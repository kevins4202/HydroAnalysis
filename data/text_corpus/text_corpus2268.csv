11340,intensive tillage it in potato crops is considered as one of the main non point sources nps of local water eutrophication in the fuquene lake of colombia therefore the local government has invested in several programs aiming at the adoption of principles of conservation tillage ct which would allow for developing and applying the agricultural best management practices bmps the complexity of hydrological and geological heterogeneity makes the degree of benefit that ct has in different locations uncertain in this study the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to assess the impacts of changing it for ct on nitrogen n and phosphorus p losses in surface water runoff from the potato crop in the fuquene watershed this is done at field and watershed levels a two year study quantified the changes in surface water runoff pollutants for three potato crop cycles under the traditional it practice and ct practice which included reducing tillage green manure and permanent soil cover at twelve runoff plots installed in the fuquene watershed quintero and comerford 2013 this information was used to build calibrate and validate the swat model the results suggest that ct for the fuquene watershed can be reduced up to 26 of the sediment yield and 11 of the surface runoff compared with it which means an overall reduction of load the main ct effect on nutrient losses in runoff is an increase in the total n and p 2 to 18 respectively compared to it however the results at watershed level showed different patterns from those obtained at field level despite the model uncertainties the results show a possibility of using hydrological models to assess the effectiveness of various field management practices in agriculture keywords hydrological model best management practice conservation tillage water quality andes swat model 1 introduction the decline in the water quality in the fuquene watershed colombia is a serious environmental problem especially in lake fuquene where an accelerated eutrophication process has been observed japanese international cooperation agency jica 2000 nitrogen and phosphorus runoffs from potato crop fertilizer operations are estimated to be causing the increase of nutrients in the lake which has in turn has increased the presence of algae bloom rubiano et al 2006b as a result the biodiversity in the lake is threatened as well that the drinking water for the local communities due to the leakage of toxic chemical in the treating process hanifzadeh et al 2017 and also water for agriculture fisheries and particularly for livestock quintero and otero 2006 rubiano et al 2006b therefore the environmental authorities are aiming to address this problem due to the importance of this water source for the communities agriculture and livestock rubiano et al 2006a intensive tillage it is the conventional management practice used by potato farmers in the fuquene watershed this practice is characterized by a lack of plant coverage and low levels of crop residue in the potato cycle because of this the soil is vulnerable to erosion processes and nutrient losses in the runoff zhang et al 2014 carter et al 2009 therefore research nowadays focuses on agricultural bmps which endeavor to use nutrients efficiently conserve the soil structure and reduce runoff quintero and comerford 2013 logan 1993 in this context agricultural bmps that focus on non tillage and reduced tillage are increasingly being adopted by farmers because they have the potential to reduce water pollution and to develop environmentally friendly agricultural systems which at the same time will offer better income to local farmers liu et al 2013 sedano et al 2013 panagopoulos et al 2011 soane 1990 studies indicated that the bmps in growing potato crops could reduce the loss of nutrients in surface without any negative effect on the potato yield and quality although there may be some influence on the potato maturation and harvest date carter and sanderson 2001 a study done in 14 potato field trials at various locations across idaho oregon over a time period of four years demonstrated that potato farmers following bmps received a similar yield with less financial investment than when following a maximum yield approach hopkins et al 2007 also zebarth and rosen 2007 clarified that even when bmps are developed to optimize tuber yield and reduce losses of nutrients it is necessary to select the appropriate rate and timing for applying nitrogen based fertilizers in this way it is possible to control potato growth according to the soil properties water management climatic conditions and terrain slope in colombia the regional environmental authority corporacion autonoma regional car in the fuquene watershed has been investing in adopting conservation tillage ct since 1999 for the potato crop system in this paper ct is defined as any practice of soil cultivation that reduces runoff and increases infiltration by leaving the previous crop residues on the field derpsch 2003 this also increases the soil organic matter near the soil surface improving the soil structure and biological properties in the potato crop carter et al 2009 experience has shown that ct provides potential benefits for organic matter increase soil hydraulic properties and that soil protection may be increased by the impact of rainfall carter and sanderson 2001 nevertheless the management effects of some biological properties are not measurable in the short term i e less than 5 years carter 1992 the international center for tropical agriculture ciat has been researching the impact on nutrient and soil losses in this crop since 2010 due to the implementation of ct practices in fuquene watershed experimental runoff plots were installed and the it and ct practices applied the specific ct practices adopted in the pilot project included reduced tillage green manure and a permanent soil cover crop prior to potato sowing sediment yield and loss of nitrogen n as nh4 and no3 as well as phosphorus p as po4 3 in runoff were measured the results helped to understand the effect of ct at field level for example quintero and comerford 2013 investigated the effect of ct in the potato crop system in the fuquene watershed in order to assess the contribution of ct in potato based rotations with respect to the aggregated soil organic carbon in the disturbed organic matter the results indicated that reduced tillage in potato based crop rotations increased the soil carbon concentration and average c content in the whole profile by 50 and 33 respectively as compared to conventional farming practices thus ct helps to bring these soils back to their original characteristics high organic matter soils quintero and comerford 2013 several studies report the effects of ct on pollutant losses by applying hydrological modeling tools many of these studies describe the accuracy of pollutant prediction obtained for each case study however the results are found to vary significantly and provide important insights only for particular agricultural watersheds park et al 2014 amon armah et al 2013 liu et al 2013 bosch et al 2013 betrie et al 2011 lam et al 2011 despite the increased use of modeling tools to assess the impact of ct as an agricultural bmp on the pollutant losses there are still knowledge gaps in this topic one of the most common issues identified to date is how to evaluate the effectiveness of bmps at controlling nonpoint source pollution in order to obtain the necessary information that would help decision makers to develop environmental regulations and manage the agricultural sector therefore the objective of this research is to assess the impact of ct on sediments nitrogen n and phosphorus p losses in runoff for potatoes at field and watershed levels by applying the soil water assessment tool swat this paper will contribute by answering the questions how do the management practices in a potato based mixed crop system influencing the runoff and soil nutrients n and p losses at the field and watershed levels and what would be the effect of applying ct extrapolation in current potato systems throughout all the watershed 2 material and methods parameters related to the crop database soil and agricultural management practices were set in the swat model according to the local crop systems a calibration process was carried out by combining the data regarding the impact of management practices on soil and nutrient losses and runoff measured in the field and streamflow data from gauging stations usually the calibration of the hydrological model calibration process is considered a challenge to be carry out in the colombia watersheds where the complexity of shifting cultivation intensive traditional agriculture diverse crops and management practices in a landscape and weather seasonality are predominant also ct management practices for the potato crop were extrapolated to be able to assess the whole basin additionally the it and ct effectiveness at field and watershed level were assessed in order to provide guidelines for the decision makers and stakeholders who aim to use these agricultural management practices for the potato crop 2 1 fuquene watershed case study this study was conducted on the fuquene lake watershed located in the northern part of bogota city colombia 5 28 00 n 73 45 00 w the watershed has an area of approximately 784 km2 the study area is characterized by large rocky outcrops and mixed topography flat areas semi flat and streams which varies between 2520 and 3 786 m above sea level m a s l the annual mean precipitation is 777 9 mm and the annual temperatures are between 12 c and 18 c without great variation throughout the year the relative humidity ranges between 70 and 80 ideam 2004 the water from the lake is used and distributed by the municipal water supply companies for human consumption in settlements located downstream of the lake the water is supplied to more than 500 000 inhabitants of the region igac 2000 fig 1 presents the study area the development of agricultural activities in this watershed has become the main economic driver for its inhabitants due to the climate and soils of this watershed monocultures are predominant the potato crop is considered as the most important crop in the watershed it is worth mentioning that the potato crop has been included in the food and nutrition national plan pan as one of the main crops for the daily diet of millions of consumers especially in low income sectors car 2006 the potato cultivated area in the fuquene watershed is around 16 933 ha with an annual production of 280 000 tons although the research uses the fuquene basin in colombia as the main case study the goal is to develop general methodologies that are applicable to similar watersheds 2 2 hydrological and water quality model the watershed model used in this study was the soil and water assessment tool swat developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars arnold et al 1998 the model is a continuous time semi distributed process based river watershed scale model designed to simulate the long term effects of water management decisions on the water quality and hydrology response neitsch et al 2011 the model is built on a daily time step at sub basin and watershed scales the use of sub basins in a simulation is particularly helpful when different areas of the watersheds are dominated by land uses or soils which are differ in their properties that may impact the hydrology these are further subdivided into a series of hydrological response units hru which are common land areas within the sub basin that are composed of unique land cover soil and agricultural management practices arnold et al 2012 the hydrological cycle simulated is based on the water balance equation which includes daily precipitation runoff evapotranspiration percolation and returns ﬂow components gassman et al 2007 spatial information such as the soil type and characteristics land use climate and topography are necessary inputs the input data required for this study were compiled from different sources these include the agustin codazzi geographic institute igac the institute of hydrology meteorology and environmental studies ideam the regional environmental authority of cundinamarca car and the public service companies the resolution scale and sources are shown in table 1 the weather input data from 46 stations located in the basin were obtained from public and private institutions and provided by car fig 1 the historic recorded daily data included relative humidity precipitation temperature maximum minimum and average solar radiation and wind speed monthly flow measurements at the boyera el pino puente balsa and puente colorado stations were used to represent the flow in different locations of the watershed the puente colorado station is located near the end of the basin and represents the outlet for the entire watershed just before the main river reaches the lake fig 1 the puente balsa station has three months of empty records in 2008 and one month in the year 2013 likewise the puente colorado station did not record values for the years of 2006 2008 and 2009 therefore these dates will not be used for the calculation of errors in the calibration and validation processes for this study the swat model was built on a daily time step for the period 2006 2013 the watershed was delineated into 30 subbasins fig 1 in the generation of hrus the slope classes were always set out in five ranges 0 5 5 15 15 25 25 45 and 45 the potential evapotranspiration pet was simulated using the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 and the actual evapotranspiration aet was calculated based on the methodology developed by ritchie 1972 in order to predict the surface runoff the natural resources conservation service curve number cn method usda scs 1972 was used cn values were determined based on a previous study where the colombian land cover map categories were associated with swat land cover codes ideam et al 2008 2 3 agricultural management practices agricultural management practices are inputs to the model by modifying the management files the representation of the traditional and conservation potato agricultural management practices was simulated as scenarios it in the current situation corresponds to the baseline scenario and the ct practice was considered to be scenario 1 seven hrus were selected because these correspond spatially with the plots installed in the field these are characterized by being located in the subbasin 12 with mean slope 15 45 and soil units mmve3 and mmvg3 which are inceptisol soil types classified by igac as typic haplustepts igac 2000 based on previous results from the experimental runoff plots installed in 2011 by ciat in the municipality of ubate located in the watershed the parameter values related to management practices were defined quintero and comerford 2013 quintero 2014 fig 1 the pilot fuquene project established twelve experimental runoff plots each with an area of 2500 m2 for assessing two potato based systems conventional agriculture with intensive tillage it and conservation agriculture with oat cover crop residues green manure gm permanent cover and conservation tillage ct a total of three crop cycles were planted in september 2011 march 2012 and october 2012 the conventional agriculture with it is traditionally a rotation between potato solanum tuberosum and pasture lolium perenne with grazing quintero 2014 the it operation is carried out by conventional plowing followed by rotovator passes to invert the soil fig 2 on the other hand the ct adopted in the pilot fuquene project included different management practices such as reduced tillage green manure and permanent soil cover the ct rotation oats potato oats potato pasture involved potatoes with an oat cover crop used as green manure prior to potato sowing and pastures at the end of the rotation cycle quintero 2014 fig 3 the management practices parameter values obtained from the runoff plots are shown in table 2 the physico chemical characteristics of the soil measured in the field plots were defined in the soil database for the hrus which correspond to the location of the runoff plots table 3 2 4 model calibration traditional statistical indicators measuring the proximity

technique green and van griensven 2008 morris 1991 was used to determine the sensitive parameters for streamflow the results obtained were used for flow calibration manual monthly calibration and validation were conducted using the data from the four stream gauging stations boyera el pino puente balsa and puente colorado compared with the outflows of subbasins 12 7 and 2 respectively fig 1 all these comparisons were based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse eq 1 the index of agreement d the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae given by eqs 2 4 were used for each gauging station as a reference table 4 provides an overview of the parameters modified in the model calibration and their final calibration values the second step of the calibration process was for losses of sediments and nutrients the model was calibrated manually using the monthly data from september 2011 to march 2013 for sediments surface runoff and concentration of soluble p and no3 in the runoff the mean absolute error mae was used to evaluate the model performance for total accumulated sediment yield and nutrient losses collected from each runoff plot during the mentioned period validation was conducted at field level with the results obtained in the hrus where it and ct practices were applied 3 results and discussion 3 1 streamflow calibration sensitivity analysis was performed for streamflow to determine the most influential parameters on the model output table 4 presents the eleven most sensitive parameters related to streamflow from the 20 evaluated the parameters were ranked according to the p value significance of the sensitivity from the highest to the lowest where the highest are the most sensitive parameters abbaspour et al 2015 in general revapmn gw threshold water depth in the shallow aquifer for return flow by capillary and soil evaporation process gwqmn gw threshold water depth in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur and sol k sol saturated hydraulic conductivity into the soil were the most sensitive the sensitivity analysis results were included in the streamflow model calibration table 5 presents the parameters that were adjusted in order to improve the efficiency of the model in the studied watershed for predicting the streamflow which correspond mainly to runoff and groundwater flow processes the range of the simulation period was divided into two without including the first year the first year was excluded because this time is the warm modeling period the streamflow calibration process was performed for the first period 2006 2010 and the second period 2011 2013 was used for the validation process the calibration and validation results are summarized in table 6 according to guidelines developed by moriasi et al 2007 the monthly streamflow calibration values at the four gauging stations were considered good in the calibration period nse values greater than 0 65 and index of agreement d values were close to 1 with the exception of the puente balsa station nse 0 5 the validation model predicted monthly flows at the four stations with nse 0 54 0 32 0 58 and 0 61 respectively highlighting that values obtained at the el pino station were considered unsatisfactory in the validation period nse 0 32 fig 4 shows the hydrographs for the calibration and validation results the two periods separated by a red line for each streamflow gauging station overall the monthly streamflow predictions were considered acceptable for this project the baseflow is generally well represented by the model when compared to the observations however the peaks for certain times of the simulated period were slightly overpredicted this is expected considering that the watershed is under intensive agriculture and the agricultural water used in the model was insufficient since only the potato crop management was considered additionally the calibration and validation were affected by the lack of information available on the el hato reservoir located upstream and the dams constructed for irrigation similar findings have shown the overprediction of peak flows arnold et al 2012 harmel et al 2014 daggupati et al 2015 francesconi et al 2016 which confirms that there is greater uncertainty in the calibration process particularly for scenarios and case studies in which the information is not available 3 2 water quality calibration on the other hand calibration of nutrient losses in the runoff and sediments was performed for the available experimental period september 2011 march 2013 on the runoff plots related with the hrus selected table 5 presents the parameters that were adjusted in order to improve the efficiency of the model in the studied watershed for the prediction of sediments and nutrients in general the calibration of the water quality for the it management practices baseline was done by decreasing the sediment yield increasing the content of no3 and decreasing soluble and organic p yields some important parameters are the cn2 defined for potato which in the model database was increased by 10 and the usle p ratio of soil loss with a specific support practice which was changed from 1 to 0 5 in order to reduce the sediment yield in the case of the nutrients in the soil layer the initial concentrations of no3 soluble p organic n and p sol no3 sol labp sol orgn and sol orgp were defined according to the measurement obtained in the runoff plots the measured and simulated total accumulated values were compared for i the surface runoff ii no3 iii the soluble p and iv sediment losses at field level hru analyzed the calibration for sediments and nutrients was considered to be acceptable moriasi et al 2007 the results table 7 showed that the highest absolute errors were calculated for surface runoff with values of 1 5 and 2 3 l m2 for the it and ct scenarios respectively however the absolute error table 7 for the other variables was less than zero for each measurement unit despite the errors reported a similar trend was observed for the it and ct values simulated when compared with the field observations runoff plots measurements for instance it can be observed that the total runoff and soil losses are reduced in the ct scenario while the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the runoff are higher when compared to the intensive tillage it however the calibration can be further improved when continuous records of water quality parameters are available also several calibration techniques have been developed for a physically based model like swat smarzyńska and miatkowski 2016 me et al 2015 akhavan et al 2010 harmel et al 2014 arnold et al 2012 and these could be suitable depending on the final goal of the modeling 3 3 the effectiveness of ct bmp at field level the effectiveness of ct was first evaluated at field level the period from september 2011 to february 2012 was selected for the assessment of the ct effect if compared to the baseline it results obtained this period was selected because it corresponds with the potato planting phase in both practices in addition ct spatial extrapolation was done for the whole potato crop area in order to define the impact on the water quality if bmps were applied by all farmers fig 1 table 8 shows the results of the main effects of it and ct on the average monthly runoff sediment and nutrients in the runoff at field vs watershed level the results for the ct practice showed a reduction of the sediment yield by 46 and the surface runoff by 27 at field level table 8 the simulated sediment loads indicated a tendency to decrease when the surface runoff decreased and the same tendency was found for soil loss but not as high as for the sediment loads fig 5 furthermore the soil loss reduction was almost twice the reduction of runoff during the rainy season it is noteworthy that the percentage of runoff reduction 27 is similar to the increase in infiltration obtained for ct which varies from 429 mm h2o to 553 mm h2o representing a 29 increase therefore when the runoff is minimum and infiltration is maximum there is a high possibility of water moving through the root zone stewart and lal 1994 our study indicates that the soil water content increase approximately 3 is in accordance with previous studies carried out in the same watershed quintero 2009 quintero and comerford 2013 quintero 2014 the trend of high infiltration as a consequence of ct practices is reported by other studies deubel et al 2011 ram et al 2018 villamil and nafziger 2015 however it is stated that such results vary widely depending on the soil type crop system and management additionally the mass balances of nitrogen and phosphorus were analyzed in order to understand the differences between the effects of ct and it practices on the nutrients losses the mass balances showed that the total losses of n and p in the runoff increased by 17 and 29 respectively the total n and total p yields in the runoff at field level are shown in fig 6 the results at field level agree completely with the results from the data measured in the runoff plots reported by ciat quintero et al 2013 quintero 2014 the main reason for the total n and p increments is related to the increase of the organic n within a range of 50 and the increase of soluble p of 38 table 8 this might be attributed to the effect of the increase of the residual cover crop oat as a green manure in the potato pasture rotation in the ct scenario the average concentration of nitrate n in the runoff increased by 20 table 8 in the ct practice furthermore this result was more evident in specific events the transformation of fresh organic n to mineral n suggests an increase of up to 162 kg n ha in the ct practice compared with 47 kg n ha in the it practice mineralization of active nitrogen increases up to 248 in the ct compared to it the mineralization of residual nitrogen from fresh residual plants to nitrate is about 80 while active organic nitrogen is 20 this means that mineralization generates a net gain in the nitrate due to oxidation of the n compounds allowing nutrients to be released hart et al 1994 the results for no3 leachate from the soil profile suggest that there is an increase of 15 however even though there is a high no3 n content in the soil the model shows that it leaches which prevents its accumulation in the soil profile consequently there is a decrease by 10 of nitrogen uptake in the plants despite the increase of the bulk density of the first soil layer table 3 and the decrease of the amount of surface runoff the soluble phosphorus increased in the ct scenario table 8 the main reason for the soluble p increment may be that the amount of phosphorus in solution in the top 10 mm of soil increased by 26 88 kg p ha compared to 8 59 kg p ha for the it scenario the results suggested that the increase of net p in solution can be attributed mainly to the mineralization of phosphorus from the fresh residue pool and from the active organic pool to the labile pool p in solution which increased by up to 178 in the ct compared to it deubel et al 2011 reported an increase of soluble p by 24 under conservation tillage in long term research along with a trend of high p concentrations in deeper soil layers in contrast the implementation of ct can reduce by approximately 33 the organic phosphorus transported with the sediments into the reach table 8 the transformation of phosphorus between the mineral pool p in solution and the active mineral pool p absorbed to the surface of soil particles decreased by 69 85 in the ct scenario additionally the decrease of the sediments yield metric tons for the ct scenario table 8 has a direct influence on the phosphorus load transported with sediments to the main channel in the surface runoff neitsch et al 2011 equally important despite the increased availability of the total p and especially soluble p in this research the uptake of p removed from the soil by plants was almost the same or even tended to be less for the ct scenario 38 63 and 36 86 kg p ha for the it and ct scenarios respectively 3 4 the effectiveness of ct bmp at the watershed level the extrapolation of the ct management practice was performed for the entire potato crop cultivated in the watershed under different biophysical conditions hrus from those evaluated at the field level the results suggest that ct at the watershed level reduces the surface runoff and sediment yield by 11 and 26 respectively the reduction obtained for the two parameters represents approximately half of the reduction obtained at the field level furthermore the greatest reduction in ct compared with it occurred during the rainy season which is when farmers normally perform fertilization tasks in order to take advantage of the wet soil conditions surface runoff loss could be influenced by the tillage type and the rotation system e g when incorporating green manure however the scs runoff curve numbers cn2 defined per soil type land use and management practices in the model inputs were not affected directly by the ct operation therefore the surface runoff increments cannot be attributed mainly to the ct scenario maharjan et al 2018 this is mainly because the precipitation slope and soil moisture vary for the other potato crop areas hrus along the watershed in addition to which the tillage practices affect the sediment yields in the model the pusle support practice factor usle p defined in the modified universal soil loss equation williams 1995 is the only parameter related to ct practices that affects the sediment yields however to verify the consistency of this impact it is necessary to consider that the swat model is also directly affected by the surface runoff volume topographic factors and soil erodibility factors defined in the soil properties total nitrogen increased by 2 in the ct scenario at watershed level table 8 the concentration of nitrate n was significantly higher in ct compared to it with an increase of 17 table 8 the increment in no3 was directly affected by the nitrification process which oxidized the ammonia or ammonium coming from the inorganic fertilizer applied 0 26 and 4 42 kg n ha in the it and ct scenarios respectively furthermore no significant differences were shown for organic n table 8 this form of nitrogen is associated with the sediment loading and consequently organic n decreases when the sediment loads are reduced the amount of organic n transported to the main channel in surface runoff calculated by the model can be adjusted using the nitrogen enrichment ratio erorgn parameter neitsch et al 2011 in our study the default value of the model was used which is calculated by a logarithmic equation related to sediment concentration developed by menzel 1980 therefore future studies are required to calibrate this parameter for the different types of soils in the watershed and also to be able to calibrate the sediment loads for hrus that are different from those used in the analysis at the field level in contrast total phosphorus decreased by 18 in the ct scenario table 8 this effect is mainly due to the 38 decrease of soluble p in the surface runoff of the ct scenario in comparison to the it scenario table 8 when each component of the phosphorus mass balance was analyzed it was interesting to note that the amount of phosphorus between the labile mineral pool p in solution and the active mineral pool p sorbed to the surface of soil particles was 4 97 kg p ha in the ct compared to 3 87 kg p ha in the it scenario a negative value in the model denotes a net gain in soluble p due to the increase in the labile pool from the active pool neitsch et al 2011 however the amount of soluble p transported in surface runoff also depends on the bulk density of the first soil layer and the phosphorus soil partitioning coefficient phoskd which is the ratio of the soluble p concentration in the surface soil to the soluble p concentration in surface runoff neitsch et al 2011 for instance even though the phoskd parameter was calibrated table 5 and the bulk density was measured table 3 at field level the spatial transfer of the ct to a different type of soil affects directly the value calculated for the soluble p deubel et al 2011 at the watershed level furthermore the principal effect of the ct on organic p was a decrease of 8 compared to the it scenario table 8 unlike the organic n the value obtained for the organic p showed a direct correlation with the sediment loading loss nevertheless to verify the consistency of this impact over the watershed the phosphorus enrichment ratio parameter erorggp calculated as a default by the model needs to be adjusted this study indicates that the use of an integrated watershed modeling to assess the impact of ct on nutrient properties requires further spatial calibration to improve the model accuracy farm scale soil physical and chemical data under ct management is necessary to parameterize the inputs for example the soil bulk density in swat is an input defined manually by the user and the temporal variation of the bulk density of the soil layer is not affected by the tillage operation arnold et al 2012 maharjan et al 2018 although the impact of ct on the soil properties has been studied widely for the management of different crops over short and long term durations carter and sanderson 2001 deubel et al 2011 ram et al 2018 quintero and comerford 2013 villamil and nafziger 2015 wang et al 2015 many gaps still need to be addressed such as the simulation approach to soil tillage and especially to the spatial and temporal changes of the soil s physical and microbial activity however we realize that some processes are difficult to characterize accurately in large watersheds due to the insufficient data or understanding of the processes themselves furthermore depending on the research scope the modeling approach may or may not be a viable alternative 4 conclusions and outlook the objective of the study was to assess the impacts of ct on the runoff quality as well as soil nitrogen n and phosphorus p losses in a potato crop in the fuquene watershed colombia by applying the swat model the model performance was calibrated and validated at field level for site specific conditions and then ct practices were extrapolated to the whole potato crop area in the basin despite the modeling uncertainties the results provide evidence that the model based approach presented is useful and effective and it can be used as a strong basis to facilitate the development of land use plans by local decision makers to reduce water pollution in the fuquene watershed the results suggest that ct at the watershed level reduces the sediment yield by 26 and surface runoff by 11 if compared with it which means an overall reduction of load the greatest reduction of ct occurs especially in the rainy season the main ct effect on nutrient losses in the runoff is that an increase occurs in the total n and p 2 to 18 respectively compared to the baseline in addition the ct simulation results suggest that the concentration of n no3 in the surface runoff could be increased by 17 this might be attributed to the nitrification process which oxidized the ammonia or ammonium coming from the inorganic fertilizer applied however the results at watershed level showed different patterns from those obtained at field level in fact the major limitation identified in this study arises from the process of the ct extrapolation practice for all the potato crop areas within the watershed because the calibration model was made for a very small area field level and the initial and calibrated parameter values are the same for other soil types and average slopes this paper provides important information about the effects of potato crop agricultural management practices on the runoff water quality in an andean watershed it thereby provides a potential model for future andean watershed studies providing guidelines to decision makers and stakeholders who are aiming to use these agricultural management practices for the potato crop given the loss of nutrients obtained for the ct practice the authors suggest that it may be possible to reduce the amounts applied considering the contribution of the green manure nutrients involved adjusting to the amounts of fertilizer could help increase the competitiveness of conservation agriculture in potato crops compared to conventional management practices however it is necessary to assess reduced dose trials and their impacts on productivity erosion and runoff in addition more detailed spatio temporal models and the application of optimization techniques would be a very useful approach to identify and allocate ct bmp options with the aim of reducing the reliance of agricultural practices on water pollution moreover using this type of models and techniques it could be possible to include several crops in the same watershed consider climate change scenarios and define suitable parameters for the different areas in the watershed overall future research that contemplates these points will help mitigate the uncertainty in assessing the implementation of bmps at the watershed level 
11340,intensive tillage it in potato crops is considered as one of the main non point sources nps of local water eutrophication in the fuquene lake of colombia therefore the local government has invested in several programs aiming at the adoption of principles of conservation tillage ct which would allow for developing and applying the agricultural best management practices bmps the complexity of hydrological and geological heterogeneity makes the degree of benefit that ct has in different locations uncertain in this study the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to assess the impacts of changing it for ct on nitrogen n and phosphorus p losses in surface water runoff from the potato crop in the fuquene watershed this is done at field and watershed levels a two year study quantified the changes in surface water runoff pollutants for three potato crop cycles under the traditional it practice and ct practice which included reducing tillage green manure and permanent soil cover at twelve runoff plots installed in the fuquene watershed quintero and comerford 2013 this information was used to build calibrate and validate the swat model the results suggest that ct for the fuquene watershed can be reduced up to 26 of the sediment yield and 11 of the surface runoff compared with it which means an overall reduction of load the main ct effect on nutrient losses in runoff is an increase in the total n and p 2 to 18 respectively compared to it however the results at watershed level showed different patterns from those obtained at field level despite the model uncertainties the results show a possibility of using hydrological models to assess the effectiveness of various field management practices in agriculture keywords hydrological model best management practice conservation tillage water quality andes swat model 1 introduction the decline in the water quality in the fuquene watershed colombia is a serious environmental problem especially in lake fuquene where an accelerated eutrophication process has been observed japanese international cooperation agency jica 2000 nitrogen and phosphorus runoffs from potato crop fertilizer operations are estimated to be causing the increase of nutrients in the lake which has in turn has increased the presence of algae bloom rubiano et al 2006b as a result the biodiversity in the lake is threatened as well that the drinking water for the local communities due to the leakage of toxic chemical in the treating process hanifzadeh et al 2017 and also water for agriculture fisheries and particularly for livestock quintero and otero 2006 rubiano et al 2006b therefore the environmental authorities are aiming to address this problem due to the importance of this water source for the communities agriculture and livestock rubiano et al 2006a intensive tillage it is the conventional management practice used by potato farmers in the fuquene watershed this practice is characterized by a lack of plant coverage and low levels of crop residue in the potato cycle because of this the soil is vulnerable to erosion processes and nutrient losses in the runoff zhang et al 2014 carter et al 2009 therefore research nowadays focuses on agricultural bmps which endeavor to use nutrients efficiently conserve the soil structure and reduce runoff quintero and comerford 2013 logan 1993 in this context agricultural bmps that focus on non tillage and reduced tillage are increasingly being adopted by farmers because they have the potential to reduce water pollution and to develop environmentally friendly agricultural systems which at the same time will offer better income to local farmers liu et al 2013 sedano et al 2013 panagopoulos et al 2011 soane 1990 studies indicated that the bmps in growing potato crops could reduce the loss of nutrients in surface without any negative effect on the potato yield and quality although there may be some influence on the potato maturation and harvest date carter and sanderson 2001 a study done in 14 potato field trials at various locations across idaho oregon over a time period of four years demonstrated that potato farmers following bmps received a similar yield with less financial investment than when following a maximum yield approach hopkins et al 2007 also zebarth and rosen 2007 clarified that even when bmps are developed to optimize tuber yield and reduce losses of nutrients it is necessary to select the appropriate rate and timing for applying nitrogen based fertilizers in this way it is possible to control potato growth according to the soil properties water management climatic conditions and terrain slope in colombia the regional environmental authority corporacion autonoma regional car in the fuquene watershed has been investing in adopting conservation tillage ct since 1999 for the potato crop system in this paper ct is defined as any practice of soil cultivation that reduces runoff and increases infiltration by leaving the previous crop residues on the field derpsch 2003 this also increases the soil organic matter near the soil surface improving the soil structure and biological properties in the potato crop carter et al 2009 experience has shown that ct provides potential benefits for organic matter increase soil hydraulic properties and that soil protection may be increased by the impact of rainfall carter and sanderson 2001 nevertheless the management effects of some biological properties are not measurable in the short term i e less than 5 years carter 1992 the international center for tropical agriculture ciat has been researching the impact on nutrient and soil losses in this crop since 2010 due to the implementation of ct practices in fuquene watershed experimental runoff plots were installed and the it and ct practices applied the specific ct practices adopted in the pilot project included reduced tillage green manure and a permanent soil cover crop prior to potato sowing sediment yield and loss of nitrogen n as nh4 and no3 as well as phosphorus p as po4 3 in runoff were measured the results helped to understand the effect of ct at field level for example quintero and comerford 2013 investigated the effect of ct in the potato crop system in the fuquene watershed in order to assess the contribution of ct in potato based rotations with respect to the aggregated soil organic carbon in the disturbed organic matter the results indicated that reduced tillage in potato based crop rotations increased the soil carbon concentration and average c content in the whole profile by 50 and 33 respectively as compared to conventional farming practices thus ct helps to bring these soils back to their original characteristics high organic matter soils quintero and comerford 2013 several studies report the effects of ct on pollutant losses by applying hydrological modeling tools many of these studies describe the accuracy of pollutant prediction obtained for each case study however the results are found to vary significantly and provide important insights only for particular agricultural watersheds park et al 2014 amon armah et al 2013 liu et al 2013 bosch et al 2013 betrie et al 2011 lam et al 2011 despite the increased use of modeling tools to assess the impact of ct as an agricultural bmp on the pollutant losses there are still knowledge gaps in this topic one of the most common issues identified to date is how to evaluate the effectiveness of bmps at controlling nonpoint source pollution in order to obtain the necessary information that would help decision makers to develop environmental regulations and manage the agricultural sector therefore the objective of this research is to assess the impact of ct on sediments nitrogen n and phosphorus p losses in runoff for potatoes at field and watershed levels by applying the soil water assessment tool swat this paper will contribute by answering the questions how do the management practices in a potato based mixed crop system influencing the runoff and soil nutrients n and p losses at the field and watershed levels and what would be the effect of applying ct extrapolation in current potato systems throughout all the watershed 2 material and methods parameters related to the crop database soil and agricultural management practices were set in the swat model according to the local crop systems a calibration process was carried out by combining the data regarding the impact of management practices on soil and nutrient losses and runoff measured in the field and streamflow data from gauging stations usually the calibration of the hydrological model calibration process is considered a challenge to be carry out in the colombia watersheds where the complexity of shifting cultivation intensive traditional agriculture diverse crops and management practices in a landscape and weather seasonality are predominant also ct management practices for the potato crop were extrapolated to be able to assess the whole basin additionally the it and ct effectiveness at field and watershed level were assessed in order to provide guidelines for the decision makers and stakeholders who aim to use these agricultural management practices for the potato crop 2 1 fuquene watershed case study this study was conducted on the fuquene lake watershed located in the northern part of bogota city colombia 5 28 00 n 73 45 00 w the watershed has an area of approximately 784 km2 the study area is characterized by large rocky outcrops and mixed topography flat areas semi flat and streams which varies between 2520 and 3 786 m above sea level m a s l the annual mean precipitation is 777 9 mm and the annual temperatures are between 12 c and 18 c without great variation throughout the year the relative humidity ranges between 70 and 80 ideam 2004 the water from the lake is used and distributed by the municipal water supply companies for human consumption in settlements located downstream of the lake the water is supplied to more than 500 000 inhabitants of the region igac 2000 fig 1 presents the study area the development of agricultural activities in this watershed has become the main economic driver for its inhabitants due to the climate and soils of this watershed monocultures are predominant the potato crop is considered as the most important crop in the watershed it is worth mentioning that the potato crop has been included in the food and nutrition national plan pan as one of the main crops for the daily diet of millions of consumers especially in low income sectors car 2006 the potato cultivated area in the fuquene watershed is around 16 933 ha with an annual production of 280 000 tons although the research uses the fuquene basin in colombia as the main case study the goal is to develop general methodologies that are applicable to similar watersheds 2 2 hydrological and water quality model the watershed model used in this study was the soil and water assessment tool swat developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars arnold et al 1998 the model is a continuous time semi distributed process based river watershed scale model designed to simulate the long term effects of water management decisions on the water quality and hydrology response neitsch et al 2011 the model is built on a daily time step at sub basin and watershed scales the use of sub basins in a simulation is particularly helpful when different areas of the watersheds are dominated by land uses or soils which are differ in their properties that may impact the hydrology these are further subdivided into a series of hydrological response units hru which are common land areas within the sub basin that are composed of unique land cover soil and agricultural management practices arnold et al 2012 the hydrological cycle simulated is based on the water balance equation which includes daily precipitation runoff evapotranspiration percolation and returns ﬂow components gassman et al 2007 spatial information such as the soil type and characteristics land use climate and topography are necessary inputs the input data required for this study were compiled from different sources these include the agustin codazzi geographic institute igac the institute of hydrology meteorology and environmental studies ideam the regional environmental authority of cundinamarca car and the public service companies the resolution scale and sources are shown in table 1 the weather input data from 46 stations located in the basin were obtained from public and private institutions and provided by car fig 1 the historic recorded daily data included relative humidity precipitation temperature maximum minimum and average solar radiation and wind speed monthly flow measurements at the boyera el pino puente balsa and puente colorado stations were used to represent the flow in different locations of the watershed the puente colorado station is located near the end of the basin and represents the outlet for the entire watershed just before the main river reaches the lake fig 1 the puente balsa station has three months of empty records in 2008 and one month in the year 2013 likewise the puente colorado station did not record values for the years of 2006 2008 and 2009 therefore these dates will not be used for the calculation of errors in the calibration and validation processes for this study the swat model was built on a daily time step for the period 2006 2013 the watershed was delineated into 30 subbasins fig 1 in the generation of hrus the slope classes were always set out in five ranges 0 5 5 15 15 25 25 45 and 45 the potential evapotranspiration pet was simulated using the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 and the actual evapotranspiration aet was calculated based on the methodology developed by ritchie 1972 in order to predict the surface runoff the natural resources conservation service curve number cn method usda scs 1972 was used cn values were determined based on a previous study where the colombian land cover map categories were associated with swat land cover codes ideam et al 2008 2 3 agricultural management practices agricultural management practices are inputs to the model by modifying the management files the representation of the traditional and conservation potato agricultural management practices was simulated as scenarios it in the current situation corresponds to the baseline scenario and the ct practice was considered to be scenario 1 seven hrus were selected because these correspond spatially with the plots installed in the field these are characterized by being located in the subbasin 12 with mean slope 15 45 and soil units mmve3 and mmvg3 which are inceptisol soil types classified by igac as typic haplustepts igac 2000 based on previous results from the experimental runoff plots installed in 2011 by ciat in the municipality of ubate located in the watershed the parameter values related to management practices were defined quintero and comerford 2013 quintero 2014 fig 1 the pilot fuquene project established twelve experimental runoff plots each with an area of 2500 m2 for assessing two potato based systems conventional agriculture with intensive tillage it and conservation agriculture with oat cover crop residues green manure gm permanent cover and conservation tillage ct a total of three crop cycles were planted in september 2011 march 2012 and october 2012 the conventional agriculture with it is traditionally a rotation between potato solanum tuberosum and pasture lolium perenne with grazing quintero 2014 the it operation is carried out by conventional plowing followed by rotovator passes to invert the soil fig 2 on the other hand the ct adopted in the pilot fuquene project included different management practices such as reduced tillage green manure and permanent soil cover the ct rotation oats potato oats potato pasture involved potatoes with an oat cover crop used as green manure prior to potato sowing and pastures at the end of the rotation cycle quintero 2014 fig 3 the management practices parameter values obtained from the runoff plots are shown in table 2 the physico chemical characteristics of the soil measured in the field plots were defined in the soil database for the hrus which correspond to the location of the runoff plots table 3 2 4 model calibration traditional statistical indicators measuring the proximity

technique green and van griensven 2008 morris 1991 was used to determine the sensitive parameters for streamflow the results obtained were used for flow calibration manual monthly calibration and validation were conducted using the data from the four stream gauging stations boyera el pino puente balsa and puente colorado compared with the outflows of subbasins 12 7 and 2 respectively fig 1 all these comparisons were based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse eq 1 the index of agreement d the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae given by eqs 2 4 were used for each gauging station as a reference table 4 provides an overview of the parameters modified in the model calibration and their final calibration values the second step of the calibration process was for losses of sediments and nutrients the model was calibrated manually using the monthly data from september 2011 to march 2013 for sediments surface runoff and concentration of soluble p and no3 in the runoff the mean absolute error mae was used to evaluate the model performance for total accumulated sediment yield and nutrient losses collected from each runoff plot during the mentioned period validation was conducted at field level with the results obtained in the hrus where it and ct practices were applied 3 results and discussion 3 1 streamflow calibration sensitivity analysis was performed for streamflow to determine the most influential parameters on the model output table 4 presents the eleven most sensitive parameters related to streamflow from the 20 evaluated the parameters were ranked according to the p value significance of the sensitivity from the highest to the lowest where the highest are the most sensitive parameters abbaspour et al 2015 in general revapmn gw threshold water depth in the shallow aquifer for return flow by capillary and soil evaporation process gwqmn gw threshold water depth in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur and sol k sol saturated hydraulic conductivity into the soil were the most sensitive the sensitivity analysis results were included in the streamflow model calibration table 5 presents the parameters that were adjusted in order to improve the efficiency of the model in the studied watershed for predicting the streamflow which correspond mainly to runoff and groundwater flow processes the range of the simulation period was divided into two without including the first year the first year was excluded because this time is the warm modeling period the streamflow calibration process was performed for the first period 2006 2010 and the second period 2011 2013 was used for the validation process the calibration and validation results are summarized in table 6 according to guidelines developed by moriasi et al 2007 the monthly streamflow calibration values at the four gauging stations were considered good in the calibration period nse values greater than 0 65 and index of agreement d values were close to 1 with the exception of the puente balsa station nse 0 5 the validation model predicted monthly flows at the four stations with nse 0 54 0 32 0 58 and 0 61 respectively highlighting that values obtained at the el pino station were considered unsatisfactory in the validation period nse 0 32 fig 4 shows the hydrographs for the calibration and validation results the two periods separated by a red line for each streamflow gauging station overall the monthly streamflow predictions were considered acceptable for this project the baseflow is generally well represented by the model when compared to the observations however the peaks for certain times of the simulated period were slightly overpredicted this is expected considering that the watershed is under intensive agriculture and the agricultural water used in the model was insufficient since only the potato crop management was considered additionally the calibration and validation were affected by the lack of information available on the el hato reservoir located upstream and the dams constructed for irrigation similar findings have shown the overprediction of peak flows arnold et al 2012 harmel et al 2014 daggupati et al 2015 francesconi et al 2016 which confirms that there is greater uncertainty in the calibration process particularly for scenarios and case studies in which the information is not available 3 2 water quality calibration on the other hand calibration of nutrient losses in the runoff and sediments was performed for the available experimental period september 2011 march 2013 on the runoff plots related with the hrus selected table 5 presents the parameters that were adjusted in order to improve the efficiency of the model in the studied watershed for the prediction of sediments and nutrients in general the calibration of the water quality for the it management practices baseline was done by decreasing the sediment yield increasing the content of no3 and decreasing soluble and organic p yields some important parameters are the cn2 defined for potato which in the model database was increased by 10 and the usle p ratio of soil loss with a specific support practice which was changed from 1 to 0 5 in order to reduce the sediment yield in the case of the nutrients in the soil layer the initial concentrations of no3 soluble p organic n and p sol no3 sol labp sol orgn and sol orgp were defined according to the measurement obtained in the runoff plots the measured and simulated total accumulated values were compared for i the surface runoff ii no3 iii the soluble p and iv sediment losses at field level hru analyzed the calibration for sediments and nutrients was considered to be acceptable moriasi et al 2007 the results table 7 showed that the highest absolute errors were calculated for surface runoff with values of 1 5 and 2 3 l m2 for the it and ct scenarios respectively however the absolute error table 7 for the other variables was less than zero for each measurement unit despite the errors reported a similar trend was observed for the it and ct values simulated when compared with the field observations runoff plots measurements for instance it can be observed that the total runoff and soil losses are reduced in the ct scenario while the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the runoff are higher when compared to the intensive tillage it however the calibration can be further improved when continuous records of water quality parameters are available also several calibration techniques have been developed for a physically based model like swat smarzyńska and miatkowski 2016 me et al 2015 akhavan et al 2010 harmel et al 2014 arnold et al 2012 and these could be suitable depending on the final goal of the modeling 3 3 the effectiveness of ct bmp at field level the effectiveness of ct was first evaluated at field level the period from september 2011 to february 2012 was selected for the assessment of the ct effect if compared to the baseline it results obtained this period was selected because it corresponds with the potato planting phase in both practices in addition ct spatial extrapolation was done for the whole potato crop area in order to define the impact on the water quality if bmps were applied by all farmers fig 1 table 8 shows the results of the main effects of it and ct on the average monthly runoff sediment and nutrients in the runoff at field vs watershed level the results for the ct practice showed a reduction of the sediment yield by 46 and the surface runoff by 27 at field level table 8 the simulated sediment loads indicated a tendency to decrease when the surface runoff decreased and the same tendency was found for soil loss but not as high as for the sediment loads fig 5 furthermore the soil loss reduction was almost twice the reduction of runoff during the rainy season it is noteworthy that the percentage of runoff reduction 27 is similar to the increase in infiltration obtained for ct which varies from 429 mm h2o to 553 mm h2o representing a 29 increase therefore when the runoff is minimum and infiltration is maximum there is a high possibility of water moving through the root zone stewart and lal 1994 our study indicates that the soil water content increase approximately 3 is in accordance with previous studies carried out in the same watershed quintero 2009 quintero and comerford 2013 quintero 2014 the trend of high infiltration as a consequence of ct practices is reported by other studies deubel et al 2011 ram et al 2018 villamil and nafziger 2015 however it is stated that such results vary widely depending on the soil type crop system and management additionally the mass balances of nitrogen and phosphorus were analyzed in order to understand the differences between the effects of ct and it practices on the nutrients losses the mass balances showed that the total losses of n and p in the runoff increased by 17 and 29 respectively the total n and total p yields in the runoff at field level are shown in fig 6 the results at field level agree completely with the results from the data measured in the runoff plots reported by ciat quintero et al 2013 quintero 2014 the main reason for the total n and p increments is related to the increase of the organic n within a range of 50 and the increase of soluble p of 38 table 8 this might be attributed to the effect of the increase of the residual cover crop oat as a green manure in the potato pasture rotation in the ct scenario the average concentration of nitrate n in the runoff increased by 20 table 8 in the ct practice furthermore this result was more evident in specific events the transformation of fresh organic n to mineral n suggests an increase of up to 162 kg n ha in the ct practice compared with 47 kg n ha in the it practice mineralization of active nitrogen increases up to 248 in the ct compared to it the mineralization of residual nitrogen from fresh residual plants to nitrate is about 80 while active organic nitrogen is 20 this means that mineralization generates a net gain in the nitrate due to oxidation of the n compounds allowing nutrients to be released hart et al 1994 the results for no3 leachate from the soil profile suggest that there is an increase of 15 however even though there is a high no3 n content in the soil the model shows that it leaches which prevents its accumulation in the soil profile consequently there is a decrease by 10 of nitrogen uptake in the plants despite the increase of the bulk density of the first soil layer table 3 and the decrease of the amount of surface runoff the soluble phosphorus increased in the ct scenario table 8 the main reason for the soluble p increment may be that the amount of phosphorus in solution in the top 10 mm of soil increased by 26 88 kg p ha compared to 8 59 kg p ha for the it scenario the results suggested that the increase of net p in solution can be attributed mainly to the mineralization of phosphorus from the fresh residue pool and from the active organic pool to the labile pool p in solution which increased by up to 178 in the ct compared to it deubel et al 2011 reported an increase of soluble p by 24 under conservation tillage in long term research along with a trend of high p concentrations in deeper soil layers in contrast the implementation of ct can reduce by approximately 33 the organic phosphorus transported with the sediments into the reach table 8 the transformation of phosphorus between the mineral pool p in solution and the active mineral pool p absorbed to the surface of soil particles decreased by 69 85 in the ct scenario additionally the decrease of the sediments yield metric tons for the ct scenario table 8 has a direct influence on the phosphorus load transported with sediments to the main channel in the surface runoff neitsch et al 2011 equally important despite the increased availability of the total p and especially soluble p in this research the uptake of p removed from the soil by plants was almost the same or even tended to be less for the ct scenario 38 63 and 36 86 kg p ha for the it and ct scenarios respectively 3 4 the effectiveness of ct bmp at the watershed level the extrapolation of the ct management practice was performed for the entire potato crop cultivated in the watershed under different biophysical conditions hrus from those evaluated at the field level the results suggest that ct at the watershed level reduces the surface runoff and sediment yield by 11 and 26 respectively the reduction obtained for the two parameters represents approximately half of the reduction obtained at the field level furthermore the greatest reduction in ct compared with it occurred during the rainy season which is when farmers normally perform fertilization tasks in order to take advantage of the wet soil conditions surface runoff loss could be influenced by the tillage type and the rotation system e g when incorporating green manure however the scs runoff curve numbers cn2 defined per soil type land use and management practices in the model inputs were not affected directly by the ct operation therefore the surface runoff increments cannot be attributed mainly to the ct scenario maharjan et al 2018 this is mainly because the precipitation slope and soil moisture vary for the other potato crop areas hrus along the watershed in addition to which the tillage practices affect the sediment yields in the model the pusle support practice factor usle p defined in the modified universal soil loss equation williams 1995 is the only parameter related to ct practices that affects the sediment yields however to verify the consistency of this impact it is necessary to consider that the swat model is also directly affected by the surface runoff volume topographic factors and soil erodibility factors defined in the soil properties total nitrogen increased by 2 in the ct scenario at watershed level table 8 the concentration of nitrate n was significantly higher in ct compared to it with an increase of 17 table 8 the increment in no3 was directly affected by the nitrification process which oxidized the ammonia or ammonium coming from the inorganic fertilizer applied 0 26 and 4 42 kg n ha in the it and ct scenarios respectively furthermore no significant differences were shown for organic n table 8 this form of nitrogen is associated with the sediment loading and consequently organic n decreases when the sediment loads are reduced the amount of organic n transported to the main channel in surface runoff calculated by the model can be adjusted using the nitrogen enrichment ratio erorgn parameter neitsch et al 2011 in our study the default value of the model was used which is calculated by a logarithmic equation related to sediment concentration developed by menzel 1980 therefore future studies are required to calibrate this parameter for the different types of soils in the watershed and also to be able to calibrate the sediment loads for hrus that are different from those used in the analysis at the field level in contrast total phosphorus decreased by 18 in the ct scenario table 8 this effect is mainly due to the 38 decrease of soluble p in the surface runoff of the ct scenario in comparison to the it scenario table 8 when each component of the phosphorus mass balance was analyzed it was interesting to note that the amount of phosphorus between the labile mineral pool p in solution and the active mineral pool p sorbed to the surface of soil particles was 4 97 kg p ha in the ct compared to 3 87 kg p ha in the it scenario a negative value in the model denotes a net gain in soluble p due to the increase in the labile pool from the active pool neitsch et al 2011 however the amount of soluble p transported in surface runoff also depends on the bulk density of the first soil layer and the phosphorus soil partitioning coefficient phoskd which is the ratio of the soluble p concentration in the surface soil to the soluble p concentration in surface runoff neitsch et al 2011 for instance even though the phoskd parameter was calibrated table 5 and the bulk density was measured table 3 at field level the spatial transfer of the ct to a different type of soil affects directly the value calculated for the soluble p deubel et al 2011 at the watershed level furthermore the principal effect of the ct on organic p was a decrease of 8 compared to the it scenario table 8 unlike the organic n the value obtained for the organic p showed a direct correlation with the sediment loading loss nevertheless to verify the consistency of this impact over the watershed the phosphorus enrichment ratio parameter erorggp calculated as a default by the model needs to be adjusted this study indicates that the use of an integrated watershed modeling to assess the impact of ct on nutrient properties requires further spatial calibration to improve the model accuracy farm scale soil physical and chemical data under ct management is necessary to parameterize the inputs for example the soil bulk density in swat is an input defined manually by the user and the temporal variation of the bulk density of the soil layer is not affected by the tillage operation arnold et al 2012 maharjan et al 2018 although the impact of ct on the soil properties has been studied widely for the management of different crops over short and long term durations carter and sanderson 2001 deubel et al 2011 ram et al 2018 quintero and comerford 2013 villamil and nafziger 2015 wang et al 2015 many gaps still need to be addressed such as the simulation approach to soil tillage and especially to the spatial and temporal changes of the soil s physical and microbial activity however we realize that some processes are difficult to characterize accurately in large watersheds due to the insufficient data or understanding of the processes themselves furthermore depending on the research scope the modeling approach may or may not be a viable alternative 4 conclusions and outlook the objective of the study was to assess the impacts of ct on the runoff quality as well as soil nitrogen n and phosphorus p losses in a potato crop in the fuquene watershed colombia by applying the swat model the model performance was calibrated and validated at field level for site specific conditions and then ct practices were extrapolated to the whole potato crop area in the basin despite the modeling uncertainties the results provide evidence that the model based approach presented is useful and effective and it can be used as a strong basis to facilitate the development of land use plans by local decision makers to reduce water pollution in the fuquene watershed the results suggest that ct at the watershed level reduces the sediment yield by 26 and surface runoff by 11 if compared with it which means an overall reduction of load the greatest reduction of ct occurs especially in the rainy season the main ct effect on nutrient losses in the runoff is that an increase occurs in the total n and p 2 to 18 respectively compared to the baseline in addition the ct simulation results suggest that the concentration of n no3 in the surface runoff could be increased by 17 this might be attributed to the nitrification process which oxidized the ammonia or ammonium coming from the inorganic fertilizer applied however the results at watershed level showed different patterns from those obtained at field level in fact the major limitation identified in this study arises from the process of the ct extrapolation practice for all the potato crop areas within the watershed because the calibration model was made for a very small area field level and the initial and calibrated parameter values are the same for other soil types and average slopes this paper provides important information about the effects of potato crop agricultural management practices on the runoff water quality in an andean watershed it thereby provides a potential model for future andean watershed studies providing guidelines to decision makers and stakeholders who are aiming to use these agricultural management practices for the potato crop given the loss of nutrients obtained for the ct practice the authors suggest that it may be possible to reduce the amounts applied considering the contribution of the green manure nutrients involved adjusting to the amounts of fertilizer could help increase the competitiveness of conservation agriculture in potato crops compared to conventional management practices however it is necessary to assess reduced dose trials and their impacts on productivity erosion and runoff in addition more detailed spatio temporal models and the application of optimization techniques would be a very useful approach to identify and allocate ct bmp options with the aim of reducing the reliance of agricultural practices on water pollution moreover using this type of models and techniques it could be possible to include several crops in the same watershed consider climate change scenarios and define suitable parameters for the different areas in the watershed overall future research that contemplates these points will help mitigate the uncertainty in assessing the implementation of bmps at the watershed level

regulated deficit irrigation rootstocks soil water status water use efficiency yield 1 introduction according to the climate projections for the middle of this century 2040 2070 temperature aridity and water stress are expected to increase in many areas of southern europe reducing yield and growth of the vine fraga et al 2013 2016 ipcc 2014 resco 2015 guiot and cramer 2016 in addition the increase in extreme temperatures may lead to an increased risk of pests and diseases fraga et al 2013 and a decrease in quality and yield due to recurrent heat shock especially in the more continental and warmer areas from the center and south of the iberian peninsula it would be in these semiarid regions of southern europe e g se spain where viticulture would need to make the greatest efforts of adaptation with greater costs to maintain quality and productivity since they are going to experience more severe water stress and impacts of greater magnitude than other wine growing areas resco et al 2016 in these warm and more vulnerable regions it will be necessary to combine different adaptation measures especially those related to water management and availability iglesias and garrote 2015 water scarcity is one of the most important problems of agriculture in semiarid regions increased aridity and reduced rainfall predicted in the future will increase water scarcity making the availability of water for irrigation an even more limiting factor for agriculture the predicted increase in evapotranspiration and in the water needs of the vine as a result of climate change cc will make necessary the application of irrigation water to maintain the sustainability of vineyards and to prevent severe stress in many wine regions of southern spain resco et al 2016 one of the main adaptation measures for the vineyards in these areas will be the implementation of strategies techniques and technologies that save water and improve the efficiency in the use and application of irrigation water without causing a decrease in quality this future scenario with more recurrent drought phenomena and heatwaves will make it more necessary to apply deficit irrigation di techniques as an adaptation to cc in addition to face the risks associated with cc and to achieve environmentally sustainable viticulture vine growers will also have to carry out other changes and make serious adjustments to their traditional production system these include as a measure of adaptation in the medium longer term the substitution of plant material by different rootstocks varieties of vine or clones of the same variety selected for their better adaptation to and tolerance of the new climatic conditions fraga et al 2013 the monastrell variety native to the spanish levant and the most widespread variety in the south east of spain is well adapted to these rigorous and dry climates of high temperatures and recurrent drought cycles because it has evolved since ancient times in these mediterranean climates from a physiological point of view this variety possesses interesting characteristics of drought tolerance which give it a high capacity to adapt to seasonal water stress and di strategies romero et al 2010 2012 2014 in this respect we have verified that di techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation rdi and partial root zone drying irrigation pri efficiently applied and using moderate annual volumes of water maintain high yields and improve long term water use efficiency wue and berry and wine quality in monastrell wine grapes under semiarid conditions romero et al 2016a 2016b the choice of more efficient and drought tolerant rootstocks has been proposed as another measure of adaptation to cc fraga et al 2013 berdeja et al 2015 genotypic differences in the vigor of the rootstocks induce morphological and anatomical modifications and changes in the distribution of the root system which may influence the soil volume explored and the availability of water to the plant in this way the rootstock can affect the regulation of water relations alsina et al 2011 jones 2012 yield components and fruit composition berdeja et al 2014 habran et al 2016 in a warm winegrowing area of the jumilla region se spain monastrell vines grafted on an invigorating rootstock e g 1103 p classified as a rootstock with medium high drought tolerance and widely used in this area responded well to the application of different di techniques such as pri and rdi with moderate amounts of water the optimum irrigation being 140 150 mm year 1 romero et al 2016a 2016b besides previous results indicate that distinctive pri effects compared to rdi depend on the volumetric soil water content of the wet root zone romero et al 2012 and that the maintenance of a high water content in the wet root zone during drying re watering cycles is critical to improve root vine performance in long term pri wine grapes romero et al 2014 a b nevertheless we do not know if this agronomic response can be extrapolated to other soil climatic conditions and besides little is known about the interaction of monastrell with other rootstocks of differing vigor and drought tolerance and with di techniques such as pri and rdi justifying the need for further studies in other climatic conditions with different rootstocks di strategies and water volumes thus the main goal of this study was to determine if the choice of the rootstock modifies substantially the physiological and agronomic response of the monastrell variety to rdi and pri and to evaluate which of these rootstock scion combinations is best suited to the application of long term di techniques under the semiarid conditions of se spain thus five commercial rootstocks 1103 p 140ru 110r 41b and 161 49c on which were grafted mature monastrell grapevines were compared under field conditions with the same irrigation volumes and the same controlled di strategy two different irrigation techniques rdi and pri were

fertilizers 30 kg n 20 kg p 30 kg k and 16 kg mg per ha supplied through the irrigation drip system from april to august besides at the beginning of the growing season a liquid organic matter amino acid complex was applied water was applied by one pressure compensated emitter per plant 2 l h 1 with one drip irrigation line per row for the conventional drip irrigation in rdi and on a double line per row for the pri with emitters 4 l h 1 to apply the same amount of water in pri and rdi in the pri layout the two pipelines were joined on both sides of the trunk and located underneath each vine row in each pipeline in the pri treatments there were alternate zones with and without emitters to create dry and wet root zones within each vine row fig 1 in the pri treatments water was supplied to

for pri vines fig 3 and regardless of the rootstock pri vines experienced greater water stress during the veraison harvest especially at early ripening and postharvest periods than rdi vines table 4 fig 3 in addition significant interactive effects were observed for the annual averaged ψs with pri vines grafted on 1103 p and 161 49c showing lower ψs than rdi vines table 4 the years with the most severe vine water stress were 2012 and 2014 while and the stress was milder in 2013 and 2015 vines grafted on 140ru maintained significantly higher net leaf photosynthesis measured at early mid morning an during most of the growing season especially from fruit set to harvest followed by vines grafted on 110r table 4 differences in averaged an of up to 2 5 μmol m 2 s 1 were observed in some phenological periods between vines grafted on 140ru the maximum an and vines grafted on 161 49c and 1103 p which maintained the lowest values of seasonal an the year also had a significant effect on leaf photosynthesis an reaching its maximum levels in 2014 and its minimum in 2015 although in general there were no significant effects of the irrigation method on an a significant interaction between the rootstock and irrigation method was observed during the fruit set veraison period in this period pri vines grafted on 161 49c or 110r had lower averaged an values than rdi vines while pri vines grafted on 41b maintained significantly higher an values than rdi vines table 4 3 3 leaf mineral nutrition the rootstock and the year had an important effect on leaf mineral composition in general invigorating rootstocks 140ru and 1103 p enhanced significantly the leaf n p and mg 1103 p contents and decreased b compared to low vigor rootstocks 161 49c and 110r table 5 the irrigation method only had a significant effect on the leaf zn and b contents with pri vines showing significantly lower zn and higher b than rdi vines table 5 significant interactive effects of the rootstock and irrigation method were observed for n p ca mg and mn table 5 3 4 fruit growth and ripening the rgr of berries on the rootstock 140ru was significantly higher than for the rest of the rootstocks mainly during the post veraison periods table 6 conversely the rgr of 1103 p berries showed the lowest value in addition during pre veraison in 2014 and 2015 the rgr of pri berries was significantly lower than that of rdi berries table 6 fresh weight accumulation rates during ripening averaged for 2014 and 2015 and berry rgr post veraison in 2015 showed significant interactive effects of the rootstock and irrigation method table 6 table 2s 3 5 vegetative development yield response sink source relationships and resources distribution vines grafted on rootstocks 140ru and 1103 p were the most invigorated plants showing significantly greater trunk growth absolute main shoot growth rate final main shoot length number of lateral shoots 1103 p total and exposed leaf area and pruning weight than the vines grafted on the other rootstocks table 7 table 3s supporting information rootstock 140ru was also the most productive by far with significantly higher fructification yield number of clusters per shoot and per vine cluster weight berry weight and berry number per cluster compared to the other rootstocks table 8 and 4s supporting information this rootstock also induced greater cluster compactness and a higher of big clusters table 5s supporting information it was the most efficient from a productive point of view with an averaged wueyield of 18 kg m 3 compared to 9 11 kg m 3 for the other rootstocks table 8 in addition other whole plant efficiency indices such as fwproductivity harvest index hi and dwyield were highest for this rootstock fig 8 for vines grafted on 41b and 1103 p the vigor productive response and whole plant wue indices were intermediate in contrast vines grafted on rootstocks 110r and 161 49c were the least invigorated and productive tables 7 and 8 showing a significantly lower trunk growth rate table 3s wueyield fwproductivity dwproductivity and dwyield tables 8 and 9 the degree of cluster compactness and of big clusters were also lower in these low vigor rootstocks while their of small clusters was the highest in 2015 table 5s also vines grafted on 110r had the poorest vegetative development the number of main shoots per vine number of lateral shoots total leaf area exposed leaf area and pruning weight being significantly p 0 05 lower than for vines grafted on 161 49c table 7 however vines grafted on 161 49c were the least productive the number of main shoots with clusters fructification and number of clusters per shoot being significantly lower table 4s consequently they had lower yield and cluster weight than vines on 110r and the other rootstocks table 8 besides 161 49c was the rootstock with the lowest wue from a productive point of view although it did not differ significantly from 110r table 8 there were no significant effects of the irrigation method pri or rdi on any of the vegetative productive or wue parameters measured the vegetative development and yield were greatest in years 2012 and 2013 rainy years and poorest in 2014 a warmer and drier year table 8 we observed a significant interaction between the rootstock and irrigation method for several parameters such as pruning weight yield cluster weight berry weight and wueyield tables 7 and 8 thus pri vines grafted on 110r had significantly higher pruning weight yield and cluster weight than rdi 110r vines in contrast rdi vines grafted on 161 49c had significantly higher yield cluster weight berry weight and wueyield than pri vines table 8 besides rdi vines grafted on 140ru had significantly higher pruning weight than pri 140ru vines the sink source indices calculated show that in general the most invigorating rootstocks 1103 p and 140ru particularly 140ru gave significantly lower ela tla tla pruning weight toda index yield pruning weight and tla yield values than the rest of the rootstocks tables 7 and 8 conversely the low vigor rootstocks 110r and 161 49c had in general the highest values of these ratios in addition of the invigorating rootstocks 140ru gave a significantly lower toda index and tla yield ratio and a significantly higher yield pruning weight ratio than 1103 p comparing the less invigorating rootstocks 110r had significantly higher ela tla and yield pruning weight ratios and a significantly lower toda index and tla yield ratio than 161 49c tables 7 and 8 the differences in the sink source ratios among rootstocks are supported by the data for the distribution of resources water fresh and dry matter among plant organs in general invigorating rootstocks such as 140ru followed by 1103 p and 41b gave significantly greater accumulation of water and fresh and dry matter in seasonal plant organs than non invigorating rootstocks 110r and 161 49c although this depended on the year fig 4 in particular vines grafted on 140ru accumulated significantly more water and fresh and dry matter in grapes than vines on other rootstocks conversely 161 49c and 110r gave the lowest accumulation of water and fresh and dry matter in grapes also the water content and dry and fresh matter in the main shoots were significantly lower for pri vines compared to rdi vines in 2014 a very dry year fig 5 but not in 2016 data not shown interactions between the rootstock and irrigation method were also observed for the accumulation of water and fresh matter particularly for the main shoots clusters and cumulative total fig 5 3 6 berry composition and berry quality indices plants grafted on different rootstocks produced berries with different concentrations of tss and titratable acidity 161 49c giving the highest sugar concentration and tartaric malic ratio and the lowest ph and malic acid concentration table 9 the berries of the vines grafted on 161 49c and 140ru had the highest titratable acidity values in addition the most vigorous rootstocks 1103 p and 140ru had the highest malic acid concentration table 9 regardless of the rootstock the irrigation method also had a significant effect on the ph titratable acidity im maturity index ºbrix titratable acidity and tartaric malic ratio with pri vines showing lower ph and im and higher titratable acidity and tartatic malic ratio than rdi vines table 9 a significant interaction between the rootstock and irrigation method was observed for malic acid with vines grafted on 161 49c showing a significantly lower content with pri than with rdi vines grafted on rootstocks 140ru and 41b produced the berries with the lowest color index of the must table 10 during the five years of study an overall effect of the rootstock vigor on the concentration of phenolic compounds in the monastrell grapes was observed in general higher concentrations of total anthocyanins extractable anthocyanins and polyphenols were produced by the less vigorous rootstocks 161 49c and 110r table 10 the rootstock that gave the highest phenolic concentration throughout the experiment was 161 49c the anthocyanins extractability was significantly greater lower ae index in 1103 p compared to the other rootstocks the seed maturity index was highest in vines grafted on 41b and lowest in vines grafted on 140ru a significant interaction r x im was also observed for the color intensity total anthocyanins polyphenols and sm index table 10 the antioxidant activity of the monastrell grapes was determined during the period 2014 2016 there was a high positive correlation between the antioxidant activity of the berry and its concentration of flavonoids r 0 96 p 0 001 fig 4s supporting information grapes from vines grafted on 140ru showed the lowest flavonoids concentration and antioxidant activity table 11 the rootstock also modified the concentrations of stilbenes in the berry the concentrations of resveratrol its glycosidic forms and piceids being higher in a low productive vigor rootstock such as 161 49c table 11 the rootstock also modified the concentration of total amino acids which was highest in the berries of vines grafted on the rootstock 161 49c table 11 vines receiving pri produced grapes with higher flavonoids and stilbenes concentrations than those receiving rdi table 11 a r x im interaction also occurred for total amino acids with pri vines grafted on 110r having a higher content than rdi vines and pri vines grafted on 41b having a lower content than rdi vines table 11 in order to have a more global quantitative view of the final berry quality we calculated some quality indices qis described by romero et al 2016c according to these qis one of the less vigorous rootstocks 161 49c had the highest score for qioverall berry highest qitechnological berry and highest qiphenolic berry followed by 110r table 12 the lowest overall berry quality score was produced by the more vigorous rootstocks 140ru and 1103 p due to a low qitechnological berry and qiphenolic berry in general pri vines had a significantly higher qi score than rdi vines although a significant interaction between is and r was also observed for the qi scores table 12 thus pri vines grafted on 161 49c showed the highest qi score of all the combinations and pri vines grafted on 140ru had a higher qioverall berry score than rdi vines in contrast pri vines grafted on 1103 p 41b or 110r had qiphenolic berry qitechnological berry and qioverall berry scores similar to those of rdi vines table 12 3 7 vine water status berry quality water use efficiency relationships the phenolic quality qiphenolic berry technological quality qitechnological berry and qioverall berry showed significant curvilinear relationships with the averaged ψs during the fruit set veraison period reaching their maximum values when ψs was between 1 1 and 1 2 mpa fig 6 a c conversely qiphenolic berry and qioverall berry showed a significant linear relationship with the averaged ψs during the veraison harvest period fig 6d and f mainly during early ripening with higher qi values occurring between 1 3 and 1 4 mpa figs 6g i there was no significant relationship between qitechnological berry and the averaged ψs maintained during the veraison harvest period fig 6e berry quality qioverall berry qiphenolic berry was linearly and negatively related with yield wueyield and fresh berry weight fig 7a d and h conversely qiphenolic berry and qioverall berry were linearly and positively correlated with the tla yield ratio and exposed leaf area tla ratio respectively fig 7e and g besides qiphenolic berry increased with the toda index vine vigor index reaching a certain saturation around 2 m2 kg 1 m 1 fig 7f the fwproductivity aboveground and dwyield were linearly and negatively correlated with berry qis fig 8 b d and f but were positively correlated with the productive wueyield kg fw m 3 fig 8a c and e in addition the hi was negatively correlated with qiphenolic berry fig 8g and h 4 discussion 4 1 rootstock effect the threat of climate change cc will make it necessary to combine different adaptation measures especially those related to irrigation and water management and availability in order to maintain the sustainability of vineyards iglesias and garrote 2015 resco et al 2016 especially in the semiarid warm and more vulnerable winegrowing regions of southern europe such as our study area in this study we combined the use of different rootstocks and di with a low amount of water to increase wue and improve vine performance and sustainability as a long term adaptation to cc our results show that the rootstock had a significant impact on the ability to extract water from the soil and in consequence on the vine water status leaf photosynthesis vigor productivity wue and berry quality of monastrell vines this mirrors previous studies with other rootstock scion genotypes satisha et al 2007 peccoux 2011 marguerit et al 2012 berdeja et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 but contrasts with other work where no significant effect of the rootstock on vine performance was observed keller et al 2012 harbertson and keller 2012 kidman et al 2014 the studies examining rootstock effects on scion performance are highly variable in terms of results zhang et al 2016 differences in the edaphoclimatic and experimental conditions and specific rootstock scion genotypic interactions may have contributed to these divergences keller et al 2001 santarosa et al 2016 vines grafted on invigorating rootstocks such as 1103 p or 140ru both classified as rootstocks with high or very high drought tolerance keller 2010 alsina et al 2011 lovisolo et al 2016 maintained greater water uptake capacity during the growing season and were able to exploit soil water resources more efficiently increasing the irrigation efficiency improved root water uptake and transport capacity is likely due to the presence of v rupestris in the genotypic background of 140ru 1103 p and 110r compared to more drought susceptible rootstocks of lower vigor v riparia crossings such as 41b or 161 49c lovisolo et al 2016 this greater soil water uptake was also reflected in higher leaf nutrient content and vigor superior accumulation of water and dry matter in plant organs and higher yield response but this was offset by poorer final berry quality and color lower polyphenolic and nutraceutical concentrations in the must and lower qi scores compared to rootstocks of medium low vigor 41b 110r and 161 49c this reflects previous results for other varieties nuzzo and matthews 2006 nadal and vernet 2010 wooldridge et al 2010 it has been reported that traditionally high vine vigor and yields are associated with grapes and wines of low quality cortell et al 2008 vines grafted on either of the invigorating rootstocks had sink source ratios such as yield pruning weight tla yield and the toda index that were well outside the optimal agronomic ranges proposed for improving polyphenolic berry quality in di monastrell grapevines romero et al 2016a suggesting that these vines were unbalanced tables 7 and 8 besides their significantly lower ela tla compared to less vigorous rootstocks probably indicates more closed canopies higher proportion of shaded and internal leaves within the canopy and decreased par in the cluster zone data not shown which can also negatively affect berry quality santos et al 2007 romero et al 2010 in accordance with the linear and positive relationship between ela tla and qioverall berry fig 7g nevertheless 1103 p and 140ru despite their genetic proximity sabir et al 2010 and to irrigate with the same volume of water differed in regulation of water relations and in their resources distribution which had important repercussions for yield and berry quality thus vines grafted on 140ru maintained significantly better plant water status and leaf gas exchange and distributed more resources to berry growth and fruit load but at the expense of the final grape quality and final qi scores tables 4 7 8 and 12 conversely vines grafted on 1103 p had a significantly worse vine water status and leaf gas exchange and distributed more resources to leaf area development lateral leaf area and permanent structures trunk growth than to berry growth and fruit load table 8 and gave better berry quality than 140ru different factors such as greater dilution as a consequence of larger berry size and higher fruit load romero et al 2016b greater cluster compactness lower water stress during ripening a lower degree of cluster homogeneity and a higher of big clusters table 5s supporting information may have contributed to reduce the final berry quality in 140ru in general rootstock 41b classified as a rootstock with high medium low or very low drought tolerance depending on the study peccoux 2011 showed a moderate vigor yield berry quality response clearly different from that of the other rootstocks probably due to its different genomic constitution it was the only rootstock derived solely from the crossing of v vinifera cv chasselas x v berlandieri sabir et al 2010 interestingly monastrell vines grafted on the least productive and least vigorous rootstocks 161 49c classified as having low medium drought tolerance peccoux 2011 serra et al 2013 followed by 110r a rootstock of high very high drought tolerance keller 2010 peccoux 2011 showed a significant improvement in long term vine performance and berry quality under di this contrasts with other work where syrah vines grafted on the rootstocks 110r and 161 49c showed poorer final berry quality than vines on more invigorating rootstocks novelli dias et al 2017 revealing the importance of specific rootstock scion interactions and experimental conditions low vigor rootstocks especially 161 49c stimulated the accumulation of polyphenolics and improvements in technological parameters giving the highest berry qi scores tables 9 12 besides they showed several other positive features which may also have contributed to higher berry quality lower cluster compactness lower of big clusters higher of small clusters and a higher degree of homogeneity in the clusters data not shown however the physiological and agronomic behaviors and plant resources distribution of 110r and 161 49c were clearly distinct thus despite receiving the same volumes of water vines grafted on 110r had a significantly higher root water uptake better leaf nutrient p plant water status and higher photosynthesis than vines grafted on 161 49c tables 3 and 4 figs 3 and 3s confirming that 110r increased the water transport capacity to maintain plant activity under water stress probably also due to the presence of v rupestris in its genotypic background lovisolo et al 2016 and enhanced root aquaporins activity galmés et al 2007 and other root traits peccoux 2011 barrios masias et al 2015 in accordance with the significant relationships found among the level of water stress productive parameters sink source ratios and berry quality indices figs 6 8 the greater final berry quality in vines grafted on 161 49c compared to 110r could be due to several interacting factors first greater seasonal sψ and vine water stress during critical periods in 161 49c ψs values around 1 3 mpa were maintained during early ripening within the optimum range proposed for monastrell romero et al 2010 which could have stimulated the secondary metabolism in the berries castellarin et al 2007 second greater leaf area development and carbohydrates supply which could have had a positive effect increasing the biosynthesis and accumulation of quality related metabolites both primary sugars and acids and secondary anthocyanins third lower berry weight which could have enhanced the concentration of metabolites in the berries and qiphenolic berry fig 7 fourth better balanced vines with significantly lower yield pruning weight ratios a higher tla yield ratio close to 1 8 m2 kg 1 and toda index 1 5 m2 kg 1 m 1 and a high ela tla ratio open canopies and exposed clusters as maintained in vines grafted on 161 49c tables 7 and 8 compared to r110 which stimulated more water and plant resources distribution to reproductive organs higher yield than 161 49c table 8 all these features improved monastrell berry quality phenolic and technological and nutraceutical potential under semiarid conditions and their values were close to or within the optimum physiological and agronomic thresholds and ranges proposed for monastrell grapevines romero et al 2016a the greater leaf ca content in 161 49c vines compared to the other rootstocks table 5 may indicate stronger adjustment to greater water stress intensity as ca is a player in most cellular signaling processes acting as a secondary signal provoked by many different environmental stresses kacperska 2004 higher concentrations of total amino acids in berries from vines grafted on 161 49c were also probably a consequence of more severe water stress since certain amino acids have functions including antioxidant and osmoprotectant that can protect abiotically stressed plants cramer et al 2013 amino acids serve as precursors for the synthesis of wine volatile aromatic compounds thus contributing to the overall taste of wine grimplet et al 2009 martins et al 2012 in addition stilbenes resveratrol derivatives piceids are phytoalexins directly related with the intricate defense system used by plants against biotic and abiotic stresses jeandet 2015 a higher concentration of stilbenes as observed in 161 49c can induce more protection against infection by plant pathogens signorelli and guidoni 2005 in this way these low vigour vines together with 110r vines had lower affectation of fungal wood disease during the entire experiment data not shown an enhanced stilbenes concentration may have also important medicinal properties leading to health benefits park et al 2012 4 2 effects of the irrigation method pri vs rdi and its interaction with the rootstock compared to rdi pri vines maintained a significantly lower root water uptake a worse vine water status during ripening and higher cumulative annual water stress tables 3 and 4 figs 2 and 3 confirming previous results in pri monastrell grapevines receiving low irrigation volumes romero et al 2015 significant interactive effects also show that pri vines decreased leaf n and p 161 49c 140ru leaf ca and mg 1103 p leaf ca and mn 41b and leaf zn contents all rootstocks compared to rdi vines table 5 these results suggest that the water applied in this study 85 90 mm year 1 and the volumetric soil water content maintained in the wet half of the root zone during most of the season were insufficient to maintain a more favorable supply of water and certain minerals to the shoots in pri vines as observed in other edaphoclimatic conditions romero et al 2016a b and suggest a decreased soil nutrient uptake translocation capacity compared to rdi vines grafted on these rootstocks the altered soil plant water relations and leaf nutrient status in pri vines did not modify substantially the leaf photosynthesis vigor yield components or productivity indices compared to rdi vines tables 4 8 conversely berry quality parameters and nutraceutical potential were significantly improved by the pri method relative to rdi tables 9 12 in almost all rootstocks thus in vines grafted on 140ru 1103 p 110r and 161 49c the overall berry quality phenolic amino acid concentration and nutraceutical potential was significantly increased by pri in contrast for pri vines grafted on rootstock 41b of medium vigor there was no advantage in terms of yield wue or berry quality qi probably our results reflect intrinsic changes in vine physiology and berry metabolism caused specifically by pri as previously reported in monastrell romero et al 2016b and in other grape varieties martín vertedor et al 2004 valdés et al 2004 2005 uriarte hernández et al 2005 antolín et al 2006 2008 bindon et al 2008 conesa et al 2016 previous research in pri field grown monastrell vines showed an increased xylem sap aba concentration following re irrigation romero et al 2014 and altered endogenous hormonal status of the berries e g abscisic acid aba at harvest compared to rdi romero et al 2015 although we do not have berry aba and other hormones concentration data in this study aba is implicated in berry ripening process and grapevine response to stress ferrandino and lovisolo 2014 and berry aba accumulation can induce a selective increases in the transcript abundance of transcription factors and key genes of the flavonoids biosynthesis encoding catalytic enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway villalobos gónzalez et al 2016 which may explain the increase in the concentration of flavonoids and stilbenes in pri in addition in winegrapes the intrinsic characteristics of the soil fine textured soil as in this study clay loam or clayey soils as in previous romero et al studies also promotes the release of non hydraulic signals root to shoot hormonal signalling putatively aba tramontini et al 2013 which probably favours the application of pri method and an improvement in the final berry quality in other soil types e g sandy soils which do not promote root to shoot stress signalling tramontini et al 2013 pri effects on berry quality may not be beneficial interestingly the effects of pri differed between the two low vigor rootstocks 110r and 161 49c thus pri vines grafted on 110r showed enhanced pruning weight yield 1 400 kg ha 1 table 8 total amino acids and resveratrol and a similar qi score compared to rdi vines grafted on 110r the higher yield and berry weight of pri vines with a similar polyphenolic concentration and must quality and greater nutraceutical potential suggests no dilution but instead greater synthesis and accumulation of photoassimilates and secondary metabolites in the berries relative to rdi vines de la hera et al 2007 in contrast 161 49c vines under pri maintained similar vigor and lower berry weight yield 1 700 kg ha 1 and wueyield compared to rdi vines but had the highest qitecnological berry qiphenolic berry and qioverall berry scores and nutraceutical potential of all the combinations the coincidence of higher phenolic concentration and qi scores with lower berry weight and yield for pri as consequence of greater water stress also suggests a significant concentration effect for secondary metabolites in the berries compared to rdi romero et al 2016b despite the higher berry quality an excessive yield penalty in 161 49c pri vines indicates greater long term cumulative water stress effects and can make pri unviable in this rootstock overall relative to rdi taking into account the higher installation costs of pri garcía garcía et al 2012 this rootstock scion irrigation method combination under di with low water volumes would give low yields of berries of high quality and nutraceutical potential for the production of premium red wine with a high added value unfortunately the current grape market conditions where the payment system in many areas still uses kg baume without taking into account other quality parameters such as the phenolic concentration and nutraceutical potential favor high productivity to the detriment of better grape quality and vineyard efficiency romero et al 2016b other combinations such as vines grafted on 110r under pri 9 900 kg ha 1 and vines grafted on 161 49c under rdi 9 055 kg ha 1 also gave high grape quality and similar qioverall berry scores 11 table 12 and can be good options to seek a compromise between long term yield quality efficiency and returns for the grower 4 3 implications for vineyard irrigation management in semiarid conditions in this winegrowing area a di strategy with low annual water volumes 85 90 mm year 1 was enough to maintain optimum physiological vine performance during the season give moderate or high yields 7 000 16 000 kg ha 1 depending on the rootstock and high wueyield levels 9 18 kg m 3 and berry quality for premium red wine production the ranges of yield 7 400 9 900 kg ha 1 obtained with low vigour rootstocks 110r and 161 49c are adequate and fit well the upper limit established by d o bullas for red wine production while the yield of 16 000 kg ha 1 obtained with invigorating rootstock 140ru surpasses these limits by far in addition the ɵv in deeper soil layers 60 100 cm changed little during most of the growing season fig 1s indicating minor deep percolation according to the low irrigation volumes applied the di strategy applied in this study with 1 no stress or slight stress from budburst to fruit set 19 20 mm year 1 moderate severe water stress from fruit set to harvest 23 24 mm year 1 partial irrigation recovery after veraison 35 36 mm year 1 to maintain moderate stress from veraison to harvest and full recovery postharvest 9 mm year 1 table 2 it was in general adequate to maintain the vine water status within an optimum range of moderate water stress 1 2 ψs 1 40 mpa during critical periods of the growing season never reaching dangerous values 1 4 mpa in any rootstock fig 3s the significant qi ψs relationships indicate that the maintenance of ψs between 1 1 and 1 2 mpa from fruit set to veraison and between 1 3 and 1 4 mpa from veraison to harvest maximizes berry qi in monastrell grapevines fig 6 agreeing with romero et al 2010 and these ranges can be useful for the management of physiologically based irrigation techniques the water volumes applied in this study are well below the recommended thresholds for monastrell grapevines under semiarid conditions in other wine growing region of se spain d o jumilla 110 mm year 1 the optimum irrigation being 140 150 mm year 1 romero et al 2013 2016b probably the different rootstocks used and distinct edaphoclimatic conditions 60 cm deep fine clay soil with 48 clay and a hotter and drier area with 276 mm rainfall year 1 in the jumilla study vs 80 cm deep clay loam soil with 33 clay in a less warm and slightly rainier area 302 mm rainfall year 1 in this bullas study can help explain these differences romero et al 2016a b at veraison there were no important leaf deficiencies of macro and micronutrients although the values are close to the lower limits of the optimum ranges proposed for whole grape leaves in irrigated vineyards davenport and horneck 2011 this indicates that a long term low nutrient input strategy as applied in our edaphoclimatic conditions can be adequate for monastrell grapevines under di previous research also indicated that the benefits of pri relative to di in different species depend on the soil water content maintained in the wet root zone and the total soil water availability hu et al 2011 hutton and loveys 2011 wang et al 2012 einhorn et al 2012 beis and patakas 2015 romero et al 2016a b which are determined by the irrigation management frequencies and volumes however the results of the present study indicate that depending on the specific rootstock scion interaction pri can also be beneficial for monastrell yield or berry quality even with low irrigation water volumes decreased θv availability in the wet root zone and lower root water uptake compared to rdi thus compared to rdi the application of pri with low water volumes improved substantially monastrell yield response 110r and berry quality and nutraceutical potential especially for low vigor rootstocks 161 49c 110r and two invigorating rootstocks 140ru 1103 p in addition compared to rdi method pri method showed deeper water percolation although currently vineyards in south eastern spain such as bullas d o are mostly maintained without irrigation with rainfall 300 mm year 1 and high summer temperatures and frequent drought waves the threat of cc in these semiarid zones with a probable warmer and drier climate will make them unfeasible in the near future in this situation the application of low irrigation volumes 85 90 mm year 1 in combination with low fertilizer inputs low vigor rootstocks 161 49c and 110r and well designed di strategies pri and rdi it could be an adaptation to cc in order to guarantee the sustainability of the monastrell vineyards under semiarid conditions besides for the invigorating drought tolerant rootstocks 140ru and 1103 p our results show that irrigation could be reduced even more under optimized di strategies in order to control the excess vigor and yield in subsequent studies we will seek to confirm or undermine this hypothesis and determine whether these physiological changes and altered berry quality conditioned by the rootstock and

11341,regulated deficit irrigation rdi and partial root zone irrigation pri were compared for five years in field grown mature monastrell grapevines grafted on five different rootstocks 140ru 1103 p 41b 110r and 161 49c in the semiarid winegrowing region of d o bullas south eastern spain vines grafted on invigorating rootstocks 140ru or 1103 p showed the highest vigor water productivity and

41b showed a moderate vigor yield efficiency quality response and this did not improve substantially the final berry quality the least vigorous rootstocks 161 49c and 110r gave lower yield wueyield and productivity ratios but a significant improvement in long term final berry quality the pri increased the yield and or berry quality attributes especially in low vigor rootstocks 161 49c 110r and high vigor rootstocks 140ru 1103 p but not in the medium vigor rootstock 41b in addition pri produced a beneficial increase in the nutraceutical potential for practically all rootstocks the pri vines grafted on 161 49c gave the lowest yield and wueyield but the highest qi scores and the highest nutraceutical value while pri vines grafted on 110r had enhanced long term yield wueyield and amino acid and resveratrol contents with similar berry quality qi indices compared to rdi vines both 161 49c and 110r seem good options to achieve a compromise between long term yield quality efficiency and returns for the grower the application of low water volumes 85 90 mm year 1 with well designed di strategies was enough to maintain the vines in an optimum physiological state obtaining moderate yields 7 400 9 900 kg ha 1 for 161 49c and 110r with high berry quality and nutraceutical potential for premium red wine production such an approach can serve as an adaptation measure in the face of

regulated deficit irrigation rootstocks soil water status water use efficiency yield 1 introduction according to the climate projections for the middle of this century 2040 2070 temperature aridity and water stress are expected to increase in many areas of southern europe reducing yield and growth of the vine fraga et al 2013 2016 ipcc 2014 resco 2015 guiot and cramer 2016 in addition the increase in extreme temperatures may lead to an increased risk of pests and diseases fraga et al 2013 and a decrease in quality and yield due to recurrent heat shock especially in the more continental and warmer areas from the center and south of the iberian peninsula it would be in these semiarid regions of southern europe e g se spain where viticulture would need to make the greatest efforts of adaptation with greater costs to maintain quality and productivity since they are going to experience more severe water stress and impacts of greater magnitude than other wine growing areas resco et al 2016 in these warm and more vulnerable regions it will be necessary to combine different adaptation measures especially those related to water management and availability iglesias and garrote 2015 water scarcity is one of the most important problems of agriculture in semiarid regions increased aridity and reduced rainfall predicted in the future will increase water scarcity making the availability of water for irrigation an even more limiting factor for agriculture the predicted increase in evapotranspiration and in the water needs of the vine as a result of climate change cc will make necessary the application of irrigation water to maintain the sustainability of vineyards and to prevent severe stress in many wine regions of southern spain resco et al 2016 one of the main adaptation measures for the vineyards in these areas will be the implementation of strategies techniques and technologies that save water and improve the efficiency in the use and application of irrigation water without causing a decrease in quality this future scenario with more recurrent drought phenomena and heatwaves will make it more necessary to apply deficit irrigation di techniques as an adaptation to cc in addition to face the risks associated with cc and to achieve environmentally sustainable viticulture vine growers will also have to carry out other changes and make serious adjustments to their traditional production system these include as a measure of adaptation in the medium longer term the substitution of plant material by different rootstocks varieties of vine or clones of the same variety selected for their better adaptation to and tolerance of the new climatic conditions fraga et al 2013 the monastrell variety native to the spanish levant and the most widespread variety in the south east of spain is well adapted to these rigorous and dry climates of high temperatures and recurrent drought cycles because it has evolved since ancient times in these mediterranean climates from a physiological point of view this variety possesses interesting characteristics of drought tolerance which give it a high capacity to adapt to seasonal water stress and di strategies romero et al 2010 2012 2014 in this respect we have verified that di techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation rdi and partial root zone drying irrigation pri efficiently applied and using moderate annual volumes of water maintain high yields and improve long term water use efficiency wue and berry and wine quality in monastrell wine grapes under semiarid conditions romero et al 2016a 2016b the choice of more efficient and drought tolerant rootstocks has been proposed as another measure of adaptation to cc fraga et al 2013 berdeja et al 2015 genotypic differences in the vigor of the rootstocks induce morphological and anatomical modifications and changes in the distribution of the root system which may influence the soil volume explored and the availability of water to the plant in this way the rootstock can affect the regulation of water relations alsina et al 2011 jones 2012 yield components and fruit composition berdeja et al 2014 habran et al 2016 in a warm winegrowing area of the jumilla region se spain monastrell vines grafted on an invigorating rootstock e g 1103 p classified as a rootstock with medium high drought tolerance and widely used in this area responded well to the application of different di techniques such as pri and rdi with moderate amounts of water the optimum irrigation being 140 150 mm year 1 romero et al 2016a 2016b besides previous results indicate that distinctive pri effects compared to rdi depend on the volumetric soil water content of the wet root zone romero et al 2012 and that the maintenance of a high water content in the wet root zone during drying re watering cycles is critical to improve root vine performance in long term pri wine grapes romero et al 2014 a b nevertheless we do not know if this agronomic response can be extrapolated to other soil climatic conditions and besides little is known about the interaction of monastrell with other rootstocks of differing vigor and drought tolerance and with di techniques such as pri and rdi justifying the need for further studies in other climatic conditions with different rootstocks di strategies and water volumes thus the main goal of this study was to determine if the choice of the rootstock modifies substantially the physiological and agronomic response of the monastrell variety to rdi and pri and to evaluate which of these rootstock scion combinations is best suited to the application of long term di techniques under the semiarid conditions of se spain thus five commercial rootstocks 1103 p 140ru 110r 41b and 161 49c on which were grafted mature monastrell grapevines were compared under field conditions with the same irrigation volumes and the same controlled di strategy two different irrigation techniques rdi and pri were

fig 1 six two bud spurs 12 nodes were left after pruning while in may green non productive shoots were removed from each vine in the same manner for all treatments according to the grower s practice in the area each rootstock irrigation method combination was drip irrigated during five consecutive years 2012 2016 using two different di techniques rdi and pri all combinations were irrigated with similar annual water volumes applying the same designed di strategy table 2 1 no stress or slight stress from budburst to fruit set 2 moderate severe water stress from fruit set to veraison period of the phenological cycle where grape coloration its softening and the accumulation of sugars and anthocyanins begins 3 partial irrigation recovery to maintain moderate stress from veraison to harvest 4 full recovery postharvest this di strategy was initially designed to control excessive vigor during early and mid season improve cluster microclimate reduce berry size and yield by using moderate or severe pre veraison water deficits and stimulate berry accumulation of sugar anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds by using a moderate post veraison water deficit in these periods the weekly

in the meteorological station campbell mod cr 10x located at the experimental vineyard and belonging to the servicio de información agraria de murcia siam imida the experimental design consisted of four replicates per rootstock irrigation combination in a completely randomized 4 block design each replicate contained five vines only the three central vines being assessed the border vines in each row were excluded to eliminate potential edge effects irrigation was applied every year from april to october during the late evening 20 00 23 00 two to five times per week depending on the phenological period and was controlled automatically each irrigation event lasted between 1 and 3 h depending on the phenological stage to avoid deep water percolation the amount of water applied in each irrigation method pri and rdi was measured with flow meters model m170 elster iberconta basque country spain all rootstock irrigation method combinations received the same annual low amount of fertilizers 30 kg n 20 kg p 30 kg k and 16 kg mg per ha supplied through the irrigation drip system from april to august besides at the beginning of the growing season a liquid organic matter amino acid complex was applied water was applied by one pressure compensated emitter per plant 2 l h 1 with one drip irrigation line per row for the conventional drip irrigation in rdi and on a double line per row for the pri with emitters 4 l h 1 to apply the same amount of water in pri and rdi in the pri layout the two pipelines were joined on both sides of the trunk and located underneath each vine row in each pipeline in the pri treatments there were alternate zones with and without emitters to create dry and wet root zones within each vine row fig 1 in the pri treatments water was supplied to only one side of the root system at a time alternating every 14 16 days in the rdi treatments irrigation water was supplied simultaneously to the entire root system we applied 13 14 drying re watering pri cycles during the whole season from early mid april to the end of october every year 2 2 soil water content root dry biomass and root water uptake rate from 2013 to 2016 the volumetric soil water

fortnightly from early april to the end of july the total shoot length was measured with a tape measure the total number of main shoots per vine was also recorded each year at the end of june in the same vines besides in 2014 and 2015 in one representative main shoot per vine 16 vines per rootstock the total number of lateral shoots was counted and the lateral shoot length growth was measured weekly using a tape measure in previously labeled lateral shoots from 2012 to 2015 the total leaf area tla per vine was estimated pre and post veraison in 8 or 16 vines per rootstock depending on the year using a non destructive method a first order polynomial equation was developed for each rootstock relating main shoot length sl to total leaf area tla of the main shoot the tla per plant was calculated by selecting four or five representative main shoots per vine and calculating their average sl the tla per plant was estimated by multiplying the average shoot leaf area by the total number

status than those on 1103 p 41b or 161 49c table 4 vines grafted on 161 49c experienced the most severe water stress during early ripening and veraison harvest period table 4 and they had the highest annual averaged sψ together with 1103 p and 41b fig 3 besides vines grafted on 1103 p and 41b experienced greater water stress from fruit set to veraison p 0 05 than those on the other rootstocks table 4 the seasonal evolution of ψs indicates that for most of the growing season especially from fruit set to harvest ψs was maintained within a range of values indicating moderate water stress between 1 25 and 1 35 mpa for all rootstocks and only occasionally in a short period of 2012 for 41b and 1103 p exceeded the critical threshold of 1 4 mpa fig 3 also according to the higher sψ values for pri vines fig 3 and regardless of the rootstock pri vines experienced greater water stress during the veraison harvest especially at early ripening and postharvest periods than rdi vines table 4 fig 3 in addition significant interactive effects were observed for the annual averaged ψs with pri vines grafted on 1103 p and 161 49c showing lower ψs than rdi vines table 4 the years with the most severe vine water stress were 2012 and 2014 while and the stress was milder in 2013 and 2015 vines grafted on 140ru maintained significantly higher net leaf photosynthesis measured at early mid morning an during most of the growing season especially from fruit set to harvest followed by vines grafted on 110r table 4 differences in averaged an of up to 2 5 μmol m 2 s 1 were observed in some phenological periods between vines grafted on 140ru the maximum an and vines grafted on 161 49c and 1103 p which maintained the lowest values of seasonal an the year also had a significant effect on leaf photosynthesis an reaching its maximum levels in 2014 and its minimum in 2015 although in general there were no significant effects of the irrigation method on an a significant interaction between the rootstock and irrigation method was observed during the fruit set veraison period in this period pri vines grafted on 161 49c or 110r had lower averaged an values than rdi vines while pri vines grafted on 41b maintained significantly higher an values than rdi vines table 4 3 3 leaf mineral nutrition the rootstock and the year had an important effect on leaf mineral composition in general invigorating rootstocks 140ru and 1103 p enhanced significantly the leaf n p and mg 1103 p contents and decreased b compared to low vigor rootstocks 161 49c and 110r table 5 the irrigation method only had a significant effect on the leaf zn and b contents with pri vines showing significantly lower zn and higher b than rdi vines table 5 significant interactive effects of the rootstock and irrigation method were observed for n p ca mg and mn table 5 3 4 fruit growth and ripening the rgr of berries on the rootstock 140ru was significantly higher than for the rest of the rootstocks mainly during the post veraison periods table 6 conversely the rgr of 1103 p berries showed the lowest value in addition during pre veraison in 2014 and 2015 the rgr of pri berries was significantly lower than that of rdi berries table 6 fresh weight accumulation rates during ripening averaged for 2014 and 2015 and berry rgr post veraison in 2015 showed significant interactive effects of the rootstock and irrigation method table 6 table 2s 3 5 vegetative development yield response sink source relationships and resources distribution vines grafted on rootstocks 140ru and 1103 p were the most invigorated plants showing significantly greater trunk growth absolute main shoot growth rate final main shoot length number of lateral shoots 1103 p total and exposed leaf area and pruning weight than the vines grafted on the other rootstocks table 7 table 3s supporting information rootstock 140ru was also the most productive by far with significantly higher fructification yield number of clusters per shoot and per vine cluster weight berry weight and berry number per cluster compared to the other rootstocks table 8 and 4s supporting information this rootstock also induced greater cluster compactness and a higher of big clusters table 5s supporting information it was the most efficient from a productive point of view with an averaged wueyield of 18 kg m 3 compared to 9 11 kg m 3 for the other rootstocks table 8 in addition other whole plant efficiency indices such as fwproductivity harvest index hi and dwyield were highest for this rootstock fig 8 for vines grafted on 41b and 1103 p the vigor productive response and whole plant wue indices were intermediate in contrast vines grafted on rootstocks 110r and 161 49c were the least invigorated and productive tables 7 and 8 showing a significantly lower trunk growth rate table 3s wueyield fwproductivity dwproductivity and dwyield tables 8 and 9 the degree of cluster compactness and of big clusters were also lower in these low vigor rootstocks while their of small clusters was the highest in 2015 table 5s also vines grafted on 110r had the poorest vegetative development the number of main shoots per vine number of lateral shoots total leaf area exposed leaf area and pruning weight being significantly p 0 05 lower than for vines grafted on 161 49c table 7 however vines grafted on 161 49c were the least productive the number of main shoots with clusters fructification and number of clusters per shoot being significantly lower table 4s consequently they had lower yield and cluster weight than vines on 110r and the other rootstocks table 8 besides 161 49c was the rootstock with the lowest wue from a productive point of view although it did not differ significantly from 110r table 8 there were no significant effects of the irrigation method pri or rdi on any of the vegetative productive or wue parameters measured the vegetative development and yield were greatest in years 2012 and 2013 rainy years and poorest in 2014 a warmer and drier year table 8 we observed a significant interaction between the rootstock and irrigation method for several parameters such as pruning weight yield cluster weight berry weight and wueyield tables 7 and 8 thus pri vines grafted on 110r had significantly higher pruning weight yield and cluster weight than rdi 110r vines in contrast rdi vines grafted on 161 49c had significantly higher yield cluster weight berry weight and wueyield than pri vines table 8 besides rdi vines grafted on 140ru had significantly higher pruning weight than pri 140ru vines the sink source indices calculated show that in general the most invigorating rootstocks 1103 p and 140ru particularly 140ru gave significantly lower ela tla tla pruning weight toda index yield pruning weight and tla yield values than the rest of the rootstocks tables 7 and 8 conversely the low vigor rootstocks 110r and 161 49c had in general the highest values of these ratios in addition of the invigorating rootstocks 140ru gave a significantly lower toda index and tla yield ratio and a significantly higher yield pruning weight ratio than 1103 p comparing the less invigorating rootstocks 110r had significantly higher ela tla and yield pruning weight ratios and a significantly lower toda index and tla yield ratio than 161 49c tables 7 and 8 the differences in the sink source ratios among rootstocks are supported by the data for the distribution of resources water fresh and dry matter among plant organs in general invigorating rootstocks such as 140ru followed by 1103 p and 41b gave significantly greater accumulation of water and fresh and dry matter in seasonal plant organs than non invigorating rootstocks 110r and 161 49c although this depended on the year fig 4 in particular vines grafted on 140ru accumulated significantly more water and fresh and dry matter in grapes than vines on other rootstocks conversely 161 49c and 110r gave the lowest accumulation of water and fresh and dry matter in grapes also the water content and dry and fresh matter in the main shoots were significantly lower for pri vines compared to rdi vines in 2014 a very dry year fig 5 but not in 2016 data not shown interactions between the rootstock and irrigation method were also observed for the accumulation of water and fresh matter particularly for the main shoots clusters and cumulative total fig 5 3 6 berry composition and berry quality indices plants grafted on different rootstocks produced berries with different concentrations of tss and titratable acidity 161 49c giving the highest sugar concentration and tartaric malic ratio and the lowest ph and malic acid concentration table 9 the berries of the vines grafted on 161 49c and 140ru had the highest titratable acidity values in addition the most vigorous rootstocks 1103 p and 140ru had the highest malic acid concentration table 9 regardless of the rootstock the irrigation method also had a significant effect on the ph titratable acidity im maturity index ºbrix titratable acidity and tartaric malic ratio with pri vines showing lower ph and im and higher titratable acidity and tartatic malic ratio than rdi vines table 9 a significant interaction between the rootstock and irrigation method was observed for malic acid with vines grafted on 161 49c showing a significantly lower content with pri than with rdi vines grafted on rootstocks 140ru and 41b produced the berries with the lowest color index of the must table 10 during the five years of study an overall effect of the rootstock vigor on the concentration of phenolic compounds in the monastrell grapes was observed in general higher concentrations of total anthocyanins extractable anthocyanins and polyphenols were produced by the less vigorous rootstocks 161 49c and 110r table 10 the rootstock that gave the highest phenolic concentration throughout the experiment was 161 49c the anthocyanins extractability was significantly greater lower ae index in 1103 p compared to the other rootstocks the seed maturity index was highest in vines grafted on 41b and lowest in vines grafted on 140ru a significant interaction r x im was also observed for the color intensity total anthocyanins polyphenols and sm index table 10 the antioxidant activity of the monastrell grapes was determined during the period 2014 2016 there was a high positive correlation between the antioxidant activity of the berry and its concentration of flavonoids r 0 96 p 0 001 fig 4s supporting information grapes from vines grafted on 140ru showed the lowest flavonoids concentration and antioxidant activity table 11 the rootstock also modified the concentrations of stilbenes in the berry the concentrations of resveratrol its glycosidic forms and piceids being higher in a low productive vigor rootstock such as 161 49c table 11 the rootstock also modified the concentration of total amino acids which was highest in the berries of vines grafted on the rootstock 161 49c table 11 vines receiving pri produced grapes with higher flavonoids and stilbenes concentrations than those receiving rdi table 11 a r x im interaction also occurred for total amino acids with pri vines grafted on 110r having a higher content than rdi vines and pri vines grafted on 41b having a lower content than rdi vines table 11 in order to have a more global quantitative view of the final berry quality we calculated some quality indices qis described by romero et al 2016c according to these qis one of the less vigorous rootstocks 161 49c had the highest score for qioverall berry highest qitechnological berry and highest qiphenolic berry followed by 110r table 12 the lowest overall berry quality score was produced by the more vigorous rootstocks 140ru and 1103 p due to a low qitechnological berry and qiphenolic berry in general pri vines had a significantly higher qi score than rdi vines although a significant interaction between is and r was also observed for the qi scores table 12 thus pri vines grafted on 161 49c showed the highest qi score of all the combinations and pri vines grafted on 140ru had a higher qioverall berry score than rdi vines in contrast pri vines grafted on 1103 p 41b or 110r had qiphenolic berry qitechnological berry and qioverall berry scores similar to those of rdi vines table 12 3 7 vine water status berry quality water use efficiency relationships the phenolic quality qiphenolic berry technological quality qitechnological berry and qioverall berry showed significant curvilinear relationships with the averaged ψs during the fruit set veraison period reaching their maximum values when ψs was between 1 1 and 1 2 mpa fig 6 a c conversely qiphenolic berry and qioverall berry showed a significant linear relationship with the averaged ψs during the veraison harvest period fig 6d and f mainly during early ripening with higher qi values occurring between 1 3 and 1 4 mpa figs 6g i there was no significant relationship between qitechnological berry and the averaged ψs maintained during the veraison harvest period fig 6e berry quality qioverall berry qiphenolic berry was linearly and negatively related with yield wueyield and fresh berry weight fig 7a d and h conversely qiphenolic berry and qioverall berry were linearly and positively correlated with the tla yield ratio and exposed leaf area tla ratio respectively fig 7e and g besides qiphenolic berry increased with the toda index vine vigor index reaching a certain saturation around 2 m2 kg 1 m 1 fig 7f the fwproductivity aboveground and dwyield were linearly and negatively correlated with berry qis fig 8 b d and f but were positively correlated with the productive wueyield kg fw m 3 fig 8a c and e in addition the hi was negatively correlated with qiphenolic berry fig 8g and h 4 discussion 4 1 rootstock effect the threat of climate change cc will make it necessary to combine different adaptation measures especially those related to irrigation and water management and availability in order to maintain the sustainability of vineyards iglesias and garrote 2015 resco et al 2016 especially in the semiarid warm and more vulnerable winegrowing regions of southern europe such as our study area in this study we combined the use of different rootstocks and di with a low amount of water to increase wue and improve vine performance and sustainability as a long term adaptation to cc our results show that the rootstock had a significant impact on the ability to extract water from the soil and in consequence on the vine water status leaf photosynthesis vigor productivity wue and berry quality of monastrell vines this mirrors previous studies with other rootstock scion genotypes satisha et al 2007 peccoux 2011 marguerit et al 2012 berdeja et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 but contrasts with other work where no significant effect of the rootstock on vine performance was observed keller et al 2012 harbertson and keller 2012 kidman et al 2014 the studies examining rootstock effects on scion performance are highly variable in terms of results zhang et al 2016 differences in the edaphoclimatic and experimental conditions and specific rootstock scion genotypic interactions may have contributed to these divergences keller et al 2001 santarosa et al 2016 vines grafted on invigorating rootstocks such as 1103 p or 140ru both classified as rootstocks with high or very high drought tolerance keller 2010 alsina et al 2011 lovisolo et al 2016 maintained greater water uptake capacity during the growing season and were able to exploit soil water resources more efficiently increasing the irrigation efficiency improved root water uptake and transport capacity is likely due to the presence of v rupestris in the genotypic background of 140ru 1103 p and 110r compared to more drought susceptible rootstocks of lower vigor v riparia crossings such as 41b or 161 49c lovisolo et al 2016 this greater soil water uptake was also reflected in higher leaf nutrient content and vigor superior accumulation of water and dry matter in plant organs and higher yield response but this was offset by poorer final berry quality and color lower polyphenolic and nutraceutical concentrations in the must and lower qi scores compared to rootstocks of medium low vigor 41b 110r and 161 49c this reflects previous results for other varieties nuzzo and matthews 2006 nadal and vernet 2010 wooldridge et al 2010 it has been reported that traditionally high vine vigor and yields are associated with grapes and wines of low quality cortell et al 2008 vines grafted on either of the invigorating rootstocks had sink source ratios such as yield pruning weight tla yield and the toda index that were well outside the optimal agronomic ranges proposed for improving polyphenolic berry quality in di monastrell grapevines romero et al 2016a suggesting that these vines were unbalanced tables 7 and 8 besides their significantly lower ela tla compared to less vigorous rootstocks probably indicates more closed canopies higher proportion of shaded and internal leaves within the canopy and decreased par in the cluster zone data not shown which can also negatively affect berry quality santos et al 2007 romero et al 2010 in accordance with the linear and positive relationship between ela tla and qioverall berry fig 7g nevertheless 1103 p and 140ru despite their genetic proximity sabir et al 2010 and to irrigate with the same volume of water differed in regulation of water relations and in their resources distribution which had important repercussions for yield and berry quality thus vines grafted on 140ru maintained significantly better plant water status and leaf gas exchange and distributed more resources to berry growth and fruit load but at the expense of the final grape quality and final qi scores tables 4 7 8 and 12 conversely vines grafted on 1103 p had a significantly worse vine water status and leaf gas exchange and distributed more resources to leaf area development lateral leaf area and permanent structures trunk growth than to berry growth and fruit load table 8 and gave better berry quality than 140ru different factors such as greater dilution as a consequence of larger berry size and higher fruit load romero et al 2016b greater cluster compactness lower water stress during ripening a lower degree of cluster homogeneity and a higher of big clusters table 5s supporting information may have contributed to reduce the final berry quality in 140ru in general rootstock 41b classified as a rootstock with high medium low or very low drought tolerance depending on the study peccoux 2011 showed a moderate vigor yield berry quality response clearly different from that of the other rootstocks probably due to its different genomic constitution it was the only rootstock derived solely from the crossing of v vinifera cv chasselas x v berlandieri sabir et al 2010 interestingly monastrell vines grafted on the least productive and least vigorous rootstocks 161 49c classified as having low medium drought tolerance peccoux 2011 serra et al 2013 followed by 110r a rootstock of high very high drought tolerance keller 2010 peccoux 2011 showed a significant improvement in long term vine performance and berry quality under di this contrasts with other work where syrah vines grafted on the rootstocks 110r and 161 49c showed poorer final berry quality than vines on more invigorating rootstocks novelli dias et al 2017 revealing the importance of specific rootstock scion interactions and experimental conditions low vigor rootstocks especially 161 49c stimulated the accumulation of polyphenolics and improvements in technological parameters giving the highest berry qi scores tables 9 12 besides they showed several other positive features which may also have contributed to higher berry quality lower cluster compactness lower of big clusters higher of small clusters and a higher degree of homogeneity in the clusters data not shown however the physiological and agronomic behaviors and plant resources distribution of 110r and 161 49c were clearly distinct thus despite receiving the same volumes of water vines grafted on 110r had a significantly higher root water uptake better leaf nutrient p plant water status and higher photosynthesis than vines grafted on 161 49c tables 3 and 4 figs 3 and 3s confirming that 110r increased the water transport capacity to maintain plant activity under water stress probably also due to the presence of v rupestris in its genotypic background lovisolo et al 2016 and enhanced root aquaporins activity galmés et al 2007 and other root traits peccoux 2011 barrios masias et al 2015 in accordance with the significant relationships found among the level of water stress productive parameters sink source ratios and berry quality indices figs 6 8 the greater final berry quality in vines grafted on 161 49c compared to 110r could be due to several interacting factors first greater seasonal sψ and vine water stress during critical periods in 161 49c ψs values around 1 3 mpa were maintained during early ripening within the optimum range proposed for monastrell romero et al 2010 which could have stimulated the secondary metabolism in the berries castellarin et al 2007 second greater leaf area development and carbohydrates supply which could have had a positive effect increasing the biosynthesis and accumulation of quality related metabolites both primary sugars and acids and secondary anthocyanins third lower berry weight which could have enhanced the concentration of metabolites in the berries and qiphenolic berry fig 7 fourth better balanced vines with significantly lower yield pruning weight ratios a higher tla yield ratio close to 1 8 m2 kg 1 and toda index 1 5 m2 kg 1 m 1 and a high ela tla ratio open canopies and exposed clusters as maintained in vines grafted on 161 49c tables 7 and 8 compared to r110 which stimulated more water and plant resources distribution to reproductive organs higher yield than 161 49c table 8 all these features improved monastrell berry quality phenolic and technological and nutraceutical potential under semiarid conditions and their values were close to or within the optimum physiological and agronomic thresholds and ranges proposed for monastrell grapevines romero et al 2016a the greater leaf ca content in 161 49c vines compared to the other rootstocks table 5 may indicate stronger adjustment to greater water stress intensity as ca is a player in most cellular signaling processes acting as a secondary signal provoked by many different environmental stresses kacperska 2004 higher concentrations of total amino acids in berries from vines grafted on 161 49c were also probably a consequence of more severe water stress since certain amino acids have functions including antioxidant and osmoprotectant that can protect abiotically stressed plants cramer et al 2013 amino acids serve as precursors for the synthesis of wine volatile aromatic compounds thus contributing to the overall taste of wine grimplet et al 2009 martins et al 2012 in addition stilbenes resveratrol derivatives piceids are phytoalexins directly related with the intricate defense system used by plants against biotic and abiotic stresses jeandet 2015 a higher concentration of stilbenes as observed in 161 49c can induce more protection against infection by plant pathogens signorelli and guidoni 2005 in this way these low vigour vines together with 110r vines had lower affectation of fungal wood disease during the entire experiment data not shown an enhanced stilbenes concentration may have also important medicinal properties leading to health benefits park et al 2012 4 2 effects of the irrigation method pri vs rdi and its interaction with the rootstock compared to rdi pri vines maintained a significantly lower root water uptake a worse vine water status during ripening and higher cumulative annual water stress tables 3 and 4 figs 2 and 3 confirming previous results in pri monastrell grapevines receiving low irrigation volumes romero et al 2015 significant interactive effects also show that pri vines decreased leaf n and p 161 49c 140ru leaf ca and mg 1103 p leaf ca and mn 41b and leaf zn contents all rootstocks compared to rdi vines table 5 these results suggest that the water applied in this study 85 90 mm year 1 and the volumetric soil water content maintained in the wet half of the root zone during most of the season were insufficient to maintain a more favorable supply of water and certain minerals to the shoots in pri vines as observed in other edaphoclimatic conditions romero et al 2016a b and suggest a decreased soil nutrient uptake translocation capacity compared to rdi vines grafted on these rootstocks the altered soil plant water relations and leaf nutrient status in pri vines did not modify substantially the leaf photosynthesis vigor yield components or productivity indices compared to rdi vines tables 4 8 conversely berry quality parameters and nutraceutical potential were significantly improved by the pri method relative to rdi tables 9 12 in almost all rootstocks thus in vines grafted on 140ru 1103 p 110r and 161 49c the overall berry quality phenolic amino acid concentration and nutraceutical potential was significantly increased by pri in contrast for pri vines grafted on rootstock 41b of medium vigor there was no advantage in terms of yield wue or berry quality qi probably our results reflect intrinsic changes in vine physiology and berry metabolism caused specifically by pri as previously reported in monastrell romero et al 2016b and in other grape varieties martín vertedor et al 2004 valdés et al 2004 2005 uriarte hernández et al 2005 antolín et al 2006 2008 bindon et al 2008 conesa et al 2016 previous research in pri field grown monastrell vines showed an increased xylem sap aba concentration following re irrigation romero et al 2014 and altered endogenous hormonal status of the berries e g abscisic acid aba at harvest compared to rdi romero et al 2015 although we do not have berry aba and other hormones concentration data in this study aba is implicated in berry ripening process and grapevine response to stress ferrandino and lovisolo 2014 and berry aba accumulation can induce a selective increases in the transcript abundance of transcription factors and key genes of the flavonoids biosynthesis encoding catalytic enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway villalobos gónzalez et al 2016 which may explain the increase in the concentration of flavonoids and stilbenes in pri in addition in winegrapes the intrinsic characteristics of the soil fine textured soil as in this study clay loam or clayey soils as in previous romero et al studies also promotes the release of non hydraulic signals root to shoot hormonal signalling putatively aba tramontini et al 2013 which probably favours the application of pri method and an improvement in the final berry quality in other soil types e g sandy soils which do not promote root to shoot stress signalling tramontini et al 2013 pri effects on berry quality may not be beneficial interestingly the effects of pri differed between the two low vigor rootstocks 110r and 161 49c thus pri vines grafted on 110r showed enhanced pruning weight yield 1 400 kg ha 1 table 8 total amino acids and resveratrol and a similar qi score compared to rdi vines grafted on 110r the higher yield and berry weight of pri vines with a similar polyphenolic concentration and must quality and greater nutraceutical potential suggests no dilution but instead greater synthesis and accumulation of photoassimilates and secondary metabolites in the berries relative to rdi vines de la hera et al 2007 in contrast 161 49c vines under pri maintained similar vigor and lower berry weight yield 1 700 kg ha 1 and wueyield compared to rdi vines but had the highest qitecnological berry qiphenolic berry and qioverall berry scores and nutraceutical potential of all the combinations the coincidence of higher phenolic concentration and qi scores with lower berry weight and yield for pri as consequence of greater water stress also suggests a significant concentration effect for secondary metabolites in the berries compared to rdi romero et al 2016b despite the higher berry quality an excessive yield penalty in 161 49c pri vines indicates greater long term cumulative water stress effects and can make pri unviable in this rootstock overall relative to rdi taking into account the higher installation costs of pri garcía garcía et al 2012 this rootstock scion irrigation method combination under di with low water volumes would give low yields of berries of high quality and nutraceutical potential for the production of premium red wine with a high added value unfortunately the current grape market conditions where the payment system in many areas still uses kg baume without taking into account other quality parameters such as the phenolic concentration and nutraceutical potential favor high productivity to the detriment of better grape quality and vineyard efficiency romero et al 2016b other combinations such as vines grafted on 110r under pri 9 900 kg ha 1 and vines grafted on 161 49c under rdi 9 055 kg ha 1 also gave high grape quality and similar qioverall berry scores 11 table 12 and can be good options to seek a compromise between long term yield quality efficiency and returns for the grower 4 3 implications for vineyard irrigation management in semiarid conditions in this winegrowing area a di strategy with low annual water volumes 85 90 mm year 1 was enough to maintain optimum physiological vine performance during the season give moderate or high yields 7 000 16 000 kg ha 1 depending on the rootstock and high wueyield levels 9 18 kg m 3 and berry quality for premium red wine production the ranges of yield 7 400 9 900 kg ha 1 obtained with low vigour rootstocks 110r and 161 49c are adequate and fit well the upper limit established by d o bullas for red wine production while the yield of 16 000 kg ha 1 obtained with invigorating rootstock 140ru surpasses these limits by far in addition the ɵv in deeper soil layers 60 100 cm changed little during most of the growing season fig 1s indicating minor deep percolation according to the low irrigation volumes applied the di strategy applied in this study with 1 no stress or slight stress from budburst to fruit set 19 20 mm year 1 moderate severe water stress from fruit set to harvest 23 24 mm year 1 partial irrigation recovery after veraison 35 36 mm year 1 to maintain moderate stress from veraison to harvest and full recovery postharvest 9 mm year 1 table 2 it was in general adequate to maintain the vine water status within an optimum range of moderate water stress 1 2 ψs 1 40 mpa during critical periods of the growing season never reaching dangerous values 1 4 mpa in any rootstock fig 3s the significant qi ψs relationships indicate that the maintenance of ψs between 1 1 and 1 2 mpa from fruit set to veraison and between 1 3 and 1 4 mpa from veraison to harvest maximizes berry qi in monastrell grapevines fig 6 agreeing with romero et al 2010 and these ranges can be useful for the management of physiologically based irrigation techniques the water volumes applied in this study are well below the recommended thresholds for monastrell grapevines under semiarid conditions in other wine growing region of se spain d o jumilla 110 mm year 1 the optimum irrigation being 140 150 mm year 1 romero et al 2013 2016b probably the different rootstocks used and distinct edaphoclimatic conditions 60 cm deep fine clay soil with 48 clay and a hotter and drier area with 276 mm rainfall year 1 in the jumilla study vs 80 cm deep clay loam soil with 33 clay in a less warm and slightly rainier area 302 mm rainfall year 1 in this bullas study can help explain these differences romero et al 2016a b at veraison there were no important leaf deficiencies of macro and micronutrients although the values are close to the lower limits of the optimum ranges proposed for whole grape leaves in irrigated vineyards davenport and horneck 2011 this indicates that a long term low nutrient input strategy as applied in our edaphoclimatic conditions can be adequate for monastrell grapevines under di previous research also indicated that the benefits of pri relative to di in different species depend on the soil water content maintained in the wet root zone and the total soil water availability hu et al 2011 hutton and loveys 2011 wang et al 2012 einhorn et al 2012 beis and patakas 2015 romero et al 2016a b which are determined by the irrigation management frequencies and volumes however the results of the present study indicate that depending on the specific rootstock scion interaction pri can also be beneficial for monastrell yield or berry quality even with low irrigation water volumes decreased θv availability in the wet root zone and lower root water uptake compared to rdi thus compared to rdi the application of pri with low water volumes improved substantially monastrell yield response 110r and berry quality and nutraceutical potential especially for low vigor rootstocks 161 49c 110r and two invigorating rootstocks 140ru 1103 p in addition compared to rdi method pri method showed deeper water percolation although currently vineyards in south eastern spain such as bullas d o are mostly maintained without irrigation with rainfall 300 mm year 1 and high summer temperatures and frequent drought waves the threat of cc in these semiarid zones with a probable warmer and drier climate will make them unfeasible in the near future in this situation the application of low irrigation volumes 85 90 mm year 1 in combination with low fertilizer inputs low vigor

period there was no leaching from the pots at the fifth leaf stage tomato lycopersicon esculentum l var qianxi seedlings were transplanted into the pots the soil water contents in the pots were monitored by a time domain reflectometer tdr minitrase soil moisture equipment corp ca usa with 17 cm probes installed in the middle area of the pots 2 2 fertigation treatments fertigation treatments comprised three levels of soil moisture and three n levels the soil moisture levels consisted of 90 70 and 50 of soil water holding capacity representing sufficiently moderately and severely water

randomized design with four replicates in each treatment and this yielded 36 pots in total for n fertigation 20 of the total applied n was used as basal fertilizer which was mixed thoroughly with the soil before filling the pots the remaining 80 of the total applied n was delivered with irrigation water by fertigation in ten equal splits every five days on 0 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 41 and 46 dat

new york usa duncan s multiple range test was applied to assess the differences between treatments at a significance level of 5 regression analyses were used to determine the relationships between the measured parameters 3 results 3 1 soil water dynamics in the high soil water treatment soil water contents were close to 30 in the first 15dat thereafter remained on average around 26 fig 1 moreover the soil water contents were highest in the low n treatment intermediate in the medium n treatment and lowest in the high n treatment in the moderately water stressed treatment soil water contents were kept at about 21 similarly the soil water contents were highest in the low n treatment followed by the medium and high n treatments in the severely water stressed treatments soil water contents remained at about 15 during the whole treatment period for all the treatments 3 2 leaf and root water potential both lwp and rwp were significantly affected by water treatments fig 2 across the n treatments lwp and rwp increased with the increase of water levels across the water treatment lwp and rwp were similar among the n treatments the rwp was significantly positively and linearly correlated with swc and a significant positive linear relationship was found between lwp and rwp fig 3 3 3 leaf gas exchange and intrinsic water use efficiency across the n treatments an was similar among different soil water treatments except on two occasions fig 4 the gs was significantly decreased by the severely water stressed treatment compared with other two soil water treatments during most of the treatment period consequently the wuei was highest in the severely water stressed treatment intermediate in the moderately water stressed treatment and lowest in the high soil water treatment across the water treatments an was similar among the n treatments before 34dat thereafter an was highest in the high n treatment followed by the medium n treatment and lowest in the low n treatment though there were no statistical differences among n treatments on most occasions fig 4 the gs and wuei were not significantly affected by n treatments except wuei on 48dat 3 4 leaf and root tissue aba concentration the aba leaf and aba root were significantly affected by water treatments while they were not influenced by n treatments fig 5 across the n treatments the highest aba leaf and aba root were found under the severely water stressed treatment intermediate in the moderately water stressed treatment and lowest in the high soil water treatment fig 5 the swc was significantly negatively and linearly correlated with aba leaf and aba root respectively fig 6 a significant negative linear relationship was also observed between rwp and aba root there was a significant positive linear relationship between aba leaf and aba root 3 5 leaf area fresh fruit weight biomass production plant water use efficiency leaf δ13c and δ18o the leaf area above ground dry biomass plant water use and wuep were significantly affected by both water and n treatments table 1 across the n treatments leaf area above ground dry biomass and plant water use were highest in the high soil water treatment intermediate in the moderately water stressed treatment and lowest in the severely water stressed treatment the wuep in the moderately and severely water stressed treatments were significantly increased by 14 and 10 than that under the high soil water treatment at harvest high and moderately water stressed treatments produced 59 and 50 more fruit compared to the severely water stressed treatment across the water treatments leaf area above ground biomass and plant water use were highest in the high n treatment intermediate in the medium n treatment and lowest in the low n treatment table 1 in consequence the wuep followed the same pattern nonetheless the fresh fruit weight was not affected by n treatments when analyzed across the n treatments leaf δ13c was highest in the severely water stressed treatment followed by the moderately water stressed and high soil water treatment table 1 nevertheless leaf δ13c and leaf δ18o were similar among the n treatments across the n treatments leaf δ18o was highest in the severely water stressed treatment which was significantly higher than those under other two soil water treatments there were significant positive linear relationships between leaf δ13c and wuep as well as between leaf δ18o and wuep fig 7 however significant negative linear relationships were observed between leaf δ13c and gs and also between leaf δ18o and gs leaf δ13c was significantly positively and linearly correlated with leaf δ18o a significant positive linear relationship was found between leaf δ13c and specific leaf n content fig 7 while no relationship existed between leaf δ18o and specific leaf n content data not shown 3 6 plant n and 15n accumulation and specific leaf n content across the n treatments n and 15n accumulation in the leaf stem and above ground biomass were similar between high soil water and moderately water stressed treatments which were higher than those under the severely water stressed treatment except 15n accumulation in the leaf table 2 analysis across the water treatments showed that n and 15n accumulation in the leaf stem and above ground biomass were highest in the high n treatment intermediate in the medium n treatment and lowest in the low n treatment n and 15n accumulation in the fruit was not affected by water or n treatments except 15n accumulation under the n treatments across the n treatments the moderately and severely water stressed treatments had similar specific leaf n content which was greater than that under the high soil water treatment nevertheless similar specific leaf n content was found among n treatments when analyzed across the water treatments 4 discussion accumulated evidence has demonstrated that fertigation can improve water and n use efficiency compared with conventional separate application of water and fertilizers to tomato plants locascio et al 1997 hebbar et al 2004 badr et al 2010 singandhupe et al 2003 yet the mechanisms underlying the improved wue under fertigation remain unclear therefore water and n impacts on leaf gas exchange plant water relations aba signaling and wue as well as leaf δ13c and δ18o were investigated in order to unravel how water and n modulate plant wue under fertigation the root system communicates changes in soil water availability to the shoot via xylem hydrostatic pressure and non hydraulic signals davies et al 1990 1994 tardieu and davies 1993 it was found that reduced soil water regimes decreased rwp lwp along with increasing of aba root and aba leaf figs 2 and 5 and they were dependent on soil water status as indicated by the significant positive linear relationship between soil water content rwp and lwp as well as the significant negative linear correlations between swc and aba root and aba leaf figs 3 and 6 with the decrease of rwp aba synthesis in root cells increases zhang and davies 1987 simonneau et al 1998 in good agreement with this here the decrease of root water status stimulated the production of aba in the roots and rwp was significantly negatively and linearly correlated with aba root fig 6 in the present study both plant water status and root to shoot aba signaling regulated leaf stomatal aperture the decreased lwp and high aba root and aba leaf significantly decreased the leaf area table 1 and gs fig 4 of plants this agrees with previous studies demonstrating that aba based root to shoot chemical signaling and hydraulic signal causes partial closure of stomata and leaf expansion limitation thereby curtailing the transpirational water loss davies et al 2002 voisin et al 2006 tardieu et al 2010 as a consequence the wuei was improved in the treatments under reduced soil water regimes fig 4 in the current study δ13c in the leaf was determined as a proxy of time integrated measurement of plant wue wuep increases in δ13c and wue due to partial stomatal closure under water stress have been observed farquhar and richards 1984 farquhar et al 1989 in the present study decreased soil water contents increased both wuep and leaf δ13c table 1 indicating that the moderate and severe water stress regulated stomatal closure of leaves during the treatment period which enhanced the wuep it is widely accepted that a higher leaf n content is usually associated with higher photosynthetic capacity which results in an increase in photosynthetic rate at a certain transpiration rate this may decrease ci ca and increase δ13c leading to an increase of wue cernusak et al 2007 cabrera bosquet et al 2009 across the n treatments the specific leaf n content was significantly higher in the reduced soil water treatments compared to that in the treatment with high soil water content table 2 moreover the significant positive linear relationship between leaf δ13c and specific leaf n content was also observed fig 7 therefore it seems that in the present study higher leaf δ13c as affected by the reduced soil water regimes could be due to either water deficit reduced gs or higher specific leaf n content enhanced photosynthetic capacity or both simultaneously across the water treatments leaf an was almost not affected by the n treatments during the treatment period fig 4 however it is noteworthy that leaf an was highest in the high n treatment intermediate in the medium n treatment and lowest in the low n treatment after 28dat though they were not statistically different during most of the treatment period fig 4 in addition across the water treatments the leaf area and wuep was significantly higher in the medium and high n treatments compared with the low n treatment table 1 thus both water and n nutrition could contribute to the regulation of plant wue as mentioned above the increase of leaf δ13c under reduced soil water regimes is driven by decreased gs or enhanced photosynthetic capacity or both in order to further distinguish these two factors and determine their role in regulating plant wue δ18o of leaf tissue was determined in the current study as a long term surrogate of gs during the experimental period as expected increasing gs resulted in less enrichment of δ18o in the leaf biomass under the high and moderately water stressed treatments table 1 since leaf δ18o is primarily affected by variations in gs but is not strongly influenced by changes in photosynthetic capacity leaf δ18o can be used to identify if differences in δ13c are primarily a result of changes in photosynthetic capacity or gs yakir and israeli 1995 farquhar et al 1998 scheidegger et al 2000 barbour 2007 flanagan and farquhar 2014 it has been shown that when the primary cause of variations in δ13c is gs there should be a positive correlation between δ18o and δ13c farquhar et al 1998 barbour and farquhar 2000 barbour et al 2000 scheidegger et al 2000 barbour et al 2002 grams et al 2007 sullivan and welker 2007 roden and farquhar 2012 alternatively the relationship between δ18o and δ13c should be non existent or demonstrate a negative correlation when variations in photosynthetic capacity are the primary cause of differences in δ13c farquhar et al 1998 in the present study a significant positive linear relationship between leaf δ18o and δ13c was observed fig 7 indicating that the significant increase in leaf δ13c under the reduced water regimes was caused primarily by reductions in gs compared with n nutrition therefore gs rather than n nutrition predominated regulation of plant wue under fertigation in addition to wue the fresh fruit yield was affected significantly by water treatments being that high and moderate water supply treatments produced significantly greater fresh fruit yield compared with the severely water stressed treatment table 1 similarly these two treatments also showed significantly higher n uptake as indicated by the significantly greater n and 15n accumulation table 2 analysis across the water treatments showed that n and 15n accumulation increased with the elevated n levels overall moderate soil water regimes e g 70 of soil water holding capacity with sufficient n quantity are recommended for fertigation in terms of achieving high fresh fruit yield wue and nutrient uptake 5 conclusions reduced soil water regimes caused partial closure of stomata via decreased plant water status and intensified root to shoot aba signaling resulting in improved wuei the gs rather than n nutrition primarily determined plant wue under fertigation under sufficient n supply wue can be improved by moderate watering without affecting fruit yield significantly therefore

pots were filled with 12 8 kg of air dried soil with a bulk density of 1 20 g dry soil cm 3 the bottoms of the pots were perforated with small holes which allow free drainage during the treatment period there was no leaching from the pots at the fifth leaf stage tomato lycopersicon esculentum l var qianxi seedlings were transplanted into the pots the soil water contents in the pots were monitored by a time domain reflectometer tdr minitrase soil moisture equipment corp ca usa with 17 cm probes installed in the middle area of the pots 2 2 fertigation treatments fertigation treatments comprised three levels of soil moisture and three n levels the soil moisture levels consisted of 90 70 and 50 of soil water holding capacity representing sufficiently moderately and severely water stressed conditions which were denoted as wh wm and wl respectively the n levels included low n nl 1 0 g n pot 1 medium n nm 2 0 g n pot 1 and high n nh 3 0 g n pot 1 the experiment was a complete randomized design with four replicates in each treatment and this yielded 36 pots in total for n fertigation 20 of the total applied n was used as basal fertilizer which was mixed thoroughly with the soil before filling the pots the remaining 80 of the total applied n was delivered with irrigation water by fertigation in ten equal splits every five days on 0 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 41 and 46 dat during the treatment period water was applied at 16 00 every day during the treatment period nh4no3 and 15nh4 15no3 with 99 excess 15n at 5 enrichment were used as n fertilizers for all the pots chemical fertilizers of p and k both at rate of 3 0 g pot 1 as kh2po4 and k2so4 were mixed into the soil to meet the macronutrient requirement for plant growth plant water use during the experimental period was calculated based on the amount of irrigation tdr soil moisture measurements and the soil volume concerned the water used for the irrigation was tap water with negligible concentrations of nutrients the tomato plants were well watered in the first 11 days after transplanting and then the fertigation treatments were initiated the fertigation treatment lasted 60 days 2 3 sampling

new york usa duncan s multiple range test was applied to assess the differences between treatments at a significance level of 5 regression analyses were used to determine the relationships between the measured parameters 3 results 3 1 soil water dynamics in the high soil water treatment soil water contents were close to 30 in the first 15dat thereafter remained on average around 26 fig 1 moreover the soil water contents were highest in the low n treatment intermediate in the medium n treatment and lowest in the high n treatment in the moderately water stressed treatment soil water contents were kept at about 21 similarly the soil water contents were highest in the low n treatment followed by the medium and high n treatments in the severely water stressed treatments soil water contents remained at about 15 during the whole treatment period for all the treatments 3 2 leaf and root water potential both lwp and rwp were significantly affected by water treatments fig 2 across the n treatments lwp and rwp increased with the increase of water levels across the water treatment lwp and rwp were similar among the n treatments the rwp was significantly positively and linearly correlated with swc and a significant positive linear relationship was found between lwp and rwp fig 3 3 3 leaf gas exchange and intrinsic water use efficiency across the n treatments an was similar among different soil water treatments except on two occasions fig 4 the gs was significantly decreased by the severely water stressed treatment compared with other two soil water treatments during most of the treatment period consequently the wuei was highest in the severely water stressed treatment intermediate in the moderately water stressed treatment and lowest in the high soil water treatment across the water treatments an was similar among the n treatments before 34dat thereafter an was highest in the high n treatment followed by the medium n treatment and lowest in the low n treatment though there were no statistical differences among n treatments on most occasions fig 4 the gs and wuei were not significantly affected by n treatments except wuei on 48dat 3 4 leaf and root tissue aba concentration the aba leaf and aba root were significantly affected by water treatments while they were not influenced by n treatments fig 5 across the n treatments the highest aba leaf and aba root were found under the severely water stressed treatment intermediate in the moderately water stressed treatment and lowest in the high soil water treatment fig 5 the swc was significantly negatively and linearly correlated with aba leaf and aba root respectively fig 6 a significant negative linear relationship was also observed between rwp and aba root there was a significant positive linear relationship between aba leaf and aba root 3 5 leaf area fresh fruit weight biomass production plant water use efficiency leaf δ13c and δ18o the leaf area above ground dry biomass plant water use and wuep were significantly affected by both water and n treatments table 1 across the n treatments leaf area above ground dry biomass and plant water use were highest in the high soil water treatment intermediate in the moderately water stressed treatment and lowest in the severely water stressed treatment the wuep in the moderately and severely water stressed treatments were significantly increased by 14 and 10 than that under the high soil water treatment at harvest high and moderately water stressed treatments produced 59 and 50 more fruit compared to the severely water stressed treatment across the water treatments leaf area above ground biomass and plant water use were highest in the high n treatment intermediate in the medium n treatment and lowest in the low n treatment table 1 in consequence the wuep followed the same pattern nonetheless the fresh fruit weight was not affected by n treatments when analyzed across the n treatments leaf δ13c was highest in the severely water stressed treatment followed by the moderately water stressed and high soil water treatment table 1 nevertheless leaf δ13c and leaf δ18o were similar among the n treatments across the n treatments leaf δ18o was highest in the severely water stressed treatment which was significantly higher than those under other two soil water treatments there were significant positive linear relationships between leaf δ13c and wuep as well as between leaf δ18o and wuep fig 7 however significant negative linear relationships were observed between leaf δ13c and gs and also between leaf δ18o and gs leaf δ13c was significantly positively and linearly correlated with leaf δ18o a significant positive linear relationship was found between leaf δ13c and specific leaf n content fig 7 while no relationship existed between leaf δ18o and specific leaf n content data not shown 3 6 plant n and 15n accumulation and specific leaf n content across the n treatments n and 15n accumulation in the leaf stem and above ground biomass were similar between high soil water and moderately water stressed treatments which were higher than those under the severely water stressed treatment except 15n accumulation in the leaf table 2 analysis across the water treatments showed that n and 15n accumulation in the leaf stem and above ground biomass were highest in the high n treatment intermediate in the medium n treatment and lowest in the low n treatment n and 15n accumulation in the fruit was not affected by water or n treatments except 15n accumulation under the n treatments across the n treatments the moderately and severely water stressed treatments had similar specific leaf n content which was greater than that under the high soil water treatment nevertheless similar specific leaf n content was found among n treatments when analyzed across the water treatments 4 discussion accumulated evidence has demonstrated that fertigation can improve water and n use efficiency compared with conventional separate application of water and fertilizers to tomato plants locascio et al 1997 hebbar et al 2004 badr et al 2010 singandhupe et al 2003 yet the mechanisms underlying the improved wue under fertigation remain unclear therefore water and n impacts on leaf gas exchange plant water relations aba signaling and wue as well as leaf δ13c and δ18o were investigated in order to unravel how water and n modulate plant wue under fertigation the root system communicates changes in soil water availability to the shoot via xylem hydrostatic pressure and non hydraulic signals davies et al 1990 1994 tardieu and davies 1993 it was found that reduced soil water regimes decreased rwp lwp along with increasing of aba root and aba leaf figs 2 and 5 and they were dependent on soil water status as indicated by the significant positive linear relationship between soil water content rwp and lwp as well as the significant negative linear correlations between swc and aba root and aba leaf figs 3 and 6 with the decrease of rwp aba synthesis in root cells increases zhang and davies 1987 simonneau et al 1998 in good agreement with this here the decrease of root water status stimulated the production of aba in the roots and rwp was significantly negatively and linearly correlated with aba root fig 6 in the present study both plant water status and root to shoot aba signaling regulated leaf stomatal aperture the decreased lwp and high aba root and aba leaf significantly decreased the leaf area table 1 and gs fig 4 of plants this agrees with previous studies demonstrating that aba based root to shoot chemical signaling and hydraulic signal causes partial closure of stomata and leaf expansion limitation thereby curtailing the transpirational water loss davies et al 2002 voisin et al 2006 tardieu et al 2010 as a consequence the wuei was improved in the treatments under reduced soil water regimes fig 4 in the current study δ13c in the leaf was determined as a proxy of time integrated measurement of plant wue wuep increases in δ13c and wue due to partial stomatal closure under water stress have been observed farquhar and richards 1984 farquhar et al 1989 in the present study decreased soil water contents increased both wuep and leaf δ13c table 1 indicating that the moderate and severe water stress regulated stomatal closure of leaves during the treatment period which enhanced the wuep it is widely accepted that a higher leaf n content is usually associated with higher photosynthetic capacity which results in an increase in photosynthetic rate at a certain transpiration rate this may decrease ci ca and increase δ13c leading to an increase of wue cernusak et al 2007 cabrera bosquet et al 2009 across the n treatments the specific leaf n content was significantly higher in the reduced soil water treatments compared to that in the treatment with high soil water content table 2 moreover the significant positive linear relationship between leaf δ13c and specific leaf n content was also observed fig 7 therefore it seems that in the present study higher leaf δ13c as affected by the reduced soil water regimes could be due to either water deficit reduced gs or higher specific leaf n content enhanced photosynthetic capacity or both simultaneously across the water treatments leaf an was almost not affected by the n treatments during the treatment period fig 4 however it is noteworthy that leaf an was highest in the high n treatment intermediate in the medium n treatment and lowest in the low n treatment after 28dat though they were not statistically different during most of the treatment period fig 4 in addition across the water treatments the leaf area and wuep was significantly higher in the medium and high n treatments compared with the low n treatment table 1 thus both water and n nutrition could contribute to the regulation of plant wue as mentioned above the increase of leaf δ13c under reduced soil water regimes is driven by decreased gs or enhanced photosynthetic capacity or both in order to further distinguish these two factors and determine their role in regulating plant wue δ18o of leaf tissue was determined in the current study as a long term surrogate of gs during the experimental period as expected increasing gs resulted in less enrichment of δ18o in the leaf biomass under the high and moderately water stressed treatments table 1 since leaf δ18o is primarily affected by variations in gs but is not strongly influenced by changes in photosynthetic capacity leaf δ18o can be used to identify if differences in δ13c are primarily a result of changes in photosynthetic capacity or gs yakir and israeli 1995 farquhar et al 1998 scheidegger et al 2000 barbour 2007 flanagan and farquhar 2014 it has been shown that when the primary cause of variations in δ13c is gs there should be a positive correlation between δ18o and δ13c farquhar et al 1998 barbour and farquhar 2000 barbour et al 2000 scheidegger et al 2000 barbour et al 2002 grams et al 2007 sullivan and welker 2007 roden and farquhar 2012 alternatively the relationship between δ18o and δ13c should be non existent or demonstrate a negative correlation when variations in photosynthetic capacity are the primary cause of differences in δ13c farquhar et al 1998 in the present study a significant positive linear relationship between leaf δ18o and δ13c was observed fig 7 indicating that the significant increase in leaf δ13c under the reduced water regimes was caused primarily by reductions in gs compared with n nutrition therefore gs rather than n nutrition predominated regulation of plant wue under fertigation in addition to wue the fresh fruit yield was affected significantly by water treatments being that high and moderate water supply treatments produced significantly greater fresh fruit yield compared with the severely water stressed treatment table 1 similarly these two treatments also showed significantly higher n uptake as indicated by the significantly greater n and 15n accumulation table 2 analysis across the water treatments showed that n and 15n accumulation increased with the elevated n levels overall moderate soil water regimes e g 70 of soil water holding capacity with sufficient n quantity are recommended for fertigation in terms of achieving high fresh fruit yield wue and nutrient uptake 5 conclusions reduced soil water regimes caused partial closure of stomata via decreased plant water status and intensified root to shoot aba signaling resulting in improved wuei the gs rather than n nutrition primarily determined plant wue under fertigation under sufficient n supply wue can be improved by moderate watering without affecting fruit yield significantly therefore with respect to application of fertigation technique water management is of more importance than quantity of fertilizers to achieve high yield wue and nutrient uptake acknowledgements financial

11343,treated wastewater may be reused for crop irrigation this contributes to recovery of water and nutrients and at the same time it helps to reduce pollution discharge to receiving water bodies despite these advantages of reuse of treated wastewater there is little experience of this in colombia and latin america in part this condition is explained by the lack of studies that show the potential of reuse comparing the traditional wastewater treatment options without reuse versus the options with reuse in this research the financial viability of reuse of treated wastewater for the irrigation of sugarcane crops in the upper cauca river basin in colombia was studied the study included three cases with different characteristics of wastewater bod5 between 164 and 233 mg l flows between 369 and 7600 l s rainfall levels between 1009 and 1459 mm year and irrigation requirements 0 34 and 1 08 l s ha for both scenarios the same baseline was considered cost benefit analysis cba was used to compare the options with and without reuse of treated wastewater cost of initial investment and o m were considered benefits were considered like avoided cost by use of fertilizers reduction of taxes for water use and discharges directly to water bodies and investment and o m costs of infrastructure for irrigation with groundwater the results of the cba and sensitivity analysis show that there are two key factors that influence financial viability of treated wastewater for sugarcane crop irrigation 1 the water balance and irrigation requirements and 2 costs corresponding to the management of wastewater for agricultural irrigation including additional treatment if it is required and the infrastructure to bring the treated wastewater to crops the financial viability of reuse in the study area was limited because the values of tax for wastewater discharges and water tariffs in colombia do not correspond to the values they should have keywords agricultural irrigation cost benefit analysis wastewater reuse water pollution control 3 ssa 1 introduction the reuse of treated wastewater for in agriculture for irrigation of crops puts demands on the municipal wastewater treatment technology to meet specific quality standards corresponding to the type of reuse brega filho and mancuso 2003 asano et al 2007 u s epa 2012 another main objective of wastewater treatment is to reduce the environmental impact on receiving water bodies via pollution reduction the reduction of this environmental impacts may be achieved when treated wastewater is reused in activities such as crop irrigation industrial processes cleansing or washing activities becerra et al 2015 capra and scicolone 2007 winpenny et al 2013 besides reusing water this approach will also promote the reuse and recovery of other resources such as nutrients and energy gijzen 2006 2001 additionally wastewater reuse being an additional source of water represents environmental benefits such as maintenance of critical water flows in sensitive ecosystems and recreational activities treated wastewater reuse is the second step the three step strategic approach 3 ssa it presents an integrated approach toward pollution and water quality management consisting of 1 minimisation prevention 2 treatment for reuse and 3 planned discharge with stimulation of self purification capacity of receiving waters gijzen 2006 galvis et al 2014 to ensure maximum impact and benefits the three steps should be implemented together preferably in a chronological order and possible interventions under each step should be fully exhausted before moving on to the next step galvis et al 2018 agriculture is the main user of freshwater accounting for over 70 of the total global freshwater withdrawal from rivers lakes and aquifers unesco ihp 2014 winpenny et al 2013 for countries with low incomes gross national income gni us 1005 or lower middle incomes us 1006 gni us 3955 this value corresponds to 82 amigos de la tierra américa latina y el caribe 2016 on the other hand wastewater is used in agriculture however in most cases effluent reuse in agriculture is done without any treatment and this poses direct health risks the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao reported that approximately 90 of total irrigation with wastewater is by untreated or partially treated wastewater winpenny et al 2013 millions of hectares are irrigated with raw wastewater in regions such as china mexico and india jiménez and asano 2008 in addition it is estimated that at least 20 million hectares are irrigated in 50 countries with polluted water jimenez and asano 2004 the main limitation of these reuse practices is that sewage is generally not sufficiently treated before reuse which introduces public health risks and environmental impacts the challenge is to develop adequate treatment systems that produce biologically safe effluents for public health but which preserve valuable components such as nutrients which may replace fertilizers the potential of reuse technologies has been considered primarily following the who and the united states environmental protection agency u s epa guidelines who 2006 u s epa 2012 who recommends natural or extensive systems which are more viable in developing countries tropical and subtropical in terms of operation and maintenance although protozoa and helminths are key parameters to be considered in the reuse applications because of their impact on health they are not considered in the regulations of some developed countries this is because in these countries the incidence of intestinal worm diseases is low or zero in contrast the technologies used in developed regions to treat wastewater for reuse have high removal efficiencies for other pathogens jimenez et al 2010 moscoso et al 2002 in a study of the financial viability of reuse the following types of benefits can be considered 1 savings on water use the use of treated effluents will reduce the use of freshwater resources for irrigation 2 savings for the reduced use of fertilizers effluent reuse improves soil fertility contributing organic matter and macronutrients n p k thus reducing the use of chemical fertilizers corcoman et al 2010 hespanhol 2003 winpenny et al 2013 3 reduction in sewer tariffs and tax for wastewater discharges directly to water bodies the reduction of effluent discharges contributes directly to the improvement of the water quality of the receiving water bodies bixio and wintgens 2006 4 converting chemical oxygen demand cod into energy wastewater treatment can be accomplished in aerobic or anaerobic systems but anaerobic systems appear to be more favourable because of energy recovery and cost effectiveness gijzen 2001 5 savings on infrastructure and its operation and maintenance o m for irrigation when groundwater is used with the wastewater reuse in agriculture groundwater is preserved since agricultural reuse will contribute a percentage of its recharge with superior quality characteristics moscoso et al 2002 in addition to agricultural reuse infrastructure costs and pumping groundwater may be avoided cruz 2015 this strategy therefore contributes to reducing freshwater use closing nutrient cycles reducing pollution discharges into receiving water bodies and reducing infrastructure and o m costs as such effluent reuse reduces the eutrophication of water bodies and costs in freshwater and the use of agrochemicals in farming candela et al 2007 despite the advantages mentioned above of reuse of treated wastewater there is little experience of this in colombia and latin america in colombia only raw wastewater is illegally used in agricultural irrigation this situation has been generated mainly by i inadequate management of domestic wastewater ii undervaluation of wastewater as an alternative source of irrigation iii ignorance of the conceptual aspects for the implementation of reuse and iv policies and regulations for the reuse management are not adequately articulated ministerio de agricultura y desarrollo rural 2011 ministerio de ambiente y desarrollo sustentable mads 2014 the assessment of the financial viability of reuse in agricultural irrigation can help stimulate reuse as a strategy for wastewater management this assessment can be done using the cost benefit analysis cba to compare the wastewater management considering reuse and without considering the reuse option this study considers the local context regarding the type of reuse the cost of raw water and local regulations in this research the financial viability of the reuse of treated wastewater in sugarcane crop irrigation in the upper cauca river basin in colombia was studied the research included three case studies with different characteristics of wastewater effluents flows from wastewater treatment rainfall levels and irrigation requirements for both scenarios with and without reuse the same baseline was considered and cba was used to compare the two scenarios a sensitivity analysis was performed for the irrigation requirements water use fee rate and tax for wastewater discharges to water bodies effluent charges in this study an incremental analysis of cba was employed boardman et al 2001 harrison 2010 it does not consider the common costs and benefits such as health benefits of the two scenarios that were compared 2 material and methods 2 1 study area upper cauca river basin the cauca is the second most important river of colombia and the main water source of the colombian southwest it has a longitude of 1204 km with a basin of 59 074 km² the study area is the upper cauca river basin fig 1 in particular the corresponding to stretch la balsa anacaro la balsa is 27 4 km 980 52 m above sea level m a s l and anacaro 416 1 km 895 56 m a s l the 0 0 km corresponds to salvajina dam this stretch of the cauca river has an average width of 105 m the depth can vary between 3 5 and 8 0 m the longitudinal profile of the river shows a concave shape with a hydraulic slope which oscillates between 1 5 10 4 m m and 7 0 10 4 m m ramirez et al 2010 the average annual rainfall varies between 938 mm central sector and 1882 mm southern sector there are two dry season periods december february and june september rainy days per year vary between 100 days central sector and 133 days northern sector sandoval and ramírez 2007 an important part of the sugarcane crops and the colombian sugar industry are located in the flat area along the upper cauca river basin in this flat area are the largest cities and therefore it is here where the largest amount of wastewater is generated in the mountain area there are coffee crops and associated industry the cauca river has been used for the last decades in fishing recreation power generation riverbed matter extraction domestic water supply irrigation and industry the salvajina reservoir began operations in 1985 and it is part of a project aimed at improving flood control water quality self purification capacity and power generation the reservoir has a capacity of 270 mw the reservoir operates with a minimum flow discharge of 60 m³ s and an average daily flow rate of 140 m³ s at the juanchito station sandoval et al 2007 the cauca river receives solid waste and wastewater discharges from industrial and domestic sectors which is contributing to the decline in water quality in the study area there are currently 3 9 million inhabitants and the cauca river receives in the la balsa anacaro stretch approximately 140 ton d of biochemical oxygen demand bod5 selecting the case studies this study area was selected considering 1 the existence of large sugarcane crops with potential to be irrigated with treated wastewater 2 scarce surface water for agricultural irrigation during sometimes of the year 3 location of cities with wastewater treatment systems existing and or projected 4 availability of information on the characteristics of the sugarcane crop due to the existence in the region of a sugarcane research centre cenicaña 5 hydro meteorological information availability through cenicaña and the regional environmental authorities 6 availability of information on wastewater management through the service provider companies and the regional environmental authorities three case studies of the upper cauca river basin were selected different sizes of wastewater treatment plants different water quality in the influent to wastewater treatment plant and different water demands for irrigation were considered table 1 the three cases are located on the cauca river bank at a distance of approximately 80 km for all the cases sugarcane was the crop for irrigation the average temperature was 24 c wastewater treatment with reuse the wastewater treatment alternatives considered in the three cases the national regulations for discharge of effluents to surface water bodies in 2013 colombia did not have a water quality regulation for the use of effluents of wastewater treatment plants who and fao guidelines were applied in this case the use of treated wastewater for irrigation of crops commercially processed before human consumption was considered for the effluent the limiting conditions for reuse were helminth eggs ho liter 1 0 l who 2006 faecal coliforms 103 100 ml bod 30 mg l and tss 30 mg l pescod 1992 additionally the treatment system requires compliance with agronomic quality guidelines ayers and wescot 1987 2 2 case studies case 1 sewered area of cali without reuse this case study was prepared based on information from emcali 2007a 2007b 2011 and universidad del valle and emcali 2008 the technology without reuse corresponded to advanced primary treatment existing system activated sludge contact stabilization projected the effluent from the existing treatment plant advanced primary treatment discharged to the cauca river 59 of the total contaminant load produced by cali city this value is explained because there is a part of the city of cali that is not connected to this wwtp the drainage area is located between 950 m a s l and 1100 m a s l this area has a sewerage system that collects approximately 70 of the municipal wastewater of cali city with reuse this case includes the existing advanced primary treatment a planned secondary treatment for agricultural reuse and the use of the effluent from the secondary treatment system for irrigation of sugarcane crops on the right bank of the cauca river of the 7600 l s that the wwtp receives 56 4274 l s is considered for treatment by the technological option without reuse which corresponds to the existing situation and expansion plans while 44 3326 l s is considered for treatment by the technological option with reuse preliminary and advanced primary treatments existing upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb facultative pond maturation pond as the existing infrastructure is on the left bank and the area to be irrigated is on the right bank of the river it will be necessary to build a viaduct the costs of this viaduct were obtained from universidad del valle and emcali 2008 case 2 expansion area of cali without reuse this case study was prepared based on information from emcali and consorcio ingesam hidroccidente 2009 emcali and hidroccidente 2006 and gaviano et al 2009 the technology without reuse two lines each of 425 l s corresponds to preliminary treatment high rate anaerobic lagoon peña 2002 facultative pond the expansion area 1358 ha is located to the south of cali in the alluvial plain of the pance and cauca rivers the slopes are between 0 and 2 degrees and with elevations between 955 m a s l and 1030 m a s l land use is extensive livestock farming and sugarcane cultivation as well as some developed areas with institutional recreational and rural housing with reuse technology with agricultural reuse was based on gaviano et al 2009 and consists of two treatment lines each for 425 l s the technology includes preliminary treatment uasb maturation pond two units in series case 3 buga city without reuse this case study was prepared based on information from different authors cvc and fal 1998 galvis et al 2007 universidad del valle and cvc 2007 the technology without reuse 369 l s corresponds to preliminary high rate anaerobic lagoon buga is located at 969 m a s l the urban area is 78 059 ha 95 and the rural area is 4595 ha 5 the predominant land use in the guadalajara river basin is extensive cattle ranching 43 followed by the cultivation of sugarcane 23 natural forest 24 stubble 3 and other crops 7 with reuse technology with agricultural reuse was based on galvis et al 2007 and consists of one treatment line of 369 l s the technology includes preliminary treatment uasb facultative pond 2 3 water balance and irrigation requirement for the three case studies a water balance based on precipitation and evapotranspiration of the sugarcane crop was carried out with this balance the amount of water required for irrigation per unit area was obtained then the effective precipitation was calculated using the method described by doorenbos and kassam 1979 for the evapotranspiration of sugarcane cultivation the methodology of cruz 2009 was used the precipitation and evaporation data were obtained from the guachalzambolo el paraíso and cenicaña stations precipitation and evaporation average monthly and multi year were estimated for all cases based on records corresponding to the period 2002 2012 2 4 available flow for irrigation and cropping area requirements in each case study the irrigation area was obtained from the relationship between the flow of waste water produced and the water requirement of the crop per unit area the location of the irrigation area with treated wastewater was based on knowledge of the study area and five criteria obtained by consulting local experts these experts were from irrigation system operators academics and the environmental authority of the region these criteria were 1 current land use 2 proximity of sugarcane crops to effluent from wastewater treatment plants 3 land slope in direction to the area where the treated wastewater will be used for irrigation 4 physical structures that limit the area of irrigation such as highways airports and other infrastructure 5 vulnerability to contamination of the aquifer system for the application of this last criterion the study developed by cvc 1999 on the cartography of intrinsic aquifer

savings in infrastructure initial investment and o m for irrigation using groundwater the use of treated wastewater avoids the use of groundwater thereby avoiding infrastructure and energy costs to estimate these benefits the irrigation flow and hydrogeological characteristics of each case were considered the production of the aquifer system was assessed which determined the number of wells to

supply and demand and irrigation requirement nine scenarios were calculated combining the irrigation requirements obtained for each case study 1 08 l s ha 0 64 l s ha y 0 34 l s ha water tariffs 81 scenarios were calculated each case study was combined with the three irrigation requirements and with different water tariffs surface water these variations were made in a range up to 300 times the value of the rate used in the region due to the difference between the deviating tariffs applied in colombia compared to tariffs used in other countries if we compare the water tariffs of some european countries england france italy spain with colombian water tariffs in terms of the minimum wage the result is that the tariffs of these countries are more than 300 times the value of the tariff in colombia tax for wastewater discharge directly to water bodies 75 scenarios were calculated each case study was combined with the three irrigation requirements and different taxes for wastewater discharge directly to water bodies these variations were performed in a range up to 150 times the baseline tax defined for the study area 3 results 3 1 water balances and irrigation requirements the results of the simplified balance fig 2 were adjusted by the efficiency of the irrigation system to obtain the actual requirement of the crop the potential irrigation period of time and irrigation requirement estimated for each case study were as follows case 1 334 days year 1 08 l s ha case 2 62 days year 0 34 l s ha case 3 212 days year 0 64 l s ha 3 2 potential area and irrigation flows based on these analyses and the irrigation requirements the following areas and irrigation flows were defined case 1 3080 ha and 3326 l s case 2 2530 ha and 880 l s and case 3 576 ha and 369 l s 3 3 cost benefit analysis cba the results are presented in tables 2 and 3 these results show the financial viability for case study 3 benefits costs b c 1 0 and the financial infeasibility for the case studies 1 and 2 b c 1 0 3 4 sensitivity analysis irrigation requirements fig 3 for each case the benefit cost ratio b c was calculated considering the three irrigation requirements ir 1 08 l s ha 0 64 l s ha and 0 34 l s ha this includes a relatively broad range of ir and these values are feasible to be presented in the study area for case 1 the values of b c were 0 60 0 45 and 0 27 respectively this showed that for case 1 the solution with reuse was not feasible for any of these requirements for case 2 the values of b c were 3 0 2 0 and 0 8 respectively and for case 3 the values of b c were 2 8 1 5 0 8 water tariffs and tax for wastewater discharge to water bodies fig 3 for each case the values of b c were calculated considering the three irrigation requirements ir 1 08 l s ha 0 64 l s ha and 0 34 l s ha and modifying the values of water tariffs and tax for wastewater discharges these variations were performed in a range up to 150 times the baseline tariff or tax defined for the study area the results for the conditions studied are explained below for case 1 only financial viability is achieved for ir 1 08 l s ha but only if the water tariffs increase by approximately 60 times the value of the baseline condition for cases 2 and 3 there is financial viability for ir 0 64 l s ha and ir 1 08 l s ha however for case 2 when ir 0 34 l s ha this viability is only obtained if tax for water discharges is increased by approximately 40 times the value of the baseline condition or water tariffs are increased by 50 times the value of the baseline condition for case 3 when ir 0 34 l s ha viability is only obtained if tax for water discharges is increased by approximately 50 times the value of the baseline condition or water tariffs are increased by 50 times the value of the baseline condition 4 discussion the results of the cba show that in the upper cauca river basin there are two key factors that determine the reuse potential of treated wastewater for sugarcane crop irrigation 1 the water balance and irrigation requirements and 2 costs corresponding to the management of wastewater for agricultural irrigation including additional treatment if it is required and the infrastructure to bring the treated wastewater to crops the first of these factors was a key factor for the infeasibility of case 2 the expansion area of cali city since the requirement for irrigation water was only there for 2 months year this time period is very limited to recover the required investments and o m costs in case 1 the sewered area of cali city the irrigation requirements were 11 months year for this case the limiting factors for reuse feasibility were investment and o m costs these costs included those associated with wastewater treatment costs and the infrastructure costs required to carry the treated wastewater from the left bank where the city of cali is located to the right bank where sugarcane crops are to be irrigated on the other hand due to the large flow and the specific characteristics of the irrigation area it was not possible to use the entire effluent of the wwtp in case 3 the cba was positive due to the combination of irrigation requirements 6 months year and the supply of treated wastewater then the required investments and o m costs can be recovered by the reuse benefits cases 1 and 2 correspond to the same sub region and between the two potential irrigation areas the distance does not exceed 25 km however the irrigation requirements are very different 1 08 l s ha and 0 34 l s ha respectively thus the feasibility of reuse is very dependent on the local conditions of the reuse project avellaneda et al 2004 moscoso et al 2002 the specific results of a site cannot be extrapolated to another site however the implemented methodology can be applied to other locations the results of sensitivity analysis reinforce the importance of irrigation requirements in the financial viability of reuse this shows the potential of reuse in areas with water shortage different experiences at the global level and documents of international organizations express this relationship as the main driver of the reuse of wastewater in agriculture corcoman et al 2010 jiménez and asano 2008 who 2006 winpenny et al 2013 for case 2 where precipitation limited the reuse of treated wastewater in the expansion area of cali the sensitivity analysis showed that with an increase in the irrigation requirements due to possible changes in rainfall quantity and temporality by phenomena such as climate variability or climate change reuse could become viable in this area sensitivity analysis shows that with the increase of the values the economic instruments water tariffs and tax for wastewater discharges to water bodies can favourably affect the cba results and with this the feasibility of reuse of treated wastewater in sugarcane crops in the upper cauca river basin however in order to achieve this viability the value of these economic instruments for the reference year 2013 must be increased by many times fig 3 the fact is however that compared to western countries water tariffs and tax for wastewater discharges in colombia are indeed extremely low and are likely to increase in the near future this is because the values used for avoided costs by taxes for water use and taxes for waste water discharges directly to water bodies were negligible since these unit costs are extremely low for example taxes for agricultural irrigation are about 300 times lower as a percentage of minimum wages compared with raw water prices in europe and the united states despite this sugarcane farmers report that irrigation represents between 30 and 60 of the total costs of cultivation cruz 2015 in the last decade colombia has been managing its entry into the oecd organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the oecd countries have seen an increase in their water tariffs for agricultural irrigation use with the aim of encouraging efficient water use however the fao recognizes that these type of strategies for other countries is the result of social political and economic factors which makes this kind of action more complex to encourage the reuse of wastewater in agriculture winpenny et al 2013 other factors to consider in the viability of reuse are associated with the regulations and control of irrigation with treated wastewater colombia is among the countries with the highest use of raw wastewater in agricultural irrigation jiménez and asano 2008 while irrigation with treated wastewater is virtually non existent universidad del valle and mads 2013 recently the government of colombia introduced new regulations for the use of treated wastewater ministerio de ambiente y desarrollo sustentable mads 2014 through which it aims to encourage reuse in both agricultural irrigation and other types of reuse in this research project the cost benefit analysis of the options with and without reuse was associated with the irrigation of sugarcane crops however other benefits may be included in the integrated wastewater management these benefits can include the recovery of nutrients and the use of energy gijzen and ikramullah 1999 gijzen and veenstra 2000 for example a scheme with awwt lagoons with duckweed aquaculture irrigation in agriculture el shafai 2004 includes additional costs and benefits which will affect the result of the reuse viability other benefits not considered here are the non market benefits wastewater reuse in agricultural irrigation can contribute to preserving at river s ecological status by reducing the amount of water taken directly from the river for irrigation while at the same time ensuring a continued water supply for the farmers alcon et al 2010 the wastewater reuse in agriculture increase resources where water scarcity is present its main benefits are related to the economy the environment and health helmer and hespanhol 1997 reuse is a second step of three steps strategic approach gijzen 2006 galvis et al 2018 where the benefits including pollution control of water bodies as the direct reduction of water discharge residual water sources toze 2006 5 conclusions feasibility of reuse of wastewater in agricultural irrigation can be assessed through the water balance and irrigation requirements they can be obtained with the following criteria 1 current land use 2 proximity of sugarcane crops to effluent from wastewater treatment plants 3 land slope in direction to the area where the treated wastewater will be used for irrigation 4 physical structures that limit the area of irrigation such as highways airports and other infrastructure 5 vulnerability to contamination of the aquifer system the reuse potential is complemented by the study of financial viability with cba of the incremental situation when comparing the options with and without reuse of treated wastewater the study of the financial viability of the reuse of treated wastewater for the irrigation of sugarcane crops from three case studies in the upper cauca river basin in colombia produced the following results financial viability b c 1 for case 3 buga city ir 0 64 l s ha and financial infeasibility b c 1 for cases 1 sewered area of cali ir 1 08 l s ha and 2 expansion area of cali ir 034 l s ha case 1 is not feasible even if its ir is increased up to 1 8 l s ha while case 2 would reach its feasibility condition with a slight increase in its ir thus for an ir 0 64 its financial viability is guaranteed with a b c 2 0 the financial viability of reuse in irrigation of sugarcane crops in the upper cauca river basin is limited because the values of tax for wastewater discharges and water tariffs extremely low thus for case 1 only the financial viability for ir 1 08 l s ha is achieved but only if the water tariff increases approximately 60 times the value of the reference condition for case 2 when ir 0 34 l s ha feasibility is only obtained if the tax for wastewater discharges increases approximately 40 times the value of the baseline condition or if the tariff increases 50 times the value of the baseline condition for case 3 when ir 0 34 l s financial viability is only obtained if the tax for wastewater discharges increases approximately 50 times the value of the baseline condition or water tariff increases by 50 times the value of the reference condition it should be further recognised that step 2 of 3 ssa must be managed as part of the integral of this strategy and cba might give different outcomes if the interventions under the three steps are combined acknowledgments this study was initiated as part of the research project switch sustainable urban water management improves tomorrow s city s health

11343,treated wastewater may be reused for crop irrigation this contributes to recovery of water and nutrients and at the same time it helps to reduce pollution discharge to receiving water bodies despite these advantages of reuse of treated wastewater there is little experience of this in colombia and latin america in part this condition is explained by the lack of studies that show the potential of reuse comparing the traditional wastewater treatment options without reuse versus the options with reuse in this research the financial viability of reuse of treated wastewater for the irrigation of sugarcane crops in the upper cauca river basin in colombia was studied the study included three cases with different characteristics of wastewater bod5 between 164 and 233 mg l flows between 369 and 7600 l s rainfall levels between 1009 and 1459 mm year and irrigation requirements 0 34 and 1 08 l s ha for both scenarios the same baseline was considered cost benefit analysis cba was used to compare the options with and without reuse of treated wastewater cost of initial investment and o m were considered benefits were considered like avoided cost by use of fertilizers reduction of taxes for water use and discharges directly to water bodies and investment and o m costs of infrastructure for irrigation with groundwater the results of the cba and sensitivity analysis show that there are two key factors that influence financial viability of treated wastewater for sugarcane crop irrigation 1 the water balance and irrigation requirements and 2 costs corresponding to the management of wastewater for agricultural irrigation including additional treatment if it is required and the infrastructure to bring the treated wastewater to crops the financial viability of reuse in the study area was limited because the values of tax for wastewater discharges and water tariffs in colombia do not correspond to the values they should have keywords agricultural irrigation cost benefit analysis wastewater reuse water pollution control 3 ssa 1 introduction the reuse of treated wastewater for in agriculture for irrigation of crops puts demands on the municipal wastewater treatment technology to meet specific quality standards corresponding to the type of reuse brega filho and mancuso 2003 asano et al 2007 u s epa 2012 another main objective of wastewater treatment is to reduce the environmental impact on receiving water bodies via pollution reduction the reduction of this environmental impacts may be achieved when treated wastewater is reused in activities such as crop irrigation industrial processes cleansing or washing activities becerra et al 2015 capra and scicolone 2007 winpenny et al 2013 besides reusing water this approach will also promote the reuse and recovery of other resources such as nutrients and energy gijzen 2006 2001 additionally wastewater reuse being an additional source of water represents environmental benefits such as maintenance of critical water flows in sensitive ecosystems and recreational activities treated wastewater reuse is the second step the three step strategic approach 3 ssa it presents an integrated approach toward pollution and water quality management consisting of 1 minimisation prevention 2 treatment for reuse and 3 planned discharge with stimulation of self purification capacity of receiving waters gijzen 2006 galvis et al 2014 to ensure maximum impact and benefits the three steps should be implemented together preferably in a chronological order and possible interventions under each step should be fully exhausted before moving on to the next step galvis et al 2018 agriculture is the main user of freshwater accounting for over 70 of the total global freshwater withdrawal from rivers lakes and aquifers unesco ihp 2014 winpenny et al 2013 for countries with low incomes gross national income gni us 1005 or lower middle incomes us 1006 gni us 3955 this value corresponds to 82 amigos de la tierra américa latina y el caribe 2016 on the other hand wastewater is used in agriculture however in most cases effluent reuse in agriculture is done without any treatment and this poses direct health risks the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao reported that approximately 90 of total irrigation with wastewater is by untreated or partially treated wastewater winpenny et al 2013 millions of hectares are irrigated with raw wastewater in regions such as china mexico and india jiménez and asano 2008 in addition it is estimated that at least 20 million hectares are irrigated in 50 countries with polluted water jimenez and asano 2004 the main limitation of these reuse practices is that sewage is generally not sufficiently treated before reuse which introduces public health risks and environmental impacts the challenge is to develop adequate treatment systems that produce biologically safe effluents for public health but which preserve valuable components such as nutrients which may replace fertilizers the potential of reuse technologies has been considered primarily following the who and the united states environmental protection agency u s epa guidelines who 2006 u s epa 2012 who recommends natural or extensive systems which are more viable in developing countries tropical and subtropical in terms of operation and maintenance although protozoa and helminths are key parameters to be considered in the reuse applications because of their impact on health they are not considered in the regulations of some developed countries this is because in these countries the incidence of intestinal worm diseases is low or zero in contrast the technologies used in developed regions to treat wastewater for reuse have high removal efficiencies for other pathogens jimenez et al 2010 moscoso et al 2002 in a study of the financial viability of reuse the following types of benefits can be considered 1 savings on water use the use of treated effluents will reduce the use of freshwater resources for irrigation 2 savings for the reduced use of fertilizers effluent reuse improves soil fertility contributing organic matter and macronutrients n p k thus reducing the use of chemical fertilizers corcoman et al 2010 hespanhol 2003 winpenny et al 2013 3 reduction in sewer tariffs and tax for wastewater discharges directly to water bodies the reduction of effluent discharges contributes directly to the improvement of the water quality of the receiving water bodies bixio and wintgens 2006 4 converting chemical oxygen demand cod into energy wastewater treatment can be accomplished in aerobic or anaerobic systems but anaerobic systems appear to be more favourable because of energy recovery and cost effectiveness gijzen 2001 5 savings on infrastructure and its operation and maintenance o m for irrigation when groundwater is used with the wastewater reuse in agriculture groundwater is preserved since agricultural reuse will contribute a percentage of its recharge with superior quality characteristics moscoso et al 2002 in addition to agricultural reuse infrastructure costs and pumping groundwater may be avoided cruz 2015 this strategy therefore contributes to reducing freshwater use closing nutrient cycles reducing pollution discharges into receiving water bodies and reducing infrastructure and o m costs as such effluent reuse reduces the eutrophication of water bodies and costs in freshwater and the use of agrochemicals in farming candela et al 2007 despite the advantages mentioned above of reuse of treated wastewater there is little experience of this in colombia and latin america in colombia only raw wastewater is illegally used in agricultural irrigation this situation has been generated mainly by i inadequate management of domestic wastewater ii undervaluation of wastewater as an alternative source of irrigation iii ignorance of the conceptual aspects for the implementation of reuse and iv policies and regulations for the reuse management are not adequately articulated ministerio de agricultura y desarrollo rural 2011 ministerio de ambiente y desarrollo sustentable mads 2014 the assessment of the financial viability of reuse in agricultural irrigation can help stimulate reuse as a strategy for wastewater management this assessment can be done using the cost benefit analysis cba to compare the wastewater management considering reuse and without considering the reuse option this study considers the local context regarding the type of reuse the cost of raw water and local regulations in this research the financial viability of the reuse of treated wastewater in sugarcane crop irrigation in the upper cauca river basin in colombia was studied the research included three case studies with different characteristics of wastewater effluents flows from wastewater treatment rainfall levels and irrigation requirements for both scenarios with and without reuse the same baseline was considered and cba was used to compare the two scenarios a sensitivity analysis was performed for the irrigation requirements water use fee rate and tax for wastewater discharges to water bodies effluent charges in this study an incremental analysis of cba was employed boardman et al 2001 harrison 2010 it does not consider the common costs and benefits such as health benefits of the two scenarios that were compared 2 material and methods 2 1 study area upper cauca river basin the cauca is the second most important river of colombia and the main water source of the colombian southwest it has a longitude of 1204 km with a basin of 59 074 km² the study area is the upper cauca river basin fig 1 in particular the corresponding to stretch la balsa anacaro la balsa is 27 4 km 980 52 m above sea level m a s l and anacaro 416 1 km 895 56 m a s l the 0 0 km corresponds to salvajina dam this stretch of the cauca river has an average width of 105 m the depth can vary between 3 5 and 8 0 m the longitudinal profile of the river shows a concave shape with a hydraulic slope which oscillates between 1 5 10 4 m m and 7 0 10 4 m m ramirez et al 2010 the average annual rainfall varies between 938 mm central sector and 1882 mm southern sector there are two dry season periods december february and june september rainy days per year vary between 100 days central sector and 133 days northern sector sandoval and ramírez 2007 an important part of the sugarcane crops and the colombian sugar industry are located in the flat area along the upper cauca river basin in this flat area are the largest cities and therefore it is here where the largest amount of wastewater is generated in the mountain area there are coffee crops and associated industry the cauca river has been used for the last decades in fishing recreation power generation riverbed matter extraction domestic water supply irrigation and industry the salvajina reservoir began operations in 1985 and it is part of a project aimed at improving flood control water quality self purification capacity and power generation the reservoir has a capacity of 270 mw the reservoir operates with a minimum flow discharge of 60 m³ s and an average daily flow rate of 140 m³ s at the juanchito station sandoval et al 2007 the cauca river receives solid waste and wastewater discharges from industrial and domestic sectors which is contributing to the decline in water quality in the study area there are currently 3 9 million inhabitants and the cauca river receives in the la balsa anacaro stretch approximately 140 ton d of biochemical oxygen demand bod5 selecting the case studies this study area was selected considering 1 the existence of large sugarcane crops with potential to be irrigated with treated wastewater 2 scarce surface water for agricultural irrigation during sometimes of the year 3 location of cities with wastewater treatment systems existing and or projected 4 availability of information on the characteristics of the sugarcane crop due to the existence in the region of a sugarcane research centre cenicaña 5 hydro meteorological information availability through cenicaña and the regional environmental authorities 6 availability of information on wastewater management through the service provider companies and the regional environmental authorities three case studies of the upper cauca river basin were selected different sizes of wastewater treatment plants different water quality in the influent to wastewater treatment plant and different water demands for irrigation were considered table 1 the three cases are located on the cauca river bank at a distance of approximately 80 km for all the cases sugarcane was the crop for irrigation the average temperature was 24 c wastewater treatment with reuse the wastewater treatment alternatives considered in the three cases the national regulations for discharge of effluents to surface water bodies in 2013 colombia did not have a water quality regulation for the use of effluents of wastewater treatment plants who and fao guidelines were applied in this case the use of treated wastewater for irrigation of crops commercially processed before human consumption was considered for the effluent the limiting conditions for reuse were helminth eggs ho liter 1 0 l who 2006 faecal coliforms 103 100 ml bod 30 mg l and tss 30 mg l pescod 1992 additionally the treatment system requires compliance with agronomic quality guidelines ayers and wescot 1987 2 2 case studies case 1 sewered area of cali without reuse this case study was prepared based on information from emcali 2007a 2007b 2011 and universidad del valle and emcali 2008 the technology without reuse corresponded to advanced primary treatment existing system activated sludge contact stabilization projected the effluent from the existing treatment plant advanced primary treatment discharged to the cauca river 59 of the total contaminant load produced by cali city this value is explained because there is a part of the city of cali that is not connected to this wwtp the drainage area is located between 950 m a s l and 1100 m a s l this area has a sewerage system that collects approximately 70 of the municipal wastewater of cali city with reuse this case includes the existing advanced primary treatment a planned secondary treatment for agricultural reuse and the use of the effluent from the secondary treatment system for irrigation of sugarcane crops on the right bank of the cauca river of the 7600 l s that the wwtp receives 56 4274 l s is considered for treatment by the technological option without reuse which corresponds to the existing situation and expansion plans while 44 3326 l s is considered for treatment by the technological option with reuse preliminary and advanced primary treatments existing upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb facultative pond maturation pond as the existing infrastructure is on the left bank and the area to be irrigated is on the right bank of the river it will be necessary to build a viaduct the costs of this viaduct were obtained from universidad del valle and emcali 2008 case 2 expansion area of cali without reuse this case study was prepared based on information from emcali and consorcio ingesam hidroccidente 2009 emcali and hidroccidente 2006 and gaviano et al 2009 the technology without reuse two lines each of 425 l s corresponds to preliminary treatment high rate anaerobic lagoon peña 2002 facultative pond the expansion area 1358 ha is located to the south of cali in the alluvial plain of the pance and cauca rivers the slopes are between 0 and 2 degrees and with elevations between 955 m a s l and 1030 m a s l land use is extensive livestock farming and sugarcane cultivation as well as some developed areas with institutional recreational and rural housing with reuse technology with agricultural reuse was based on gaviano et al

followed by the cultivation of sugarcane 23 natural forest 24 stubble 3 and other crops 7 with reuse technology with agricultural reuse was based on galvis et al 2007 and consists of one treatment line of 369 l s the technology includes preliminary treatment uasb facultative pond 2 3 water balance and irrigation requirement for the three case studies a water balance based on precipitation and evapotranspiration of the sugarcane crop was carried out with this balance the amount of water required for irrigation per unit area was obtained then the effective precipitation was calculated using the method described by doorenbos and kassam 1979 for the evapotranspiration of sugarcane cultivation the methodology of cruz 2009 was used the precipitation and evaporation data were obtained from the guachalzambolo el paraíso and cenicaña stations precipitation and evaporation average monthly and multi year were estimated for all cases based on records corresponding to the period 2002 2012 2 4 available flow for irrigation and cropping area requirements in each case study the irrigation area was obtained from the relationship between the flow of waste water produced and the water requirement of the crop per unit area the location of the irrigation area with treated wastewater was based on knowledge of the study area and five criteria obtained by consulting local experts these experts were from irrigation system operators academics and the environmental authority of the region these criteria were 1 current land use 2 proximity of sugarcane crops to effluent from wastewater treatment plants 3 land slope in direction to the area where the treated wastewater will be used for irrigation 4 physical structures that limit the area of irrigation such as highways airports and other infrastructure 5 vulnerability to contamination of the aquifer system for the application of this last criterion the study developed by cvc 1999 on the cartography of intrinsic aquifer

savings in infrastructure initial investment and o m for irrigation using groundwater the use of treated wastewater avoids the use of groundwater thereby avoiding infrastructure and energy costs to estimate these benefits the irrigation flow and hydrogeological characteristics of each case were considered the production of the aquifer system was assessed which determined the number of wells to be constructed for this water demand the initial investment costs and o m of wells for each area were obtained from colpozos 2010 baseline conditions correspond to year 2013 for cases 1 and 3 major infrastructure investments were proposed to be made in year 1 for case 2 where two wwtps were considered there is a first investment in year 1 2013 and a second investment in year 10 the costs and benefits associated with o m tax for wastewater discharges pollution charges and water tariffs were considered each year from year 2 2014 until year 20 2033 costs were obtained in colombian pesos and a conversion rate of 1 euro 2500 colombian pesos was used based on information specific to sugarcane crops in the valle del cauca ministerio de agricultura y desarrollo rural 2010 the following prices for fertilizers were used npk 0 53 euros kg and urea 0 58 euros kg for wastewater discharge tax the following values were used bod 0 0492 euros kg and tss 0 0211 euros kg for the tariffs for freshwater use the following values were used case 1 wwtp 0 000823 euros m3 case 2 expansion area of cali 0 00032 euros m3 case 3 buga city 0 000485 euros m3 2 6 sensitivity analysis water balance supply and demand and irrigation requirement nine scenarios were calculated combining the irrigation requirements obtained for each case study 1 08 l s ha 0 64 l s ha y 0 34 l s ha water tariffs 81 scenarios were calculated each case study was combined with the three irrigation requirements and with different water tariffs surface water these variations were made in a range up to 300 times the value of the rate used in the region due to the difference between the deviating tariffs applied in colombia compared to tariffs used in other countries if we compare the water tariffs of some european countries england france italy spain with colombian water tariffs in terms of the minimum wage the result is that the tariffs of these countries are more than 300 times the value of the tariff in colombia tax for wastewater discharge directly to water bodies 75 scenarios were calculated each case study was combined with the three irrigation requirements and different taxes for wastewater discharge directly to water bodies these variations were performed in a range up to 150 times the baseline tax defined for the study area 3 results 3 1 water balances and irrigation requirements the results of the simplified balance fig 2 were adjusted by the efficiency of the irrigation system to obtain the actual requirement of the crop the potential irrigation period of time and irrigation requirement estimated for each case study were as follows case 1 334 days year 1 08 l s ha case 2 62 days year 0 34 l s ha case 3 212 days year 0 64 l s ha 3 2 potential area and irrigation flows based on these analyses and the irrigation requirements the following areas and irrigation flows were defined case 1 3080 ha and 3326 l s case 2 2530 ha and 880 l s and case 3 576 ha and 369 l s 3 3 cost benefit analysis cba the results are presented in tables 2 and 3 these results show the financial viability for case study 3 benefits costs b c 1 0 and the financial infeasibility for the case studies 1 and 2 b c 1 0 3 4 sensitivity analysis irrigation requirements fig 3 for each case the benefit cost ratio b c was calculated considering the three irrigation requirements ir 1 08 l s ha 0 64 l s ha and 0 34 l s ha this includes a relatively broad range of ir and these values are feasible to be presented in the study area for case 1 the values of b c were 0 60 0 45 and 0 27 respectively this showed that for case 1 the solution with reuse was not feasible for any of these requirements for case 2 the values of b c were 3 0 2 0 and 0 8 respectively and for case 3 the values of b c were 2 8 1 5 0 8 water tariffs and tax for wastewater discharge to water bodies fig 3 for each case the values of b c were calculated considering the three irrigation requirements ir 1 08 l s ha 0 64 l s ha and 0 34 l s ha and modifying the values of water tariffs and tax for wastewater discharges these variations were performed in a range up to 150 times the baseline tariff or tax defined for the study area the results for the conditions studied are explained below for case 1 only financial viability is achieved for ir 1 08 l s ha but only if the water tariffs increase by approximately 60 times the value of the baseline condition for cases 2 and 3 there is financial viability for ir 0 64 l s ha and ir 1 08 l s ha however for case 2 when ir 0 34 l s ha this viability is only obtained if tax for water discharges is increased by approximately 40 times the value of the baseline condition or water tariffs are increased by 50 times the value of the baseline condition for case 3 when ir 0 34 l s ha viability is only obtained if tax for water discharges is increased by approximately 50 times the value of the baseline condition or water tariffs are increased by 50 times the value of the baseline condition 4 discussion the results of the cba show that in the upper cauca river basin there are two key factors that determine the reuse potential of treated wastewater for sugarcane crop irrigation 1 the water balance and irrigation requirements and 2 costs corresponding to the management of wastewater for agricultural irrigation including additional treatment if it is required and the infrastructure to bring the treated wastewater to crops the first of these factors was a key factor for the infeasibility of case 2 the expansion area of cali city since the requirement for irrigation water was only there for 2 months year this time period is very limited to recover the required investments and o m costs in case 1 the sewered area of cali city the irrigation requirements were 11 months year for this case the limiting factors for reuse feasibility were investment and o m costs these costs included those associated with wastewater treatment costs and the infrastructure costs required to carry the treated wastewater from the left bank where the city of cali is located to the right bank where sugarcane crops are to be irrigated on the other hand due to the large flow and the specific characteristics of the irrigation area it was not possible to use the entire effluent of the wwtp in case 3 the cba was positive due to the combination of irrigation requirements 6 months year and the supply of treated wastewater then the required investments and o m costs can be recovered by the reuse benefits cases 1 and 2 correspond to the same sub region and between the two potential irrigation areas the distance does not exceed 25 km however the irrigation requirements are very different 1 08 l s ha and 0 34 l s ha respectively thus the feasibility of reuse is very dependent on the local conditions of the reuse project avellaneda et al 2004 moscoso et al 2002 the specific results of a site cannot be extrapolated to another site however the implemented methodology can be applied to other locations the results of sensitivity analysis reinforce the importance of irrigation requirements in the financial viability of reuse this shows the potential of reuse in areas with water shortage different experiences at the global level and documents of international organizations express this relationship as the main driver of the reuse of wastewater in agriculture corcoman et al 2010 jiménez and asano 2008 who 2006 winpenny et al 2013 for case 2 where precipitation limited the reuse of treated wastewater in the expansion area of cali the sensitivity analysis showed that with an increase in the irrigation requirements due to possible changes in rainfall quantity and temporality by phenomena such as climate variability or climate change reuse could become viable in this area sensitivity analysis shows that with the increase of the values the economic instruments water tariffs and tax for wastewater discharges to water bodies can favourably affect the cba results and with this the feasibility of reuse of treated wastewater in sugarcane crops in the upper cauca river basin however in order to achieve this viability the value of these economic instruments for the reference year 2013 must be increased by many times fig 3 the fact is however that compared to western countries water tariffs and tax for wastewater discharges in colombia are indeed extremely low and are likely to increase in the near future this is because the values used for avoided costs by taxes for water use and taxes for waste water discharges directly to water bodies were negligible since these unit costs are extremely low for example taxes for agricultural irrigation are about 300 times lower as a percentage of minimum wages compared with raw water prices in europe and the united states despite this sugarcane farmers report that irrigation represents between 30 and 60 of the total costs of cultivation cruz 2015 in the last decade colombia has been managing its entry into the oecd organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the oecd countries have seen an increase in their water tariffs for agricultural irrigation use with the aim of encouraging efficient water use however the fao recognizes that these type of strategies for other countries is the result of social political and economic factors which makes this kind of action more complex to encourage the reuse of wastewater in agriculture winpenny et al 2013 other factors to consider in the viability of reuse are associated with the regulations and control of irrigation with treated wastewater colombia is among the countries with the highest use of raw wastewater in agricultural irrigation jiménez and asano 2008 while irrigation with treated wastewater is virtually non existent universidad del valle and mads 2013 recently the government of colombia introduced new regulations for the use of treated wastewater ministerio de ambiente y desarrollo sustentable mads 2014 through which it aims to encourage reuse in both agricultural irrigation and other types of reuse in this research project the cost benefit analysis of the options with and without reuse was associated with the irrigation of sugarcane crops however other benefits may be included in the integrated wastewater management these benefits can include the recovery of nutrients and the use of energy gijzen and ikramullah 1999 gijzen and veenstra 2000 for example a scheme with awwt lagoons with duckweed aquaculture irrigation in agriculture el shafai 2004 includes additional costs and benefits which will affect the result of the reuse viability other benefits not considered here are the non market benefits wastewater reuse in agricultural irrigation can contribute to preserving at river s ecological status by reducing the amount of water taken directly from the river for irrigation while at the same time ensuring a continued water supply for the farmers alcon et al 2010 the wastewater reuse in agriculture increase resources where water scarcity is present its main benefits are related to the economy the environment and health helmer and hespanhol 1997 reuse is a second step of three steps strategic approach gijzen 2006 galvis et al 2018 where the benefits including pollution control of water bodies as the direct reduction of water discharge residual water sources toze 2006 5 conclusions feasibility of reuse of wastewater in agricultural irrigation can be assessed through the water balance and irrigation requirements they can be obtained with the following criteria 1 current land use 2 proximity of sugarcane crops to effluent from wastewater treatment plants 3 land slope in direction to the area where the treated wastewater will be used for irrigation 4 physical structures that limit the area of irrigation such as highways airports and other infrastructure 5 vulnerability to contamination of the aquifer system the reuse potential is complemented by the study of financial viability with cba of the incremental situation when comparing the options with and without reuse of treated wastewater the study of the financial viability of the reuse of treated wastewater for the irrigation of sugarcane crops from three case studies in the upper cauca river basin in colombia produced the following results financial viability b c 1 for case 3 buga city ir 0 64 l s ha and financial infeasibility b c 1 for cases 1 sewered area of cali ir 1 08 l s ha and 2 expansion area of cali ir 034 l s ha case 1 is not feasible even if its ir is increased up to 1 8 l s ha while case 2 would reach its feasibility condition with a slight increase in its ir thus for an ir 0 64 its financial viability is guaranteed with a b c 2 0 the financial viability of reuse in irrigation of sugarcane crops in the upper cauca river basin is limited because the values of tax for wastewater discharges and water tariffs extremely low thus for case 1 only the financial viability for ir 1 08 l s ha is achieved but only if the water tariff increases approximately 60 times the value of the reference condition for case 2 when ir 0 34 l s ha feasibility is only obtained if the tax for wastewater discharges increases approximately 40 times the value of the baseline condition or if the tariff increases 50 times the value of the baseline condition for case 3 when ir 0 34 l s financial viability is only obtained if the tax for wastewater discharges increases approximately 50 times the value of the baseline condition or water tariff increases by 50 times the value of the reference condition it should be further recognised that step 2 of 3 ssa must be managed as part of the integral of this strategy and cba might give different outcomes if the interventions under the three steps are combined acknowledgments this study was initiated as part of the research project switch sustainable urban water management improves tomorrow s city s health

11344,the major challenge affecting rural resource poor households rrphs in south africa is deficiencies in micronutrients iron and zinc and vitamin a traditional leafy vegetables tlvs are dense in iron zinc and β carotene concentrations therefore they are deemed suitable to improve the dietary diversity of rrphs the main objective of this study was to assess the effect of irrigation regimes on nutritional water productivity nwp of selected leafy vegetables amaranthus cruentus amaranth and cleome gynandra spider flower both tlvs and beta vulgaris swiss chard experiments were conducted under a rain shelter at the arc vop pretoria south africa during two consecutive seasons 2013 14 and 2014 15 leafy vegetables were subjected to three irrigation regimes well watered i30 moderate water stress i50 and severe water stress i80 data collected aboveground biomass agb aboveground edible biomass ageb actual evapotranspiration and nutrient concentrations iron zinc and β carotene were used to calculate nwp of leafy vegetables swiss chard exhibited a higher portion of ageb compared to tlvs due to its larger harvest index 0 57 0 92 selected tlvs displayed superiority in terms of nutrient richness compared to swiss chard under i50 results indicated that tlvs could provide more than the daily recommended nutrient intake drni for vitamin a to all age groups for iron spider flower could supply more than the drni to infants between 1 and 3 years of age whereas for zinc it could supply approximately 11 to this age group however higher micronutrient and β carotene concentrations did not translate to superior nutritional yield ny swiss chard showed higher fe ny and zn ny whereas tlvs were rich in β carotene ny similarly swiss chard demonstrated the highest fe nwp 1090 mg m 3 and zn nwp 125 mg m 3 whereas amaranth was larger in β carotene nwp 1799 mg m 3 under moderate water stress these results show that there may be an opportunity to improve nwp under drought conditions there is a need for future studies that will assess nwp for a wider range of leafy vegetables these studies should be conducted in different locations and explore the effect of management factors fertiliser water stress planting density and planting date and soil type on nwp of micronutrients and β carotene keywords deficit irrigation hidden hunger african leafy vegetables micronutrient deficiency irrigation regimes indigenous leafy vegetables 1 introduction in south africa nearly fourteen million rural resource poor households rrphs have diets deficient in essential micronutrients iron and zinc and vitamin a oelofse and van averbeke 2012 thirty four per cent of rrphs rely on agriculture therefore this remains the main vehicle that can address food and nutrition insecurity mabhaudhi et al 2016a govender et al 2017 defined food and nutrition insecurity as the inability to access adequate quantities of nutritious foods required for optimal growth and development hendriks et al 2016 found that in south africa one in four rrphs experienced food and nutrition insecurity which became severe in winter months may october due to lack of water for irrigation a typical diet of many rrphs consisted of maize meal with sugar and where income permitted rrphs consumed a relish of onions and tomato or cabbage once per day another study conducted by wenhold et al 2012 found that 50 of rrphs consumed a diet including fewer than four food groups per day this highlights that food and nutrition insecurity is persistent in rural areas of south africa over the past decades some progress has been made in addressing issues around food insecurity however most attention has been given to promote mainstream crops zea mays maize oryza sativa rice triticum aestivum wheat solanum tuberosum irish potato arachis hypogaea groundnut and phaseolus vulgaris beans and selected vegetables brassica oleracea cabbage daucus carota carrot allium cepa onion lactuca sativa lettuce and spinacea oleracea spinach to address food and nutrition security underwater scarcity chibarabada et al 2017 mabhaudhi et al 2016a b minimal attention has been given towards addressing nutritional goals especially for rrphs we recognize the crucial role played by mainstream crops in providing proteins and calories however mainstream crops are deficient in essential micronutrients iron and zinc and β carotene deficiency of micronutrients and vitamin a in human diets causes hidden hunger a condition whose effects may not be immediately apparent but may have severe consequences by inducing stunted growth delayed cognitive development and reduced immunity mabhaudhi et al 2016a to broaden the food basket of rural poor south africans the water research commission has directed considerable funding towards research on traditional leafy vegetables tlvs i e vegetables that have adapted in a certain geographic location where they have become part of local culture and indigenised mabhaudhi et al 2017 popularity of tlvs is attributed to their high nutrient concentration iron zinc and β carotene their short crop cycle the low use of agronomic inputs water and fertiliser their drought tolerance and their abundance available for rrphs in the wild or next to cereal crops as weeds chibarabada et al 2017 chivenge et al 2015 maseko et al 2017 mavengahama et al 2013 nyathi et al 2016 oelofse and van averbeke 2012 it is important to note tlvs cannot replace mainstream crops in the diets of rrphs however tlvs can contribute significantly to dietary diversity and agro biodiversity chibarabada et al 2017 chibarabada et al 2017 noted that there is a gap between water use in agriculture crop production and nutritional requirements from research conducted by nutritionists on nutrient concentrations of crops daily consumption targets to meet human nutritional requirements can be derived uusiku et al 2010 van jaarsveld et al 2014 schönfeldt and pretorius 2011 agronomic and irrigation research tends to focus on producing as much crop with minimum water as possible i e improving crop water productivity chibarabada et al 2017 mabhaudhi et al 2016a b nhamo et al 2016 renault and wallender 2000 these three aspects water use in agriculture crop production and nutritional requirements cannot be assessed in isolation because they interlink mabhaudhi et al 2016b mabhaudhi et al 2016a averred that to meaningfully address food and nutrition security there is a need for an index that combines aspects of water use crop production human nutrition and food access they proposed the nutritional water productivity index nwp nwp yield or biomass actual evapotranspiration nutritional content of a product which was coined by renault and wallender 2000 we fully support the suggestion of using the nwp index for assessing the relationship between water use food production and nutrition however this index can only be optimised for rrphs if suitable crops that are highly nutritious rich in iron zinc and β carotene are available to rrphs and data on their production requirements consumption and nutritional values are available to be incorporated in nwp assessments information on nwp of tlvs is minimal a scoping study conducted by wenhold et al 2012 benchmarked nwp of selected vegetables amaranth amaranthus cruentus chinese cabbage brassica rapa spider flower cleome gynandra swiss chard beta vulgaris cowpea vigna unguiculata jute corchorus spp bitter watermelon citrullus lanatus blackjack bidens pilosa pumpkin leaves cucurbita maxima sweet potato leaves ipomoea batatas and kale brassica oleracea var sabellica using datasets yield or biomass evapotranspiration and nutrient concentration derived from different literature sources these parameters not only differ among crops they also vary among different locations for the same crop due to climatic conditions soil fertility and water availability this is a severe limitation to this data as crop comparisons for these agronomic and nutritional factors are only valid when they are grown under the same conditions uusiku et al 2010 the main aim of the study was to assess the effect of irrigation regimes on nwp of amaranth spider flower and swiss chard using datasets yield or biomass evapotranspiration and nutrient content from the same location the two tlvs amaranth and spider flower were selected because they are nutrient dense high mass concentrations of iron zinc and β carotene and they are utilised by rrphs as a relish in south africa mavengahama et al 2013 in this study we compared nwp of selected tlvs with that of swiss chard var fordhook giant we selected swiss chard because it is an alien leafy vegetable that is highly nutritious contains high levels of fe zn and β carotene has been commercialised many decades ago and is widely consumed in sub saharan africa as a relish with maize porridge mavengahama et al 2013 for these selected tlvs and swiss chard we imposed three water stress levels and measured selected plant parameters leaf area index stomatal conductance light interception radiation use efficiency biomass above ground growth and above ground edible biomass nutritional yield and water productivity our hypotheses were that 1 tlvs are more tolerant to water stress than swiss chard 2 tlvs are more nutrient dense iron zinc and β carotene than swiss chard and 3 tlvs are more productive than swiss chard in terms of aboveground biomass ny and nwp under severe water stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description set up and crop management

soilwater index htm the field capacity of the soil was 168 mm m 1 and the permanent wilting point was 37 mm m 1 table 1 illustrates the chemical properties of the experimental site a 3 3 factorial design was used three leafy vegetables amaranth spider flower and swiss chard and three irrigation regimes i30 well watered i50 moderate water stress and i80 severe water stress i30 i50 and i80 represent the different irrigation regimes in terms of irrigating the soil back to field capacity after 30 50 and 80 of plant available water was depleted respectively we used a randomised complete block design with three replications the arc vop gene bank provided amaranth and spider flower seeds whereas swiss chard seedlings were procured seeds for amaranth and spider flower were sown in seedling trays and covered with vermiculite which was used as a medium for seed germination after 8 weeks seedlings were planted at an inter row and intra row spacing of 0 3 m x 0 3 m 111 111 plants ha 1 residual soil p 127 mg kg 1 and k 132 mg kg 1 values were very high due to previous experiments conducted under the rainshelter therefore only n was applied in the form of limestone ammonium nitrate 28 n at a recommended rate of 150 kg n ha 1 of which 50 kg n ha 1 was applied at planting and the remaining 100 kg n ha 1 was applied as top dressing at increments of 25 kg n ha 1 after each harvest during the growing period nyathi et al 2018 2 2 irrigation management the rain shelter was divided into 27 small plots 4 6 m2 to accommodate all the treatments and replications compensating non leaking cnl urinam drip emitters with a discharge rate of 2 3 l h 1 were used to irrigate each plot separately and were spaced at 0 3 m 0 3 m the cnl drip system operates similar to a pressure compensated drip emitter but has the advantage of having a non leakage device that prevents water from draining out of the drip emitter once the system is shut off and the pressure drops below 20 kpa this system ensures uniform water application within each plot aluminium access tubes were installed in the middle of each plot to a depth of 1 m soil water content was measured twice a week at fixed depth increments of 0 2 m using a neutron water meter cpn 503 dr hydroprobe usa calibrated for the site using measurements from a wet and dry profile the effective water extraction depth over the season was determined based on the soil water depletion pattern using the neutron probe data and was taken as 0 6 m the soil water balance was determined using equation 1 table 2 seedlings of selected leafy vegetables were irrigated with the same amount of water for the first 14 days to establish the crops thereafter irrigation regimes commenced nyathi et al 2018 2 3 data collection leaf area index

flower and swiss chard leaves were weighed 500 g and thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove debris the stalks were removed from the leaves thereafter samples were enclosed in transparent plastic polythene bags and sent immediately to nvirotek laboratories for iron and zinc mass concentration analysis using a method suggested by the association of official analytical chemists aoac 1990 leaf samples were oven dried at 80 c for 24 h and their water contents calculated samples were ground in a wiley mill with no 20 stainless steel sieve thereafter they were stored in airtight containers details of the reagents and extraction method used for determining iron and zinc nutrient concentration are explained in aoac 1990 these elements were determined with an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer duplicate samples were analysed for β carotene content at arc vop biotechnology laboratory fresh mass was determined thereafter samples were frozen and stored at 80 c before freeze drying extraction of β carotene was done using tetrahydrofuran methanol 1 1 vol vol according to the method explained by biehler et al 2010 extracts were analysed using an hplc dad shimadzu kyoto japan at 450 nm wavelength a 5 point standard curve that bracketed the concentration of the samples was constructed for quantitative analysis of β carotene 2 5 potential contribution to

significance difference test at a 5 significance level previously conducted experiments sorghum sorghum bicolor sunflower helianthus annuus wheat and chickpea cicer arietinum revealed that the relationship between aboveground biomass agb g m 2 and water consumed crop evapotranspiration mm is highly linear whereby the slope of the line represents water productivity steduto et al 2007 this concept has been used in the aquacrop model which simulates yield response to water foster et al 2017 hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 vanuytrecht et al 2014 other studies bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 campos et al 2018 lópez lópez et al 2018 trout and dejonge 2017 confirmed that indeed the relationship between water use and biomass is linear we followed the steduto et al 2007 concept to compare the relationship between normalised water use et et0 and aboveground biomass for amaranth spider flower and swiss chard 3 results 3 1 soil water content and irrigation to reference evapotranspiration ratio fig 1 presents the soil water content swc of the experiment on selected leafy vegetables amaranth spider flower and swiss chard the results revealed that swc was different across seasons irrigation regimes and leafy vegetables the time to initiation of water stress differed between the 2013 14 season amaranth and spider flower 18 dat swiss chard 14 dat and the 2014 15 season amaranth and spider flower 10 dat swiss chard 14 dat the observed trend across irrigation regimes showed that the well watered treatment i30 maintained higher swc compared to the moderate water stress i50 and the severe water stress i80 treatments for both seasons indicating that the treatments were successfully applied for the 2014 15 season there was a clear distinction between swc for all water treatments i30 i50 and i80 the observed differences were associated with irrigation frequency and the length of growing period irrigation to reference evapotranspiration ratio i et0 provides an indication of the level of water stress experienced by selected leafy vegetables fig 2 a low ratio means severe water stress whereas a ratio closer to 1 depicts little or no water stress during the 2013 14 season i et0 ranged from 0 40 to 0 77 for amaranth 0 46 to 0 87 for spider flower and 0 43 to 0 86 for swiss chard for the 2014 15 season i et0 ranged from 0 29 to 0 77 for amaranth 0 34 to 0 74 for spider flower and 0 16 to 0 71 for swiss chard 3 2 plant parameters leaf area index irrigation regimes affected p 0 001 leaf area index lai during the growing seasons

amaranth agb was higher 7 during the 2014 15 season in comparison to the 2013 14 season the observed trend for amaranth agb 2013 14 and 2014 15 seasons was i30 613 and 658 g m 2 was greater than i50

for both seasons i30 639 and 614 g m 2 i50 536 and 505 g m 2 i80 467 and 420 g m 2 table 3 this is explained by the higher i et0 ratio 0 43 during the 2013 14 in comparison to 0 19 in 2014 15 there

2014 15 season ageb for amaranth ranged from 151 to 387 g m 2 this shows that under well watered conditions amaranth ageb increased by 23 whereas under severe water stress ageb decreased by 18 relative to agb for the 2013 14 season spider flower was significantly p 0 05 affected by irrigation regimes and seasons the ageb ranged from 108 to 325 g m 2 for both seasons under the well watered

was no significant p 0 22 interaction between irrigation regimes and seasons for amaranth harvest index hi however there was a significant p 0 05 effect for spider flower and swiss chard hi table 3 the mean values ranged from 0 46 to 0 69 for amaranth 0 20 to 0 52 for spider flower and 0 57 to 0 92 for swiss chard harvest index results coincide with the ageb results amaranth 151 387 g m 2 and

zinc increased by 8 for amaranth and 12 for spider flower whereas for swiss chard it decreased by 36 relative to the well watered conditions for the well watered treatment β carotene for amaranth was three fold higher than for spider flower and four fold higher than swiss chard leafy vegetables responded differently to water stress β carotene for amaranth 1 and swiss chard 21 increased under the

iron for spider flower 52 increased relative to the i30 treatment a similar trend was observed for zinc amaranth 32 spider flower 19 under well watered conditions β carotene for amaranth was higher compared to spider flower 17 and swiss chard 87 severe water stress significantly p 0 001 reduced β carotene amaranth 61 spider flower 19 and swiss chard 29 for selected leafy vegetables swiss chard displayed contradicting results between seasons in 2013 14 severe water stress reduced iron and zinc concentrations whereas the opposite was observed in 2014 15 during the 2013 14 season iron nutritional yield fe ny and β carotene ny β ny were affected p 0 05 by the interaction between irrigation regimes and leafy vegetables iron ny ranged from 743 to 1361 g ha 1 for amaranth 1266 to 1461

the well watered treatment β carotene ny was improved for amaranth 28 and spider flower 87 for swiss chard β carotene ny was reduced by 35 in comparison to the 2013 14 season the severe water stress

normalised water productivities wpn across all irrigation regimes and seasons was very similar for all crops studied 35 g m 2 for amaranth 36 g m 2 for spider flower and 34 g m 2 for swiss chard normalised nwp nwpn showed that there was no effect p 0 05 between irrigation regimes and leafy vegetables 2013 14 season for fe nwpn zn nwpn and β carotene nwpn for the 2014 15 season fe nwpn was not

swiss chard for both seasons swiss chard displayed the highest wp compared to spider flower and amaranth there was a seasonal variation in nutritional water productivities nwp of leafy vegetables for the 2013 14 season fe nwp was affected p 0 01 whereas zn nwp p 0 07 and β carotene nwp p 0 10 were not affected by irrigation regimes and leafy vegetables in contrast to the previous season the 2014 15 results showed that fe nwp p 0 82 was not affected by irrigation regimes and leafy vegetables whereas zn nwp p 0 01 and β nwp p 0 001 were affected by this interaction table 5 generally our results illustrated that nwpfe zn and β carotene improved with moderate water stress the mean results for both seasons presented an interesting perspective under moderate water stress swiss chard exhibited the highest fe nwp 1090 mg m 3 and zn nwp 125 mg m 3 compared to spider flower and amaranth however under severe water stress spider flower exhibited the highest fe nwp 513 mg m 3 and zn nwp 67 mg m 3 in comparison to amaranth and swiss chard amaranth had the highest β carotene nwp under both water stress levels moderate and severe water stress 4 discussion this study assessed nutritional water productivity nwp of selected leafy vegetables amaranth spider flower and swiss chard previously conducted studies mdemu et al 2009 renault and wallender 2000 wenhold et al 2012 have evaluated nwp of vegetables using datasets sourced from literature the weakness of this approach is that meteorological conditions evapotranspiration irrigation and soil fertility management vary across different locations zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 in addition these studies focused on nwp for calories protein and fat micronutrients iron and zinc and vitamin a which are the root causes of micronutrient deficiency hidden hunger were not considered chibarabada et al 2017 assessed nwp fat content protein calcium zinc and iron of grain legumes groundnuts bambara groundnut vigna subterranean dry bean and cowpea in kwazulu natal using data sets from the same location as far as can be ascertained our study is the first attempt to assess nwp fe nwp zn nwp and β carotene nwp of selected leafy vegetables using datasets above ground biomass evapotranspiration and nutrient concentration fe zn and β carotene from the same experiment therefore the findings of this research serve as a benchmark in this study water stress reduced total aboveground biomass agb for several harvests mean values for both seasons show that reductions were larger under severe water stress relative to well watered conditions similar results were observed in severely stressed bottle gourd lagenaria siceraria sorghum cowpea and colocasia esculenta taro chimonyo et al 2016 mabhaudhi et al 2013 mashilo et al 2018 the response of total agb for selected leafy vegetables to water stress was consistent with measured plant parameters leaf area index lai actual evapotranspiration et stomatal conductance light intercepted li and radiation use efficiency rue the observed trend indicated that as the level of water stress increased figs 1 and 2 measured plant parameters decreased significantly table 3 and fig a1 under severe water stress mean rue for both seasons showed that swiss chard is more efficient in converting intercepted radiation into dry matter table 3 we expected c4 plants amaranth and spider flower to be more productive than the c3 plant swiss chard as suggested by renault and wallender 2000 van halsema and vincent 2012 and wenhold et al 2012 quite surprisingly our results revealed the opposite table 3 perhaps the differing chemical composition of the crops studied could shed light on this unexpected result it is likely that more energy was required to produce total agb lignified stems and leaves for amaranth and spider flower compared to swiss chard mavengahama et al 2013 highlighted that resource poor households consume the softest portion soft stems and leaves of leafy vegetables it is crucial to consider the effect of water stress on above ground edible biomass this study showed that under drought conditions ageb was lower by 55 for amaranth 44 for spider flower and 41 for swiss chard compared to the well watered irrigation regime table 3 the agb and ageb results of this study propose that amaranth and spider flower s reported drought tolerance is perhaps somewhat overestimated in the literature afari sefa et al 2011 aliber and hart 2009 chivenge et al 2015 mabhaudhi et al 2016a b chibarabada et al 2017 maseko et al 2017 information from these studies was based on anecdotal evidence with the assumption that tlvs grow naturally next to mainstream crops we show that tlvs will benefit from irrigation and most likely fertiliser as is the case for commercially cultivated crops our study tested the performance of selected tlvs under three drought levels and found they are comparable with swiss chard under drought conditions several reported studies afolayan and jimoh 2009 odhav et al 2007 uusiku et al 2010 van jaarsveld et al 2014 schönfeldt and pretorius 2011 did not evaluate the effect of environmental factors meteorological conditions soil fertility severe drought conditions and management on nutrient concentrations of leafy vegetables our results show that micronutrient concentrations iron and zinc and β carotene differed among selected leafy vegetables across irrigation regimes and seasons firstly during the 2013 14 season water stress did not affect iron concentration in contrast iron concentration for the 2014 15 season was reduced 21 due to severe water stress secondly the 2014 15 season values were low compared to the previous season this suggests that nutrient concentrations of leafy vegetables are not that conservative as alluded by uusiku et al 2010 we suspect that different meteorological conditions and irrigation management caused the variation in nutrient concentrations figs 1 and 2 it was remarkable that severe water stress increased iron and zinc concentrations for amaranth and spider flower whereas for swiss chard iron 46 and zinc 35 concentrations were reduced β carotene concentration showed sensitivity towards severe water stress levels our selected tlvs displayed superiority in terms of nutrient richness compared to swiss chard fig a2 this authenticates our hypothesis that tlvs are nutrient dense compared to swiss chard table 4 in this study nutrient concentrations fresh mass basis values for amaranth and spider flower ranged from 5 5 to 16 mg 100 g 1 for iron 0 9 to 1 9 mg 100 g 1 for zinc and 934 to 1483 μg rae over different irrigation treatments table a 4 a study conducted by chibarabada et al 2017 assessed the nutrient concentrations of grain legumes under three irrigation regimes their findings showed that cowpea and dry bean contained around five times the zinc of selected leafy vegetables whereas grain legumes exhibited iron concentration lower than this study our results indicate that amaranth and spider flower can provide more than the daily recommended nutrient intake drni for vitamin a to all age groups under severe drought conditions for iron spider flower could provide more than the drni to infants between 1 and 3 years old whereas for zinc spider flower can provide 11 of the drni to the same age group table a 4 we contend that evaluating nutrient concentrations without considering yields is a bit unfortunate as together they can indicate the nutrient yield per unit area of cropped land g ha 1 a useful term proposed by bumgarner et al 2012 this study revealed that severe water stress decreased ny of iron zinc and β carotene across selected leafy vegetables the mean values for both seasons illustrated that spider flower was more tolerant to severe drought conditions than amaranth and swiss chard spider flower fe ny and zn ny were reduced by 30 with severe stress whereas for amaranth and swiss chard this reduction was 50 for β carotene ny swiss chard was tolerant 19 compared to spider flower 60 and amaranth 68 under severe drought conditions table 4 generally swiss chard shows high fe ny and zn ny whereas the tlvs exhibited higher β carotene ny fig a2 the ny findings are not consistent with nutrient concentration results which showed that selected tlvs are more nutrient dense than swiss chard the advantage of swiss chard over selected tlvs is its higher proportion of ageb which increases its ny values this study brought new insight into the importance of considering ny as a parameter for assessing nutrient richness of crops assessments displayed that spider flower can potentially supply a large number of people rrphs with the required amount of micronutrients and vitamin a iron 11 people zinc 2 people and β carotene 47 people in comparison to amaranth iron 4 people zinc 1 person β carotene 47 people and swiss chard iron 5 people zinc 1 person β carotene 20 people under severe drought conditions limited information exists on ny of selected leafy vegetables wen luoh et al 2014 conducted a study assessing nys of three tlvs amaranth amaranthus spp ethiopian kale brassica carinata african nightshade solanum spp under controlled conditions the merit of our study is that we evaluated nys of selected leafy vegetables under variously controlled water regime the goal of wp is to improve yield under limited water supply more crop per drop of water our results displayed that wp of leafy vegetables improved under severe water stress in both seasons table 5 this agrees with other studies which indicate that wp of sorghum chimonyo et al 2016 taro mabhaudhi et al 2013 and maize wu et al 2015 improve under water stress steduto et al 2007 emphasised the need to normalise agb water productivity wpn because of variation in evaporative demand caused by different climatic conditions our results illustrated that wpn of selected leafy vegetables is conserved because there was no effect between irrigation regimes and seasons astonishingly mean wpn of c4 leafy vegetables amaranth and spider flower was similar to a c3 leafy vegetable swiss chard in this study stomatal conductance gs mmol m2 s 2 of selected c4 leafy vegetables was lower than that of a c3 leafy vegetable under severe water stress initially this suggests that with limited water supply c4 plants are more efficient than c3 crops at minimising their water loss ali and talukder 2008 renault and wallender 2000 van halsema and vincent 2012 wenhold et al 2012 the similarity between wpc4 and wpc3 is ascribed to the methodology used to compute wp the numerator is mass produced yield or agb and the denominator is et steduto et al 2007 suggested normalising wp for different climates using tr as the denominator a study conducted by nyathi et al 2018 evaluated wp of selected leafy vegetables using the aquacrop model which separated tr from et their findings confirmed that amaranth and spider flower are more productive compared to swiss chard this insight highlights the importance of assessing wp using the productive use of water tr renault and wallender 2000 emphasised the need for a transition from wp to nutritional water productivity nwp nutritional water productivity is a novel concept that links crop production water use in agriculture and nutrient concentration the main findings of this study showed that fe nwp zn nwp and β nwp varied among leafy vegetables across irrigation regimes and seasons table 5 generally the results revealed that these nwp s improved with moderate water stress either severe water stress reduced nwp or it remained constant with some variation between seasons for example during the 2013 14 season fe nwp improved by 5 for amaranth and 19 for spider flower whereas for swiss chard it was reduced by 21 in contrast in 2014 15 fe nwp was reduced by 39 for amaranth whereas for spider flower and swiss chard it remained the same under severe water stress nwp of micronutrients and β carotene were higher compared to the well watered treatment generally swiss chard was the most productive leafy vegetable for fe nwp and zn nwp whereas amaranth was superior with β carotene nwp under severe water stressed conditions fig a2 this highlights the need for crop diversification in order to maximise the amount of micronutrients produced per unit of water used a study conducted by chibarabada et al 2017 reported fe nwp ranged from 5 3 to 79 mg m 3 and zn nwp ranged from 3 7 to 38 6 mg m 3 values that are lower than found in this study this suggests that selected leafy vegetables are more productive than grain legumes table 5 the possible explanation is the length of growing period leafy vegetables take 3 months therefore they utilise less water 147 457 mm compared to grain legumes our study computed the total amount of water required per day to meet total nutrient requirements water required for nutrients iron zinc β carotene for a family of six people box 1 the moderate water stress was the best because it displayed the minimum amount of water required fig a3 amazingly selected tlvs amaranth 3544 litres day 1 spider flower 5057 litres day 1 required less water compared to swiss chard 5992 litres day 1 this contradicts the nwp results which suggested that swiss chard was more productive compared to selected tlvs the possible reason could be converting nutrient concentration from dry mass to fresh mass basis under severe drought conditions the observed trend was that swiss chard is more productive than amaranth in terms of total water required fig a3 this study presented new insights that there is some scope to alleviate micronutrient deficiency under drought conditions 5 conclusions and future research in this study severe water stress reduced aboveground biomass agb for selected traditional leafy vegetables tlvs and swiss chard relative to the well watered treatment this implies that not all tlvs are tolerant to water stress compared to swiss chard productivity data from literature is based on anecdotal evidence under severe water stress swiss chard produced more edible biomass ageb over selected tlvs this highlights that under drought conditions less ageb will be available for rural resource poor households rrphs traditional leafy vegetables exhibited higher micronutrient iron and zinc and β carotene concentrations amaranth and spider flower can provide more than the daily recommended nutrient intake drni for vitamin a to all age groups however higher nutrient concentrations did not translate to higher nutritional yield ny findings displayed that swiss chard was rich in fe ny and zn ny whereas tlvs were superior in β carotene ny this highlights the importance of using ny as a parameter for assessing nutrient denseness of crops under moderate water stress selected tlvs amaranth 3544 litres day 1 spider flower 5057 litres day 1 required less water to meet total human nutritional requirements for a family of six compared to swiss chard 5992 litres day 1 there is a possibility of alleviating micronutrient deficiency of rrphs under drought conditions the results of this study are a first in quantifying nutritional productivity under controlled water regime we propose that future research and validation of our results should consider the following this study assessed nwp of three selected leafy vegetables under well controlled conditions future studies are needed to assess nwp iron zinc and β carotene of many tlvs and alien vegetables these studies should be conducted in different locations climates and soils explore the effect of management factors fertiliser water stress planting density and planting date on nwp such studies should consider using gis and remote sensing as a tool to scale up nwp results throughout southern africa in this study conversion of raw nutrient concentrations iron zinc and β carotene into cooked boiled values used conversion factors from other studies future studies on nwp should consider assessing the effect of various cooking methods i e boiling frying steaming and grilling on nutrient concentrations of leafy vegetables this calls for a multidisciplinary team soil scientists agronomists irrigation scientists and food scientists when assessing nwp in addition factors affecting the bioavailability of iron and zinc of tlvs should be assessed key findings of our study are that micronutrients and β carotene concentrations are not conservative future research should assess the factors affecting the stability of micronutrients and β carotene concentrations this can provide the basis for modeling the nwp of crops acknowledgements funding from the south african water research

11344,the major challenge affecting rural resource poor households rrphs in south africa is deficiencies in micronutrients iron and zinc and vitamin a traditional leafy vegetables tlvs are dense in iron zinc and β carotene concentrations therefore they are deemed suitable to improve the dietary diversity of rrphs the main objective of this study was to assess the effect of irrigation regimes on nutritional water productivity nwp of selected leafy vegetables amaranthus cruentus amaranth and cleome gynandra spider flower both tlvs and beta vulgaris swiss chard experiments were conducted under a rain shelter at the arc vop pretoria south africa during two consecutive seasons 2013 14 and 2014 15 leafy vegetables were subjected to three irrigation regimes well watered i30 moderate water stress i50 and severe water stress i80 data collected aboveground biomass agb aboveground edible biomass ageb actual evapotranspiration and nutrient concentrations iron zinc and β carotene were used to calculate nwp of leafy vegetables swiss chard exhibited a higher portion of ageb compared to tlvs due to its larger harvest index 0 57 0 92 selected tlvs displayed superiority in terms of nutrient richness compared to swiss chard under i50 results indicated that tlvs could provide more than the daily recommended nutrient intake drni for vitamin a to all age groups for iron spider flower could supply more than the drni to infants between 1 and 3 years of age whereas for zinc it could supply approximately 11 to this age group however higher micronutrient and β carotene concentrations did not translate to superior nutritional yield ny swiss chard showed higher fe ny and zn ny whereas tlvs were rich in β carotene ny similarly swiss chard demonstrated the highest fe nwp 1090 mg m 3 and zn nwp 125 mg m 3 whereas amaranth was larger in β carotene nwp 1799 mg m 3 under moderate water stress these results show that there may be an opportunity to improve nwp under drought conditions there is a need for future studies that will assess nwp for a wider range of leafy vegetables these studies should be conducted in different locations and explore the effect of management factors fertiliser water stress planting density and planting date and soil type on nwp of micronutrients and β carotene keywords deficit irrigation hidden hunger african leafy vegetables micronutrient deficiency irrigation regimes indigenous leafy vegetables 1 introduction in south africa nearly fourteen million rural resource poor households rrphs have diets deficient in essential micronutrients iron and zinc and vitamin a oelofse and van averbeke 2012 thirty four per cent of rrphs rely on agriculture therefore this remains the main vehicle that can address food and nutrition insecurity mabhaudhi et al 2016a govender et al 2017 defined food and nutrition insecurity as the inability to access adequate quantities of nutritious foods required for optimal growth and development hendriks et al 2016 found that in south africa one in four rrphs experienced food and nutrition insecurity which became severe in winter months may october due to lack of water for irrigation a typical diet of many rrphs consisted of maize meal with sugar and where income permitted rrphs consumed a relish of onions and tomato or cabbage once per day another study conducted by wenhold et al 2012 found that 50 of rrphs consumed a diet including fewer than four food groups per day this highlights that food and nutrition insecurity is persistent in rural areas of south africa over the past decades some progress has been made in addressing issues around food insecurity however most attention has been given to promote mainstream crops zea mays maize oryza sativa rice triticum aestivum wheat solanum tuberosum irish

rrphs we recognize the crucial role played by mainstream crops in providing proteins and calories however mainstream crops are deficient in essential micronutrients iron and zinc and β carotene deficiency of micronutrients and vitamin a in human diets causes hidden hunger a condition whose effects may not be immediately apparent but may have severe consequences by inducing stunted growth delayed cognitive development and reduced immunity mabhaudhi et al 2016a to broaden the food basket of rural poor south africans the water research commission has directed considerable funding towards research on traditional leafy vegetables tlvs i e vegetables that have adapted in a certain geographic location where they have become part of local culture and indigenised mabhaudhi et al 2017 popularity of tlvs is attributed to their high nutrient concentration iron zinc and β carotene their short crop cycle the low use of agronomic inputs water and fertiliser their drought tolerance and their abundance available for rrphs in the wild or next to cereal crops as weeds chibarabada et al 2017 chivenge et al 2015 maseko et al 2017 mavengahama et al 2013 nyathi et al 2016 oelofse and van averbeke 2012 it is important to note tlvs cannot replace mainstream crops in the diets of rrphs however tlvs can contribute significantly to dietary diversity and agro biodiversity chibarabada et al 2017 chibarabada et al 2017 noted that there is a gap between water use in agriculture crop production and nutritional requirements from research conducted by nutritionists on nutrient concentrations of crops daily consumption targets to meet human nutritional requirements can be derived uusiku et al 2010 van jaarsveld et al 2014 schönfeldt and pretorius 2011 agronomic and irrigation research tends to focus on producing as much crop with minimum water as possible i e improving crop water productivity chibarabada et al 2017 mabhaudhi et al 2016a b nhamo et al 2016 renault and wallender 2000 these three aspects water use in agriculture crop production and nutritional requirements cannot be assessed in isolation because they interlink mabhaudhi et al 2016b mabhaudhi et al 2016a averred that to meaningfully address food and nutrition security there is a need for an index that combines aspects of water use crop production human nutrition and food access they proposed the nutritional water productivity index nwp nwp yield or biomass actual evapotranspiration nutritional content of a product which was coined by renault and wallender 2000 we fully support the suggestion of using the nwp index for assessing the relationship between water use food production and nutrition however this index can only be optimised for rrphs if suitable crops that are highly nutritious rich in iron zinc and β carotene are available to rrphs and data on their production requirements consumption and nutritional values are available to be incorporated in nwp assessments information on nwp of tlvs is minimal a scoping study conducted by wenhold et al 2012 benchmarked nwp of selected vegetables amaranth amaranthus cruentus chinese cabbage brassica rapa spider flower cleome gynandra swiss chard beta vulgaris cowpea vigna unguiculata jute corchorus spp bitter watermelon citrullus lanatus blackjack bidens pilosa pumpkin leaves cucurbita maxima sweet potato leaves ipomoea batatas and kale brassica oleracea var sabellica using datasets yield or biomass evapotranspiration and nutrient concentration derived from different literature sources these parameters not only differ among crops they also vary among different locations for the same crop due to climatic conditions soil fertility and water availability this is a severe limitation to this data as crop comparisons for these agronomic and nutritional factors are only valid when they are grown under the same conditions uusiku et al 2010 the main aim of the study was to assess the effect of irrigation regimes on nwp of amaranth spider flower and swiss chard using datasets yield or biomass evapotranspiration and nutrient content from the same location the two tlvs amaranth and spider flower were selected because they are nutrient dense high mass concentrations of iron zinc and β carotene and they are utilised by rrphs as a relish in south africa mavengahama et al 2013 in this study we compared nwp of selected tlvs with that of swiss chard var fordhook giant we selected swiss chard because it is an alien leafy vegetable that is highly nutritious contains high levels of fe zn and β carotene has been commercialised many decades ago and is widely consumed in sub saharan africa as a relish with maize porridge mavengahama et al 2013 for these selected tlvs and swiss chard we imposed three water stress levels and measured selected plant parameters leaf area index stomatal conductance light interception radiation use efficiency biomass above ground growth and above ground edible biomass nutritional yield and water productivity our hypotheses were that 1 tlvs are more tolerant to water stress than swiss chard 2 tlvs are more nutrient dense iron zinc and β carotene than swiss chard and 3 tlvs are more productive than swiss chard in terms of aboveground biomass ny and nwp under severe water stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description set up and crop management experiments were conducted under a rainshelter at the agricultural research council vegetables and ornamental plants arc vop located in roodeplaat pretoria 25 59 s 28 35 e 1168 m a s l in the gauteng province of south africa during the 2013 14 and 2014 15 summer seasons november may the rainshelter has a rain sensor that activates an electric motor during a rainfall event and the shelter closes and covers the experimental field therefore the experiment experiences normal field conditions except when it is raining mabhaudhi et al 2014 nyathi et al 2018 presented the long term climatic data rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures detailed meteorological conditions maximum and minimum temperatures oc total radiation mj m 2 reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 wind speed m s 1 and vapour pressure deficit kpa during the growing seasons and soil type of the experimental site which was classified as a sandy loam using the usda soil classification system https hrsl ba ars usda gov soilwater index htm the field capacity of the soil was 168 mm m 1 and the permanent wilting point was 37 mm m 1 table 1 illustrates the chemical properties of the experimental site a 3 3 factorial design was used three leafy vegetables amaranth spider flower and swiss chard and three irrigation regimes i30 well watered i50 moderate water stress and i80 severe water stress i30 i50 and i80 represent the different irrigation regimes in terms of irrigating the soil back to field capacity after 30 50 and 80 of plant available water was depleted respectively we used a randomised complete block design with three replications the arc vop gene bank provided amaranth and spider flower seeds whereas swiss chard seedlings were procured seeds for amaranth and spider flower were sown in seedling trays and covered with vermiculite which was used as a medium for seed germination after 8 weeks seedlings were planted at an inter row and intra row spacing of 0 3 m x 0 3 m 111 111 plants ha 1 residual soil p 127 mg kg 1 and k 132 mg kg 1 values were very high due to previous experiments conducted under the rainshelter therefore only n was applied in the form of limestone ammonium nitrate 28 n at a recommended rate of 150 kg n ha 1 of which 50 kg n ha 1 was applied at planting and the remaining 100 kg n ha 1 was applied as top dressing at increments of 25 kg n ha 1 after each harvest during the growing period nyathi et al 2018 2 2 irrigation management the rain shelter was divided into 27 small plots 4 6 m2 to accommodate all the treatments and replications compensating non leaking cnl urinam drip emitters with a discharge rate of 2 3 l h 1 were used to irrigate each plot separately and were spaced at 0 3 m 0 3 m the cnl drip system operates similar to a pressure compensated drip emitter but has the advantage of having a non leakage device that prevents water from draining out of the drip emitter once the system is shut off and the pressure drops below 20 kpa this system ensures uniform water application within each plot aluminium access tubes were installed in the middle of each plot to a depth of 1 m soil water content was measured twice a week at fixed depth increments of 0 2 m using a neutron water meter cpn 503 dr hydroprobe usa calibrated for the site using measurements from a wet and dry profile the effective water extraction depth over the season was determined based on the soil water depletion pattern using the neutron probe data and was taken as 0 6 m the soil water balance was determined using equation 1 table 2 seedlings of selected leafy vegetables were irrigated with the same amount of water for the first 14 days to establish the crops thereafter irrigation regimes commenced nyathi et al 2018 2 3 data collection leaf area index was measured at two week intervals during the growing seasons using the lai 2000 canopy analyser licor lincoln ne united states of america stomatal conductance was measured only for the 2013 14 season due to equipment breakdown measurements were taken at 10 25 35 45 55 and 75 days after planting using the sc 1 leaf porometer decagon devices pullman wa united states of america nyathi et al 2018 leaves of amaranth were harvested four times whereas for spider flower and swiss chard they were harvested five times during the growing seasons to avoid border effects only data from the middle rows were utilised 1 8 m2 fresh mass was determined by weighing freshly harvested aboveground biomass agb leaves plus stems and aboveground edible biomass ageb agb harvest index thereafter samples were oven dried at 75 c for 3 4 days and the dry biomass was measured selected plant parameters harvest index normalized evapotranspiration normalized water productivity fractional interception of photosynthetically active radiation par irrigation to reference evapotranspiration ratio i et0 radiation use efficiency rue nutritional yield ny normalized nutritional water productivity nwpn and nutritional water productivity nwp were calculated using equations 2 11 table 2 water productivity was normalised for climatic conditions because of seasonal variations in vapour pressure deficit 2013 14 and 2014 15 seasons that affect evapotranspiration canopy extension coefficient k values for par were obtained from archontoulis et al 2011 2 4 nutrient analysis fresh samples of amaranth spider flower and swiss chard leaves were weighed 500 g and thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove debris the stalks were removed from the leaves thereafter samples were enclosed in transparent plastic polythene bags and sent immediately to nvirotek laboratories for iron and zinc mass concentration analysis using a method suggested by the association of official analytical chemists aoac 1990 leaf samples were oven dried at 80 c for 24 h and their water contents calculated samples were ground in a wiley mill with no 20 stainless steel sieve thereafter they were stored in airtight containers details of the reagents and extraction method used for determining iron and zinc nutrient concentration are explained in aoac 1990 these elements were determined with an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer duplicate samples were analysed for β carotene content at arc vop biotechnology laboratory fresh mass was determined thereafter samples were frozen and stored at 80 c before freeze drying extraction of β carotene was done using tetrahydrofuran methanol 1 1 vol vol according to the method explained by biehler et al 2010 extracts were analysed using an hplc dad shimadzu kyoto japan at 450 nm wavelength a 5 point standard curve that bracketed the concentration of the samples was constructed for quantitative analysis of β carotene 2 5 potential contribution to

normalised water productivity light intercepted radiation use efficiency nutrient concentrations nutritional yield nutritional water productivity and normalised nutritional water productivity checks for normality and homogeneity of variance were carried out using shapiro wilk s and bartlett s tests means separation for the analyses of variance was done using fischer s unprotected least significance difference test at a 5 significance level previously conducted experiments sorghum sorghum bicolor sunflower helianthus annuus wheat and chickpea cicer arietinum revealed that the relationship between aboveground biomass agb g m 2 and water consumed crop evapotranspiration mm is highly linear whereby the slope of the line represents water productivity steduto et al 2007 this concept has been used in the aquacrop model which simulates yield response to water foster et al 2017 hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 vanuytrecht et al 2014 other studies bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 campos et al 2018 lópez lópez et al 2018 trout and dejonge 2017 confirmed that indeed the relationship between water use and biomass is linear we followed the steduto et

moderate water stress i50 and the severe water stress i80 treatments for both seasons indicating that the treatments were successfully applied for the 2014 15 season there was a clear distinction between swc for all water treatments i30 i50 and i80 the observed differences were associated with irrigation frequency and the length of growing period irrigation to reference evapotranspiration ratio i et0 provides an indication of the level of water stress experienced by selected leafy vegetables fig 2 a low ratio means severe water stress whereas a ratio closer to 1 depicts little or no water stress during the 2013 14 season i et0 ranged from 0 40 to 0 77 for amaranth 0 46 to 0 87 for spider flower and 0 43 to 0 86 for swiss chard for the 2014 15 season i et0 ranged from 0 29 to 0 77

using datasets above ground biomass evapotranspiration and nutrient concentration fe zn and β carotene from the same experiment therefore the findings of this research serve as a benchmark in this study water stress reduced total aboveground biomass agb for several harvests mean values for both seasons show that reductions were larger under severe water stress relative to well watered

the response of total agb for selected leafy vegetables to water stress was consistent with measured plant parameters leaf area index lai actual evapotranspiration et stomatal conductance light intercepted li and radiation use efficiency rue the observed trend indicated that as the level of water stress increased figs 1 and 2 measured plant parameters decreased significantly table 3 and fig a1 under severe water stress mean rue for both seasons showed that swiss chard is more efficient in converting intercepted radiation into dry matter table 3 we expected c4 plants amaranth and spider flower to be more productive than the c3 plant swiss chard as suggested by renault and wallender 2000 van halsema and vincent 2012 and wenhold et al 2012 quite surprisingly our results revealed the opposite table 3 perhaps the differing chemical composition of the crops studied could shed light on this unexpected result it is likely that more energy was required to produce total agb lignified stems and leaves for amaranth and spider flower compared to swiss chard mavengahama et al 2013 highlighted that resource poor households consume the softest portion soft stems and leaves of leafy vegetables it is crucial to consider the effect of water stress on above ground edible biomass this study showed that under drought conditions ageb was lower by 55 for amaranth 44 for spider flower and 41 for swiss chard compared to the well watered irrigation regime table 3 the agb and ageb results of this study propose that amaranth and spider flower s reported drought tolerance is perhaps somewhat overestimated in the literature afari sefa et al 2011 aliber and hart 2009 chivenge et al 2015 mabhaudhi et al 2016a b chibarabada et al 2017 maseko et al 2017 information from these studies was based on anecdotal evidence with the assumption that tlvs grow naturally next to mainstream crops we show that tlvs will benefit from irrigation and most likely fertiliser as is the case for commercially cultivated crops our study tested the performance of selected tlvs under three drought levels and found they are comparable with swiss chard under drought conditions several reported studies afolayan and jimoh 2009 odhav et al 2007 uusiku et al 2010 van jaarsveld et al 2014 schönfeldt and pretorius 2011 did not evaluate the effect of environmental factors meteorological conditions soil fertility severe drought conditions and management on nutrient concentrations of leafy vegetables our results show that micronutrient concentrations iron and zinc and β carotene differed among selected leafy vegetables across irrigation regimes and seasons firstly during the 2013 14 season water stress did not affect iron concentration in contrast iron concentration for the 2014 15 season was reduced 21 due to severe water stress secondly the 2014 15 season values were low compared to the previous season this suggests that nutrient concentrations of leafy vegetables are not that conservative as alluded by uusiku et al 2010 we suspect that different meteorological conditions and irrigation management caused the variation in nutrient concentrations figs 1 and 2 it was remarkable that severe water stress increased iron and zinc concentrations for amaranth and spider flower whereas for swiss chard iron 46 and zinc 35 concentrations were reduced β carotene concentration showed sensitivity towards severe water stress levels our selected tlvs displayed superiority in terms of nutrient richness compared to swiss chard fig a2 this authenticates our hypothesis that tlvs are nutrient dense compared to swiss chard table 4 in this study nutrient concentrations fresh mass basis values for amaranth and spider flower ranged from 5 5 to 16 mg 100 g 1 for iron 0 9 to 1 9 mg 100 g 1 for zinc and 934 to 1483 μg rae over different irrigation treatments table a 4 a study conducted by chibarabada et al 2017 assessed the nutrient concentrations of grain legumes under three irrigation regimes their findings showed that cowpea and dry bean contained around five times the zinc of selected leafy vegetables whereas grain legumes exhibited iron concentration lower than this study our results indicate that amaranth and spider flower can provide more than the daily recommended nutrient intake drni for vitamin a to all age groups under severe drought conditions for iron spider flower could provide more than the drni to infants between 1 and 3 years old whereas for zinc spider flower can provide 11 of the drni to the same age group table a 4 we contend that evaluating nutrient concentrations without considering yields is a bit unfortunate as together they can indicate the nutrient yield per unit area of cropped land g ha 1 a useful term proposed by bumgarner et al 2012 this study revealed that severe water stress decreased ny of iron zinc and β carotene across selected leafy vegetables the mean values for both seasons illustrated that spider flower was more tolerant to severe drought conditions than amaranth and swiss chard spider flower fe ny and zn ny were reduced by 30 with severe stress whereas for amaranth and swiss chard this reduction was 50 for β carotene ny swiss chard was tolerant 19 compared to spider flower 60 and amaranth 68 under severe drought conditions table 4 generally swiss chard shows high fe ny and zn ny whereas the tlvs exhibited higher β carotene ny fig a2 the ny findings are not consistent with nutrient concentration results which showed that selected tlvs are more nutrient dense than swiss chard the advantage of swiss chard over selected tlvs is its higher proportion of ageb which increases its ny values this study brought new insight into the importance of considering ny as a parameter for assessing nutrient richness of crops assessments displayed that spider flower can potentially supply a large number of people rrphs with the required amount of micronutrients and vitamin a iron 11 people zinc 2 people and β carotene 47 people in comparison to amaranth iron 4 people zinc 1 person β carotene 47 people and swiss chard iron 5 people zinc 1 person β carotene 20 people under severe drought conditions limited information exists on ny of selected leafy vegetables wen luoh et al 2014 conducted a study assessing nys of three tlvs amaranth amaranthus spp ethiopian kale brassica carinata african nightshade solanum spp under controlled conditions the merit of our study is that we evaluated nys of selected leafy vegetables under variously controlled water regime the goal of wp is to improve yield under limited water supply more crop per drop of water our results displayed that wp of leafy vegetables improved under severe water stress in both seasons table 5 this agrees with other studies which indicate that wp of sorghum chimonyo et al 2016 taro mabhaudhi et al 2013 and maize wu et al 2015 improve under water stress steduto et al 2007 emphasised the need to normalise agb water productivity wpn because of variation in evaporative demand caused by different climatic conditions our results illustrated that wpn of selected leafy vegetables is conserved because there was no effect between irrigation regimes and seasons astonishingly mean wpn of c4 leafy vegetables amaranth and spider flower was similar to a c3 leafy vegetable swiss chard in this study stomatal conductance gs mmol m2 s 2 of selected c4 leafy vegetables was lower than that of a c3 leafy vegetable under severe water stress initially this suggests that with limited water supply c4 plants are more efficient than c3 crops at minimising their water loss ali and talukder 2008 renault and wallender 2000 van halsema and vincent 2012 wenhold et al 2012 the similarity between wpc4 and wpc3 is ascribed to the methodology used to compute wp the numerator is mass produced yield or agb and the denominator is et steduto et al 2007 suggested normalising wp for different climates using tr as the denominator a study conducted by nyathi et al 2018 evaluated wp of selected leafy vegetables using the aquacrop model which separated tr from et their findings confirmed that amaranth and spider flower are more productive compared to swiss chard this insight highlights the importance of assessing wp using the productive use of water tr renault and wallender 2000 emphasised the need for a transition from wp to nutritional water productivity nwp nutritional water productivity is a novel concept that links crop production water use in agriculture and nutrient concentration the main findings of this study showed that fe nwp zn nwp and β nwp varied among leafy vegetables across irrigation regimes and seasons table 5 generally the results revealed that these nwp s improved with moderate water stress either severe water stress reduced nwp or it remained constant with some variation between seasons for example during the 2013 14 season fe nwp improved by 5 for amaranth and 19 for spider flower whereas for swiss chard it was reduced by 21 in contrast in 2014 15 fe nwp was reduced by 39 for amaranth whereas for spider flower and swiss chard it remained the same under severe water stress nwp of micronutrients and β carotene were higher compared to the well watered treatment generally swiss chard was the most productive leafy vegetable for fe nwp and zn nwp whereas amaranth was superior with β carotene nwp under severe water stressed conditions fig a2 this highlights the need for crop diversification in order to maximise the amount of micronutrients produced per unit of water used a study conducted by chibarabada et al 2017 reported fe nwp ranged from 5 3 to 79 mg m 3 and zn nwp ranged from 3 7 to 38 6 mg m 3 values that are lower than found in this study this suggests that selected leafy vegetables are more productive than grain legumes table 5 the possible explanation is the length of growing period leafy vegetables take 3 months therefore they utilise less water 147 457 mm compared to grain legumes our study computed the total amount of water required per day to meet total nutrient requirements water required for nutrients iron zinc β carotene for a family of six people box 1 the moderate water stress was the best because it displayed the minimum amount of water required fig a3 amazingly selected tlvs amaranth 3544 litres day 1 spider flower 5057 litres day 1 required less water compared to swiss chard 5992 litres day 1 this contradicts the nwp results which suggested that swiss chard was more productive compared to selected tlvs the possible reason could be converting nutrient concentration from dry mass to fresh mass basis under severe drought conditions the observed trend was that swiss chard is more productive than amaranth in terms of total water required fig a3 this study presented new insights that there is some scope to alleviate micronutrient deficiency under drought conditions 5 conclusions and future research in this study severe water stress reduced aboveground biomass agb for selected traditional leafy vegetables tlvs and swiss chard relative to the well watered treatment this implies that not all tlvs are tolerant to water stress compared to swiss chard productivity data from literature is based on anecdotal evidence under severe water stress swiss chard produced more edible biomass ageb over selected tlvs this highlights that under drought conditions less ageb will be available for rural resource poor households rrphs traditional leafy vegetables exhibited higher micronutrient iron and zinc and β carotene concentrations amaranth and spider flower can provide more than the daily recommended nutrient intake drni for vitamin a to all age groups however higher nutrient concentrations did not translate to higher nutritional yield ny findings displayed that swiss chard was rich in fe ny and zn ny whereas tlvs were superior in β carotene ny this highlights the importance of using ny as a parameter for assessing nutrient denseness of crops under moderate water stress selected tlvs amaranth 3544 litres day 1 spider flower 5057 litres day 1 required less water to meet total human nutritional requirements for a family of six compared to swiss chard 5992 litres day 1 there is a possibility of alleviating micronutrient deficiency of rrphs under drought conditions the results of this study are a first in quantifying nutritional productivity under controlled water regime we propose that future research and validation of our results should consider the following this study assessed nwp of three selected leafy vegetables under well controlled conditions future studies are needed to assess nwp iron zinc and β carotene of many tlvs and alien vegetables these studies should be conducted in different locations climates and soils explore the effect of management factors fertiliser water stress planting density and planting date on nwp such studies should consider using gis and remote sensing as a tool to scale up nwp results throughout southern africa in this study conversion of raw nutrient concentrations iron zinc and β carotene into cooked boiled values used conversion factors from other studies future studies on nwp should consider assessing the effect of various cooking methods i e boiling frying steaming and grilling on nutrient concentrations of leafy vegetables this calls for a multidisciplinary team soil scientists agronomists irrigation scientists and food scientists when assessing nwp in addition factors affecting the bioavailability of iron and zinc of tlvs should be assessed key findings of our study are that micronutrients and β carotene concentrations are not conservative future research should assess the factors affecting the stability of micronutrients and β carotene concentrations this can provide the basis for modeling the nwp of crops acknowledgements funding from the south african water research
