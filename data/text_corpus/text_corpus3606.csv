18030,groundwater infiltration into sanitary sewers increases hydraulic loadings of sewage collection systems and threatens wastewater treatment efficiency however cost effective approach to quantify this important process still needs to be improved in order to better manage this common issue this paper presents a method for determining the origin and amount of groundwater entering the urban sewer system on a catchment scale by measuring and tracking a chemical tracer i e artificial sweetener acesulfame in the urban sewers the magnitude of daily groundwater flows in each sub catchment could be quantified based on a monte carlo chemical mass balance approach for the study site 7 9 of the sewer length contributed 58 of the total groundwater infiltration in the identified high risk sub catchment groundwater sources and their spatial temporal flows could be further pinpointed and elucidated by physically based numerical self optimization model using microbial genetic algorithm method which was verified by on site sewer flow measurements as well as time series tracer concentration patterns at the terminal outlet it was found that the diurnal variations of groundwater seepage into sewer network was linked to the in pipe water level associated with sewage pumps operation mode demonstrating the importance of in pipe water level regulation in controlling groundwater infiltration compared with traditional visual inspection or direct flow measurement methods the proposed approach exhibits distinct advantages in determining groundwater sources and flows in large sewer systems

important for proper conveyance of sanitary water to wastewater treatment plant wwtp prior to environmental discharge however worldwide sewer defect is a known problem in many cities due to aging insufficient rehabilitation and poor construction and materials karpf and krebs 2011 rutsch et al 2006 sercu et al 2011 xu et al 2019 in areas where the sewer invert lies below the groundwater table sewer infiltration commonly occurs through pipe cracks and joints with the estimated groundwater discharge range from 30 to 72 of the sewage flow ellis and revitt 2002 houhou et al 2010 xu et al 2019 increased hydraulic loading reduces wastewater treatment efficiency dirckx et al 2016 franz 2007 and results in additional pumping and treatment costs kracht et al 2008 excessive infiltration could also impact surface water quality with increased sewer overflow risk liu et al 2018 practitioners therefore have endeavored to identify available techniques to detect and tackle groundwater infiltration and solutions to this issue could result in more effective rehabilitation strategies of the costly sewer infrastructure and improved environmental quality for the urban watershed in the last two decades sewer leak detection is often based on physical or visual inspection methods such as closed circuit television cctv ahmadi et al 2014 which are often problematic due to their deficiencies in quantifying the amount of infiltration additionally these methods are often too labor intensive and expensive to achieve system wide sewer conditions assessment shehab eldeen 2001 due to the cumbersome procedures of sewer blocking draining and sediments dredging in sequence before each visual inspection an alternative approach to detecting groundwater infiltration is based on measurements of flow and water quality traditional monitoring approaches are mostly based on volume balances wei√ü et al 2002 xu et al 2014 by measurements of upstream downstream sewer flows to quantify sewage infiltration or exfiltration recently published mass balance methods suggested the use of tracer parameters which requires the signature of sewage distinct from that of infiltrating water mostly shallow groundwater for example the fraction of clear water can be calculated by changes in the concentration of specific sewage components such as borates verbanck 1993 chemical oxygen demand kracht and gujer 2005 total nitrogen shelton et al 2011 and total phosphorous mattsson et al 2016 water isotope tracers and pharmaceutical products have also been used in the context of hydrological processes for determining the origin and amount of groundwater sewer interaction fenz et al 2005a 2005b houhou et al 2010 kracht et al 2007 nakada et al 2008 prigiobbe and giulianelli 2009 use of flow and water quality measurement is less labor intensive as compared to in pipe visual inspection due to its minimal disturbance to urban sewers i e unnecessary pre prepared procedures of sewer blocking draining and sediments dredging however practically a system wide assessment to ascertain the location and quantity of infiltrated groundwater still requires numerous measurements in different locations even using tracers and flow measurements therefore a novel methodology is needed to efficiently and reliably pinpoint and quantify groundwater infiltration with optimized measurement with the support of reasonable number of measurement points for water flow and water quality data physical modeling approaches based on sewer system hydraulics is anticipated to assess the spatial distribution of groundwater infiltration in potable water distribution network the methodology for identifying the source location of accidental contamination has been formulated using a sparse sensor grid usually only one source location of accidental contamination was considered guan et al 2006 laird et al 2005 preis and ostfeld 2007 however in urban sewer network the shallow groundwater infiltration occurs through multiple pipe defects or cracks instead of only one location making the complexity of locating them and quantifying the magnitude of groundwater infiltration increase liu et al 2018 conceptually such a problem can be solved by trial and error method using forward simulation but such a scheme will likely become tedious even for a small catchment the alternative approach is a simulation optimization approach in which a search procedure and optimization model are coupled with a sewer simulation model e g the use in aiding the design of storm sewer networks provided that a layout is given haghighi and bakhshipour 2012 shao et al 2017 however the simulation optimization approach to dynamically characterize groundwater infiltration sources in sewer networks has not been reported to that end we developed a new method to pinpoint and quantify infiltration sources with moderate work input the developed method was demonstrated in an urban sewer network in downtown chaohu city of anhui province china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site is a catchment approximately 76 inhabitants ha served by a wastewater treatment plant wwtp with a total sewer length of 58 3 km and coverage area of 22 4 km2 that can be divided into six sub catchments fig 1 the available wwtp inflow data showed that dry weather discharge within this catchment was approximately 47 000 m3 d however the sewage generation based on pollution sources investigation was only 28 000 m3 d supporting information s1 therefore an estimate of groundwater infiltration flow into the sewer system was about 19 000 m3 d accounting for approximately 40 of total wwtp inflow on dry weather days this indicated severe pipe defect problem in this area which negatively impacts the wwtp operational efficiency and energy cost 2 2 conceptual outline and data acquisition approach the methodology for identifying groundwater infiltration into sewer system is schematized in fig 2 firstly at system wide level the chemical tracers and water flow are monitored at selected sites to quantify daily infiltrated groundwater in different sub catchments then at each divided sub catchment using quantified infiltration flow as constraints a physically based transient flowing model that incorporates self optimization approach is developed to inversely pinpoint groundwater infiltration locations and associated flows by minimizing the biases between simulated time series flows and those measured at monitoring stations such methodology reduces uncertainties for assessing sewer conditions and pinpointing groundwater infiltrations in a catchment scale as compared to direct use of numerical modeling simulation approach additionally this model could help identify high risk areas thus reducing the workload for sewer assessment and detection in a catchment scale in line with above methodology monitoring sites were selected at the boundaries of the six sub catchments of this study site including five manholes two wet wells of sewage pump stations and the terminal wet well of the wwtp see fig 1 in each monitoring site both water quality and water flow data were collected for the acquisition of in pipe water quality data sampling events took place over the period of nov 15 16 2015 there was no rainfall within 72 h before sampling and therefore the direct contribution of storm water runoff to the sewers was negligible within this period a sampler that could be laid horizontally into shallow flow was used to collect water from the manholes or wet wells for 24 h at 1 h interval resulting in a total of 192 samples the collected sewage samples were transported back to the laboratory for immediate processing and analysis simultaneously the time series dry weather flows at the eight monitoring sites were recorded during this period specifically at in pipe manholes i e sampling site 1 2 3 5 and 7 flow measurement was conducted using the ultrasonic area velocity meter nivus pcm pro germany while at wet wells of pumping stations i e site 4 and 6 and wwtp inlet the flows were obtained by pumping operation record to select water quality parameters for use in source identification the target analyte should be a conservative chemical clearly linked to sewage and have low affinity to solids i e it does not undergo significant concentration changes due to physical chemical and biological processes other than conservative mixing based on these considerations we selected acesulfame an artificial sweetener used worldwide as tabletop sweeteners and food additives acesulfame was viewed as an ideal tracer for the evaluation of wastewater contamination in urban water systems or wastewater misconnection to the storm pipes due to its ubiquity and recalcitrance to transformation e g buerge et al 2009 tran et al 2014 xu et al 2016 meanwhile acesulfame featured minimal adsorption to suspended materials by comparing the influent and effluent data of wwtps with activated sludge processes buerge et al 2009 yin et al 2019 detailed analytical procedure for acesulfame was provided in supporting information s2 determination of sewer infiltration flow for each sub catchment also relates to the preexisting or background acesulfame concentration in groundwater aquifer in the areas where sewer invert is below the groundwater table sewer infiltration instead of sewer exfiltration occurs under this scenario usually the concentration of acesulfame in groundwater is much lower than that in domestic raw sewage in this case the acesulfame concentration in groundwater aquifer consulted the reported data in our previous study xu et al 2016 2 3 modeling approach at system wide level chemical mass balance cmb approach in combination with the measured tracers is employed to quantify infiltrated groundwater flows at system wide level in this way the potential mass loss within the sewers could be minimized as possible as can for each designated sub catchment the flow and chemical mass balance are given by 1 q j c j q s j c s j q g j c g j 2 q j 1 c j 1 q s j 1 c s j 1 q g j 1 c g j 1 3 q j q s j q g j 4 q j 1 q s j 1 q g j 1 where q j and q j 1 are the daily flow discharges at test manhole j and j 1 respectively m3 d corresponding to upstream and downstream boundary of designated sub catchment j q s j and q g j are the daily sewage and groundwater inflows into designated sewer upstream of test manhole j respectively m3 d q s j 1 and q g j 1 are the daily sewage and groundwater inflow into designated sewer upstream of test manhole j 1 respectively m3 d c j and c j 1 are the tracer concentrations at test manhole j and j 1 respectively Œºg l c g j and c g j 1 are infiltrated groundwater concentrations Œºg l c s j and c s j 1 are domestic sewage concentrations Œºg l furthermore combining eq 1 eq 4 gives the infiltrated groundwater flows of each specific sub catchment by 5 Œ¥ q g j q s j 1 c s j 1 c j 1 c j 1 c g j 1 q s j c s j c j c j c g j with the following constraint 6 q g j 1 n Œ¥ q g j where q g is daily infiltrated flow within the whole sewer network m3 d determined by the difference in the inflows of the wastewater treatment plant and investigated sewage output within the catchment n is the number of divided sub catchments e g n 6 in this site 2 4 modeling approach at local level 2 4 1 transient flow transport and tracking model physically transient flow transport is described in the form of continuity and momentum equation to describe flowing wave propagation with respect to spatial and time scale as listed below 7 a t q x q i l 8 q t q 2 a x g a h x g a s f 0 where q is transient flow rate down the sewer length m¬≥ s x is the distance along the sewer m a is the sewer cross sectional area m2 t is time s l is length of divided pipe segment for one specific sub catchment m g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 h is the hydraulic head of water in the sewer including pipe invert elevation and water depth m s f is the friction slope q i is transient side discharges including groundwater and untreated sewage that add to pipe segment i m¬≥ s that is 9 q i t q i s t q i g t where q i s t is the time series sewage inflow rate for pipe segment i m¬≥ s q i g t is the time series groundwater inflow rate for pipe segment i m¬≥ s by introducing time variable coefficients the transient inflow rates in eq 9 can be represented as follows 10 q i s t q i s f s t 11 q i g t q i g f g t where q i s is the daily sewage inflow for pipe segment i m3 d q i g is the daily groundwater inflow for pipe segment i m3 d f s t and f g t are the factors of time patterns for sewage and groundwater discharge respectively which satisfy 12 l 1 l f s t t l l 1 l f g t t l 1 where l is the number of divided time intervals over the course of 24 h the sum of daily groundwater inflow added to each pipe segment is equal to the apportioned groundwater flow using mass balance equation at system wide level see eq 5 that is 13 i 1 k q i g Œ¥ q g j where k is the number of pipe segments in sub catchment j in a reverse problem infiltrated groundwater locations and associated flows are unknown parameters to be determined pinpointing groundwater locations and quantifying flows will then depend on the combination of sewer flowing model with optimization algorithm as described below 2 4 2 coupling of self optimization algorithm with sewer flowing model the sewer flowing model for pinpointing groundwater flows as described in eq 7 8 is a non linear mathematical expression currently one of the most popular optimization methods is known as genetic algorithm ga which is used for solving complex optimization problems garc√≠a et al 2015 siriwardene and perera 2006 ga employs the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics to select optimum solution for a given problem even though ga has been recognized as robust optimization method for estimating multiple model parameters in many fields knowledge concerning the use of ga in optimal sewer network management still needs to be enriched e g optimal searching of sewer defects problem specifically the ga method employed in this study is microbial genetic algorithm mga one of the recently developed algorithms that offers the ability to effectively solve highly non linear optimization problems harvey 2011 umer 2015 architecture of pinpointing groundwater infiltrated flows using mga with sewer flowing model is shown in fig 3 which follows four steps as described below step 1 generation of initial population mga starts to optimize the problem with an initial population consisted of p chromosomes each chromosome comprises two kinds of decision variables including daily infiltrated flow rates q i g of potential groundwater sources and time series infiltration coefficients f g t as shown in fig 3 for designated pipe segment daily flow rate of each potential groundwater infiltration source q i g is set randomly within the range of apportioned groundwater flow of a sub catchment i e eq 13 for f g t it is set randomly within the range of 0 1 over the daily cycle under the given constraint i e eq 12 all the random samplings during population initialization are reached on the basis of latin hypercube sampling bekele and nicklow 2007 for each sub catchment the time series infiltration patterns are assumed to be the same over different pipe segments step 2 strategies generated and fitness computations a random pick for two different individuals from the population is performed for each tournament cycle subsequently the groundwater infiltration strategies will be generated and embedded into the data file of numerical sewer flowing model for simulations and fitness computations the objective function is selected to maximize the values of nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse between the predicted and observed dry weather outflows at the monitoring location pushpalatha r et al 2012 written mathematically 14 f x m a x x 1 t 1 t q o t q m t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 where x is the candidate scheme x is the optimal solution t is the simulation time ranging from 0 to t q o t and q m t are the measured and simulated dry weather outflows at a specific location at time t while q o is the average observed outflow during the simulation time t step 3 population evolution after comparing the fitness of the two different individuals the loser with poorer fitness will be regarded as a child and their genotype can be modified by infection and mutation in situ subsequently while the winner genotype is left intact within the genotype array which enabling the presumptive good genes to be transferred to the next generation when individuals evolutions have been completed at a tournament the genetic information will be decoded into normal real values to replace the last ones and participate in a new round of tournament considering n u binary bits to represent each parameter in q i g i 1 2 k and f g t t l l 1 2 l a designed chromosome is consisted of k l n u binary strings as shown in fig 3 the conversion of genetic information into normal real values is done using the following expression 15 q i g u 1 n u b s j u 2 u 1 i j 1 2 k 16 f g t t l u 1 n u b s j u 2 u 1 l 1 2 l j k l where b s j u is the u t h gene of j t h binary string in a chromosome step 4 stopping criterion steps 2 and 3 are repeated until one individual fitness is equal to 1 or if a predefined maximum number of generations is attained realization of above self optimizing processes could be based on pyswmm mcdonnell 2019 pyswmm is a python language based package for the creation and manipulation of the structure dynamics and function of usepa stormwater management models swmm an open source tool for sewer hydraulic simulation with the development of pyswmm mga algorithm was developed exclusively in python to generate its own node inflows i e groundwater inflow then it was embedded into swmm for control actions to pinpoint infiltrated groundwater sources and associated flows through runs of generations see fig 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 delineation of infiltrated groundwater flow at system wide level the acesulfame concentrations measured down the sewers of study site are shown in fig 4 and table s1 by contrast the acesulfame concentration in groundwater is insignificant for the site where sewer invert is submerged by shallow aquifer the reported data was only 0 02 Œºg l on average in this figure acesulfame was detected at the highest concentrations at sampling site 1 and 2 i e starting points of the sewer network these concentrations indicated the background concentration levels of untreated domestic sewage with average data of 10 2 Œºg l the measured data at other sampling sites i e site 3 7 and wwtp inflow represented outflow concentrations of divided six sub catchments as seen in this figure detected acesulfame concentrations decreased at each sub catchment indicative of extraneous water infiltration within the whole sewer network specially at wwtp inlet the acesulfame concentration decreased from 10 2 Œºg l to 6 74 Œºg l corresponding to the sewer defect problems described in site description however sewer infiltration flows and high risk area can t be determined by the absolute decline of acesulfame concentration at each sub catchment in a direct way the magnitude of infiltrated flows should be quantified by the combination of measured tracer concentrations and water flows using cmb as depicted in section 2 3 in our practice monte carlo based cmb approach was employed to cope with the uncertainties in source apportionment modeling uncertainties may arise by different residence times of discharge sources in the sewers and spatial or temporal variations of discharge concentrations based on monte carlo based cmb approach probability distributions for entry i e source profiles for sewage and groundwater and exit i e measured concentrations down the sewers were generated and then input into the cmb modeling for each sub catchment a flow chart for quantifying the groundwater flows using monte carlo based cmb is explained in supporting information s3 accordingly apportioned groundwater flow in each sub catchment is shown in fig 5 where the mean and 95 confidence interval ci of our estimate were presented based on fig 5 the level of deterioration among different sub catchments can be ranked fig 5 shows that the infiltrated groundwater discharge in sub catchment e is significantly higher than those in other sub catchments the mean estimate of daily infiltrated groundwater flow in sub catchment e was 11054 m3 d representing approximately 58 of the total groundwater flow in this study site with only 7 9 of the total sewer length this showed groundwater infiltration may not distribute evenly across the catchment highlighting the necessity to prioritize high risk areas for rehabilitation to achieve optimal efficiency and cost effectiveness similar result was found in dresden catchment with an area of 98 km2 germany where more than 90 of total groundwater infiltration volume was estimated to be located in only 21 of the sewer pipes karpf and krebs 2011 in our study sub catchment e was the identified top high risk area for further delineating the groundwater source flows as described below 3 2 identification of groundwater sources and flows in the high risk area 3 2 1 spatial pattern of groundwater sources and flows for sub catchment e a hydraulic model was set up where the sewers were further divided into 59 pipe segments each pipe segment corresponds to the length between two adjacent manholes the inflow hydrographs at sampling site 3 4 5 7 were input into the numerical model as boundary conditions additionally the side inflow of domestic sewage source was defined including measured daily discharge rate and the factor of discharge pattern over the diurnal cycle see fig s2 the established hydraulic model for sub catchment e was further coupled with self optimizing algorithm mga to pinpoint groundwater sources and flows in this case the population size the number of generations the probability of crossover and mutation were set to 50 300 0 3 and 0 005 respectively in order to reduce the chance of premature convergence cauchy mutation was applied as the search operator to introduce mutation into the population by randomly modifying the chromosomes during the self optimizing process 15000 runs were performed to reach an acceptable coincidence between simulated time series data and the measured data at wwtp inlet see supporting information s4 variations of nse as a function of populations and generations are presented in fig 6 a which can be distinguished into three groups at the initial stage of self optimization the value of nse ranged from 2 5 to 0 with a low degree of aggregation subsequently the nse was quickly concentrated to a narrow range of 0 0 0 5 and eventually converged to the optimal value of 0 78 after 31 generations it is clear from fig 6 a that cauchy mutation applied in mga spent relatively short time in exploiting the local neighborhood because of its higher probability of making longer jumps yao et al 1999 which facilitated the rapid convergence to the global optimal solution fig 6 b demonstrates the maximum likelihood of groundwater flow for each pipe segment as the nse converged to an optimal data where the size of dot reflected the cumulative occurrences of a groundwater flow accordingly an infiltration severity map for the sub catchment e is presented in fig 7 flow monitoring data at three pipe segments were further used to determine the amount of actual groundwater infiltration for model verification details regarding the model verification are reported in supporting information s5 additionally the surplus between measured upstream and downstream discharge of each pipe segment represented the side inflow of domestic sewage and infiltrated groundwater with known domestic sewage input see supporting information s1 the groundwater infiltration into each pipe segment was therefore determined it is shown that relative error between measured and simulated sewer infiltration data was in the range of 14 9 29 8 fig 7 further demonstrating the robust global search ability of developed self optimizing method for pinpointing groundwater sources and flows according to the groundwater infiltration severity map the locations and flows of groundwater infiltration can be further refined specifically in this map the upper yellow shaded area indicated high risk pipe segments while the lower blue shaded area indicated low risk pipe segments which can be largely excluded from consideration for pipe rehabilitation actions wide spread pipe defects and groundwater flows were identified in the yellow shaded high risk area with average groundwater infiltration rate of 3 73m¬≥ m d equivalent to 3730 m¬≥ km d this is approximately 2 40 times of the allowable groundwater infiltration rate for the newly constructed pipes in china s national code for design of outdoor wastewater engineering 2016 indicating the dire necessity for pipe repairs and rehabilitation this example showcased that the pinpointing model can further screen different pipe segments and prioritize them for rehabilitations based on a ranking scheme 3 2 2 temporal pattern of infiltrated groundwater flows the groundwater infiltration rate varying with hour could be determined by measured time series acesulfame concentration using cmb approach aforementioned fig 8 shows the concentration dynamics of measured acesulfame at the wwtp inlet and the source profiles of domestic sewage and groundwater accordingly the apportioned time series factor of groundwater infiltration was presented as indicated in the bar plot of this figure alternatively the temporal pattern of infiltrated groundwater flow can also be determined using the developed physically based pinpointing model it can be concluded that the dynamic groundwater infiltration rates either determined by physically based pinpointing model or based on tracer concentrations changed over time in similar patterns see fig 9 this demonstrates that the developed pin pointing model can provide well resolved information about both spatial distribution and temporal pattern of groundwater infiltration into urban sewers fig 9 shows the hydrograph of infiltration is variable during daily cycle hourly infiltration can vary with a factor 0 02 to 0 06 for the modeling period generally the infiltration is more obvious in the night period than that in the day period infiltration variations could be explained by the variability of in pipe water level during the night period when the wet perimeter in the pipe decreases due to minimum sewage inflow more defects can contribute to groundwater infiltration specifically the diurnal cycle of sewer water level is observed in fig 9 with a relative decrease during the early hours of the morning 3 00 7 00 am and corresponding infiltration peaks in view of the above the assumption of a permanent and constant infiltration rate during the day can be questioned it should also be noted that the modeling scenario corresponded to the hydrodynamic condition of sewers under gravity flow in this circumstance the dry weather flow lifted into wwtp by sewage pumps is approximately the same with sewage and groundwater discharge into the sewers and the sewer water levels exhibit daily reproducible fluctuation patterns around 2 85 m i e corresponding to water depth of 0 38 m and water depth to pipe diameter ratio of 0 27 at terminal pipe based on darcy s law the groundwater infiltration is related to the head difference between groundwater level and water level in the pipes karpf and krebs 2011 assuming local groundwater table is less likely to be subject to intraday fluctuation under dry weather conditions the in pipe water level becomes the dominant factor for determining groundwater infiltration rate the lower the in pipe water level the larger the groundwater infiltration would be therefore it is possible to optimize the operation of sewage pump station to elevate the in pipe water level to a higher standard in this way the groundwater infiltration rate could be decreased for the whole sub catchment for example in a certain of period time if the pumping wwtp inflow is adjusted to be significantly lower than the sewage and groundwater output the sewer flow will be accommodated within the pipes accordingly the sewer water elevation will gradually rise to a higher level and in the following could be maintained at a new round of daily fluctuation based on water flow balance between sewer outflow and wwtp inflow as mentioned above from this perspective further on site experiment is anticipated to be conducted in wwtp so as to present an optimized scheme for sewage pumps operation this would also be helpful for alleviating groundwater infiltration into the urban sewers apart from the pipe repairs of identified high risk areas 4 conclusions this study presented a combination of computational tools to determine the sources and flows of groundwater infiltration within urban sewer system the following are the major findings at the system wide level measurements of chemical tracers representing untreated sewage down the sewers in combination with simulation of cmb model provide clear information about absolute groundwater infiltration of each individual sub catchments within an entire sewer system this is the case particularly in terms of identifying high risk sub catchments for further sewer assessments and repairs for the study site 7 9 of the sewer length contributed about 58 of the total groundwater flow indicating the necessity of system wide assessments for sewer conditions before on site investigation at local level or the identified high risk sub catchment groundwater locations and their flows can be further clarified by a numerical self optimization hydrodynamic model supported with microbial genetic algorithm method validated by coinciding simulated water flows with on site observations for the pinpointed sewer infiltration sources apportioned groundwater flow rate could be as large as 2 40 times of the benchmark data for newly constructed sewer pipes specified in china s national standard based on such model it was also found that the diurnal variations of groundwater seepage into sewer network was related to the in pipe water level as well as sewage pumps operation mode regulations of in sewer water level will have implications in controlling groundwater infiltration overall this paper provides a method to prioritize and quantify the detection of urban sewer infiltrations while featuring minimal disruption to the larger sewer systems future research will be directed to the combination use of novel water quality sensoring and modeling technologies for the purpose of pursuing more

discharge within this catchment was approximately 47 000 m3 d however the sewage generation based on pollution sources investigation was only 28 000 m3 d supporting information s1 therefore an estimate of groundwater infiltration flow into the sewer system was about 19 000 m3 d accounting for approximately 40 of total wwtp inflow on dry weather days this indicated severe pipe defect problem in this area which negatively impacts the wwtp operational efficiency and energy cost 2 2 conceptual outline and data acquisition approach the methodology for identifying groundwater infiltration into sewer system is schematized in fig 2 firstly at system wide level the chemical tracers and water flow are monitored at selected sites to quantify daily infiltrated groundwater in different sub catchments then at each divided sub catchment using quantified infiltration flow as constraints a physically based transient flowing model that incorporates self optimization approach is developed to inversely pinpoint groundwater infiltration locations and associated flows by minimizing the biases between simulated time series flows and those measured at monitoring stations such methodology reduces uncertainties for assessing sewer conditions and pinpointing groundwater infiltrations in a catchment scale as compared to direct use of numerical modeling simulation approach additionally this model could help identify high risk areas thus reducing the workload for sewer assessment and detection in a catchment scale in line with above methodology monitoring sites were selected at the boundaries of the six sub catchments of this study site including five manholes two wet wells of sewage pump stations and the terminal wet well of the wwtp see fig 1 in each monitoring site both water quality and water flow data were collected for the acquisition of in pipe water quality data sampling events took place over the period of nov 15 16 2015 there was no rainfall within 72 h before sampling and therefore the direct contribution of storm water runoff to the sewers was negligible within this period a sampler that could be laid horizontally into shallow flow was used to collect water from the manholes or wet wells for 24 h at 1 h interval resulting in a total of 192 samples the collected sewage samples were transported back to the laboratory for immediate processing and analysis simultaneously the time series dry weather flows at the eight monitoring sites were recorded during this period specifically at in pipe manholes i e sampling site 1 2 3 5 and 7 flow measurement was conducted using the ultrasonic area velocity meter nivus pcm pro germany while at wet wells of pumping stations i e site 4 and 6 and wwtp inlet the flows were obtained by pumping operation record to select water quality parameters for use in source identification the target analyte should be a conservative chemical clearly linked to sewage and have low affinity to solids i e it does not undergo significant concentration changes due to physical chemical and biological processes other than conservative mixing based on these considerations we selected acesulfame an artificial sweetener used worldwide as tabletop sweeteners and food additives acesulfame was viewed as an ideal tracer for the evaluation of wastewater contamination in urban water systems or wastewater misconnection to the storm pipes due to its ubiquity and recalcitrance to transformation e g buerge et al 2009 tran et al 2014 xu et al 2016 meanwhile acesulfame featured minimal adsorption to suspended materials by comparing the influent and effluent data of wwtps with activated sludge processes buerge et al 2009 yin et al 2019 detailed analytical procedure for acesulfame was provided in supporting information s2 determination of sewer infiltration flow for each sub catchment also relates to the preexisting or background acesulfame concentration in groundwater aquifer in the areas where sewer invert is below the groundwater table sewer infiltration instead of sewer exfiltration occurs under this scenario usually the concentration of acesulfame in groundwater is much lower than that in domestic raw sewage in this case the acesulfame concentration in groundwater aquifer consulted the reported data in our previous study xu et al 2016 2 3 modeling approach at system wide level chemical mass balance cmb approach in combination with the measured tracers is employed to quantify infiltrated groundwater flows at system wide level in this way the potential mass loss within the sewers could be minimized as possible as can for each designated sub catchment the flow and chemical mass balance are given by 1 q j c j q s j c s j q g j c g j 2 q j 1 c j 1 q s j 1 c s j 1 q g j 1 c

designated sub catchment j q s j and q g j are the daily sewage and groundwater inflows into designated sewer upstream of test manhole j respectively m3 d q s j 1 and q g j 1 are the daily sewage and groundwater inflow into designated sewer upstream of test manhole j 1 respectively m3 d c j and c j 1 are the tracer concentrations at test manhole j and j 1 respectively Œºg l c g j and c g j 1 are infiltrated groundwater concentrations Œºg l c s j and c s j 1 are domestic sewage concentrations Œºg l furthermore combining eq 1 eq 4 gives the infiltrated groundwater flows of each specific sub

site 2 4 modeling approach at local level 2 4 1 transient flow transport and tracking model physically transient flow transport is described in the form of continuity and momentum equation to describe flowing wave propagation with respect to spatial and time scale as listed below 7 a t q x q i l 8 q t q 2 a x g a h x g a s f 0 where q is transient flow rate down the sewer length m¬≥ s x is the distance along the sewer m a is the sewer cross sectional area m2 t is time s l is length of divided pipe segment for one specific sub catchment m g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 h is the hydraulic head of water in the sewer including pipe invert elevation and water depth m s f is the friction slope q i is transient side discharges including groundwater and untreated sewage that add to

m¬≥ s by introducing time variable coefficients the transient inflow rates in eq 9 can be represented as follows 10 q i s t q i s f s t 11 q i g t q i g f g t where q i s is the daily sewage inflow for pipe segment i m3 d q i g is the daily groundwater inflow for pipe segment i m3 d f s t and f g t are the factors of time patterns for sewage and groundwater discharge respectively which satisfy 12 l 1 l f s t t l l 1 l f g t t l 1 where l is the number of divided time intervals over the course of 24 h the sum of daily groundwater inflow added to each pipe segment is equal to the apportioned groundwater flow using mass balance equation at system wide level see eq 5 that is 13 i 1 k q i g Œ¥ q g j where k is the number of pipe segments in sub catchment j in a reverse problem infiltrated groundwater locations and associated flows are unknown parameters to be determined pinpointing groundwater locations and quantifying flows will then depend on the combination of sewer flowing model with optimization algorithm as described below 2 4 2 coupling of self optimization algorithm with sewer flowing model the sewer flowing model for pinpointing groundwater flows as described in eq 7 8 is a non linear mathematical expression currently one of the most popular optimization methods is known as genetic algorithm ga which is used for solving complex optimization problems garc√≠a et al 2015 siriwardene and perera 2006 ga employs the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics to select optimum solution for a given problem even though ga has been recognized as robust optimization method for estimating multiple model parameters in many fields knowledge concerning the use of ga in optimal sewer network management still needs to be enriched e g optimal searching of sewer defects problem specifically the ga method employed in this study is microbial genetic algorithm mga one of the recently developed algorithms that offers the ability to effectively solve highly non linear optimization problems harvey 2011 umer 2015 architecture of pinpointing groundwater infiltrated flows using mga with sewer flowing model is shown in fig 3 which follows four steps as described below step 1 generation of initial population mga starts to optimize the problem with an initial population consisted of p chromosomes each chromosome comprises two kinds of decision variables including daily infiltrated flow rates q i g of potential groundwater sources and time series infiltration coefficients f g t as shown in fig 3 for designated pipe segment daily flow rate of each potential groundwater infiltration source q i g is set randomly within the range of apportioned groundwater flow of a sub catchment i e eq 13 for f g t it is set randomly within the range of 0 1 over the daily cycle under the given constraint i e eq 12 all the random samplings during population initialization are reached on the basis of latin hypercube sampling bekele and nicklow 2007 for each sub catchment the time series infiltration patterns are assumed to be the same over different pipe segments step 2 strategies generated and fitness computations a random pick for two different individuals from the population is performed for each tournament cycle subsequently the groundwater infiltration strategies will be generated and embedded into the data file of numerical sewer flowing model for simulations and fitness computations the objective function is selected to maximize the values of nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse between the predicted and observed dry weather outflows at the monitoring location pushpalatha r et al 2012 written mathematically 14 f x m a x x 1 t 1 t q o t q m t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 where x is the candidate scheme x is the optimal solution t is the simulation time ranging from 0 to t q o t and q m t are the measured and simulated dry weather outflows at a specific location at time t while q o is the average observed outflow during the simulation time t step 3 population evolution after comparing the fitness of the two different individuals the loser with poorer fitness will be regarded as a child and their genotype can be modified by infection and mutation in situ subsequently while the winner genotype is left intact within the genotype array which enabling the presumptive good genes to be transferred to the next generation when individuals evolutions have been completed at a tournament the genetic information will be decoded into normal real values to replace the last ones and participate in a new round of tournament considering n u binary bits to represent each parameter in q i g i 1 2 k and f g t t l l 1 2 l a designed chromosome is consisted of k l n u binary strings as shown in fig 3 the conversion of genetic information into normal real values is done using the following expression 15 q i g u 1 n u b s j u 2 u 1 i j 1 2 k 16 f g t t l u 1 n u b s j u 2 u 1 l 1 2 l j k l where b s j u is the u t h gene of j t h binary string in a chromosome step 4 stopping criterion steps 2 and 3 are repeated until one individual fitness is equal to 1 or if a predefined maximum number of generations is attained realization of above self optimizing processes could be based on pyswmm mcdonnell 2019 pyswmm is a python language based package for the creation and manipulation of the structure dynamics and function of usepa stormwater management models swmm an open source tool for sewer hydraulic simulation with the development of pyswmm mga algorithm was developed exclusively in python to generate its own node inflows i e groundwater inflow then it was embedded into swmm for control actions to pinpoint infiltrated groundwater sources and associated flows through runs of generations see fig 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 delineation of infiltrated groundwater flow at system wide level the acesulfame concentrations measured down the sewers of study site are shown in fig 4 and table s1 by contrast the acesulfame concentration in groundwater is insignificant for the site where sewer invert is submerged by shallow aquifer the reported data was only 0 02 Œºg l on average in this figure acesulfame was detected at the highest concentrations at sampling site 1 and 2 i e starting points of the sewer network these concentrations indicated the background concentration levels of untreated domestic sewage with average data of 10 2 Œºg l the measured data at other sampling sites i e site 3 7 and wwtp inflow represented outflow concentrations of divided six sub catchments as seen in this figure detected acesulfame concentrations decreased at each sub catchment indicative of extraneous water infiltration within the whole sewer network specially at wwtp inlet the acesulfame concentration decreased from 10 2 Œºg l to 6 74 Œºg l corresponding to the sewer defect problems described in site description however sewer infiltration flows and high risk area can t be determined by the absolute decline of acesulfame concentration at each sub catchment in a direct way the magnitude of infiltrated flows should be quantified by the combination of measured tracer concentrations and water flows using cmb as depicted in section 2 3 in our practice monte carlo based cmb approach was employed to cope with the uncertainties in source apportionment modeling uncertainties may arise by different residence times of discharge sources in the sewers and spatial or temporal variations of discharge concentrations based on monte carlo based cmb approach probability distributions for entry i e source profiles for sewage and groundwater and exit i e measured concentrations down the sewers were generated and then input into the cmb modeling for each sub catchment a flow chart for quantifying the groundwater flows using monte carlo based cmb is explained in supporting information s3 accordingly apportioned groundwater flow in each sub catchment is shown in fig 5 where the mean and 95 confidence interval ci of our estimate were presented based on fig 5 the level of deterioration among different sub catchments can be ranked fig 5 shows that the infiltrated groundwater discharge in sub catchment e is significantly higher than those in other sub catchments the mean estimate of daily infiltrated groundwater flow in sub catchment e was 11054 m3 d representing approximately 58 of the total groundwater flow in this study site with only 7 9 of the total sewer length this showed groundwater infiltration may not distribute evenly across the catchment highlighting the necessity to prioritize high risk areas for rehabilitation to achieve optimal efficiency and cost effectiveness similar result was found in dresden catchment with an area of 98 km2 germany where more than 90 of total groundwater infiltration volume was estimated to be located in only 21 of the sewer pipes karpf and krebs 2011 in our study sub catchment e was the identified top high risk area for further delineating the groundwater source flows as described below 3 2 identification of groundwater sources and flows in the high risk area 3 2 1 spatial pattern of groundwater sources and flows for sub catchment e a hydraulic model was set up where the sewers were further divided into 59 pipe segments each pipe segment corresponds to the length between two adjacent manholes the inflow hydrographs at sampling site 3 4 5 7 were input into the numerical model as boundary conditions additionally the side inflow of domestic sewage source was defined including measured daily discharge rate and the factor of discharge pattern over the diurnal cycle see fig s2 the established hydraulic model for sub catchment e was further coupled with self optimizing algorithm mga to pinpoint groundwater sources and flows in this case the population size the number of generations the probability of crossover and mutation were set to 50 300 0 3 and 0 005 respectively in order to reduce the chance of premature convergence cauchy mutation was applied as the search operator to introduce mutation into the population by randomly modifying the chromosomes during the self optimizing process 15000 runs were performed to reach an acceptable coincidence between simulated time series data and the measured data at wwtp inlet see supporting information s4 variations of nse as a function of populations and generations are presented in fig 6 a which can be distinguished into three groups at the initial stage of self optimization the value of nse ranged from 2 5 to 0 with a low degree of aggregation subsequently the nse was quickly concentrated to a narrow range of 0 0 0 5 and eventually converged to the optimal value of 0 78 after 31 generations it is clear from fig 6 a that cauchy mutation applied in mga spent relatively short time in exploiting the local neighborhood because of its higher probability of making longer jumps yao et al 1999 which facilitated the rapid convergence to the global optimal solution fig 6 b demonstrates the maximum likelihood of groundwater flow for each pipe segment as the nse converged to an optimal data where the size of dot reflected the cumulative occurrences of a groundwater flow accordingly an infiltration severity map for the sub catchment e is presented in fig 7 flow monitoring data at three pipe segments were further used to determine the amount of actual groundwater infiltration for model verification details regarding the model verification are reported in supporting information s5 additionally the surplus between measured upstream and downstream discharge of each pipe segment represented the side inflow of domestic sewage and infiltrated groundwater with known domestic sewage input see supporting information s1 the groundwater infiltration into each pipe segment was therefore determined it is shown that relative error between measured and simulated sewer infiltration data was in the range of 14 9 29 8 fig 7 further demonstrating the robust global search ability of developed self optimizing method for pinpointing groundwater sources and flows according to the groundwater infiltration severity map the locations and flows of groundwater infiltration can be further refined specifically in this map the upper yellow shaded area indicated high risk pipe segments while the lower blue shaded area indicated low risk pipe segments which can be largely excluded from consideration for pipe rehabilitation actions wide spread pipe defects and groundwater flows were identified in the yellow shaded high risk area with average groundwater infiltration rate of 3 73m¬≥ m d equivalent to 3730 m¬≥ km d this is approximately 2 40 times of the allowable groundwater infiltration rate for the newly constructed pipes in china s national code for design of outdoor wastewater engineering 2016 indicating the dire necessity for pipe repairs and rehabilitation this example showcased that the pinpointing model can further screen different pipe segments and prioritize them for rehabilitations based on a ranking scheme 3 2 2 temporal pattern of infiltrated groundwater flows the groundwater infiltration rate varying with hour could be determined by measured time series acesulfame concentration using cmb approach aforementioned fig 8 shows the concentration dynamics of measured acesulfame at the wwtp inlet and the source profiles of domestic sewage and groundwater accordingly the apportioned time series factor of groundwater infiltration was presented as indicated in the bar plot of this figure alternatively the temporal pattern of infiltrated groundwater flow can also be determined using the developed physically based pinpointing model it can be concluded that the dynamic groundwater infiltration rates either determined by physically based pinpointing model or based on tracer concentrations changed over time in similar patterns see fig 9 this demonstrates that the developed pin pointing model can provide well resolved information about both spatial distribution and temporal pattern of groundwater infiltration into urban sewers fig 9 shows the hydrograph of infiltration is variable during daily cycle hourly infiltration can vary with a factor 0 02 to 0 06 for the modeling period generally the infiltration is more obvious in the night period than that in the day period infiltration variations could be explained by the variability of in pipe water level during the night period when the wet perimeter in the pipe decreases due to minimum sewage inflow more defects can contribute to groundwater infiltration specifically the diurnal cycle of sewer water level is observed in fig 9 with a relative decrease during the early hours of the morning 3 00 7 00 am and corresponding infiltration peaks in view of the above the assumption of a permanent and constant infiltration rate during the day can be questioned it should also be noted that the modeling scenario corresponded to the hydrodynamic condition of sewers under gravity flow in this circumstance the dry weather flow lifted into wwtp by sewage pumps is approximately the same with sewage and groundwater discharge into the sewers and the sewer water levels exhibit daily reproducible fluctuation patterns around 2 85 m i e corresponding to water depth of 0 38 m and water depth to pipe diameter ratio of 0 27 at terminal pipe based on darcy s law the groundwater infiltration is related to the head difference between groundwater level and water level in the pipes karpf and krebs 2011 assuming local groundwater table is less likely to be subject to intraday fluctuation under dry weather conditions the in pipe water level becomes the dominant factor for determining groundwater infiltration rate the lower the in pipe water level the larger the groundwater infiltration would be therefore it is possible to optimize the operation of sewage pump station to elevate the in pipe water level to a higher standard in this way the groundwater infiltration rate could be decreased for the whole sub catchment for example in a certain of period time if the pumping wwtp inflow is adjusted to be significantly lower than the sewage and groundwater output the sewer flow will be accommodated within the pipes accordingly the sewer water elevation will gradually rise to a higher level and in the following could be maintained at a new round of daily fluctuation based on water flow balance between sewer outflow and wwtp inflow as mentioned above from this perspective further on site experiment is anticipated to be conducted in wwtp so as to present an optimized scheme for sewage pumps operation this would also be helpful for alleviating groundwater infiltration into the urban sewers apart from the pipe repairs of identified high risk areas 4 conclusions this study presented a combination of computational tools to determine the sources and flows of groundwater infiltration within urban sewer system the following are the major findings at the system wide level measurements of chemical tracers representing untreated sewage down the sewers in combination with simulation of cmb model provide clear information about absolute groundwater infiltration of each individual sub catchments within an entire sewer system this is the case particularly in terms of identifying high risk sub catchments for further sewer assessments and repairs for the study site 7 9 of the sewer length contributed about 58 of the total groundwater flow indicating the necessity of system wide assessments for sewer conditions before on site investigation at local level or the identified high risk sub catchment groundwater locations and their flows can be further clarified by a numerical self optimization hydrodynamic model supported with microbial genetic algorithm method validated by coinciding simulated water flows with on site observations for the pinpointed sewer infiltration sources apportioned groundwater flow rate could be as large as 2 40 times of the benchmark data for newly constructed sewer pipes specified in china s national standard based on such model it was also found that the diurnal variations of groundwater seepage into sewer network was related to the in pipe water level as well as sewage pumps operation mode regulations of in sewer water level will have implications in controlling groundwater infiltration overall this paper provides a method to prioritize and quantify the detection of urban sewer infiltrations while featuring minimal disruption to the larger sewer systems future research will be directed to the combination use of novel water quality sensoring and modeling technologies for the purpose of pursuing more

18031,nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi is recognized as a powerful tool for the remediation of groundwater contaminated by chlorinated ethenes ces this long term field study explored nzvi driven degradation of ces supported by electrokinetic ek treatment which positively affects nzvi longevity and migration and its impact on indigenous bacteria in particular the impact of combined nzvi ek treatment on organohalide respiring bacteria ethenotrophs and methanotrophs all capable of ce degradation was assessed using molecular genetic markers detecting dehalococcoides spp desulfitobacterium spp the reductive dehalogenase genes vcra and bvca and ethenotroph and methanotroph functional genes the remediation treatment resulted in a rapid decrease of the major pollutant cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce by 75 in the affected area followed by an increase in ce degradation products methane ethane and ethene the newly established geochemical conditions in the treated aquifer not only promoted growth of organohalide respiring bacteria but also allowed for the concurrent presence of vinyl chloride and cdce oxidizing methanotrophs and especially ethenotrophs which proliferated preferentially in the vicinity of an anode where low levels of oxygen were produced the nzvi treatment resulted in a temporary negative impact on indigenous bacteria in the application well close to the cathode but even there the microbiome was restored within 15 days the nzvi ek treatment proved highly effective in reducing ce contamination and creating a suitable environment for subsequent biodegradation by changing groundwater conditions promoting transport of nutrients and improving ce availability to soil and groundwater bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords nzvi electrokinetic treatment bioremediation organohalide respiring bacteria chlorinated ethenes 1 introduction perchloroethylene pce and trichloroethylene tce are widely used in industry as dry cleaning fluids and degreasers and historical contamination has typically occurred due to their improper handling storage or incidental releases degradation of pce and tce is very limited in aerobic environments however more efficient degradation is achieved under anaerobic conditions primarily by the process of reductive dehalogenation vogel et al 1987 middeldorp et al 1999 aulenta et al 2006 despite this it is very difficult to completely clean a site contaminated with chlorinated ethenes ces due to the slow degradation kinetics of the less chlorinated by products cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce and vinyl chloride vc as these compounds are more soluble and mobile in the environment than their parents and vc also more toxic and even carcinogenic their accumulation should be avoided and degradation processes stimulated and monitored tobiszewski and namie≈õnik 2012 the most commonly used remediation process for ces is enhanced anaerobic biodegradation supported by the addition of organic substrates as carbon and electron sources and by changing groundwater conditions to make them more suitable for specific organohalide respiring bacteria bioremediation is a cost effective method compared to physical or chemical treatment chen et al 2015 but is relatively problematic for sites with high initial pollutant concentrations which usually inhibit bacterial growth haest et al 2010 xiu et al 2010 as such a combination of two or more remediation approaches remedial train usually proves a better strategy for efficient removal of these contaminants hassan et al 2018 the use of reducing agents such as nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi can be highly effective due to its high reactivity large specific surface area and its ability to completely dechlorinate ces to non toxic ethene elliott and zhang 2001 zhang and elliott 2006 lacinov√° et al 2012 if oxygen is present in the environment rapid oxidation of nzvi leads to oxygen depletion which helps form an anaerobic environment at the same time however it decreases nzvi lifetime for reduction of the target contaminants stefaniuk et al 2016 under the anaerobic conditions typical for deeper zones of contaminated aquifers nzvi reacts with water to form elemental hydrogen which serves as an electron donor for present bacteria bruton et al 2015 both of these reactions lead to the creation of an environment suitable for the growth of organohalide respiring bacteria however nzvi particles possess several limitations such as short term reactivity and also rapid aggregation that negatively affects their reactivity and mobility stefaniuk et al 2016 to counteract this different surface modifications of the nzvi particles may be used to accelerate their migration in groundwater and increase their contact with the contaminant lu et al 2016 several studies have applied electrokinetic ek treatment to support nzvi and solve the above mentioned problems moon et al 2005 gomes et al 2016 ƒçern√≠k et al 2019 stejskal et al 2020 the ek remediation process involves applying a low voltage direct current dc across a section of contaminated aquifer material acar and alshawabkeh 1993 three different mechanisms positively affect the transport of nzvi particles electroosmosis electromigration and electrophoresis yeung 1994 hassan et al 2018 however in an environment where advective flow dominates their contribution may be negligible ƒçern√≠k et al 2019 moreover electrolysis reactions at the electrode produce hydronium ion h3o at the anode which lower the ph in its proximity and hydroxyls at the cathode which increase the ph electrons released from the cathode together with a higher ph help to retain nzvi in a reduced state thereby lowering reduction conditions over a longer period ƒçern√≠k et al 2019 in addition to a positive effect of the dc field on nzvi longevity and migration transport of nutrients to indigenous bacteria and pollutant availability is also significantly

mena ram√≠rez et al 2014 mousavi et al 2011 zhan et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 2014 several anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing pce and tce to cdce have been described including the genera desulfitobacterium dehalobacter sulfurospirillium and geobacter dolinov√° et al 2017 however only dehalococcoides spp and the recently described dehalogenimonas spp both chloroflexi phyla are capable of complete reduction of cdce and vc to ethene lee et al 2013 l√∂ffler et al 2013 yang et al 2017 their presence at a contaminated site correlates with ethene production while their absence leads to cdce and vc accumulation successive dechlorination of ces is catalyzed by different reductive dehalogenases pcea tcea vcra or bvca each cleaving specific carbon chlorine bonds futamata et al 2009 p√∂ritz et al 2013 the presence of genes for different reductases can indicate the contaminated site potential for successful bioremediation dolinov√° et al 2016 saiyari et al 2018 in addition to anaerobic degradation pathways methanotrophs have been shown to cometabolicaly oxidize tce cdce and vc using enzyme methane monooxygenases mmo methanotrophs oxidize methane as a primary growth substrate but the broader substrate range of mmo s allows for accidental ces degradation yoon et al 2011 liang et al 2017 ethen oxidizing bacteria ethenotrophs can also cometabolize vc or cdce in the presence of ethene as the primary growth substrate koziollek et al 1999 mattes et al 2010 and some ethenotrophs are even able to use vc as a sole carbon source verce et al 2001 vc oxidizing methanotrophs and ethenotrophs have been found in anaerobic groundwater samples and can establish themselves at low levels of dissolved oxygen gossett 2010 richards et al 2019 as such the functional genes from ethenotrophs etnc and etne and methanotrophs mmox and pmoa are used as biomarkers of aerobic degradation of ces in groundwater wymore et al 2007 jin and mattes 2010 nƒõmeƒçek et al 2020 the aim of this long term field study was to apply a strong ce reducing agent nzvi supported by ek to enhance its performance and support complete biodegradation of ces in particular we focused on the dynamics of organohalide respiring bacteria methanotrophs and ethenotrophs involved in both reducing and oxidizing processes changes in microbial abundance and groundwater properties were evaluated by combining physical chemical parameters with molecular biology techniques 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the experiment took place on property owned by spolchemie a s √∫st√≠ nad labem czech

starting point specific primer sets are listed in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of nzvi ek treatment on orp ph and temperature when evaluating changes in physical and chemical parameters it is necessary to take into account that the nzvi ek treatment formed a geochemical barrier with constant inflow of contaminated groundwater 1 3 m per day injection of nzvi resulted in a rapid decrease of orp in the application wells from approx 100 mv to 200 mv in amw 61 and to 300 in amw 57 in well mw 58 which was not used for nzvi application orp decreased by 100 mv to 20 mv fig 2 a despite subsequent dc application orp values increased almost to their initial values within seven days due to relatively fast groundwater flow nevertheless aside from well amw 57 which was most affected by inflowing untreated water orp remained lower in the treated area than in inlet water well mw 33 until the end of the experiment only short term changes in ph were observed following nzvi injection fig 2b the aquifer environment was sufficiently buffered as described in other studies gavaskar et al 2005 wei et al 2010 in wells amw 57 and amw 61 ph increased directly after nzvi injection from an initial level of around 6 standard units s u to more than 7 s u and 8 s u respectively compared with the starting point ph values were still one standard ph unit higher after seven days and showed a slight increase after dc commissioning the downstream well mw 58 situated near the cathode and dp 3 probe was most influenced as the inflowing water had been treated longest the high volumes of nzvi suspension applied increased groundwater temperature within the treated area from approximately 15 c to 18 21 c application of dc current then maintained the temperature 5 c higher in the treated area compared with the inlet water in well mw 33 fig s1 3 2 degradation of ces the major contaminants detected in inflowing groundwater from well mw 33 were tce 48 of total ces and cdce 46 of total ces the proportion of cdce increased in downstream groundwater due to ongoing relatively rapid tce degradation as a result initial contamination in the treated aquifer comprised mainly cdce 70 80 of total ces and vc 10 15 of total ces fig 3 the combination of nzvi and ek treatment resulted in a rapid decrease in tce and especially cdce inside the treated area higher concentrations of tce 42 4 Œºmol l were only recorded in upstream well amw 57 and these were successfully reduced to 0 1 Œºmol l after treatment initial levels of cdce 120 633 Œºmol l rapidly decreased by approximately 75 in all wells except for the inlet well where the reduction was nearer 50 concentrations of degradation products the sum of methane ethene and ethane increased in all wells inside the treated zone following nzvi and dc application indicating successful completion of ce dehalogenation a significant rise in degradation products was observed from day 71 to day 98 of the experiment accordingly high abundance of dehalococcoides spp together with both vc reductase genes vcra and bvca were detected fig 4 in well amw 57 situated on the edge of the affected area cdce slowly increased after an initial drop due to the constant inflow of contaminated groundwater that had not passed through the created geochemical barrier fig 3b nevertheless high concentrations of final degradation products together with an increase in dehalococcoides spp and vc reductase genes were observed fig 4b highest concentrations of ce degradation products and vc were detected in well mw 58 situated downgradient of the anodes and close to a cathode fig 3c in all wells vc levels remained relatively constant average 75 Œºmol l in mw 33 mw 58 and amw 57 and 23 Œºmol l in amw 61 fig 3 throughout the experiment despite the presence of dehalococcoides spp and vc reductases vc is probably produced from cdce more rapidly than it is degraded in inlet well mw 33 concentrations of tce and cdce decreased by approximately 50 after nzvi application from 622 to 324 Œºmol l and from 598 to 311 Œºmol l respectively fig 3a after 15 days tce levels increased slowly due to the continuous inflow of contaminated water levels of final degradation products remained low changes in ce concentration and ph observed in well mw 33 following nzvi application were most likely caused by the vast volume of water injected into nearby wells only 2 m away which could have diluted the local groundwater and affected conditions in well mw 33 over the medium term distinct changes in all physico chemical parameters were observed in all wells after 100 days with a drop in ph and orp values fig 2 an increase in water conductivity fig s2 a 5 c decrease in temperature fig s1 and an increase in the concentration of ces fig 3 this was probably caused by a combination of two factors i e a 0 5 m increase in groundwater level in the aquifer fig s3 which could have resulted in washing of the unsaturated zone and degradation and passivation of the anodes resulting in a 50 decrease in the electric current fig s4 3 3 impact of nzvi ek treatment on native bacterial populations and degradation enzymes relative quantification based on qpcr data was used to evaluate the changes in bacterial populations and degradation enzymes following nzvi ek treatment in individual wells over time fig 4 presence of organohalide respiring bacteria of the genera desulfitobacterium and dehalococcoides and the functional vc reductase genes vcra and bvca was confirmed in inlet water from well mw 33 fig 4a however the abundance of organohalide respiring bacterial populations and degradation enzymes as well as total bacterial biomass was lower in the highly contaminated inlet water when compared with the aquifer and plume zone as clearly shown on ct values of each marker in different wells prior to nzvi ek treatment fig s5 total ce concentration reached 1 3 mmol l in well mw 33 while considerably lower levels were recorded in the other monitored wells fig 3 such high concentrations of ces could be toxic to microorganisms and inhibit their growth duhamel et al 2002 haest et al 2010 an exception was the tce dechlorinating genus desulfitobacterium which was more abundant in the inlet water from well mw 33 than in the wells situated downstream fig s5 this can be attributed to high concentrations of tce in mw 33 compared to low tce levels in other monitored wells interestingly a different response to nzvi application was observed in two application wells close to a cathode and an anode in well amw 57 situated near the cathode nzvi injection resulted in a severe reduction of total bacterial biomass eight days after application fig 4b such a rapid decrease can be explained by the nzvi suspension flushing out a significant portion of the microorganisms present moreover high doses of nzvi could be toxic to microorganisms in the short term bruton et al 2015 stefaniuk et al 2016 however the initial decline in bacterial biomass and all monitored markers was followed by a rapid recovery especially of dehalococcoides spp and both vc reductases indicating enhanced biotic reduction of ces the groundwater microbiome was restored within 15 days after the nzvi application and most notably the growth of organohalide respiring bacteria was enhanced the increase in bacterial biomass corresponded to increasing concentrations of ce degradation products fig 3b on the other hand no negative impact was observed on microorganisms eight days after nzvi injection in well amw 61 situated close to the anode fig 4d with dehalococcoides and desulfitobacterium spp even more abundant than before treatment electrolysis reactions constantly produce oxygen at the anode as well as hydrogen ions which can lower groundwater ph in the immediate vicinity hassan et al 2018 dissolved oxygen can react rapidly with nzvi resulting in decreasing toxicity towards microorganisms ƒçern√≠kov√° et al 2020 this effect together with new microorganisms carried into the well with groundwater flow could have caused rapid restoration of the microbial community following nzvi injection the treatment s impact on the abundance of cdce and vc oxidizing ethenotrophs and methanotrophs was assessed using markers for co metabolic oxidation of ces targeting the genes etnc etne mmox and pmoa encoding degradation enzymes clear differences were observed in the abundance of ethenotrophs and methanotrophs near the cathode and anode fig 5 in accordance with other monitored bacteria with a decrease in abundance observed in well amw 57 located near the cathode directly after application fig 5a populations of methanotrophs and ethenotrophs re established themselves within 35 days but remained at pre application levels due to a lack of dissolved oxygen a slight decrease in ethenotrophs and methanotrophs was observed in well aw5 61 after nzvi and dc application fig 5b but higher levels of dissolved oxygen resulting from water oxidation on the anode allowed for a higher proliferation of vc oxidizing bacteria after 35 days methanotrophs and ethenotrophs increased once again and ethenotroph levels especially remained up to 50 times higher compared to initial values until the end of the field study groundwater heterogeneity clearly supported divergent vc degradation processes anaerobic reductive degradation of vc produces ethene which is oxidized by ethenotrophs that can also degrade vc co metabolically atashgahi et al 2017 liang et al 2017 moreover hydrogen produced at the cathodes served as an electron donor for organohalide respiring bacteria while oxygen produced at the anodes promoted growth of bacteria capable of aerobic co metabolic vc oxidation ethenotrophs and methanotrophs mattes et al 2010 liang et al 2017 with the coupling of these two processes helping to completely clean the aquifer the remediation treatment had no negative impact on indigenous microorganisms in well mw 58 even though it was situated near the cathode fig 4c the treated water flowing through this well allowed for better growth of dehalococcoides spp while the presence of both vc reductases indicated complete removal of ces the high abundance of these markers corresponded with the high concentration of ce degradation products fig 3c desulfitobacterium sp has been shown to be highly successful at colonizing newly formed niches villemur et al 2006 after nzvi application the relative quantity of desulfitobacterium sp increased rapidly in the affected wells though they were soon outcompeted by more specialized organohalide respiring bacteria favored by conditions in the treated groundwater dehalococcoides spp and vc reductase genes were so abundant in the aquifer that they were able to buffer the diluting effect of rising groundwater levels 100 days after nzvi application and remained relatively stable until the end of the study fig 4 nzvi ek treatment elevated temperatures over the whole treated area by approximately 5 c fig s1 and this may also have accelerated ce biodegradation microbial activity is closely related to temperature and as such applying a dc current could represent a cost effective method for both heating the soil and promoting enzymatic activity especially in cold climates suni et al 2007 in this study injection of nzvi induced depletion of indigenous microorganisms in application wells near the cathode while the observed decrease in microbial biomass could have been caused by the high volume of injected nzvi solution diluting the groundwater the groundwater microbiome was re established within just eight and 15 days after nzvi application in wells amw 61 and amw 57 respectively fig 4d and b xiu et al 2010 also observed stimulation in the growth of a culture containing dehalococcoides spp after a short lag period when exposed to nzvi several studies have documented that microorganisms can be negatively affected when exposed to different nzvi particles however the toxic effect of nzvi has usually only been observed under laboratory conditions and on pure bacterial cultures lee et al 2008 diao and yao 2009 el temsah et al 2016 ≈°evc≈Ø et al 2017 in comparison microcosm scale tests on mixed bacterial cultures prove slightly more positive kirschling et al 2010 xiu et al 2010 while nzvi shell oxidation and coating with natural organic matter can rapidly reduce its toxicity under natural environmental conditions li et al 2010 bruton et al 2015 data from field experiments are still scarce but mostly show changes and shifts in the composition of bacterial communities generally speaking nzvi effect is highly dose and species dependent fajardo et al 2012 pawlett et al 2013 nƒõmeƒçek et al 2014 2016 lefevre et al 2016 nguyen et al 2018 and rapid recovery or even support of organohalide respiring bacteria has been reported in batch microcosms xiu et al 2010 and after field injection of nzvi stabilized with carboxymethyl cellulose kocur et al 2016 accordingly nzvi ek treatment appears to have no long term negative impacts on native bacterial populations while promoting the growth of ce degrading bacteria as clearly shown in this study 4 conclusions this long term field study demonstrates the great potential of the combined nzvi ek bioremediation approach for cleaning up aquifers highly polluted by ces nzvi ek treatment caused a rapid reduction in ces in the treated area and despite the constant inflow of contaminated water into the reactive zone high cdce degradation rates were observed throughout the experiment alongside increased production of the ce degradation products methane ethene and ethane long term reactivity of nzvi was successfully supported by ek treatment which additionally stimulated microbial degradation activity by elevating groundwater temperature the negative impact of nzvi application on indigenous microorganisms observed proved to be temporary as the microbiome was restored within 15 days moreover the established groundwater conditions promoted bioremediation organohalide respiring bacteria continued ce reduction even after partial nzvi exhaustion cdce and vc were also degraded by methanotrophs and ethenotrophs which were favored by the substantial levels of oxygen produced at the anodes our approach combining nzvi as a strong ce reducing agent and ek for supporting nzvi reactivity and mobility also promoted biodegradation and as such represents a suitable remediation strategy for cleaning sites highly polluted with ces to the best of our knowledge

18031,nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi is recognized as a powerful tool for the remediation of groundwater contaminated by chlorinated ethenes ces this long term field study explored nzvi driven degradation of ces supported by electrokinetic ek treatment which positively affects nzvi longevity and migration and its impact on indigenous bacteria in particular the impact of combined nzvi ek treatment on organohalide respiring bacteria ethenotrophs and methanotrophs all capable of ce degradation was assessed using molecular genetic markers detecting dehalococcoides spp desulfitobacterium spp the reductive dehalogenase genes vcra and bvca and ethenotroph and methanotroph functional genes the remediation treatment resulted in a rapid decrease of the major pollutant cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce by 75 in the affected area followed by an increase in ce degradation products methane ethane and ethene the newly established geochemical conditions in the treated aquifer not only promoted growth of organohalide respiring bacteria but also allowed for the concurrent presence of vinyl chloride and cdce oxidizing methanotrophs and especially ethenotrophs which proliferated preferentially in the vicinity of an anode where low levels of oxygen were produced the nzvi treatment resulted in a temporary negative impact on indigenous bacteria in the application well close to the cathode but even there the microbiome was restored within 15 days the nzvi ek treatment proved highly effective in reducing ce contamination and creating a suitable environment for subsequent biodegradation by changing groundwater conditions promoting transport of nutrients and improving ce availability to soil and groundwater bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords nzvi electrokinetic treatment bioremediation organohalide respiring bacteria chlorinated ethenes 1 introduction perchloroethylene pce and trichloroethylene tce are widely used in industry as dry cleaning fluids and degreasers and historical contamination has typically occurred due to their improper handling storage or incidental releases degradation of pce and tce is very limited in aerobic environments however more efficient degradation is achieved under anaerobic conditions primarily by the process of reductive dehalogenation vogel et al 1987 middeldorp et al 1999 aulenta et al 2006 despite this it is very difficult to completely clean a site contaminated with chlorinated ethenes ces due to the slow degradation kinetics of the less chlorinated by products cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce and vinyl chloride vc as these compounds are more soluble and mobile in the environment than their parents and vc also more toxic and even carcinogenic their accumulation should be avoided and degradation processes stimulated and monitored tobiszewski and namie≈õnik 2012 the most commonly used remediation process for ces is enhanced anaerobic biodegradation supported by the addition of organic substrates as carbon and electron sources and by changing groundwater conditions to make them more suitable for specific organohalide respiring bacteria bioremediation is a cost effective method compared to physical or chemical treatment chen et al 2015 but is relatively problematic for sites with high initial pollutant concentrations which usually inhibit bacterial growth haest et al 2010 xiu et al 2010 as such a combination of two or more remediation approaches remedial train usually proves a better strategy for efficient removal of these contaminants hassan et al 2018 the use of reducing agents such as nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi can be highly effective due to its high reactivity large specific surface area and its ability to completely dechlorinate ces to non toxic ethene elliott and zhang 2001 zhang and elliott 2006 lacinov√° et al 2012 if oxygen is present in the environment rapid oxidation of nzvi leads to oxygen depletion which helps form an anaerobic environment at the same time however it decreases nzvi lifetime for reduction of the target contaminants stefaniuk et al 2016 under the anaerobic conditions typical for deeper zones of contaminated aquifers nzvi reacts with water to form elemental hydrogen which serves as an electron donor for present bacteria bruton et al 2015 both of these reactions lead to the creation of an environment suitable for the growth of organohalide respiring bacteria however nzvi particles possess several limitations such as short term reactivity and also rapid aggregation that negatively affects their reactivity and mobility stefaniuk et al 2016 to counteract this different surface modifications of the nzvi particles may be used to accelerate their migration in groundwater and increase their contact with the contaminant lu et al 2016 several studies have applied electrokinetic ek treatment to support nzvi and solve the above mentioned problems moon et al 2005 gomes et al 2016 ƒçern√≠k et al 2019 stejskal et al 2020 the ek remediation process involves applying a low voltage direct current dc across a section of contaminated aquifer material acar and alshawabkeh 1993 three different mechanisms positively affect the transport of nzvi particles electroosmosis electromigration and electrophoresis yeung 1994 hassan et al 2018 however in an environment where advective flow dominates their contribution may be negligible ƒçern√≠k et al 2019 moreover electrolysis reactions at the electrode produce hydronium ion h3o at the anode which lower the ph in its proximity and hydroxyls at the cathode which increase the ph electrons released from the cathode together with a higher ph help to retain nzvi in a reduced state thereby lowering reduction conditions over a longer period ƒçern√≠k et al 2019 in addition to a positive effect of the dc field on nzvi longevity and migration transport of nutrients to indigenous bacteria and pollutant availability is also significantly enhanced yeung and gu 2011 electrokinetically enhanced bioremediation has been extensively studied beretta et al 2019 and applied in order to remove pollutants from soil and groundwater she et al 2006 mena ram√≠rez et al 2014 mousavi et al 2011 zhan et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 2014 several anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing pce and tce to cdce have been described including the genera desulfitobacterium dehalobacter sulfurospirillium and geobacter dolinov√° et al 2017 however only dehalococcoides spp and the recently described dehalogenimonas spp both chloroflexi phyla are capable of complete reduction of cdce and vc to ethene lee et al 2013 l√∂ffler et al 2013 yang et al 2017 their presence at a contaminated site correlates with ethene production while their absence leads to cdce and vc accumulation successive dechlorination of ces is catalyzed by different reductive dehalogenases pcea tcea vcra or bvca each cleaving specific carbon chlorine bonds futamata et al 2009 p√∂ritz et al 2013 the presence of genes for different reductases can indicate the contaminated site potential for successful bioremediation dolinov√° et al 2016 saiyari et al 2018 in addition to anaerobic degradation pathways methanotrophs have been shown to cometabolicaly oxidize tce cdce and vc using enzyme methane monooxygenases mmo methanotrophs oxidize methane as a primary growth substrate but the broader substrate range of mmo s allows for accidental ces degradation yoon et al 2011 liang et al 2017 ethen oxidizing bacteria ethenotrophs can also cometabolize vc or cdce in the presence of ethene as the primary growth substrate koziollek et al 1999 mattes et al 2010 and some ethenotrophs are even able to use vc as a sole carbon source verce et al 2001 vc oxidizing methanotrophs and ethenotrophs have been found in anaerobic groundwater samples and can establish themselves at low levels of dissolved oxygen gossett 2010 richards et al 2019 as such the functional genes from ethenotrophs etnc and etne and methanotrophs mmox and pmoa are used as biomarkers of aerobic degradation of ces in groundwater wymore et al 2007 jin and mattes 2010 nƒõmeƒçek et al 2020 the aim of this long term field study was to apply a strong ce reducing agent nzvi supported by ek to enhance its performance and support complete biodegradation of ces in particular we focused on the dynamics of organohalide respiring bacteria methanotrophs and ethenotrophs involved in both reducing and oxidizing processes changes in microbial abundance and groundwater properties were evaluated by combining physical chemical parameters with molecular biology techniques 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the experiment took place on property owned by spolchemie a s √∫st√≠ nad labem czech republic where poor tce storage and handling practices have over the years led to significant contamination of soil and groundwater geologically the spolchemie site comprises mesozoic cretaceous siltstones overlaid by a quaternary terrace which is the layer containing most of the contamination the quaternary terrace consists of fluvial sediments located approximately 12 3 to 3 m below ground level bgl and its average thickness is 9 m the base of the terrace consists of clay gravels sandy gravel and alkaline boulders of the size 15 20 cm the grain size of clastic sediments decreases towards the overburden in the depth of 7 5 3 m bgl there are parts of brown rusty clay sands with smaller boulders of alkaline rocks or quartz the terrace is covered by a 3 m thick layer of anthropogenic debris originating from historical demolitions the surface of the studied site is covered by a concrete layer with a thickness of 40 55 cm or with a coarse grained gravel the groundwater

a constant inflow of ces from the source zone situated north of the site a central line of three anodes was surrounded by nine cathodes to create dc electric field fig 1 all the electrodes were steel rods with a diameter of 20 mm installed directly into the aquifer to a depth of 9 m wells amw 57 aw 60 and amw 61 were used for nzvi application wells close to cathodes amw 57 and mw 58 and an anode amw 61 were monitored to assess the influence of nzvi and the electric field on ce degradation physico chemical parameters and abundance of indigenous bacteria well mw 33 situated on the inflow side of the study site served as a control for monitoring the concentration of inflowing contaminants characterization of the groundwater from well mw 33 sampled 8 days before nzvi application is presented in table s1 2 2 application of nzvi and ek treatment a reaction mixture with a final nzvi concentration of 3 g l was prepared fresh on site by mixing 60 kg of nzvi nanofer star dc nanoiron ltd czech

a maximum power of 750 w when the system was switched on the inverter output was approximately 550 w but decreased slowly as a result of anode passivation and dissolving 2 3 sampling and measurement of chemical and physical parameters groundwater samples for molecular biology and physico chemical analysis were obtained from wells amw 57 mw 58 amw 61 and mw 33 over a period of 140 days with two samplings completed before nzvi application the groundwater level was measured in all wells using a g30 electronic gauge npk europe mfg s r o czech republic subsequently all water samples were taken

starting point specific primer sets are listed in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of nzvi ek treatment on orp ph and temperature when evaluating changes in physical and chemical parameters it is necessary to take into account that the nzvi ek treatment formed a geochemical barrier with constant inflow of contaminated groundwater 1 3 m per day injection of nzvi resulted in a rapid decrease of orp in the application wells from approx 100 mv to 200 mv in amw 61 and to 300 in amw 57 in well mw 58 which was not used for nzvi application orp decreased by 100 mv to 20 mv fig 2 a despite subsequent dc application orp values increased almost to their initial values within seven days due to relatively fast groundwater flow nevertheless aside from well amw 57 which was most affected by inflowing untreated water orp remained lower in the treated area than in inlet water well mw 33 until the end of the experiment only short term changes in ph were observed following nzvi injection fig 2b the aquifer environment was sufficiently buffered as described in other studies gavaskar et al 2005 wei et al 2010 in wells amw 57 and amw 61 ph increased directly after nzvi injection from an initial level of around 6 standard units s u to more than 7 s u and 8 s u respectively compared with the starting point ph values were still one standard ph unit higher after seven days and showed a slight increase after dc commissioning the downstream well mw 58 situated near the cathode and dp 3 probe was most influenced as the inflowing water had been treated longest the high volumes of nzvi suspension applied increased groundwater temperature within the treated area from approximately 15 c to 18 21 c application of dc current then maintained the temperature 5 c higher in the treated area compared with the inlet water in well mw 33 fig s1 3 2 degradation of ces the major contaminants detected in inflowing groundwater from well mw 33 were tce 48 of total ces and cdce 46 of total ces the proportion of cdce increased in downstream groundwater due to ongoing relatively rapid tce degradation as a result initial contamination in the treated aquifer comprised mainly cdce 70 80 of total ces and vc 10 15 of total ces fig 3 the combination of nzvi and ek treatment resulted in a rapid decrease in tce and especially cdce inside the treated area higher concentrations of tce 42 4 Œºmol l were only recorded in upstream well amw 57 and these were successfully reduced to 0 1 Œºmol l after treatment initial levels of cdce 120 633 Œºmol l rapidly decreased by approximately 75 in all wells except for the inlet well where the reduction was nearer 50 concentrations of degradation products the sum of methane ethene and ethane increased in all wells inside the treated zone following nzvi and dc application indicating successful completion of ce dehalogenation a significant rise in degradation products was observed from day 71 to day 98 of the experiment accordingly high abundance of dehalococcoides spp together with both vc reductase genes vcra and bvca were detected fig 4 in well amw 57 situated on the edge of the affected area cdce slowly increased after an initial drop due to the constant inflow of contaminated groundwater that had not passed through the created geochemical barrier fig 3b nevertheless high concentrations of final degradation products together with an increase in dehalococcoides spp and vc reductase genes were observed fig 4b highest concentrations of ce degradation products and vc were detected in well mw 58 situated downgradient of the anodes and close to a cathode fig 3c in all wells vc levels remained relatively constant average 75 Œºmol l in mw 33 mw 58 and amw 57 and 23 Œºmol l in amw 61 fig 3 throughout the experiment despite the presence of dehalococcoides spp and vc reductases vc is probably produced from cdce more rapidly than it is degraded in inlet well mw 33 concentrations of tce and cdce decreased by approximately 50 after nzvi application from 622 to 324 Œºmol l and from 598 to 311 Œºmol l respectively fig 3a after 15 days tce levels increased slowly due to the continuous inflow of contaminated water levels of final degradation products remained low changes in ce concentration and ph observed in well mw 33 following nzvi application were most likely caused by the vast volume of water injected into nearby wells only 2 m away which could have diluted the local groundwater and affected conditions in well mw 33 over the medium term distinct changes in all physico chemical parameters were observed in all wells after 100 days with a drop in ph and orp values fig 2 an increase in water conductivity fig s2 a 5 c decrease in temperature fig s1 and an increase in the concentration of ces fig 3 this was probably caused by a combination of two factors i e a 0 5 m increase in groundwater level in the aquifer fig s3 which could have resulted in washing of the unsaturated zone and degradation and passivation of the anodes resulting in a 50 decrease in the electric current fig s4 3 3 impact of nzvi ek treatment on native bacterial populations and degradation enzymes relative quantification based on qpcr data was used to evaluate the changes in bacterial populations and degradation enzymes following nzvi ek treatment in individual wells over time fig 4 presence of organohalide respiring bacteria of the genera desulfitobacterium and dehalococcoides and the functional vc reductase genes vcra and bvca was confirmed in inlet water from well mw 33 fig 4a however the abundance of organohalide respiring bacterial populations and degradation enzymes as well as total bacterial biomass was lower in the highly contaminated inlet water when compared with the aquifer and plume zone as clearly shown on ct values of each marker in different wells prior to nzvi ek treatment fig s5 total ce concentration reached 1 3 mmol l in well mw 33 while considerably lower levels were recorded in the other monitored wells fig 3 such high concentrations of ces could be toxic to microorganisms and inhibit their growth duhamel et al 2002 haest et al 2010 an exception was the tce dechlorinating genus desulfitobacterium which was more abundant in the inlet water from well mw 33 than in the wells situated downstream fig s5 this can be attributed to high concentrations of tce in mw 33 compared to low tce levels in other monitored wells interestingly a different response to nzvi application was observed in two application wells close to a cathode and an anode in well amw 57 situated near the cathode nzvi injection resulted in a severe reduction of total bacterial biomass eight days after application fig 4b such a rapid decrease can be explained by the nzvi suspension flushing out a significant portion of the microorganisms present moreover high doses of nzvi could be toxic to microorganisms in the short term bruton et al 2015 stefaniuk et al 2016 however the initial decline in bacterial biomass and all monitored markers was followed by a rapid recovery especially of dehalococcoides spp and both vc reductases indicating enhanced biotic reduction of ces the groundwater microbiome was restored within 15 days after the nzvi application and most notably the growth of organohalide respiring bacteria was enhanced the increase in bacterial biomass corresponded to increasing concentrations of ce degradation products fig 3b on the other hand no negative impact was observed on microorganisms eight days after nzvi injection in well amw 61 situated close to the anode fig 4d with dehalococcoides and desulfitobacterium spp even more abundant than before treatment electrolysis reactions constantly produce oxygen at the anode as well as hydrogen ions which can lower groundwater ph in the immediate vicinity hassan et al 2018 dissolved oxygen can react rapidly with nzvi resulting in decreasing toxicity towards microorganisms ƒçern√≠kov√° et al 2020 this effect together with new microorganisms carried into the well with groundwater flow could have caused rapid restoration of the microbial community following nzvi injection the treatment s impact on the abundance of cdce and vc oxidizing ethenotrophs and methanotrophs was assessed using markers for co metabolic oxidation of ces targeting the genes etnc etne mmox and pmoa encoding degradation enzymes clear differences were observed in the abundance of ethenotrophs and methanotrophs near the cathode and anode fig 5 in accordance with other monitored bacteria with a decrease in abundance observed in well amw 57 located near the cathode directly after application fig 5a populations of methanotrophs and ethenotrophs re established themselves within 35 days but remained at pre application levels due to a lack of dissolved oxygen a slight decrease in ethenotrophs and methanotrophs was observed in well aw5 61 after nzvi and dc application fig 5b but higher levels of dissolved oxygen resulting from water oxidation on the anode allowed for a higher proliferation of vc oxidizing bacteria after 35 days methanotrophs and ethenotrophs increased once again and ethenotroph levels especially remained up to 50 times higher compared to initial values until the end of the field study groundwater heterogeneity clearly supported divergent vc degradation processes anaerobic reductive degradation of vc produces ethene which is oxidized by ethenotrophs that can also degrade vc co metabolically atashgahi et al 2017 liang et al 2017 moreover hydrogen produced at the cathodes served as an electron donor for organohalide respiring bacteria while oxygen produced at the anodes promoted growth of bacteria capable of aerobic co metabolic vc oxidation ethenotrophs and methanotrophs mattes et al 2010 liang et al 2017 with the coupling of these two processes helping to completely clean the aquifer the remediation treatment had no negative impact on indigenous microorganisms in well mw 58 even though it was situated near the cathode fig 4c the treated water flowing through this well allowed for better growth of dehalococcoides spp while the presence of both vc reductases indicated complete removal of ces the high abundance of these markers corresponded with the high concentration of ce degradation products fig 3c desulfitobacterium sp has been shown to be highly successful at colonizing newly formed niches villemur et al 2006 after nzvi application the relative quantity of desulfitobacterium sp increased rapidly in the affected wells though they were soon outcompeted by more specialized organohalide respiring bacteria favored by conditions in the treated groundwater dehalococcoides spp and vc reductase genes were so abundant in the aquifer that they were able to buffer the diluting effect of rising groundwater levels 100 days after nzvi application and remained relatively stable until the end of the study fig 4 nzvi ek treatment elevated temperatures over the whole treated area by approximately 5 c fig s1 and this may also have accelerated ce biodegradation microbial activity is closely related to temperature and as such applying a dc current could represent a cost effective method for both heating the soil and promoting enzymatic activity especially in cold climates suni et al 2007 in this study injection of nzvi induced depletion of indigenous microorganisms in application wells near the cathode while the observed decrease in microbial biomass could have been caused by the high volume of injected nzvi solution diluting the groundwater the groundwater microbiome was re established within just eight and 15 days after nzvi application in wells amw 61 and amw 57 respectively fig 4d and b xiu et al 2010 also observed stimulation in the growth of a culture containing dehalococcoides spp after a short lag period when exposed to nzvi several studies have documented that microorganisms can be negatively affected when exposed to different nzvi particles however the toxic effect of nzvi has usually only been observed under laboratory conditions and on pure bacterial cultures lee et al 2008 diao and yao 2009 el temsah et al 2016 ≈°evc≈Ø et al 2017 in comparison microcosm scale tests on mixed bacterial cultures prove slightly more positive kirschling et al 2010 xiu et al 2010 while nzvi shell oxidation and coating with natural organic matter can rapidly reduce its toxicity under natural environmental conditions li et al 2010 bruton et al 2015 data from field experiments are still scarce but mostly show changes and shifts in the composition of bacterial communities generally speaking nzvi effect is highly dose and species dependent fajardo et al 2012 pawlett et al 2013 nƒõmeƒçek et al 2014 2016 lefevre et al 2016 nguyen et al 2018 and rapid recovery or even support of organohalide respiring bacteria has been reported in batch microcosms xiu et al 2010 and after field injection of nzvi stabilized with carboxymethyl cellulose kocur et al 2016 accordingly nzvi ek treatment appears to have no long term negative impacts on native bacterial populations while promoting the growth of ce degrading bacteria as clearly shown in this study 4 conclusions this long term field study demonstrates the great potential of the combined nzvi ek bioremediation approach for cleaning up aquifers highly polluted by ces nzvi ek treatment caused a rapid reduction in ces in the treated area and despite the constant inflow of contaminated water into the reactive zone high cdce degradation rates were observed throughout the experiment alongside increased production of the ce degradation products methane ethene and ethane long term reactivity of nzvi was successfully supported by ek treatment which additionally stimulated microbial degradation activity by elevating groundwater temperature the negative impact of nzvi application on indigenous microorganisms observed proved to be temporary as the microbiome was restored within 15 days moreover the established groundwater conditions promoted bioremediation organohalide respiring bacteria continued ce reduction even after partial nzvi exhaustion cdce and vc were also degraded by methanotrophs and ethenotrophs which were favored by the substantial levels of oxygen produced at the anodes our approach combining nzvi as a strong ce reducing agent and ek for supporting nzvi reactivity and mobility also promoted biodegradation and as such represents a suitable remediation strategy for cleaning sites highly polluted with ces to the best of our knowledge this study presents the first field scale long term exploration of native degrading bacterial population response to nzvi ek treatment author contributions all authors contributed to the writing of

18032,increasing attention has been focused on the removal of micropollutants from contaminated drinking source water however low rejection efficiency and membrane fouling still inhibit further application of nanofiltration membrane in this field interesting results were found that the residual hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles from supernatant after coagulation and sedimentation strongly improved the nanofiltration performance for micropollutant removal a simulated raw water containing humic acids micropollutants and kaolinite clay was employed to investigate the factors of water matrix affecting the nanoparticle enhanced nanofiltration for micropollutant removal results of experiments showed that these hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles easily induced the aggregation of bisphenol a bpa and humic acids in the supernatant the enhancement of bpa removal was mainly attributed to the repelling interaction between the al bpa doc complexity and in situ modified membrane surface during nanofiltration this in situ surface modification by the hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles improved membrane hydrophilicity roughness and positively charging capacity for the treatment of river songhua water spiked with micropollutant the percentage removal of bpa was improved to be 88 5 much more than the case of single nanofiltration without coagulation 60 7 meanwhile the membrane fouling was reduced by 2 13 times than the case of single nanofiltration without the dynamically deposited layer of nanoparticles this in situ modification of nanofiltration membrane by hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles achieved excellent removal efficiency for micropollutants from river songhua water background graphical abstract image 1 keywords aluminum nanoparticle in situ surface modification nanofiltration micropollutant removal membrane fouling 1 introduction micropollutants such as endocrine disrupting compounds edcs have been frequently detected in surface waters packages and soils li et al 2018a b lin et al 2019 moreman et al 2017 schwarzenbach et al 2006 they are easily released into drinking water sources and causes hazardous effects on human health including the decrease of immune function and increased probability of breast testicular cancer etc moreman et al 2017 nanofiltration membrane is capable of molecularly sieving these emerging edcs from contaminated drinking water wastewater and seawater aza√Øs et al 2016 li et al 2018a b lin 2017 wang et al 2018a b due to the low molecular weight cut off mwco 200 1000 da micropollutant removal is dependent on the pore size and charge characteristics of the nanofiltration membrane surface modification for the modulation of pore size and charge capacity is commonly conducted in the preparation process of polyamide nanofiltration membrane through an interfacial polymerization technique sulfonated polyarylene ether benzonitrile speb as a novel additive was used to modulate the pore size and stability of polyamide selective layer in nanofiltration membrane shi et al 2019 ion liquids and supramolecular cyclodextrin were also assembled onto the surface of tfc nanofiltration membrane xiao et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 due to the special host guest interaction the molecular separation accuracy of these membrane was greatly improved for different salts and small organic molecules recently deposition of nanoparticles graphene oxide mos2 metal organic frameworks etc onto membrane surface has been used to enhance the rejection of solutes and to reduce the membrane fouling liu et al 2019 wang et al 2018a b zirehpour et al 2017 the adopted methods of nanoparticle deposition include chemical grafting perreault et al 2014 sol gel coating nagasawa et al 2018 and atomic layer deposition zhou et al 2018 etc however these methods are usually complicated and difficult to be widely scaled up furthermore the deposition of nanoparticles often reduces the density of nanopores on membrane surface and in turn increases the energy consumption during nanofiltration process membrane fouling is still an obstacle during the nanofiltration process which is also affected by the coexistence of micropollutants in water comerton et al 2009 xu et al 2019 hydrophilic modification of membrane surface is an efficient measurement for the control of membrane fouling sun et al 2019 the hydrophilic surface facilitates the formation of an ultrathin layer of water molecules to resist the adhesion adsorption of hydrophobic substances onto the membrane surface however the surface modification would change the selectivity of membrane surface meanwhile membrane fouling by natural organic matter nom also changed the characteristics of membrane surface including hydrophilicity charges and mwco as a result the fouling layer of nom on nanofiltration membrane surface affected the rejections of edcs comerton et al 2009 li et al 2018a b lin 2017 it was attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonding hydrophobic adsorption electrostatic repulsion between edcs and the fouling layers of noms during nanofiltration albergamo et al 2019 fujioka et al 2018 2019 it was indicated that the characteristics of the fouling layer or deposited layer played great roles on the removal of micropollutants during long term operation of nanofiltration li et al 2018a b sch√§fer et al 2011 shen et al 2012 inspired by the abovementioned analyses constructing the dynamic layer of nanoparticles on membrane surface would be a better choice for enhancing the removal of micropollutants and the reduction of membrane fouling during nanofiltration coagulation is a potent method for reducing the silting density index sdi of feed water before entering into nanofiltration system keucken et al 2018 su et al 2017 recently nanoparticles of coagulant residuals were still observed in the supernatant after complete coagulation and sedimentation these particles were derived or detached from the crystallization process of settled sludge during coagulation wu et al 2019 yu et al 2018 in addition they may be the unsettled hydrolysates of aluminum salts in coagulated supernatant song et al 2019 combining the post streaming of nanofiltration it expectantly may be an in situ modification method for modulating membrane surface characteristics and improving micropollutant removal during nanofiltration in this work an in situ modified membrane by residual hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles was dynamically obtained during nanofiltration process for the first time owing to its lower molecular weight and higher pka value bisphenol a bpa is commonly difficult to remove through the current commercial nanofiltration membrane bpa was selected as the model micropollutant in this study morphologies and physicochemical characteristics of in situ modified membrane surface were identified by sem afm water contact angle and surface streaming potentials tests the mechanisms of enhanced performance on the bpa removal and reduction of membrane fouling during nanofiltration were demonstrated the feasibility of the in situ modified nanofiltration membrane was also assessed in the case of contaminated river water 2 materials and methods 2 1 membrane and reagents the nanofiltration membrane mwco 200da was purchased from guochu technology bisphenol a bpa was supplied by aladdin humic acid ha was purchased from aldrich sigma alcl3 6h2o and kaolinite clay were supplied by sinopharm chemical reagent corporation all these reagents were analytical grades deionized water was supplied by the milli q purification system 2 2 simulated raw water and river songhua water spiked with bpa the stock solution of bpa was set at 100 mg l in 1 l deionized water by the heating enhanced dissolution method the bpa solution was sonicated for 5 min and diluted to 500 Œºg l before nanofiltration in experiments the ph values of bpa solution were adjusted to the testing conditions ph 3 10 by hcl and naoh 0 1 mol l the simulated raw water in this work consisted of bpa humic acid ha and kaolinite the stock solution of ha 250 mg c l was obtained by the sequential washing of hcl naoh solution and filtrated by the membrane of 0 22 Œºm pore size tang et al 2006 the humic acid concentration which represents the doc content was set between 2 and 10 mg c l kaolinite concentration was set at 2 5 10 20 mg l to indicate the turbidity of simulated bpa bearing raw water the solution conductivity was modulated with cacl2 solution 20 mmol l river songhua water spiked with bpa was obtained through spiking 500 Œºg l of bpa into river songhua water china the detailed parameters was listed in table s1 doc uv254 ph and zeta potential in the river songhua water were almost not changed after the addition of bpa 2 3 coagulation process coagulation process was conducted by a six unit jar tester stock solution of alcl3 6h2o was set at 2 g al l coagulation process was programmed in three steps typically the water sample spiked with 4 mg al l of alcl3 6h2o solution was quickly stirred at 200 rpm for 2 min and then slowly stirred at 40 rpm for 15 min after the flocs formation these coagulated suspensions were settled for 30 min finally the supernatants after coagulation and sedimentation were obtained from the location below 2 3 cm of water level 15 cm height and 1 l volume for one jar and then flowed into the downstream nanofiltration process the coagulation process was conducted at 25 c and the ph values of solution were adjusted to the testing conditions ph 7 9 7 by hcl and naoh 0 1 mol l 2 4 nanofiltration protocol nanofiltration process was conducted in a laboratory scale filtration setup this setup was operated at the dead end mode and the effective filtration area was 17 cm2 wang et al 2012 the membrane was then set up into the filtration system and pre compacted under the pressure of 1 mpa for 4 h the simulated raw water was introduced into the filtration system under the pressure of 0 8 mpa for 2 h while the river songhua water spiked with bpa was operated for 24 h the dynamic water flux solute rejection and fouling potential in the nanofiltration processes with without coagulation were analyzed water flux j l m2 h1 was calculated as follow 1 j v a t where v l was the permeate volume a m2 was the effective membrane area t h was the operation time of membrane filtration the steady flux of deionized water during nanofiltration was denoted as j0 for comparison the normalized water flux j j0 was defined as the ratio of j and j0 percentage removal of solutes was determined as follow 2 percentage removal c c 0 c 0 100 where c c0 were bpa or doc concentrations at the end and initial stages of nanofiltration processes respectively a theory of cake filtration schippers and verdouw 1980 was used to differentiate the fouling mechanisms over the whole filtration period it assumed that particles were retained through membrane surface deposition membrane fouling profile could be plotted listiarini et al 2009 3 t v Œ∑i 2 Œ¥ pa 2 v Œ∑ r m Œ¥ pa where t second was the filtration time v ml was the permeate volume Œ∑ was the dynamic viscosity of water sample i was the fouling index p was the transmembrane pressure a was the effective membrane area the plot of t v versus v could be divided into three regions i pore blocking region ii uncompressed cake layer formation region and iii compressed cake layer region membrane fouling index was defined as the gradient of t v versus v of the uncompressed cake layer formation region in the plot

kcl solution or coagulated supernatants were used as the electrolyte solution in the measurements surface morphology was characterized by scanning electrical microscopy sem su8010 hitachi surface roughness was measured by atomic force microscopy afm dimension icon bruker under the tapping mode aluminum deposited amounts on membrane surfaces were detected after the hydraulic cleaning of membrane surface with 50 ml hcl solution 0 01 mol l the dissolved aluminum solution ph 2 was filtrated with the glass fiber membrane of 0 22 Œºm pore size which was injected into the icp mass system nexion 300q perkinelmer under the protection of argon gas diluted water samples of organic foulants on membrane surfaces were obtained through naoh and hcl elution 0 01 mol l 50 ml with sonication the fouling layer on the membrane surface was rinsed in deionized water solution for 10 min to remove the unattached foulants after that the membrane was rinsed in the naoh solution 0 01 mol l ph 12 with sonication for 20 min the eluent neutralized with the hcl solution 0 01 mol l was used for measuring the content of organic foulants 2 6 analytical methods of water samples the bpa concentration was determined through high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2487 at Œª 276 nm with mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min li et al 2018a b the mobile phase contained 0 1 of methanol and acetic acid with the ratio of 65 35 v v sample volume was 100 Œºl and the retention time of bpa was 5 3 min fluorescent composition in water samples was analyzed by excitation emission matrix

nano zs90 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of residual aluminum hydrolysates on bpa removal during nanofiltration as we known the turbidity of feed water entering into nanofiltration system should meet the standard of silting density index sdi 3 for the standard of nanofiltration membrane in this work this is beneficial for reducing the membrane fouling caused by colloidal substances in this work the simulated raw water contained bpa humic acids and kaolinite the sdi value was 8 4 through the method of astm 4189 95 the effects of alcl3 h2o dosage on bpa removal during nanofiltration of the supernatant after coagulation were shown in fig 1 a pre coagulation could greatly reduce the turbidity of the simulated raw water fig s1 the sdi value of the supernatant was only 0 63 much less than the standard of sdi however the percentage removal trend of bpa by coagulation approached a plateau when the dosage of alcl3 6h2o was more than 4 mg al l this result indicated that only the part of bpa adsorbed onto the residuals of aluminum humic acids was removed since the percentage removal of bpa from deionized water could be neglected 8 during coagulation it was much less than the percentage removal of bpa 60 7 shown by the red dashed line in fig 1 a from deionized water by the single nanofiltration due to the molecular sieving effect k√∂hler et al 2016 in the simulated raw water the percentage removal of bpa by single nanofiltration increased up to 68 2 which was larger than that from deionized water this increment of removal efficiency indicated that bpa and residual humic acids in the supernatant were complexed to some extent as the dosage of alcl3 6h2o increased the percentage removal of bpa gradually increased to 88 9 it demonstrated the complexity formation among residual aluminum hydrolysates bpa and humic acids al bpa doc in the supernatant the enhanced removal of bpa was associated with both the complexed state of bpa in the supernatants and the dynamic changes of membrane surface characteristics the relationships of bpa removal doc removal and aluminum deposited amount on membrane surface were shown in fig 1 b the percentage removal of bpa increased with the gradual increments of the percentage removal of doc based on the black dashed line in fig 1 b the removal efficiencies of bpa and doc were compared and correlated when the dosage of alcl3 6h2o increased this positive proportion of bpa and doc removals was changing from 1 27 to 1 17 it indirectly demonstrated that humic acids in the simulated raw water as the complexed carrier accelerated the bpa removal during nanofiltration of supernatants meanwhile the amount of aluminum deposited on membrane surface increased from 1 22 Œºg cm2 to 3 12 Œºg cm2 respectively the dynamic deposition of residual aluminum hydrolysates was beneficial for removing the al bpa ha complexity from the supernatants after coagulation and sedimentation 3 2 effects of residual aluminum hydrolysates on membrane fouling pre coagulation is often used to mitigate the fouling of ultrafiltration membrane li et al 2019 wang et al 2019 but there is not any report on the case of nanofiltration membrane fouling so far the major misgiving is about the colloidal fouling by the residual particles of coagulant hydrolysates however our primary experimental results confirmed that these residual aluminum hydrolysates in supernatants only reduced 4 2 of water flux it was even less than the 9 2 reduction of water flux caused by bpa during nanofiltration the membrane fouling developments during nanofiltration of the simulated raw water and the supernatant after coagulation were represented in fig 2 obviously 68 6 of water flux maintained at the end nanofiltration of the supernatant after coagulation which was about 1 18 times than that of simulated raw water after carefully cleaning the doc content on the fouled membrane surface was 6 65 Œºg cm2 during nanofiltration of the simulated raw water the severe fouling was ascribed to the small molecular size and hydrophobicity of humic acids in the simulated raw water cort√©s francisco et al 2014 khan et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 oppositely the amount of aluminum deposited on the fouled membrane surface was 1 51 Œºg cm2 during nanofiltration of the supernatant after coagulation meanwhile the doc content on the membrane surface was only 0 54 Œºg cm2 the greatly alleviated fouling was benefited from the interactions between al bpa doc complexity and aluminum deposited membrane in addition the characteristics of aluminum deposited membrane surface also significantly contributed to fouling mitigation 3 3 characteristics of hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles from supernatant after coagulation and sedimentation to clarify the formation of al bpa doc complexity the characteristics of residual aluminum hydrolysates in the supernatants were investigated and the results were shown in fig 3 the zeta potential and size distribution of these particles were both dependent on the dosage of alcl3 6h2o as shown in fig 3 a the zeta potential of the simulated raw water was initially 62 mv due to the negatively charged characters of humic acids and kaolinite colloids when the alcl3 6h2o was added the zeta potential of the supernatant after coagulation and sedimentation was gradually increased as the dosage was above 4 mg al l the zeta potentials of these supernatants were all above 2 53 mv the highest potential was up to 8 93 mv at the dosage of 12 mg al l meanwhile the ph values of supernatants were gradually decreased from 7 2 to 6 3 the slight acidic properties of supernatants were attributed to the hydrolysis effects of alcl3 6h2o positively charged characteristics of supernatants were the synergistic results of residual aluminum hydrolysates and unsettled bpa humic acids these residual aluminum hydrolysates were also observed in the aged supernatants after coagulation and sedimentation of ferric salt yu et al 2018 in order to identify the nanoscale characters of residual aluminum hydrolysates the size distributions of the supernatants after coagulation and sedimentation were further characterized in fig 3 b the particle sizes increased from 28 3 nm to 112 5 nm when the dosages of alcl3 6h2o increased from 0 4 mg al l to 4 mg al l however the particle size decreased to 70 9 nm at the 8 mg al l dosage of alcl3 6h2o this phenomenon was related to both the detached flocs from settled coagulants and in situ hydrolysis of residual aluminum salt in the supernatants obviously they were both much less than the size 2 61 Œºm of colloidal particles in the simulated raw water unsettled bpa and humic acids were adsorbed onto these residual nanoparticles through the electrostatic interaction this adsorption behavior resulted in a more larger size of hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles than that reported in the aged supernatants yu et al 2018 based on the results of zeta potentials and particle size the optimal amount of alcl3 6h2o for the next experiments was 4 mg al l 3 4 effects of hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles on the characteristics of membrane surface it s well known that there are substantial amounts of carboxyl groups on the polyamide membrane surface due to the hydrolysis of unreacted acyl chloride during preparation process chen et al 2017 werber et al 2017 polyamide nanofiltration membrane surface is commonly negatively charged therefore we believed that these carboxyl enhanced negative surfaces was more beneficial to the in situ adhesion of positively charged aluminum residuals during nanofiltration the morphology of membrane surface during nanofiltration of the supernatant after coagulation was compared with the original polyamide membrane fig 4 a after coagulation of the simulated raw water there was still uneven and porous nanoclusters on the membrane surface fig 4 c during nanofiltration of the supernatant the colloidal and doc concentration of the supernatant were very low shown in fig s1 and met the standards of drinking water in china therefore this discontinuous patch on membrane surface was considered as the deposition of positively charged aluminum particles through electrostatic attraction this patch was further identified from the high roughness spots in fig 4 d the average roughness ra 15 9 nm of the aluminum deposited membrane was only slightly larger than that ra 12 8 nm of the original membrane shown in fig 4 b it indirectly demonstrated the discontinuity of dynamic deposition of residual aluminum nanoparticles on membrane surface the roughness changes of membrane surface during nanofiltration played important roles on the membrane hydrophilicity and fouling potentials to evaluate the adhesion stability of aluminum deposition the surface streaming potentials of the original membrane and al deposited membrane were measured and compared in fig 5 a the original membrane showed negatively charged property under neutral and alkaline environments based on the black dashed line its isoelectric point phiec was at ph 5 2 differently the surface streaming potentials of al deposited membrane increased from 2 46 mv to 4 55 mv when the ph values of testing solution changed from 5 5 to 7 in this ph range the surface streaming potentials of the original membrane decreased from 3 4 mv to 13 5 mv due to the deprotonation of the carboxyl groups and the adsorption of anions oh these positively charged property further demonstrated the stability of aluminum deposition on membrane surface at ph 5 5 7 when the testing solution turned to be acid less than ph 5 the original and aluminum deposited membranes represented similar positively charged property this was attributed to the dissolution of aluminum depositions away from the membrane surface at acidic conditions oppositely these aluminum depositions were continuously hydrolyzed at alkaline conditions more than ph 8 however the compensation effects of positively charged aluminum depositions only weakened the negatively charging capacity of nanofiltration membrane surface considering the pka bpa is about 9 6 shown in the red dashed line the aluminum deposited membrane may be beneficial for the removal of bpa through electrostatic repelling interaction at acidic and neutral conditions consequently the surface hydrophilicities were changed with the dynamic aluminum deposited amounts on membrane surfaces as shown in fig 5 b with the increase of alcl3 6h2o dosages the aluminum deposited amounts on membrane surfaces gradually increased from 1 22 Œºg cm2 to 3 12 Œºg cm2 meanwhile the water contact angles on membrane surfaces decreased from 53 4 to 27 9 due to the intrinsic hydrophilicity of hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles under these conditions slightly higher extent of roughness on aluminum deposited membranes further reduced the water contact angles the enhanced hydrophilicity of aluminum deposited membranes facilitated the improvements of fouling resistance and bpa removal acero et al 2016 deng et al 2019 ma et al 2018 3 5 mechanisms of the enhancement of bpa removal and reduction of membrane fouling the mechanism of bpa removal enhanced by hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles in the supernatant was further confirmed through changing the factors of water matrix ph conductivity and turbidity in the simulated raw water as shown in fig 6 a the percentage removal of bpa by coagulation was only 40 1 under neutral condition it was almost not improved even when the ph value of simulated raw water increased to 9 7 however the percentage removal of bpa by aluminum deposited membrane was improved from 61 5 to 77 3 when the ph values changed from ph 7 to 9 7 meanwhile the percentage removal of doc was also enhanced from 60 to 81 7 which was shown in fig s2 it further confirmed the synergistic effect of bpa and doc removal during nanofiltration enhanced by the residual hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles the enhancement of bpa removal was dependent on the species of bpa and the charging capacities of aluminum deposited membrane in the different ph range the negatively charging capacities of supernatants and membrane surface were both obviously enhanced when the ph values of supernatants increased from 7 to 9 7 fig 5 a as a result the negatively charged repulsion interaction between them was enhanced and the removals of bpa and doc were both improved correspondingly the complexity of ca2 and humic acids was significant to bpa removal by nanofiltration which was present in fig 6 b when the solution conductivity increased from 0 4 ms cm to 0 8 ms cm the percentage removal of bpa decreased from 79 3 to 52 9 similar results were also reported on the removal of pharmaceutical active compounds by nanofiltration of secondary effluents li et al 2018a b xu et al 2019 ca2 caused the release of bpa from the complexity of al bpa doc due to its strong complexing ability as a result the percentage removal of doc increased from 64 4 to 73 1 the stability of al bpa doc complexity greatly affected the removal of bpa during nanofiltration of supernatants when the addition of kaolinite increased from 2 mg l to 20 mg l the percentage removal of bpa by aluminum deposited membrane reduced from 73 1 to 57 3 as shown in fig 6 c the addition of kaolinite disrupted the positively charged repulsion between the al bpa doc complexity and aluminum deposited membrane qin et al 2018 xu et al 2017 with the increase of kaolinite addition the zeta potentials of supernatants always maintained among 2 3 mv however the surface streaming potential of aluminum deposited membrane turned from 4 55 mv to 14 3 mv due to the partial deposition of kaolinite onto membrane surface this negative potential was less than that of nanofiltration membrane 23 8 mv independent of kaolinite addition in the range of kaolinite addition the percentage removal of bpa by coagulation increased from 4 8 to 40 9 and finally decreased to 22 1 it was the synergistic result of colloidal sedimentation and bpa release in the supernatants simultaneous mitigation of bpa and membrane fouling during nanofiltration of the supernatant after coagulation and sedimentation was illustrated in scheme 1 the enhancements of bpa removal and the greatly alleviated fouling was benefited from the positively charged repulsion between al bpa doc complexity and aluminum deposited membrane in addition the improved hydrophilicity of membrane surface fig 5 b also significantly contributed to the fouling mitigation 3 6 long term treatment performance of river songhua water spiked with micropollutant 3 6 1 bpa removal performance for comparison the bpa contents in coagulated supernatant and al deposited membrane permeate were both normalized to the initial concentration 500 Œºg l in the contaminated river water as shown in fig 7 a the bpa in coagulated supernatant was still as high as 65 7 of the initial content in contaminated river water this result indicated that coagulation did not work effectively for bpa removal obviously there was the least bpa residual 11 5 in the permeate of al deposited membrane during nanofiltration of the supernatant after coagulation this result was even much less than the residual concentration 32 8 of bpa in the permeate during nanofiltration of contaminated river water without coagulation it was firmly identified that the residual hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles could enhance the removal of bpa by nanofiltration these results were in agreement with the cases of simulated raw water containing bpa similar with the role of humic acids in the simulated raw water the doc content in the contaminated river water was believed to play important roles on the bpa removal listiarini et al 2010 yu et al 2016 as shown in fig 7 b the doc content in the permeate was further reduced to 1 08 mg l after nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant it was nearly adapted to the quick reference guide of disinfection by products dbps 2 mg l agency 2010 as a sensitive indicator of dpbs precursors phungsai et al 2018 uv254 content was also minimized to 0 019 cm 1 these lower organic contents would facilitate to inhibit the massive production of dbps during chlorination process bond et al 2010 jeong et al 2015 k√∂hler et al 2016 phungsai et al 2018 plewa et al 2008 based on the ratio of percentage removal the positive proportion of bpa and doc removals was 1 09 while that value of bpa and uv254 removals was 1 07 all of these were less than the case 1 17 1 27 of simulated raw water containing bpa demonstrating the stronger complexity of al bpa doc in the contaminated river water 3 6 2 analysis of doc components in al bpa doc complexity reduction of fluorescence intensity at specific peaks a c t1 and t2 in eem was used to differentiate the corresponding doc components in al bpa doc complexity and membrane permeate comparing to the contaminated river water fig 8 a 50 2 of humic like substances c and 50 6 of tryptophan like components t1 and t2 derived from soluble microbial products smps were removed by coagulation fig 8 b as shown in fig 8 c direct nanofiltration removed 65 6 of humic like substances c and 48 2 of fulvic like substances a which was more than those of coagulation the percentage removal of humic like c and fulvic like substances a in fig 8 d were 86 6 and 90 1 during nanofiltration of the supernatant after coagulation the increased removal of doc components was attributed to the enhanced membrane rejection of al bpa doc complexity compared to the percentage removal of c and d 21 of humic like and 41 9 of fulvic like substances contributed to the formation of al bpa doc complexity components of membrane permeates were analyzed through the normalization of peak intensity by the peak c since the component of humic like substance peak c was widely detected in surface water chen et al 2003 henderson et al 2009 in table s2 the smallest ratio of peak a c and largest ratio of peak t1 c were both obtained in the permeate during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant the intensity ratio of peak t1 c referred to the ratio of biodegradable and non biodegradable components in doc these two ratios indicated that the most of fluorescence substances were biodegradable components in the permeate during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant in addition the largest ratio of peak t2 c listed in the last column of table s2 further identified the dominant contribution of soluble microbial products smps in the permeate during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant in addition blue red shifts of peak locations were related with the variation of doc concentration and structure these changes also determined the complexing capability among residual aluminum nanoparticles doc components and bpa qin et al 2018 in addition the foulants on membrane surfaces were obtained by washing with sodium hydroxide solution and characterized by eem spectroscopy in fig s3 in agreement with the results of fig 8 protein substance was the dominant contributor of membrane fouling comparing to the case of contaminated river water the fluorescent intensities of peaks t1 and t2 were reduced by 76 1 and 73 7 during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant the less membrane fouling was dependent on the structure and charge of residual aluminum nanoparticles on membrane surface similarly it was reported that micropollutants deposited on membrane surface could reduce the membrane fouling during nanofiltration due to the increased charges on membrane surface li et al 2018a b 3 6 3 antifouling performance the membrane fouling developments during the nanofiltration of river songhua water spiked with bpa and coagulated supernatant were represented in fig 9 a obviously the normalized water flux was also maintained at 85 5 at the end nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant it was about 2 13 times than the case of the contaminated river water moreover it was also much higher than that of the simulated raw water containing bpa 68 6 shown in fig 2 it was explained that the diverse compositions of organic substances facilitated the formation of al bpa doc complexity in the contaminated river water results of membrane fouling profiles were simulated and analyzed in fig 9 b through a theory of cake filtration listiarini et al 2010 schippers and verdouw 1980 where the foulants were retained on the membrane surface by the surface deposition only the regions of pore blocking and uncompressed cake formation were found during the nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant an additional region of compressed cake layer was found during nanofiltration of contaminated river water at the beginning of filtration the slower development of pore blocking region demonstrated that the fouling potential was low during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant meanwhile membrane fouling index in the uncompressed cake region linear simulation region was 0 11 during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant much less than that 0 23 of contaminated river water the emerging region of compressed cake layer further indicated that fouling potential was larger during nanofiltration of contaminated river water which was not developed during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant the morphology and roughness of foulant layers on membrane surfaces were shown in fig s4 a dense thick layer was observed on the cracked location of membrane surface during nanofiltration of contaminated river water oppositely only a porous thin layer with small particle size was observed on the membrane surface during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant less fouling occurred in this layer surface roughness also changed with the extent of membrane fouling the average roughness of membrane surfaces approached 48 3 nm and 23 1 nm during nanofiltration of contaminated river water and coagulation supernatant the relatively smoother surface further demonstrated less fouling potential of coagulated supernatant 4 conclusions the residual hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles in the coagulated supernatant were dynamically deposited onto membrane surface during nanofiltration in the simulated raw water containing bpa and humic acid and kaolinite clay the percentage of bpa removal was improved from 60 7 to 88 9 when the ph was adjusted from neutral to alkaline in the long term operation of river songhua water spiked with micropollutant only 11 5 of bpa was remained in the permeate during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant simultaneously along with only 14 5 of reduction of normalized water flux aluminum deposited membrane enhanced the micropollutant removal through the electrostatic repelling interaction the water contact angles on membrane surfaces decreased from 53 4 to 27 9 further alleviating the organic fouling the dominated fouling of protein like substances was identified by excitation emission matrix eems spectra simultaneous abatement of micropollutant doc and membrane fouling was demonstrated effectively through the in situ modification of membrane surface during nanofiltration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18032,increasing attention has been focused on the removal of micropollutants from contaminated drinking source water however low rejection efficiency and membrane fouling still inhibit further application of nanofiltration membrane in this field interesting results were found that the residual hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles from supernatant after coagulation and sedimentation strongly improved the nanofiltration performance for micropollutant removal a simulated raw water containing humic acids micropollutants and kaolinite clay was employed to investigate the factors of water matrix affecting the nanoparticle enhanced nanofiltration for micropollutant removal results of experiments showed that these hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles easily induced the aggregation of bisphenol a bpa and humic acids in the supernatant the enhancement of bpa removal was mainly attributed to the repelling interaction between the al bpa doc complexity and in situ modified membrane surface during nanofiltration this in situ surface modification by the hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles improved membrane hydrophilicity roughness and positively charging capacity for the treatment of river songhua water spiked with micropollutant the percentage removal of bpa was improved to be 88 5 much more than the case of single nanofiltration without coagulation 60 7 meanwhile the membrane fouling was reduced by 2 13 times than the case of single nanofiltration without the dynamically deposited layer of nanoparticles this in situ modification of nanofiltration membrane by hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles achieved excellent removal efficiency for micropollutants from river songhua water background graphical abstract image 1 keywords aluminum nanoparticle in situ surface modification nanofiltration micropollutant removal membrane fouling 1 introduction micropollutants such as endocrine disrupting compounds edcs have been frequently detected in surface waters packages and soils li et al 2018a b lin et al 2019 moreman et al 2017 schwarzenbach et al 2006 they are easily released into drinking water sources and causes hazardous effects on human health including the decrease of immune function and increased probability of breast testicular cancer etc moreman et al 2017 nanofiltration membrane is capable of molecularly sieving these emerging edcs from contaminated drinking water wastewater and seawater aza√Øs et al 2016 li et al 2018a b lin 2017 wang et al 2018a b due to the low molecular weight cut off mwco 200 1000 da micropollutant removal is dependent on the pore size and charge characteristics of the nanofiltration membrane surface modification for the modulation of pore size and charge capacity is commonly conducted in the preparation process of polyamide nanofiltration membrane through an interfacial polymerization technique sulfonated polyarylene ether benzonitrile speb as a novel additive was used to modulate the pore size and stability of polyamide selective layer in nanofiltration membrane shi et al 2019 ion liquids and supramolecular cyclodextrin were also assembled onto the surface of tfc nanofiltration membrane xiao et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 due to the special host guest interaction the molecular separation accuracy of these membrane was greatly improved for different salts and small organic molecules recently deposition of nanoparticles graphene oxide mos2 metal organic frameworks etc onto membrane surface has been used to enhance the rejection of solutes and to reduce the membrane fouling liu et al 2019 wang et al 2018a b zirehpour et al 2017 the adopted methods of nanoparticle deposition include chemical grafting perreault et al 2014 sol gel coating nagasawa et al 2018 and atomic layer deposition zhou et al 2018 etc however these methods are usually complicated and difficult to be widely scaled up furthermore the deposition of nanoparticles often reduces the density of nanopores on membrane surface and in turn increases the energy consumption during nanofiltration process membrane fouling is still an obstacle during the nanofiltration process which is also affected by the coexistence of micropollutants in water comerton et al 2009 xu et al 2019 hydrophilic modification of membrane surface is an efficient measurement for the control of membrane fouling sun et al 2019 the hydrophilic surface facilitates the formation of an ultrathin layer of water molecules to resist the adhesion adsorption of hydrophobic substances onto the membrane surface however the surface modification would change the selectivity of membrane surface meanwhile membrane fouling by natural organic matter nom also changed the characteristics of membrane surface including hydrophilicity charges and mwco as a result the fouling layer of nom on nanofiltration membrane surface affected the rejections of edcs comerton et al 2009 li et al 2018a b lin 2017 it was attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonding hydrophobic adsorption electrostatic repulsion between edcs and the fouling layers of noms during nanofiltration albergamo et al 2019 fujioka et al 2018 2019 it was indicated that the characteristics of the fouling layer or deposited layer played great roles on the removal of micropollutants during long term operation of nanofiltration li et al 2018a b sch√§fer et al 2011 shen et al 2012 inspired by the abovementioned analyses constructing the dynamic layer of nanoparticles on membrane surface would be a better choice for enhancing the removal of micropollutants and the reduction of membrane fouling during nanofiltration coagulation is a potent method for reducing the silting density index sdi of feed water before entering into nanofiltration system keucken et al 2018 su et al 2017 recently nanoparticles of coagulant residuals were still observed in the supernatant after complete coagulation and sedimentation these particles were derived or detached from the crystallization process of settled sludge during coagulation wu et al 2019 yu et al 2018 in addition they may be the unsettled hydrolysates of aluminum salts in coagulated supernatant song et al 2019 combining the post streaming of nanofiltration it expectantly may be an in situ modification method for modulating membrane surface characteristics and improving micropollutant removal during nanofiltration in this work an in situ modified membrane by residual hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles was dynamically obtained during nanofiltration process for the first time owing to its lower molecular weight and higher pka value bisphenol a bpa is commonly difficult to remove through the current commercial nanofiltration membrane bpa was selected as the model micropollutant in this study morphologies and physicochemical characteristics of in situ modified membrane surface were identified by sem afm water contact angle and surface streaming potentials tests the mechanisms of enhanced performance on the bpa removal and reduction of membrane fouling during nanofiltration were demonstrated the feasibility of the in situ modified nanofiltration membrane was also assessed in the case of contaminated river water 2 materials and methods 2 1 membrane and reagents the nanofiltration membrane mwco 200da was purchased from guochu technology bisphenol a bpa was supplied by aladdin humic acid ha was purchased from aldrich sigma alcl3 6h2o and kaolinite clay were supplied by sinopharm chemical reagent corporation all these reagents were analytical grades deionized water was supplied by the milli q purification system 2 2 simulated raw water and river songhua water spiked with bpa the stock solution of bpa was set at 100 mg l in 1 l deionized water by the heating enhanced dissolution method the bpa solution was sonicated for 5 min and diluted to 500 Œºg l before nanofiltration in experiments the ph values of bpa solution were adjusted to the testing conditions ph 3 10 by hcl and naoh 0 1 mol l the simulated raw water in this work consisted of bpa humic acid ha and kaolinite the stock solution of ha 250 mg c l was obtained by the sequential washing of hcl naoh solution and filtrated by the membrane of 0 22 Œºm pore size tang et al 2006 the humic acid concentration which represents the doc content was set between 2 and 10 mg c l kaolinite concentration was set at 2 5 10 20 mg l to indicate the turbidity of simulated bpa bearing raw water the solution conductivity was modulated with cacl2 solution 20 mmol l river songhua water spiked with bpa was obtained through spiking 500 Œºg l of bpa into river songhua water china the detailed parameters was listed in table s1 doc uv254 ph and zeta potential in the river songhua water were almost not changed after the addition of bpa 2 3 coagulation process coagulation process was conducted by a six unit jar tester stock solution of alcl3 6h2o was set at 2 g al l coagulation process was programmed in three steps typically the water sample spiked with 4 mg al l of alcl3 6h2o solution was quickly stirred at 200 rpm for 2 min and then slowly stirred at 40 rpm for 15 min after the flocs formation these coagulated suspensions were settled for 30 min finally the supernatants after coagulation and sedimentation were obtained from the location below 2 3 cm of water level 15 cm height and 1 l volume for one jar and then flowed into the downstream nanofiltration process the coagulation process was conducted at 25 c and the ph values of solution were adjusted to the testing conditions ph 7 9 7 by hcl and naoh 0 1 mol l 2 4 nanofiltration protocol nanofiltration process was conducted in a laboratory scale filtration setup this setup was operated at the dead end mode and the effective filtration area was 17 cm2 wang et al 2012 the membrane was then set up into the filtration system and pre compacted under the pressure of 1 mpa for 4 h the simulated raw water was introduced into the filtration system under the pressure of 0 8 mpa for 2 h while the river songhua water spiked with bpa was operated for 24 h the dynamic water flux solute rejection and fouling potential in the nanofiltration processes with without coagulation were analyzed water flux j l m2 h1 was calculated as follow 1 j v a t where v l was the permeate volume a m2 was the effective membrane area t h was the operation time of membrane filtration the steady flux of deionized water during nanofiltration was denoted as j0 for comparison the normalized water flux j j0 was defined as the ratio of j and j0 percentage removal of solutes was determined as follow 2 percentage removal c c 0 c 0 100 where c c0 were bpa or doc concentrations at the end and initial stages of nanofiltration processes respectively a theory of cake filtration schippers and verdouw 1980 was used to differentiate the fouling mechanisms over the whole filtration period it assumed that particles were retained through membrane surface deposition membrane fouling profile could be plotted listiarini et al 2009 3 t v Œ∑i 2 Œ¥ pa 2 v Œ∑ r m Œ¥ pa where t second was the filtration time v ml was the permeate volume Œ∑ was the dynamic viscosity of water sample i was the fouling index p was the transmembrane pressure a was the effective membrane area the plot of t v versus v could be divided into three regions i pore blocking region ii uncompressed cake layer formation region and iii compressed cake layer region membrane fouling index was defined as the gradient of t v versus v of the uncompressed cake layer formation region in the plot listiarini et al 2009 2 5 membrane characterization surface streaming potential of nanofiltration membrane was measured through a method reported in our previous works zhang et al 2016a 2016b 1 mmol l kcl solution or coagulated supernatants were used as the electrolyte solution in the measurements surface morphology was characterized by scanning electrical microscopy sem su8010 hitachi surface roughness was measured by atomic force microscopy afm dimension icon bruker under the tapping mode aluminum deposited amounts on membrane surfaces were detected after the hydraulic cleaning of membrane surface with 50 ml hcl solution 0 01 mol l the dissolved aluminum solution ph 2 was filtrated with the glass fiber membrane of 0 22 Œºm pore size which was injected into the icp mass system nexion 300q perkinelmer under the protection of argon gas diluted water samples of organic foulants on membrane surfaces were obtained through naoh and hcl elution 0 01 mol l 50 ml with sonication the fouling layer on the membrane surface was rinsed in deionized water solution for 10 min to remove the unattached foulants after that the membrane was rinsed in the naoh solution 0 01 mol l ph 12 with sonication for 20 min the eluent neutralized with the hcl solution 0 01 mol l was used for measuring the content of organic foulants 2 6 analytical methods of water samples the bpa concentration was determined through high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2487 at Œª 276 nm with mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min li et al 2018a b the mobile phase contained 0 1 of methanol and acetic acid with the ratio of 65 35 v v sample volume was 100 Œºl and the retention time of bpa was 5 3 min fluorescent composition in water samples was analyzed by excitation emission matrix

nano zs90 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of residual aluminum hydrolysates on bpa removal during nanofiltration as we known the turbidity of feed water entering into nanofiltration system should meet the standard of silting density index sdi 3 for the standard of nanofiltration membrane in this work this is beneficial for reducing the membrane fouling caused by colloidal substances in this work the simulated raw water contained bpa humic acids and kaolinite the sdi value was 8 4 through the method of astm 4189 95 the effects of alcl3 h2o dosage on bpa removal during nanofiltration of the supernatant after coagulation were shown in fig 1 a pre coagulation could greatly reduce the turbidity of the simulated raw water fig s1 the sdi value of the supernatant was only 0 63 much less than the standard of sdi however the percentage removal trend of bpa by coagulation approached a plateau when the dosage of alcl3 6h2o was more than 4 mg al l this result indicated that only the part of bpa adsorbed onto the residuals of aluminum humic acids was removed since the percentage removal of bpa from deionized water could be neglected 8 during coagulation it was much less than the percentage removal of bpa 60 7 shown by the red dashed line in fig 1 a from deionized water by the single nanofiltration due to the molecular sieving effect k√∂hler et al 2016 in the simulated raw water the percentage removal of bpa by single nanofiltration increased up to 68 2 which was larger than that from deionized water this increment of removal efficiency indicated that bpa and residual humic acids in the supernatant were complexed to some extent as the dosage of alcl3 6h2o increased the percentage removal of bpa gradually increased to 88 9 it demonstrated the complexity formation among residual aluminum hydrolysates bpa and humic acids al bpa doc in the supernatant the enhanced removal of bpa was associated with both the complexed state of bpa in the supernatants and the dynamic changes of membrane surface characteristics the relationships of bpa removal doc removal and aluminum deposited amount on membrane surface were shown in fig 1 b the percentage removal of bpa increased with the gradual increments of the percentage removal of doc based on the black dashed line in fig 1 b the removal efficiencies of bpa and doc were compared and correlated when the dosage of alcl3 6h2o increased this positive proportion of bpa and doc removals was changing from 1 27 to 1 17 it indirectly demonstrated that humic acids in the simulated raw water as the complexed carrier accelerated the bpa removal during nanofiltration of supernatants meanwhile the amount of aluminum deposited on membrane surface increased from 1 22 Œºg cm2 to 3 12 Œºg cm2 respectively the dynamic deposition of residual aluminum hydrolysates was beneficial for removing the al bpa ha complexity from the supernatants after coagulation and sedimentation 3 2 effects of residual aluminum hydrolysates on membrane fouling pre coagulation is often used to mitigate the fouling of ultrafiltration membrane li et al 2019 wang et al 2019 but there is not any report on the case of nanofiltration membrane fouling so far the major misgiving is about the colloidal fouling by the residual particles of coagulant hydrolysates however our primary experimental results confirmed that these residual aluminum hydrolysates in supernatants only reduced 4 2 of water flux it was even less than the 9 2 reduction of water flux caused by bpa during nanofiltration the membrane fouling developments during nanofiltration of the simulated raw water and the supernatant after coagulation were represented in fig 2 obviously 68 6 of water flux maintained at the end nanofiltration of the supernatant after coagulation which was about 1 18 times than that of simulated raw water after carefully cleaning the doc content on the fouled membrane surface was 6 65 Œºg cm2 during nanofiltration of the simulated raw water the severe fouling was ascribed to the small molecular size and hydrophobicity of humic acids in the simulated raw water cort√©s francisco et al 2014 khan et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 oppositely the amount of aluminum deposited on the fouled membrane surface was 1 51 Œºg cm2 during nanofiltration of the supernatant after coagulation meanwhile the doc content on the membrane surface was only 0 54 Œºg cm2 the greatly alleviated fouling was benefited from the interactions between al bpa doc complexity and aluminum deposited membrane in addition the characteristics of aluminum deposited membrane surface also significantly contributed to fouling mitigation 3 3 characteristics of hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles from supernatant after coagulation and sedimentation to clarify the formation of al bpa doc complexity the characteristics of residual aluminum hydrolysates in the supernatants were investigated and the results were shown in fig 3 the zeta potential and size distribution of these particles were both dependent on the dosage of alcl3 6h2o as shown in fig 3 a the zeta potential of the simulated raw water was initially 62 mv due to the negatively charged characters of humic acids and kaolinite colloids when the alcl3 6h2o was added the zeta potential of the supernatant after coagulation and sedimentation was gradually increased as the dosage was above 4 mg al l the zeta potentials of these supernatants were all above 2 53 mv the highest potential was up to 8 93 mv at the dosage of 12 mg al l meanwhile the ph values of supernatants were gradually decreased from 7 2 to 6 3 the slight acidic properties of supernatants were attributed to the hydrolysis effects of alcl3 6h2o positively charged characteristics of supernatants were the synergistic results of residual aluminum hydrolysates and unsettled bpa humic acids these residual aluminum hydrolysates were also observed in the aged supernatants after coagulation and sedimentation of ferric salt yu et al 2018 in order to identify the nanoscale characters of residual aluminum hydrolysates the size distributions of the supernatants after coagulation and sedimentation were further characterized in fig 3 b the particle sizes increased from 28 3 nm to 112 5 nm when the dosages of alcl3 6h2o increased from 0 4 mg al l to 4 mg al l however the particle size decreased to 70 9 nm at the 8 mg al l dosage of alcl3 6h2o this phenomenon was related to both the detached flocs from settled coagulants and in situ hydrolysis of residual aluminum salt in the supernatants obviously they were both much less than the size 2 61 Œºm of colloidal particles in the simulated raw water unsettled bpa and humic acids were adsorbed onto these residual nanoparticles through the electrostatic interaction this adsorption behavior resulted in a more larger size of hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles than that reported in the aged supernatants yu et al 2018 based on the results of zeta potentials and particle size the optimal amount of alcl3 6h2o for the next experiments was 4 mg al l 3 4 effects of hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles on the characteristics of membrane surface it s well known that there are substantial amounts of carboxyl groups on the polyamide membrane surface due to the hydrolysis of unreacted acyl chloride during preparation process chen et al 2017 werber et al 2017 polyamide nanofiltration membrane surface is commonly negatively charged therefore we believed that these carboxyl enhanced negative surfaces was more beneficial to the in situ adhesion of positively charged aluminum residuals during nanofiltration the morphology of membrane surface during nanofiltration of the supernatant after coagulation was compared with the original polyamide membrane fig 4 a after coagulation of the simulated raw water there was still uneven and porous nanoclusters on the membrane surface fig 4 c during nanofiltration of the supernatant the colloidal and doc concentration of the supernatant were very low shown in fig s1 and met the standards of drinking water in china therefore this discontinuous patch on membrane surface was considered as the deposition of positively charged aluminum particles through electrostatic attraction this patch was further identified from the high roughness spots in fig 4 d the average roughness ra 15 9 nm of the aluminum deposited membrane was only slightly larger than that ra 12 8 nm of the original membrane shown in fig 4 b it indirectly demonstrated the discontinuity of dynamic deposition of residual aluminum nanoparticles on membrane surface the roughness changes of membrane surface during nanofiltration played important roles on the membrane hydrophilicity and fouling potentials to evaluate the adhesion stability of aluminum deposition the surface streaming potentials of the original membrane and al deposited membrane were measured and compared in fig 5 a the original membrane showed negatively charged property under neutral and alkaline environments based on the black dashed line its isoelectric point phiec was at ph 5 2 differently the surface streaming potentials of al deposited membrane increased from 2 46 mv to 4 55 mv when the ph values of testing solution changed from 5 5 to 7 in this ph range the surface streaming potentials of the original membrane decreased from 3 4 mv to 13 5 mv due to the deprotonation of the carboxyl groups and the adsorption of anions oh these positively charged property further demonstrated the stability of aluminum deposition on membrane surface at ph 5 5 7 when the testing solution turned to be acid less than ph 5 the original and aluminum deposited membranes represented similar positively charged property this was attributed to the dissolution of aluminum depositions away from the membrane surface at acidic conditions oppositely these aluminum depositions were continuously hydrolyzed at alkaline conditions more than ph 8 however the compensation effects of positively charged aluminum depositions only weakened the negatively charging capacity of nanofiltration membrane surface considering the pka bpa is about 9 6 shown in the red dashed line the aluminum deposited membrane may be beneficial for the removal of bpa through electrostatic repelling interaction at acidic and neutral conditions consequently the surface hydrophilicities were changed with the dynamic aluminum deposited amounts on membrane surfaces as shown in fig 5 b with the increase of alcl3 6h2o dosages the aluminum deposited amounts on membrane surfaces gradually increased from 1 22 Œºg cm2 to 3 12 Œºg cm2 meanwhile the water contact angles on membrane surfaces decreased from 53 4 to 27 9 due to the intrinsic hydrophilicity of hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles under these conditions slightly higher extent of roughness on aluminum deposited membranes further reduced the water contact angles the enhanced hydrophilicity of aluminum deposited membranes facilitated the improvements of fouling resistance and bpa removal acero et al 2016 deng et al 2019 ma et al 2018 3 5 mechanisms of the enhancement of bpa removal and reduction of membrane fouling the mechanism of bpa removal enhanced by hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles in the supernatant was further confirmed through changing the factors of water matrix ph conductivity and turbidity in the simulated raw water as shown in fig 6 a the percentage removal of bpa by coagulation was only 40 1 under neutral condition it was almost not improved even when the ph value of simulated raw water increased to 9 7 however the percentage removal of bpa by aluminum deposited membrane was improved from 61 5 to 77 3 when the ph values changed from ph 7 to 9 7 meanwhile the percentage removal of doc was also enhanced from 60 to 81 7 which was shown in fig s2 it further confirmed the synergistic effect of bpa and doc removal during nanofiltration enhanced by the residual hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles the enhancement of bpa removal was dependent on the species of bpa and the charging capacities of aluminum deposited membrane in the different ph range the negatively charging capacities of supernatants and membrane surface were both obviously enhanced when the ph values of supernatants increased from 7 to 9 7 fig 5 a as a result the negatively charged repulsion interaction between them was enhanced and the removals of bpa and doc were both improved correspondingly the complexity of ca2 and humic acids was significant to bpa removal by nanofiltration which was present in fig 6 b when the solution conductivity increased from 0 4 ms cm to 0 8 ms cm the percentage removal of bpa decreased from 79 3 to 52 9 similar results were also reported on the removal of pharmaceutical active compounds by nanofiltration of secondary effluents li et al 2018a b xu et al 2019 ca2 caused the release of bpa from the complexity of al bpa doc due to its strong complexing ability as a result the percentage removal of doc increased from 64 4 to 73 1 the stability of al bpa doc complexity greatly affected the removal of bpa during nanofiltration of supernatants when the addition of kaolinite increased from 2 mg l to 20 mg l the percentage removal of bpa by aluminum deposited membrane reduced from 73 1 to 57 3 as shown in fig 6 c the addition of kaolinite disrupted the positively charged repulsion between the al bpa doc complexity and aluminum deposited membrane qin et al 2018 xu et al 2017 with the increase of kaolinite addition the zeta potentials of supernatants always maintained among 2 3 mv however the surface streaming potential of aluminum deposited membrane turned from 4 55 mv to 14 3 mv due to the partial deposition of kaolinite onto membrane surface this negative potential was less than that of nanofiltration membrane 23 8 mv independent of kaolinite addition in the range of kaolinite addition the percentage removal of bpa by coagulation increased from 4 8 to 40 9 and finally decreased to 22 1 it was the synergistic result of colloidal sedimentation and bpa release in the supernatants simultaneous mitigation of bpa and membrane fouling during nanofiltration of the supernatant after coagulation and sedimentation was illustrated in scheme 1 the enhancements of bpa removal and the greatly alleviated fouling was benefited from the positively charged repulsion between al bpa doc complexity and aluminum deposited membrane in addition the improved hydrophilicity of membrane surface fig 5 b also significantly contributed to the fouling mitigation 3 6 long term treatment performance of river songhua water spiked with micropollutant 3 6 1 bpa removal performance for comparison the bpa contents in coagulated supernatant and al deposited membrane permeate were both normalized to the initial concentration 500 Œºg l in the contaminated river water as shown in fig 7 a the bpa in coagulated supernatant was still as high as 65 7 of the initial content in contaminated river water this result indicated that coagulation did not work effectively for bpa removal obviously there was the least bpa residual 11 5 in the permeate of al deposited membrane during nanofiltration of the supernatant after coagulation this result was even much less than the residual concentration 32 8 of bpa in the permeate during nanofiltration of contaminated river water without coagulation it was firmly identified that the residual hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles could enhance the removal of bpa by nanofiltration these results were in agreement with the cases of simulated raw water containing bpa similar with the role of humic acids in the simulated raw water the doc content in the contaminated river water was believed to play important roles on the bpa removal listiarini et al 2010 yu et al 2016 as shown in fig 7 b the doc content in the permeate was further reduced to 1 08 mg l after nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant it was nearly adapted to the quick reference guide of disinfection by products dbps 2 mg l agency 2010 as a sensitive indicator of dpbs precursors phungsai et al 2018 uv254 content was also minimized to 0 019 cm 1 these lower organic contents would facilitate to inhibit the massive production of dbps during chlorination process bond et al 2010 jeong et al 2015 k√∂hler et al 2016 phungsai et al 2018 plewa et al 2008 based on the ratio of percentage removal the positive proportion of bpa and doc removals was 1 09 while that value of bpa and uv254 removals was 1 07 all of these were less than the case 1 17 1 27 of simulated raw water containing bpa demonstrating the stronger complexity of al bpa doc in the contaminated river water 3 6 2 analysis of doc components in al bpa doc complexity reduction of fluorescence intensity at specific peaks a c t1 and t2 in eem was used to differentiate the corresponding doc components in al bpa doc complexity and membrane permeate comparing to the contaminated river water fig 8 a 50 2 of humic like substances c and 50 6 of tryptophan like components t1 and t2 derived from soluble microbial products smps were removed by coagulation fig 8 b as shown in fig 8 c direct nanofiltration removed 65 6 of humic like substances c and 48 2 of fulvic like substances a which was more than those of coagulation the percentage removal of humic like c and fulvic like substances a in fig 8 d were 86 6 and 90 1 during nanofiltration of the supernatant after coagulation the increased removal of doc components was attributed to the enhanced membrane rejection of al bpa doc complexity compared to the percentage removal of c and d 21 of humic like and 41 9 of fulvic like substances contributed to the formation of al bpa doc complexity components of membrane permeates were analyzed through the normalization of peak intensity by the peak c since the component of humic like substance peak c was widely detected in surface water chen et al 2003 henderson et al 2009 in table s2 the smallest ratio of peak a c and largest ratio of peak t1 c were both obtained in the permeate during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant the intensity ratio of peak t1 c referred to the ratio of biodegradable and non biodegradable components in doc these two ratios indicated that the most of fluorescence substances were biodegradable components in the permeate during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant in addition the largest ratio of peak t2 c listed in the last column of table s2 further identified the dominant contribution of soluble microbial products smps in the permeate during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant in addition blue red shifts of peak locations were related with the variation of doc concentration and structure these changes also determined the complexing capability among residual aluminum nanoparticles doc components and bpa qin et al 2018 in addition the foulants on membrane surfaces were obtained by washing with sodium hydroxide solution and characterized by eem spectroscopy in fig s3 in agreement with the results of fig 8 protein substance was the dominant contributor of membrane fouling comparing to the case of contaminated river water the fluorescent intensities of peaks t1 and t2 were reduced by 76 1 and 73 7 during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant the less membrane fouling was dependent on the structure and charge of residual aluminum nanoparticles on membrane surface similarly it was reported that micropollutants deposited on membrane surface could reduce the membrane fouling during nanofiltration due to the increased charges on membrane surface li et al 2018a b 3 6 3 antifouling performance the membrane fouling developments during the nanofiltration of river songhua water spiked with bpa and coagulated supernatant were represented in fig 9 a obviously the normalized water flux was also maintained at 85 5 at the end nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant it was about 2 13 times than the case of the contaminated river water moreover it was also much higher than that of the simulated raw water containing bpa 68 6 shown in fig 2 it was explained that the diverse compositions of organic substances facilitated the formation of al bpa doc complexity in the contaminated river water results of membrane fouling profiles were simulated and analyzed in fig 9 b through a theory of cake filtration listiarini et al 2010 schippers and verdouw 1980 where the foulants were retained on the membrane surface by the surface deposition only the regions of pore blocking and uncompressed cake formation were found during the nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant an additional region of compressed cake layer was found during nanofiltration of contaminated river water at the beginning of filtration the slower development of pore blocking region demonstrated that the fouling potential was low during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant meanwhile membrane fouling index in the uncompressed cake region linear simulation region was 0 11 during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant much less than that 0 23 of contaminated river water the emerging region of compressed cake layer further indicated that fouling potential was larger during nanofiltration of contaminated river water which was not developed during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant the morphology and roughness of foulant layers on membrane surfaces were shown in fig s4 a dense thick layer was observed on the cracked location of membrane surface during nanofiltration of contaminated river water oppositely only a porous thin layer with small particle size was observed on the membrane surface during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant less fouling occurred in this layer surface roughness also changed with the extent of membrane fouling the average roughness of membrane surfaces approached 48 3 nm and 23 1 nm during nanofiltration of contaminated river water and coagulation supernatant the relatively smoother surface further demonstrated less fouling potential of coagulated supernatant 4 conclusions the residual hydrolyzed aluminum nanoparticles in the coagulated supernatant were dynamically deposited onto membrane surface during nanofiltration in the simulated raw water containing bpa and humic acid and kaolinite clay the percentage of bpa removal was improved from 60 7 to 88 9 when the ph was adjusted from neutral to alkaline in the long term operation of river songhua water spiked with micropollutant only 11 5 of bpa was remained in the permeate during nanofiltration of coagulated supernatant simultaneously along with only 14 5 of reduction of normalized water flux aluminum deposited membrane enhanced the micropollutant removal through the electrostatic repelling interaction the water contact angles on membrane surfaces decreased from 53 4 to 27 9 further alleviating the organic fouling the dominated fouling of protein like substances was identified by excitation emission matrix eems spectra simultaneous abatement of micropollutant doc and membrane fouling was demonstrated effectively through the in situ modification of membrane surface during nanofiltration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18033,human exposure to antibiotic residues in drinking water has not been well evaluated this study is the first attempt to simultaneously and efficiently identify and quantify 92 antibiotic residues in filtered tap water multistage filtration at the tap n 36 collected from 10 areas of a large city in southern china 10 chinese brands of bottled barreled water n 30 and six foreign brands of bottled water n 18 obtained from the chinese market the average and median concentrations of all the detected antibiotic compounds was 182 and 92 ng l in filtered tap water 180 and 105 ng l in chinese brands of bottled barreled water and 666 and 146 ng l in foreign brands of bottled water respectively a total of 58 antibiotics were detected in the filtered tap water and 45 and 36 antibiotics were detected in the chinese and foreign brands of bottled water respectively more types of antibiotics were detected in chinese brands of bottled water than in the other bottled waters in addition chinese waters had high roxithromycin concentrations while the foreign brands of bottled water had high concentrations of dicloxacillin the average and median values of the estimated overall daily intake of all the detected antibiotics were 4 3 and 2 3 ng kg day when only filtered tap water was drunk 4 0 and 2 5 ng kg day when chinese brands of bottled water was drunk and 16 0 and 4 9 ng kg day when foreign brands of bottled water was drunk further study is needed to develop a more comprehensive estimation of human exposure to antibiotic residues in the environment and a more in depth understanding of the potential hazard of ingested antibiotic residues to the human microbiome graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic residues drinking water exposure assessment microbiological toxicity risk assessment 1 introduction antibiotics are emerging contaminants of concern in the environment due to their potential adverse effects on nontarget organisms and increased bacterial resistance national academies of sciences and medicine 2018 qiao et al 2017 the widespread use of human and veterinary antibiotics has resulted in a continuous release of antibiotics into the environment kumar et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 a variety of antibiotic residues have been detected in surface water and wastewater at concentrations ranging from 0 01 to 1 0 Œºg l le page et al 2017 there is a high probability that antibiotics have already contaminated and will very likely remain in drinking water sources due to the lack of antibiotic removal capabilities of the current municipal drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure xu et al 2007 the antibiotic residues consumed daily in drinking water interact with the human gastrointestinal microbiome long term exposure to antibiotics may induce changes in the intestinal microflora structure and increase the emergence of antibiotic resistant harmful bacteria or opportunistic pathogens inhabiting humans blaser 2016 damman et al 2012 p√©rez cobas et al 2012 exposure to residual antibiotics in drinking water may cause adverse health risks on humans unlike in many nations e g japan and the usa china s tap water is not recommended for drinking due to chlorine disinfection in recent decades chinese people have typically used boiled tap water for drinking in recent years an increasing number of people have gradually preferred to drink 1 filtered tap water i e tap water with on site purification by multistage filters installed in drinking fountains 2 bottled barreled water produced by chinese bottled water companies and 3 bottled water from foreign countries consuming different types of drinking water may result in different levels of antibiotic residue exposure however only a few studies have focused on human exposure to antibiotics via drinking water benotti et al 2009 boleda et al 2014 cai et al 2015 ji et al 2010 li et al 2017 wang et al 2016 yiruhan et al 2010 simazaki et al 2015 leung et al 2013 watkinson et al 2009 zuccato et al 2000 table 1 and these studies have had two limitations first only 2 to 28 kinds of antibiotics have been investigated in drinking water and only 20 were detected table 1 given that 120 different antibiotics are used in human health care and livestock husbandry wang et al 2015 it is highly likely that antibiotic residues in drinking water are greater than the range of investigated antibiotics second most previous studies assessed only tap water and ignored possible human exposure to antibiotic residues in other types of drinking water these two limitations may have resulted in a biased underestimate of human exposure and health risk of antibiotic residues in drinking water benotti et al 2009 boleda et al 2014 simazaki et al 2015 yiruhan et al 2010 zuccato et al 2000 the quality of drinking water is essential to human health and social development thus it is paramount to gain a comprehensive understanding of the potential human health risks due to antibiotic residue exposure from drinking water to that end this study monitored a wider range of antibiotic residues over 100 kinds in filtered tap water and bottled and barreled water than other studies and comprehensively assessed human exposure to residual antibiotics in different types of drinking water 2 methods 2 1 collection of drinking water samples drinking water samples were collected from a southern coastal city of china the city has a large population density approximately 2000 square kilometers and 13 million permanent residents and a well developed economy the tap water in the city is mainly derived from the east river dongjiang one of the main streams of the pearl river delta and is not considered to be directly drinkable without treatment bottled water and barreled water drinking fountains are of widespread availability in office buildings and residences and are the most common sources of drinking water in addition there are a few high end residential areas public institutions and facilities and commercial office buildings that have installed centralized treatment systems for further filtration of tap water meanwhile many families have purchased household tap water filtration purification systems typical commercial and residential tap water treatment systems consist of four filtrations steps 1 polypropylene cotton 2 activated carbon 3 core purification membrane and 4 a final activated carbon step to remove odor there are mainly three types of core filtration membranes in the chinese market ultra filtration membrane uf nano filtration membrane nf and reverse osmosis membrane ro the filtration accuracy of uf nf and ro is 0 01 0 001 and 0 0001 Œºm respectively at present ro is the most advanced and popular tap water treatment systems in the chinese market generally high end residential areas public institutions and facilities and commercial office buildings are equipped with ro drinking fountains residential tap water treatment systems are widely available for purchase in the city many households use ro drinking systems while others choose the other two types of core purification membranes due to lower price the life span of the ro membrane depends on the quality of the tap water the manufactures recommend replacing the membrane once a year thus three types of drinking water were collected including filtered tap water chinese brands of bottled and barreled water and foreign brands of bottled water in addition unfiltered tap water samples were also collected 2 1 1 filtered tap water there are approximately 44 water reservoirs supplying tap water in the city the water sources for these reservoirs are from the upper reach of the east river dongjiang and local precipitation the entire city was divided into 10 areas for collecting direct drinking water samples samples 3 or 6 samples individually sized with the volume of 1 l were collected in each area in january 2019 and april 2019 the sampling points selected were district libraries or office buildings that are equipped with drinking fountains to supply filtered tap water a total of 36 filtered tap water samples were collected unfiltered tap water samples n 30 at the same sampling points as the filtered tap water samples were also collected as a reference 2 1 2 bottled or barreled water a total of 42 bottled water samples from 14 brands were purchased from convenience stores or online shopping malls with 3 individual bottled water samples with the volume of 1 l collected for each brand the 14 brands of bottled water include the eight most common brands in china and six foreign brands two from france one from japan one from italy one from germany and one from the usa since most of the barreled water was of the same brand as the bottled water only 2 brands of barreled water were collected with 3 1 l individual samples collected for each brand all water samples were kept at 4 c and were analyzed within 3 7 days 2 2 selection of target analytes due to the lack of official data on the production or use of antibiotics in china a total of 106 antibiotics were included as target chemicals in the present study based on reported antibiotics in the environment and food ben et al 2019 they covered the most commonly used antibiotics used for human care and animal husbandry including 25 sulfonamides 5 acetylated sulfonamides 20 quinolones 6 tetracyclines and 9 of their degradation products 16 macrolides 14 Œ≤ lactams 3 chloramphenicols 3 polypeptides and 5 other antibiotics nine stable isotope labeled internal standards were used for analyzing the 106 antibiotics including 13c6 sulfadimidine d4 acetylsulfamethoxazole 13c d3 erythromycin d5 norfloxacin d4 fluconazol d5 metoprolol d2 carbamazepine 13c3 trimethoprim and d3 triclosan for detailed information and standard sources of the chemicals see supplementary materials chemicals and regents 2 3 sample preparation the sample preparation followed an established method for water samples wang et al 2016 yiruhan et al 2010 briefly each 1 l water sample was filtered through 7 Œºm gf glass microfibre filter f whatman buckinghamshire uk then 0 5 g na2edta and isotope labeled mixed internal standards were added to the filtrate the targeted antibiotic compounds in the drinking water sample were enriched using a hydrophilic lipophilic balanced hlb solid phase extraction spe cartridge oasis 500 mg 6 ml waters milford ma usa following the procedure described below the hlb cartridges were preconditioned with 10 ml methanol and 10 ml milli q water in sequence after acidification to ph 3 0 5 with 1 mol l hydrochloric acid the water samples were loaded on the cartridge at a flow rate of 5 10 ml min then the cartridges were rinsed with 10 ml milli q water and vacuum dried for approximately 20 min the analytes were eluted from the hlb cartridge using 10 ml methanol the elution was evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen using a turbovap biotage cardiff uk at 40 c and reconstituted with 0 5 ml methanol for instrumental analysis 2 4 instrumental analyses an agilent 1290 infinity ultra high performance liquid chromatography equipped with an agilent 6470 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer uhplc ms ms was used for targeted identification and quantification of the 106 antibiotics in drinking water the ms conditions were optimized for detecting the 106 antibiotics and two precursor fragment ion pairs with the highest abundances were generally selected for mass spectrometric analysis the ion pairs fragmentation voltages and collision energies for the detected antibiotics and the 13c or 2h labeled internal standard were determined see supplementary materials table s1 based on the different physical chemical properties of the targeted analytes the 106 antibiotics were divided into two groups one comprised 102 antibiotics and another comprised the remaining 4 antibiotics including three chloramphenicols and one sulfanitran the 102 antibiotics in the first group were analyzed on a waters beh c8 column 1 7 Œºm 2 1 100 mm waters milford ma usa with a vanguard column to obtain a better separation of target analytes different mobile phases were applied in this study although sharp peaks and improved sensitivity of analytes can be obtained when using the mobile phase a 0 1 formic acid in water b acetonitrile four isomers including epioxytetracycline oxytetracycline sulfameter and sulfamethoxypyridazine could not be separated due to poor chromatographic separation by switching the mobile phase b from acetonitrile to methanol these isomers could be well separated in the chromatogram see supplementary materials fig s1 mobile phases a and b were 0 1 formic acid in water and methanol respectively the flow rate was 0 40 ml min and the column was kept at room temperature 25 c the gradient conditions were as follows 0 min 10 b 3 5 min 40 b 4 0 min 48 b 4 5 min 30 b 6 0 min 100 b 8 0 min 100 b 10 01 min 10 b and re equilibration to 14 min the antibiotics were identified and quantified by dynamic multi reaction monitoring mrm in esi mode the injection volume was 2 Œºl for the mass spectrometer settings the gas and sheath gas temperatures were 325 and 350 c and the flow rates were 10 and 11 l min respectively the nebulizer was set at 20 psi the capillary and nozzle voltages were 4000 and 2000 v respectively in this way ofloxacin and levofloxacin a pair of chiral compounds were very difficult to separate on an achiral chromatographic column using methanol or acetonitrile as the mobile phase the total levels of these two compounds are presented as ofloxacin levofloxacin in the present study the remaining four antibiotics in the second group were analyzed by mrm in esi mode a waters cortecs t3 column 1 6 Œºm 2 1 100 mm waters milford ma usa with a vanguard column was used for chromatographic separation mobile phases a and b were ultrapure water and methanol respectively the flow rate was set at 0 40 ml min and the column was operated at room temperature 25 c the gradient conditions were as follows 0 min 10 b 1 min 70 b 3 min 90 b 4 min 10 b and re equilibration to 6 min the injection volume was 5 Œºl the ms conditions were set as the same as those for the analysis of the antibiotics in the former group 2 5 limits of detection lods the instrument detection limits idls were defined as follows 1 idl t rsd amount injected 100 where t is the student s t value given for the specified confidence level 99 and degree of freedom n 1 and rsd is the relative standard deviation of peak area at the amount injected from n replicate injections generally n 6 one negative control water blank spiked with the internal standards and run through the identical analysis procedures as those for the actual samples was determined along with every 6 samples and a total of 15 negative control samples were analyzed background noise interfered with the signals of bacitracin a doxycycline fleroxacin iso chlortetracycline methacycline minocycline monensin ofloxacin levofloxacin pipemidic acid piperacillin roxithromycin sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole tetracycline trimethoprim and sulfanitran the limits of detection lods for these compounds in the blank samples were calculated as the mean plus three standard deviations of the concentrations and ranged from 0 031 to 24 ng l for those compounds that were not detected in water blanks the lods were set equal to the idls as a result the lods ranged from 0 030 to 0 28 ng l for sulfonamides 0 040 0 50 ng l for quinolones 0 022 3 5 ng l for tetracyclines 0 0090 0 41 ng l for macrolides 0 022 24 ng l for Œ≤ lactams 0 023 0 073 ng l for chloramphenicols and 0 012 0 063 ng l for the other antibiotics in drinking water see supplementary materials table s2 2 6 data analyses identification and quantitation of the analytes were performed using agilent s mass hunter quantitative analysis software version b 08 00 to avoid overestimation of human exposure to antibiotics via drinking water we assumed the amounts for undetected antibiotics below the lods equal to 0 if the detection frequency of antibiotics were 50 while the amounts were assumed to be lod 2 if the detection frequency of antibiotics were 50 in the present study to characterize population variability of antibiotic daily intakes via drinking water boostrap re sampling based monte carlo simulation was performed with 5000 iterations by matlab version 2015a the cumulative distribution function of the 5000 iterations showed that more than 90 of our generated data can well fit the characteristics of statistical distributions of observations the statistical descriptors of the intakes of the detected compounds in drinking water including the mean and median were estimated on the basis of the 5000 iterations 3 results and discussions 3 1 method development for the quantitation of residual antibiotic in drinking water this study is the first attempt to simultaneously determine approximately 100 antibiotics in drinking water based on the different physical chemical properties of the targeted analytes the 106 antibiotics were divided into two groups 102 antibiotics were efficiently separated and detected within 10 min using water 0 1 fa methanol as mobile phases in dynamic mrm esi mode with a waters beh c8 column and the remaining 4 analytes were identified and quantified within 5 min by mrm in esi mode with a waters cortecs t3 column the optimized chromatograms of the 106 antibiotics and sub chromatograms for 7 classes of antibiotics are shown in fig 1 showing clear quantifiable peaks for all the analytes the recovery validation was carried out in 3 6 replicates of 1 l filtered tap water spiked with three levels 0 5 5 and 50 ng l of antibiotic mixture standards in contrast to 14 analytes with recovery rates always lower than 40 the average recovery of 92 analytes was mean standard deviation 88 0 19 1 80 0 23 9 88 2 37 9 at the spiked levels of 50 5 and 0 5 ng l respectively while the 0 5 ng l spiking was close to the lods of some analytes the 14 analytes with low recoveries were bacitracin a colistin a colistin b Œ± apo oxytetracycline Œ≤ apo oxytetracycline sulfasalazine spiramycin sulfaguanidine sulfanilamide narasin salinomycin tilmicosin 4 epianhydrochlortetracycline and 4 epianhydrotetracycline the chromatograms of spiked narasin and salinomycin showed 2 peaks after pretreatment therefore 92 analytes were identified and quantified in the following analysis of antibiotics in the samples of filtered tap water chinese bottled and barreled waters and foreign brands of bottled waters it is noteworthy that in unfiltered tap water there were only 30 analytes with a recovery rate higher than 40 with an average recovery rate for the 30 analytes of 81 26 0 and 80 23 at the spiked levels of 50 and 5 ng l respectively the identification and quantitation of the remaining 76 analytes were strongly inhibited by impurities in tap water see supplementary materials fig s2 with average matrix spike recovery rates of 9 8 1 3 and 5 0 0 9 at spiked levels of 50 and 5 ng l respectively the low recovery rates for the 76 analytes is likely caused by interference from disinfection byproducts in tap water and secondary pollution generated from pipeline aging these results were consistent with a previous research finding that the spe efficiency quantification and quantitation of twelve sulfonamides were strongly influenced by the matrix effect of tap water borecka et al 2014 analyte recoveries for the filtered tap water samples exhibited significantly higher recoveries as described above of analytes in matrix spiked experiments than unfiltered tap water suggesting that the filtration and purification technology used for the filtered tap water could be good for pretreatment to reduce matrix effects when antibiotics are analyzed in tap water 3 2 occurrence of antibiotics in drinking water 3 2 1 filtered tap water the filtered tap water samples were collected from 10 areas of the city whose water supply comes from different reservoirs five or more compounds were detected in all the filtered tap water samples the highest number of detected analytes was 41 at one sampling site whose water supply was from a reservoir surrounded by restaurants indicating that the water source in the reservoir may be polluted by the dining industry sewage the concentrations of the detected compounds ranged from 0 021 ng l for jossamycin to 1 133 ng l for dicloxacillin among the 92 analytes 34 were not detected and 37 were detected in fewer than 30 of samples range 3 28 twenty one were detected in more than 30 of filtered tap water samples with the highest detection frequency being 100 for trimethoprim fig 2 nineteen parent compounds four tetracyclines three macrolides six quinolones four sulfonamides one Œ≤ lactam and monensin and two degradation products 4 epitetracycline and n acetylsulfamethoxazole were detected in the 36 filtered tap water samples with an average and median concentration ranging from 0 24 and n d ng l for sulfamethoxazole to 101 and 25 ng l for dicloxacillin see supplementary materials table s2 the total concentration of the detected antibiotics in filtered tap water samples ranged from 6 0 ng l to 1172 ng l with an average and median concentration of 182 and 92 ng l and 80 of the filtered tap water samples had a total concentration of detected antibiotics of greater than 50 ng l in addition the 30 antibiotic analytes that were not affected by the matrix effect of tap water n 30 were also quantitated in the unfiltered tap water samples collected at the same sampling sites as the filtered tap water samples see supplementary materials fig s3 similar detection frequencies and concentrations of target analytes were observed in tap water and filtered tap water samples p 0 05 this may suggest that the multistage filter in regular drinking fountains involved in the present study does not remove antibiotics at the residual level of ng l there are relatively limited studies regarding antibiotic occurrence in drinking water cai et al 2015 hanna et al 2018 leung et al 2013 li et al 2017 yiruhan et al 2010 and the available data are reviewed in table 1 compared with the concentrations in these studies the maximum concentrations of azithromycin 22 ng l clarithromycin 8 9 ng l enrofloxacin 13 ng l and trimethoprim 5 2 ng l in the collected filtered tap water samples were close to those in tap water from shanghai changsha hangzhou and guangzhou china leung et al 2013 however the maximum levels of lomefloxacin 1 2 ng l and sulfamethazine 3 2 ng l in our filtered tap water samples were significantly lower than the levels 179 ng l and 77 2 ng l respectively in tap water from guangzhou and the maximum levels of sulfamethoxazole 0 98 ng l and ciprofloxacin 5 7 ng l in our samples were lower than those in tap water from guangzhou 21 2 ng l and 679 7 ng l respectively and shandong 18 6 ng l and 224 4 ng l respectively yiruhan et al 2010 leung et al 2013 hanna et al 2018 furthermore the maximum concentration of norfloxacin 297 ng l and roxithromycin 27 ng l in the collected filtered tap water samples was significantly higher than that 82 7 ng l and 15 1 ng l respectively in tap water from guangzhou yiruhan et al 2010 leung et al 2013 in contrast to the high concentrations of chloramphenicols detected in tap water from shanghai wang et al 2016 hangzhou and guangzhou leung et al 2013 chloramphenicols were seldom detected in our filtered tap water samples according to announcement no 193 listing the veterinary drugs and other compounds banned for livestock animals ministry of agriculture of the people republic of china 2011 chloramphenicol has been listed as a banned veterinary drug since 2002 due to its inhibition of hematopoietic function of bone marrow clinical applications are also limited however due to its strong antibacterial effect and low price it is likely that chloramphenicol is still in use illegally the infrequent detection in the present study may indicate that the current use of chloramphenicol is gradually in decline due to strict control in recent years 3 2 2 chinese brands of bottled barreled water the 30 individual bottled barreled water samples were from eight brands of bottled water and two brands of barreled water bottled by different companies in china the water sources of the different brands of bottled water are distributed throughout the country four or more compounds were detected in the chinese brand bottled and barreled water samples with the highest number of detected compounds in one brand of bottle samples being 31 the concentration of the detected compounds ranged from 0 0094 ng l for jossamycin to 1 376 ng l for roxithromycin among the 92 analytes 47 were not detected and 23 were detected in fewer than 30 of the samples range 3 27 twenty two were detected in more than 30 of bottle water samples with the highest detection frequency being 100 for trimethoprim similar to the results for filtered tap water these twenty two included 20 parent compounds three tetracyclines five macrolides six quinolones three sulfonamides one Œ≤ lactam one chloramphenicol and monensin and two degradation products 4 epitetracycline and 4 epioxytetracycline fig 2 with an average and median concentration ranging from 0 034 and n d ng l for monensin to 96 and 5 5 ng l for roxithromycin see supplementary materials table s2 respectively the total concentration of the detected antibiotics in bottled and barreled water samples ranged from 16 ng l to 1 554 ng l with an average and median concentration of 180 and 105 ng l respectively additionally 80 of the bottled and barreled water samples had a total concentration of detected antibiotics of greater than 50 ng l the chinese brands of bottled water labeled as mineral water or purified water collected in the present study were derived from deep lakes groundwater or mountain springs in different regions of china the production of these bottled water generally included aeration filtration sterilization filling the types and concentrations of detected compounds in filtered tap water and bottled and barreled water were very similar fig 2 which may indicate a background pollution of antibiotic residues in chinese waters it is also noteworthy that eight of 10 degradation products were found in the collected water samples while 50 of 82 parent compounds of antibiotics were detected in the water samples this may indicate a wide occurrence of antibiotic degradation products in drinking water in china possible antibiotic degradation products in the environment range far beyond the 10 quantitative analytes in the present study and even far beyond our current knowledge identification and quantification of unknown products from antibiotics transformation in the environment should receive more attention 3 2 3 foreign brands of bottled water the foreign bottled water samples included one brand from the usa one from japan one from italy one from germany and two from france each with 3 individual samples three or more compounds were detected in these foreign bottled water samples with the highest number of detected antibiotic analytes in a single brand of bottled water samples being 23 the concentration of the detected compounds ranged from 0 013 ng l for monensin to 3 462 ng l for dicloxacillin among the 92 analytes 56 were not detected and 20 were detected in fewer than 30 of the samples range 6 28 sixteen were detected in more than 30 of the samples with the highest detection frequency being 100 for dicloxacillin and trimethoprim these sixteen included 15 parent compounds four tetracyclines six quinolones three sulfonamides one Œ≤ lactam and monensin and one degradation product 4 epitetracycline with average and median concentrations ranging from 0 068 and 0 060 ng l for monensin to 631 and 113 ng l for dicloxacillin see supplementary materials table s2 the concentrations of sulfamethizole n d sulfadimethoxine n d and sulfamethoxazole n d 0 38 ng l detected in the italian brand of bottled water collected in the present study were lower than those n d 9 ng l for sulfamethizole n d 11 ng l for sulfadimethoxine and n d 80 ng l for sulfamethoxazole respectively reported in a previous study perret et al 2006 the total concentration of the detected antibiotics in bottled water samples from these countries ranged from 69 ng l to 3 486 ng l with an average and median concentration of 666 and 146 ng l almost 90 of the total antibiotic concentration was contributed by dicloxacillin if dicloxacillin was excluded the average and median concentration of the overall detected antibiotics was 35 and 18 and ng l this may be related to the use of dicloxacillin for the treatment of methicillin susceptible s aureus infections in human and small animal health care sandberg et al 2010 dicloxacillin is a member of penicillinase resistant penicillins and now is also used for therapy as a composite drug combined with amoxicillin due to its stability against penicillinases and low toxicity according to the world health organization report on surveillance of antibiotic consumption in 2016 2018 who 2018 dicloxacillin contributed about 7 3 of total defined daily doses ddd of antibiotics per 1000 inhabitants per day oral intake in the region of the americas and it was found that 65 of dicloxacillin by oral intake is excreted through urine and released into the environment hirsch et al 1999 3 2 4 comparison between chinese and foreign brands of bottled water compared with the antibiotics detected in these foreign brands of bottled water the number of antibiotics detected in chinese bottled water was significantly higher indicating that the antibiotic pollution in chinese drinking water was more complex macrolides were the most prevalent class of antibiotics detected in china fig 3 and roxithromycin was detected in chinese bottled water with a high frequency and concentration while it was seldom detected in any foreign brands of bottled water this may be due to the wide use of roxithromycin as a veterinary medicine in china the concentrations of sulfonamides detected in chinese bottled water were higher than that in the foreign brands of bottled water while the concentration of quinolones was similar to that in the foreign brands of bottled water the concentration of tetracyclines in water from china was lower than those in water from germany and france but higher than those in water from the usa and japan chloramphenicols and other antibiotics were present in low concentrations and exhibited low detection frequencies in all bottled waters it is noteworthy that the concentrations of Œ≤ lactams dicloxacillin detected in water from germany and france were 10 30 times higher than those detected in water from china the usa and japan however the comparison of antibiotics in drinking water between china and other countries in the present study was limited by the sample size further nationwide and worldwide investigations of antibiotic residues in drinking water are warranted 3 3 assessment of human exposure to residual antibiotics in drinking water 3 3 1 exposure assessment currently chinese people especially urbanites are increasingly demanding high quality drinking water and thus prefer filtered tap water or bottled barreled water while some wealthy people even only drink bottled water produced by foreign nations the daily exposure of people living in the city to residual antibiotics via drinking water was estimated for three scenarios the first scenario was that people only drank filtered tap water scenario 1 the second was that people only drank chinese brands of bottled barreled water scenario 2 and the third one was that people only drank foreign brands of bottled water scenario 3 daily intake by drinking water ng kg day was calculated by the following equation 2 di water c i d water bw where c i is the concentration of compound i in the drinking water sample and dwater and bw are the daily water intake and body weight which were set to 1 7 l and 65 kg for the chinese general population respectively according to the major science and technology program for water pollution control and treatment of china 2014 2017 rceescas 2018 zhang et al 2019 there were still a variety of possibilities in the drinking water sources in each scenario for example in scenario 1 a resident in the city would be most likely to only drink from one or two areas home and work while the possibility of drinking water from all the 10 subareas is also possible similarly many residents tended to drink the same brand of bottled water every day while some people preferred to change the brands of bottle water thus to characterize the variability of antibiotic daily intakes via drinking water bootstrap re sampling based on monte carlo simulation was performed with 5000 iterations with monte carlo simulations based on an empirical cumulative probability function of the concentration data the average and median estimated overall daily intakes of all the detectable antibiotics by drinking water were 4 3 and 2 3 ng kg day 0 14 31 ng kg day for scenario 1 4 0 and 2 5 ng kg day 0 40 41 ng kg day for scenario 2 and 16 and 4 9 ng kg day 1 8 91 ng kg day for scenario 3 respectively considering the possibilities that humans could be exposed to antibiotic residues in the environment by drinking water inhalation ingestion and dermal contact of particulate matter and food consumption the total daily intake of antibiotic residues for the people living in the city may be close to a level of Œºg kg day 3 3 2 risk assessment compared with effects of therapeutic clinical or self medication as short term and high dose exposures the effect of antibiotic residues from drinking water on humans is likely to be a long term and low dose exposure the trace amounts of individual antibiotic residues in the environment may pose a low selection risk to the human microbiome but a long term exposure to such a mixture of dozens to hundreds of antibiotic residues may play a more powerful and far reaching role in the selection of bacterial resistance than the antibiotics used in medical treatment however the mixture toxicities of antibiotics to the overall gastrointestinal bacteria in particular long term exposure to antibiotic mixtures at the residual levels and their corresponding metabolites has not yet been well understood rodriguez mozaz and weinberg 2010 therefore the information and data required to quantify the risks of a mixture of antibiotic residues in the environment are severely limited therefore the exposure risks from residual antibiotics in different types of drinking water were assessed individually in the present study based on the available toxicity information and data sixteen analytes were detectable in more than 30 of the filtered tap water the chinese brands of bottled water and the foreign brands of bottled water samples these 16 analytes are a potential list of antibiotic residues to be recommended for monitoring in drinking water the estimated average and median daily intake ranged from 0 0058 and 0 ng kg day for sulfamethoxazole to 2 3 and 0 54 ng kg day for dicloxacillin in scenario 1 from 0 00077 and 0 ng kg day for monensin to 2 0 and 0 14 ng kg day for roxithromycin in scenario 2 and from 0 00074 and 0 00030 ng kg day for monensin to 14 and 2 7 ng kg day for dicloxacillin in scenario 3 respectively table 2 for assessing human health risk when considering the detected antibiotics individually both acceptable daily intakes adis derived from toxicological data and minimum inhibition concentrations mics determined by microbiological approaches were adopted table 2 based on the toxicological approach no observed adverse effect levels noaels and lowest observed adverse effect levels loaels were divided by uncertainty factors ufs to be converted to human equivalent doses for noncarcinogenic risk bruce et al 2010 dong et al 2015 for norfloxacin with evidence of carcinogenicity in rats the virtually safe dose which corresponds to a cancer risk of one in a million was calculated by dividing the maximum tolerated dose mtd by 740 000 to predict the cancer potential bruce et al 2010 gaylor and gold 1998 the toxicological adis were generally 102 108 times higher than the drinking daily intake of each individual antibiotic table 2 indicating that the intake of antibiotics via the three types of drinking water posed no immediate human development toxicity and threat of cartilage injury the toxicological adi is mainly applicable to assessing the risk of development toxicity and reproduction toxicity however the most likely risk associated with antibiotic residues in drinking water would be promoting emergence and selection for resistant commensal bacteria inhabiting the human body especially the intestinal flora to estimate the risk of resistance selection as a result of exposure to the residual antibiotic concentrations in drinking water minimal selective concentrations mscs for antibiotic resistance selection should be used to derive the microbiological adi minimal selective concentration is initially defined as the lowest antibiotic concentration that could give a competitive advantage in growth rate to a resistant genotype over the susceptible genotype strain sandegren 2014 and currently selective concentrations of antibiotics in complex communities have been gradually assessed in recent studies kraupner et al 2018 lundstrom et al 2016 murray et al 2018 nevertheless studies on mscs are scarce to date and there is little to no available msc data derived from the human microbial community minimum inhibition concentrations were used to predict mscs by dividing by a factor of 10 based on the median mic msc ratio gullberg et al 2011 then the microbiological adi was calculated using the following equation bruce et al 2010 jeong et al 2009 leung et al 2013 schwab et al 2005 3 a d i m i c 50 m c c 10 e f b w where mic50 is the concentration inhibiting 50 of the human commensal microflora which generally includes escherichia coli e coli peptostreptococcus streptococcus and klebsiella pneumoniae 10 is the extrapolation factor from mic to msc gullberg et al 2011 mcc refers to the mass of colonic content 220 g and ef is the effective fraction of the oral dose available to the colonic microorganisms 20 bruce et al 2010 leung et al 2013 the microbiological adis were generally 102 106 times higher than the drinking daily intake for most of the detected compounds table 2 indicating that the exposure to individual residual antibiotics in drinking water may have no significant effects on human gut bacteria although all the detected antibiotics may pose a low risk to human health when considered individually at the residual level in drinking water there were still many uncertainties in the aforementioned risk assessment first no data are available on the gastrointestinal absorption of daily intake of different antibiotics residuals in food and drinking water the default value of 20 for different antibiotics is highly uncertain second it has become increasingly clear that long term antibiotic exposure could contribute to the evolution of high level bacterial resistance at concentrations that are several hundred fold below mics wistrand yuen et al 2018 the use of a factor of 10 to extrapolate mscs may overestimate the value of the microbiological adi and underestimate health risk third the metabolism of xenobiotic antibiotics by different gut bacterial species could be significantly perturbed in a species specific manner zhang et al 2018 it was very likely that the msc values of different gut bacteria vary greatly and that the use of an msc of a certain strain would lead to neglecting the selection of sensitive gut bacteria last the metabolites produced from the gastrointestinally absorbed antibiotics by gut bacteria may pose even greater toxicity to human health than the original antibiotics nonetheless little is known about the possible interactions and metabolism of the gastrointestinally absorbed antibiotics in the highly heterogeneous gastrointestinal system due to the technical challenges of analyzing the unknown metabolites all of these issues collectively indicate that further research is urgently needed to develop a more comprehensive assessment of the overall human exposure to antibiotic residues in the environment mscs in complex microbiome communities in the human body and the metabolism of xenobiotic antibiotics in the gastrointestinal system 4 conclusions the study is the first to survey approximately 100 antibiotics in different types of drinking water in china the screening analysis provides cost and time effective monitoring a wider range of antibiotic residues in drinking water the results suggested a complex antibiotic pollution in chinese drinking water with a prevalence of macrolides based on the levels of antibiotic residues analyzed in different types of drinking water the individual and overall values of daily intake of all the detected antibiotics were estimated for three scenarios only filtered tap water was drunk only chinese brands of bottled water was drunk and only foreign brands of bottled water was drunk risk of human exposure to trace antibiotics via drinking water was assessed individually indicating that the individual antibiotic residues in drinking water may pose low risk to human health however the data and knowledge required to comprehensively characterize the overall risks of antibiotic residues exposure is severely limited further research is needed for a more in depth understanding of the potential adverse effects of exposure to environmental antibiotic

18033,human exposure to antibiotic residues in drinking water has not been well evaluated this study is the first attempt to simultaneously and efficiently identify and quantify 92 antibiotic residues in filtered tap water multistage filtration at the tap n 36 collected from 10 areas of a large city in southern china 10 chinese brands of bottled barreled water n 30 and six foreign brands of bottled water n 18 obtained from the chinese market the average and median concentrations of all the detected antibiotic compounds was 182 and 92 ng l in filtered tap water 180 and 105 ng l in chinese brands of bottled barreled water and 666 and 146 ng l in foreign brands of bottled water respectively a total of 58 antibiotics were detected in the filtered tap water and 45 and 36 antibiotics were detected in the chinese and foreign brands of bottled water respectively more types of antibiotics were detected in chinese brands of bottled water than in the other bottled waters in addition chinese waters had high roxithromycin concentrations while the foreign brands of bottled water had high concentrations of dicloxacillin the average and median values of the estimated overall daily intake of all the detected antibiotics were 4 3 and 2 3 ng kg day when only filtered tap water was drunk 4 0 and 2 5 ng kg day when chinese brands of bottled water was drunk and 16 0 and 4 9 ng kg day when foreign brands of bottled water was drunk further study is needed to develop a more comprehensive estimation of human exposure to antibiotic residues in the environment and a more in depth understanding of the potential hazard of ingested antibiotic residues to the human microbiome graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic residues drinking water exposure assessment microbiological toxicity risk assessment 1 introduction antibiotics are emerging contaminants of concern in the environment due to their potential adverse effects on nontarget organisms and increased bacterial resistance national academies of sciences and medicine 2018 qiao et al 2017 the widespread use of human and veterinary antibiotics has resulted in a continuous release of antibiotics into the environment kumar et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 a variety of antibiotic residues have been detected in surface water and wastewater at concentrations ranging from 0 01 to 1 0 Œºg l le page et al 2017 there is a high probability that antibiotics have already contaminated and will very likely remain in drinking water sources due to the lack of antibiotic removal capabilities of the current municipal drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure xu et al 2007 the antibiotic residues consumed daily in drinking water interact with the human gastrointestinal microbiome long term exposure to antibiotics may induce changes in the intestinal microflora structure and increase the emergence of antibiotic resistant harmful bacteria or opportunistic pathogens inhabiting humans blaser 2016 damman et al 2012 p√©rez cobas et al 2012 exposure to residual antibiotics in drinking water may cause adverse health risks on humans unlike in many nations e g japan and the usa china s tap water is not recommended for drinking due to chlorine disinfection in recent decades chinese people have typically used boiled tap water for drinking in recent years an increasing number of people have gradually preferred to drink 1 filtered tap water i e tap water with on site purification by multistage filters installed in drinking fountains 2 bottled barreled water produced by chinese bottled water companies and 3 bottled water from foreign countries consuming different types of drinking water may result in different levels of antibiotic residue exposure however only a few studies have focused on human exposure to antibiotics via drinking water benotti et al 2009 boleda et al 2014 cai et al 2015 ji et al 2010 li et al 2017 wang et al 2016 yiruhan et al 2010 simazaki et al 2015 leung et al 2013 watkinson et al 2009 zuccato et al 2000 table 1 and these studies have had two limitations first only 2 to 28 kinds of antibiotics have been investigated in drinking water and only 20 were detected table 1 given that 120 different antibiotics are used in human health care and livestock husbandry wang et al 2015 it is highly likely that antibiotic residues in drinking water are greater than the range of investigated antibiotics second most previous studies assessed only tap water and ignored possible human exposure to antibiotic residues in other types of drinking water these two limitations may have resulted in a biased underestimate of human exposure and health risk of antibiotic residues in drinking water benotti et al 2009 boleda et al 2014 simazaki et al 2015 yiruhan et al 2010 zuccato et al 2000 the quality of drinking water is essential to human health and social development thus it is paramount to gain a comprehensive understanding of the potential human health risks due to antibiotic residue exposure from drinking water to that end this study monitored a wider range of antibiotic residues over 100 kinds in filtered tap water and bottled and barreled water than other studies and comprehensively assessed human exposure to residual antibiotics in different types of drinking water 2 methods 2 1 collection of drinking water samples drinking water samples were collected from a southern coastal city of china the city has a large population density approximately 2000 square kilometers and 13 million permanent residents and a well developed economy the tap water in the city is mainly derived from the east river dongjiang one of the main streams of the pearl river delta and is not considered to be directly drinkable without treatment bottled water and barreled water drinking fountains are of widespread availability in office buildings and residences and are the most common sources of drinking water in addition there are a few high end residential areas public institutions and facilities and commercial office buildings that have installed centralized treatment systems for further filtration of tap water meanwhile many families have purchased household tap water filtration purification systems typical commercial and residential tap water treatment systems consist of four filtrations steps 1 polypropylene cotton 2 activated carbon 3 core purification membrane and 4 a final activated carbon step to remove odor there are mainly three types of core filtration membranes in the chinese market ultra filtration membrane uf nano filtration membrane nf and reverse osmosis membrane ro the filtration accuracy of uf nf and ro is 0 01 0 001 and 0 0001 Œºm respectively at present ro is the most advanced and popular tap water treatment systems in the chinese market generally high end residential areas public institutions and facilities and commercial office buildings are equipped with ro drinking fountains residential tap water treatment systems are widely available for purchase in the city many households use ro drinking systems while others choose the other two types of core purification membranes due to lower price the life span of the ro membrane depends on the quality of the tap water the manufactures recommend replacing the membrane once a year thus three types of drinking water were collected including filtered tap water chinese brands of bottled and barreled water and foreign brands of bottled water in addition unfiltered tap water samples were also collected 2 1 1 filtered tap water there are approximately 44 water reservoirs supplying tap water in the city the water sources for these reservoirs are from the upper reach of the east river dongjiang and local precipitation the entire city was divided into 10 areas for collecting direct drinking water samples samples 3 or 6 samples individually sized with the volume of 1 l were collected in each area in january 2019 and april 2019 the sampling points selected were district libraries or office buildings that are equipped with drinking fountains to supply filtered tap water a total of 36 filtered tap water samples were collected unfiltered tap water samples n 30 at the same sampling points as the filtered tap water samples were also collected as a reference 2 1 2 bottled or barreled water a total of 42 bottled water samples from 14 brands were purchased from convenience stores or online shopping malls with 3 individual bottled water samples with the volume of 1 l collected for each brand the 14 brands of bottled water include the eight most common brands in china and six foreign brands two from france one from japan one from italy one from germany and one from the usa since most of the barreled water was of the same brand as the bottled water only 2 brands of barreled water were collected with 3 1 l individual samples collected for each brand all water samples were kept at 4 c and were analyzed within 3 7 days 2 2 selection of target analytes due to the lack of official data on the production or use of antibiotics in china a total of 106 antibiotics were included as target chemicals in the present study based on reported antibiotics in the environment and food ben et al 2019 they covered the most commonly used antibiotics used for human care and animal husbandry including 25 sulfonamides 5 acetylated sulfonamides 20 quinolones 6 tetracyclines and 9 of their degradation products 16 macrolides 14 Œ≤ lactams 3 chloramphenicols 3 polypeptides and 5 other antibiotics nine stable isotope labeled internal standards were used for analyzing the 106 antibiotics including 13c6 sulfadimidine d4 acetylsulfamethoxazole 13c d3 erythromycin d5 norfloxacin d4 fluconazol d5 metoprolol d2 carbamazepine 13c3 trimethoprim and d3 triclosan for detailed information and standard sources of the chemicals see supplementary materials chemicals and regents 2 3 sample preparation the sample preparation followed an established method for water samples wang et al 2016 yiruhan et al 2010 briefly each 1 l water sample was filtered through 7 Œºm gf glass microfibre filter f whatman buckinghamshire uk then 0 5 g na2edta and isotope labeled mixed internal standards were added to the filtrate the targeted antibiotic compounds in the drinking water sample were enriched using a hydrophilic lipophilic balanced hlb solid phase extraction spe cartridge oasis 500 mg 6 ml waters milford ma usa following the procedure described below the hlb cartridges were preconditioned with 10 ml methanol and 10 ml milli q water in sequence after acidification to ph 3 0 5 with 1 mol l hydrochloric acid the water samples were loaded on the cartridge at a flow rate of 5 10 ml min then the cartridges were rinsed with 10 ml milli q water and vacuum dried for approximately 20 min the analytes were eluted from the hlb cartridge using 10 ml methanol the elution was evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen using a turbovap biotage cardiff uk at 40 c and reconstituted with 0 5 ml methanol for instrumental analysis 2 4 instrumental analyses an agilent 1290 infinity ultra high performance liquid chromatography equipped with an agilent 6470 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer uhplc ms ms was used for targeted identification and quantification of the 106 antibiotics in drinking water the ms conditions were optimized for detecting the 106 antibiotics and two precursor fragment ion pairs with the highest abundances were generally selected for mass spectrometric analysis the ion pairs fragmentation voltages and collision energies for the detected antibiotics and the 13c or 2h labeled internal standard were determined see supplementary materials table s1 based on the different physical chemical properties of the targeted analytes the 106 antibiotics were divided into two groups one comprised 102 antibiotics and another comprised the remaining 4 antibiotics including three chloramphenicols and one sulfanitran the 102 antibiotics in the first group were analyzed on a waters beh c8 column 1 7 Œºm 2 1 100 mm waters milford ma usa with a vanguard column to obtain a better separation of target analytes different mobile phases were applied in this study although sharp peaks and improved sensitivity of analytes can be obtained when using the mobile phase a 0 1 formic acid in water b acetonitrile four isomers including epioxytetracycline oxytetracycline sulfameter and sulfamethoxypyridazine could not be separated due to poor chromatographic separation by switching the mobile phase b from acetonitrile to methanol these isomers could be well separated in the chromatogram see supplementary materials fig s1 mobile phases a and b were 0 1 formic acid in water and methanol respectively the flow rate was 0 40 ml min and the column was kept at room temperature 25 c the gradient conditions were as follows 0 min 10 b 3 5 min 40 b 4 0 min 48 b 4 5 min 30 b 6 0 min 100 b 8 0 min 100 b 10 01 min 10 b and re equilibration to 14 min the antibiotics were identified and quantified by dynamic multi reaction monitoring mrm in esi mode the injection volume was 2 Œºl for the mass spectrometer settings the gas and sheath gas temperatures were 325 and 350 c and the flow rates were 10 and 11 l min respectively the nebulizer was set at 20 psi the capillary and nozzle voltages were 4000 and 2000 v respectively in this way ofloxacin and levofloxacin a pair of chiral compounds were very difficult to separate on an achiral chromatographic column using methanol or acetonitrile as the mobile phase the total levels of these two compounds are presented as ofloxacin levofloxacin in the present study the remaining four antibiotics in the second group were analyzed by mrm in esi mode a waters cortecs t3 column 1 6 Œºm 2 1 100 mm waters milford ma usa with a vanguard column was used for chromatographic separation mobile phases a and b were ultrapure water and methanol respectively the flow rate was set at 0 40 ml min and the column was operated at room temperature 25 c the gradient conditions were as follows 0 min 10 b 1 min 70 b 3 min 90 b 4 min 10 b and re equilibration to 6 min the injection volume was 5 Œºl the ms conditions were set as the same as those for the analysis of the antibiotics in the former group 2 5 limits of detection lods the instrument detection limits idls were defined as follows 1 idl t rsd amount injected 100 where t is the student s t value given for the specified confidence level 99 and degree of freedom n 1 and rsd is the relative standard deviation of peak area at the amount injected from n replicate injections generally n 6 one negative control water blank spiked with the internal standards and run through the identical analysis procedures as those for the actual samples was determined along with every 6 samples and a total of 15 negative control samples were analyzed background noise interfered with the signals of bacitracin a doxycycline fleroxacin iso chlortetracycline methacycline minocycline monensin ofloxacin levofloxacin pipemidic acid piperacillin roxithromycin sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole tetracycline trimethoprim and sulfanitran the limits of detection lods for these compounds in the blank samples were calculated as the mean plus three standard deviations of the concentrations and ranged from 0 031 to 24 ng l for those compounds that were not detected in water blanks the lods were set equal to the idls as a result the lods ranged from 0 030 to 0 28 ng l for sulfonamides 0 040 0 50 ng l for quinolones 0 022 3 5 ng l for tetracyclines 0 0090 0 41 ng l for macrolides 0 022 24 ng l for Œ≤ lactams 0 023 0 073 ng l for chloramphenicols and 0 012 0 063 ng l for the other antibiotics in drinking water see supplementary materials table s2 2 6 data analyses identification and quantitation of the analytes were performed using agilent s mass hunter quantitative analysis software version b 08 00 to avoid overestimation of human exposure to antibiotics via drinking water we assumed the amounts for undetected antibiotics below the lods equal to 0 if the detection frequency of antibiotics were 50 while the amounts were assumed to be lod 2 if the detection frequency of antibiotics were 50 in the present study to characterize population variability of antibiotic daily intakes via drinking water boostrap re sampling based monte carlo simulation was performed with 5000 iterations by matlab version 2015a the cumulative distribution function of the 5000 iterations showed that more than 90 of our generated data can well fit the characteristics of statistical distributions of observations the statistical descriptors of the intakes of the detected compounds in drinking water including the mean and median were estimated on the basis of the 5000 iterations 3 results and discussions 3 1 method development for the quantitation of residual antibiotic in drinking water this study is the first attempt to simultaneously determine approximately 100 antibiotics in drinking water based on the different physical chemical properties of the targeted analytes the 106 antibiotics were divided into two groups 102 antibiotics were efficiently separated and detected within 10 min using water 0 1 fa methanol as mobile phases in dynamic mrm esi mode with a waters beh c8 column and the remaining 4 analytes were identified and quantified within 5 min by mrm in esi mode with a waters cortecs t3 column the optimized chromatograms of the 106 antibiotics and sub chromatograms for 7 classes of antibiotics are shown in fig 1 showing clear quantifiable peaks for all the analytes the recovery validation was carried out in 3 6 replicates of 1 l filtered tap water spiked with three levels 0 5 5 and 50 ng l of antibiotic mixture standards in contrast to 14 analytes with recovery rates always lower than 40 the average recovery of 92 analytes was mean standard deviation 88 0 19 1 80 0 23 9 88 2 37 9 at the spiked levels of 50 5 and 0 5 ng l respectively while the 0 5 ng l spiking was close to the lods of some analytes the 14 analytes with low recoveries were bacitracin a colistin a colistin b Œ± apo oxytetracycline Œ≤ apo oxytetracycline sulfasalazine spiramycin sulfaguanidine sulfanilamide narasin salinomycin tilmicosin 4 epianhydrochlortetracycline and 4 epianhydrotetracycline the chromatograms of spiked narasin and salinomycin showed 2 peaks after pretreatment therefore 92 analytes were identified and quantified in the following analysis of antibiotics in the samples of filtered tap water chinese bottled and barreled waters and foreign brands of bottled waters it is noteworthy that in unfiltered tap water there were only 30 analytes with a recovery rate higher than 40 with an average recovery rate for the 30 analytes of 81 26 0 and 80 23 at the spiked levels of 50 and 5 ng l respectively the identification and quantitation of the remaining 76 analytes were strongly inhibited by impurities in tap water see supplementary materials fig s2 with average matrix spike recovery rates of 9 8 1 3 and 5 0 0 9 at spiked levels of 50 and 5 ng l respectively the low recovery rates for the 76 analytes is likely caused by interference from disinfection byproducts in tap water and secondary pollution generated from pipeline aging these results were consistent with a previous research finding that the spe efficiency quantification and quantitation of twelve sulfonamides were strongly influenced by the matrix effect of tap water borecka et al 2014 analyte recoveries for the filtered tap water samples exhibited significantly higher recoveries as described above of analytes in matrix spiked experiments than unfiltered tap water suggesting that the filtration and purification technology used for the filtered tap water could be good for pretreatment to reduce matrix effects when antibiotics are analyzed in tap water 3 2 occurrence of antibiotics in drinking water 3 2 1 filtered tap water the filtered tap water samples were collected from 10 areas of the city whose water supply comes from different reservoirs five or more compounds were detected in all the filtered tap water samples the highest number of detected analytes was 41 at one sampling site whose water supply was from a reservoir surrounded by restaurants indicating that the water source in the reservoir may be polluted by the dining industry sewage the concentrations of the detected compounds ranged from 0 021 ng l for jossamycin to 1 133 ng l for dicloxacillin among the 92 analytes 34 were not detected and 37 were detected in fewer than 30 of samples range 3 28 twenty one were detected in more than 30 of filtered tap water samples with the highest detection frequency being 100 for trimethoprim fig 2 nineteen parent compounds four tetracyclines three macrolides six quinolones four sulfonamides one Œ≤ lactam and monensin and two degradation products 4 epitetracycline and n acetylsulfamethoxazole were detected in the 36 filtered tap water samples with an average and median concentration ranging from 0 24 and n d ng l for sulfamethoxazole to 101 and 25 ng l for dicloxacillin see supplementary materials table s2 the total concentration of the detected antibiotics in filtered tap water samples ranged from 6 0 ng l to 1172 ng l with an average and median concentration of 182 and 92 ng l and 80 of the filtered tap water samples had a total concentration of detected antibiotics of greater than 50 ng l in addition the 30 antibiotic analytes that were not affected by the matrix effect of tap water n 30 were also quantitated in the unfiltered tap water samples collected at the same sampling sites as the filtered tap water samples see supplementary materials fig s3 similar detection frequencies and concentrations of target analytes were observed in tap water and filtered tap water samples p 0 05 this may suggest that the multistage filter in regular drinking fountains involved in the present study does not remove antibiotics at the residual level of ng l there are relatively limited studies regarding antibiotic occurrence in drinking water cai et al 2015 hanna et al 2018 leung et al 2013 li et al 2017 yiruhan et al 2010 and the available data are reviewed in table 1 compared with the concentrations in these studies the maximum concentrations of azithromycin 22 ng l clarithromycin 8 9 ng l enrofloxacin 13 ng l and trimethoprim 5 2 ng l in the collected filtered tap water samples were close to those in tap water from shanghai changsha hangzhou and guangzhou china leung et al 2013 however the maximum levels of lomefloxacin 1 2 ng l and sulfamethazine 3 2 ng l in our filtered tap water samples were significantly lower than the levels 179 ng l and 77 2 ng l respectively in tap water from guangzhou and the maximum levels of sulfamethoxazole 0 98 ng l and ciprofloxacin 5 7 ng l in our samples were lower than those in tap water from guangzhou 21 2 ng l and 679 7 ng l respectively and shandong 18 6 ng l and 224 4 ng l respectively yiruhan et al 2010 leung et al 2013 hanna et al 2018 furthermore the maximum concentration of norfloxacin 297 ng l and roxithromycin 27 ng l in the collected filtered tap water samples was significantly higher than that 82 7 ng l and 15 1 ng l respectively in tap water from guangzhou yiruhan et al 2010 leung et al 2013 in contrast to the high concentrations of chloramphenicols detected in tap water from shanghai wang et al 2016 hangzhou and guangzhou leung et al 2013 chloramphenicols were seldom detected in our filtered tap water samples according to announcement no 193 listing the veterinary drugs and other compounds banned for livestock animals ministry of agriculture of the people republic of china 2011 chloramphenicol has been listed as a banned veterinary drug since 2002 due to its inhibition of hematopoietic function of bone marrow clinical applications are also limited however due to its strong antibacterial effect and low price it is likely that chloramphenicol is still in use illegally the infrequent detection in the present study may indicate that the current use of chloramphenicol is gradually in decline due to strict control in recent years 3 2 2 chinese brands of bottled barreled water the 30 individual bottled barreled water samples were from eight brands of bottled water and two brands of barreled water bottled by different companies in china the water sources of the different brands of bottled water are distributed throughout the country four or more compounds were detected in the chinese brand bottled and barreled water samples with the highest number of detected compounds in one brand of bottle samples being 31 the concentration of the detected compounds ranged from 0 0094 ng l for jossamycin to 1 376 ng l for roxithromycin among the 92 analytes 47 were not detected and 23 were detected in fewer than 30 of the samples range 3 27 twenty two were detected in more than 30 of bottle water samples with the highest detection frequency being 100 for trimethoprim similar to the results for filtered tap water these twenty two included 20 parent compounds three tetracyclines five macrolides six quinolones three sulfonamides one Œ≤ lactam one chloramphenicol and monensin and two degradation products 4 epitetracycline and 4 epioxytetracycline fig 2 with an average and median concentration ranging from 0 034 and n d ng l for monensin to 96 and 5 5 ng l for roxithromycin see supplementary materials table s2 respectively the total concentration of the detected antibiotics in bottled and barreled water samples ranged from 16 ng l to 1 554 ng l with an average and median concentration of 180 and 105 ng l respectively additionally 80 of the bottled and barreled water samples had a total concentration of detected antibiotics of greater than 50 ng l the chinese brands of bottled water labeled as mineral water or purified water collected in the present study were derived from deep lakes groundwater or mountain springs in different regions of china the production of these bottled water generally included aeration filtration sterilization filling the types and concentrations of detected compounds in filtered tap water and bottled and barreled water were very similar fig 2 which may indicate a background pollution of antibiotic residues in chinese waters it is also noteworthy that eight of 10 degradation products were found in the collected water samples while 50 of 82 parent compounds of antibiotics were detected in the water samples this may indicate a wide occurrence of antibiotic degradation products in drinking water in china possible antibiotic degradation products in the environment range far beyond the 10 quantitative analytes in the present study and even far beyond our current knowledge identification and quantification of unknown products from antibiotics transformation in the environment should receive more attention 3 2 3 foreign brands of bottled water the foreign bottled water samples included one brand from the usa one from japan one from italy one from germany and two from france each with 3 individual samples three or more compounds were detected in these foreign bottled water samples with the highest number of detected antibiotic analytes in a single brand of bottled water samples being 23 the concentration of the detected compounds ranged from 0 013 ng l for monensin to 3 462 ng l for dicloxacillin among the 92 analytes 56 were not detected and 20 were detected in fewer than 30 of the samples range 6 28 sixteen were detected in more than 30 of the samples with the highest detection frequency being 100 for dicloxacillin and trimethoprim these sixteen included 15 parent compounds four tetracyclines six quinolones three sulfonamides one Œ≤ lactam and monensin and one degradation product 4 epitetracycline with average and median concentrations ranging from 0 068 and 0 060 ng l for monensin to 631 and 113 ng l for dicloxacillin see supplementary materials table s2 the concentrations of sulfamethizole n d sulfadimethoxine n d and sulfamethoxazole n d 0 38 ng l detected in the italian brand of bottled water collected in the present study were lower than those n d 9 ng l for sulfamethizole n d 11 ng l for sulfadimethoxine and n d 80 ng l for sulfamethoxazole respectively reported in a previous study perret et al 2006 the total concentration of the detected antibiotics in bottled water samples from these countries ranged from 69 ng l to 3 486 ng l with an average and median concentration of 666 and 146 ng l almost 90 of the total antibiotic concentration was contributed by dicloxacillin if dicloxacillin was excluded the average and median concentration of the overall detected antibiotics was 35 and 18 and ng l this may be related to the use of dicloxacillin for the treatment of methicillin susceptible s aureus infections in human and small animal health care sandberg et al 2010 dicloxacillin is a member of penicillinase resistant penicillins and now is also used for therapy as a composite drug combined with amoxicillin due to its stability against penicillinases and low toxicity according to the world health organization report on surveillance of antibiotic consumption in 2016 2018 who 2018 dicloxacillin contributed about 7 3 of total defined daily doses ddd of antibiotics per 1000 inhabitants per day oral intake in the region of the americas and it was found that 65 of dicloxacillin by oral intake is excreted through urine and released into the environment hirsch et al 1999 3 2 4 comparison between chinese and foreign brands of bottled water compared with the antibiotics detected in these foreign brands of bottled water the number of antibiotics detected in chinese bottled water was significantly higher indicating that the antibiotic pollution in chinese drinking water was more complex macrolides were the most prevalent class of antibiotics detected in china fig 3 and roxithromycin was detected in chinese bottled water with a high frequency and concentration while it was seldom detected in any foreign brands of bottled water this may be due to the wide use of roxithromycin as a veterinary medicine in china the concentrations of sulfonamides detected in chinese bottled water were higher than that in the foreign brands of bottled water while the concentration of quinolones was similar to that in the foreign brands of bottled water the concentration of tetracyclines in water from china was lower than those in water from germany and france but higher than those in water from the usa and japan chloramphenicols and other antibiotics were present in low concentrations and exhibited low detection frequencies in all bottled waters it is noteworthy that the concentrations of Œ≤ lactams dicloxacillin detected in water from germany and france were 10 30 times higher than those detected in water from china the usa and japan however the comparison of antibiotics in drinking water between china and other countries in the present study was limited by the sample size further nationwide and worldwide investigations of antibiotic residues in drinking water are warranted 3 3 assessment of human exposure to residual antibiotics in drinking water 3 3 1 exposure assessment currently chinese people especially urbanites are increasingly demanding high quality drinking water and thus prefer filtered tap water or bottled barreled water while some wealthy people even only drink bottled water produced by foreign nations the daily exposure of people living in the city to residual antibiotics via drinking water was estimated for three scenarios the first scenario was that people only drank filtered tap water scenario 1 the second was that people only drank chinese brands of bottled barreled water scenario 2 and the third one was that people only drank foreign brands of bottled water scenario 3 daily intake by drinking water ng kg day was calculated by the following equation 2 di water c i d water bw where c i is the concentration of compound i in the drinking water sample and dwater and bw are the daily water intake and body weight which were set to 1 7 l and 65 kg for the chinese general population respectively according to the major science and technology program for water pollution control and treatment of china 2014 2017 rceescas 2018 zhang et al 2019 there were still a variety of possibilities in the drinking water sources in each scenario for example in scenario 1 a resident in the city would be most likely to only drink from one or two areas home and work while the possibility of drinking water from all the 10 subareas is also possible similarly many residents tended to drink the same brand of bottled water every day while some people preferred to change the brands of bottle water thus to characterize the variability of antibiotic daily intakes via drinking water bootstrap re sampling based on monte carlo simulation was performed with 5000 iterations with monte carlo simulations based on an empirical cumulative probability function of the concentration data the average and median estimated overall daily intakes of all the detectable antibiotics by drinking water were 4 3 and 2 3 ng kg day 0 14 31 ng kg day for scenario 1 4 0 and 2 5 ng kg day 0 40 41 ng kg day for scenario 2 and 16 and 4 9 ng kg day 1 8 91 ng kg day for scenario 3 respectively considering the possibilities that humans could be exposed to antibiotic residues in the environment by drinking water inhalation ingestion and dermal contact of particulate matter and food consumption the total daily intake of antibiotic residues for the people living in the city may be close to a level of Œºg kg day 3 3 2 risk assessment compared with effects of therapeutic clinical or self medication as short term and high dose exposures the effect of antibiotic residues from drinking water on humans is likely to be a long term and low dose exposure the trace amounts of individual antibiotic residues in the environment may pose a low selection risk to the human microbiome but a long term exposure to such a mixture of dozens to hundreds of antibiotic residues may play a more powerful and far reaching role in the selection of bacterial resistance than the antibiotics used in medical treatment however the mixture toxicities of antibiotics to the overall gastrointestinal bacteria in particular long term exposure to antibiotic mixtures at the residual levels and their corresponding metabolites has not yet been well understood rodriguez mozaz and weinberg 2010 therefore the information and data required to quantify the risks of a mixture of antibiotic residues in the environment are severely limited therefore the exposure risks from residual antibiotics in different types of drinking water were assessed individually in the present study based on the available toxicity information and data sixteen analytes were detectable in more than 30 of the filtered tap water the chinese brands of bottled water and the foreign brands of bottled water samples these 16 analytes are a potential list of antibiotic residues to be recommended for monitoring in drinking water the estimated average and median daily intake ranged from 0 0058 and 0 ng kg day for sulfamethoxazole to 2 3 and 0 54 ng kg day for dicloxacillin in scenario 1 from 0 00077 and 0 ng kg day for monensin to 2 0 and 0 14 ng kg day for roxithromycin in scenario 2 and from 0 00074 and 0 00030 ng kg day for monensin to 14 and 2 7 ng kg day for dicloxacillin in scenario 3 respectively table 2 for assessing human health risk when considering the detected antibiotics individually both acceptable daily intakes adis derived from toxicological data and minimum inhibition concentrations mics determined by microbiological approaches were adopted table 2 based on the toxicological approach no observed adverse effect levels noaels and lowest observed adverse effect levels loaels were divided by uncertainty factors ufs to be converted to human equivalent doses for noncarcinogenic risk bruce et al 2010 dong et al 2015 for norfloxacin with evidence of carcinogenicity in rats the virtually safe dose which corresponds to a cancer risk of one in a million was calculated by dividing the maximum tolerated dose mtd by 740 000 to predict the cancer potential bruce et al 2010 gaylor and gold 1998 the toxicological adis were generally 102 108 times higher than the drinking daily intake of each individual antibiotic table 2 indicating that the intake of antibiotics via the three types of drinking water posed no immediate human development toxicity and threat of cartilage injury the toxicological adi is mainly applicable to assessing the risk of development toxicity and reproduction toxicity however the most likely risk associated with antibiotic residues in drinking water would be promoting emergence and selection for resistant commensal bacteria inhabiting the human body especially the intestinal flora to estimate the risk of resistance selection as a result of exposure to the residual antibiotic concentrations in drinking water minimal selective concentrations mscs for antibiotic resistance selection should be used to derive the microbiological adi minimal selective concentration is initially defined as the lowest antibiotic concentration that could give a competitive advantage in growth rate to a resistant genotype over the susceptible genotype strain sandegren 2014 and currently selective concentrations of antibiotics in complex communities have been gradually assessed in recent studies kraupner et al 2018 lundstrom et al 2016 murray et al 2018 nevertheless studies on mscs are scarce to date and there is little to no available msc data derived from the human microbial community minimum inhibition concentrations were used to predict mscs by dividing by a factor of 10 based on the median mic msc ratio gullberg et al 2011 then the microbiological adi was calculated using the following equation bruce et al 2010 jeong et al 2009 leung et al 2013 schwab et al 2005 3 a d i m i c 50 m c c 10 e f b w where mic50 is the concentration inhibiting 50 of the human commensal microflora which generally includes escherichia coli e coli peptostreptococcus streptococcus and klebsiella pneumoniae 10 is the extrapolation factor from mic to msc gullberg et al 2011 mcc refers to the mass of colonic content 220 g and ef is the effective fraction of the oral dose available to the colonic microorganisms 20 bruce et al 2010 leung et al 2013 the microbiological adis were generally 102 106 times higher than the drinking daily intake for most of the detected compounds table 2 indicating that the exposure to individual residual antibiotics in drinking water may have no significant effects on human gut bacteria although all the detected antibiotics may pose a low risk to human health when considered individually at the residual level in drinking water there were still many uncertainties in the aforementioned risk assessment first no data are available on the gastrointestinal absorption of daily intake of different antibiotics residuals in food and drinking water the default value of 20 for different antibiotics is highly uncertain second it has become increasingly clear that long term antibiotic exposure could contribute to the evolution of high level bacterial resistance at concentrations that are several hundred fold below mics wistrand yuen et al 2018 the use of a factor of 10 to extrapolate mscs may overestimate the value of the microbiological adi and underestimate health risk third the metabolism of xenobiotic antibiotics by different gut bacterial species could be significantly perturbed in a species specific manner zhang et al 2018 it was very likely that the msc values of different gut bacteria vary greatly and that the use of an msc of a certain strain would lead to neglecting the selection of sensitive gut bacteria last the metabolites produced from the gastrointestinally absorbed antibiotics by gut bacteria may pose even greater toxicity to human health than the original antibiotics nonetheless little is known about the possible interactions and metabolism of the gastrointestinally absorbed antibiotics in the highly heterogeneous gastrointestinal system due to the technical challenges of analyzing the unknown metabolites all of these issues collectively indicate that further research is urgently needed to develop a more comprehensive assessment of the overall human exposure to antibiotic residues in the environment mscs in complex microbiome communities in the human body and the metabolism of xenobiotic antibiotics in the gastrointestinal system 4 conclusions the study is the first to survey approximately 100 antibiotics in different types of drinking water in china the screening analysis provides cost and time effective monitoring a wider range of antibiotic residues in drinking water the results suggested a complex antibiotic pollution in chinese drinking water with a prevalence of macrolides based on the levels of antibiotic residues analyzed in different types of drinking water the individual and overall values of daily intake of all the detected antibiotics were estimated for three scenarios only filtered tap water was drunk only chinese brands of bottled water was drunk and only foreign brands of bottled water was drunk risk of human exposure to trace antibiotics via drinking water was assessed individually indicating that the individual antibiotic residues in drinking water may pose low risk to human health however the data and knowledge required to comprehensively characterize the overall risks of antibiotic residues exposure is severely limited further research is needed for a more in depth understanding of the potential adverse effects of exposure to environmental antibiotic

18034,biological treatment of wastewater always leaves plenty of refractory dissolved organic matters dom in effluents specifically for fresh waste leachate aiming at comprehending the production and removal of these compounds this study investigated dom transformation in a simultaneous denitrification and methanogenesis with activated sludge sdm as system with no 3 no 2 backflow for raw fresh leachate chemical oxygen demand cod was reduced to 854 120 mg l from 63000 470 mg l and total nitrogen tn decreased from 2500 647 mg l to 404 75 mg l during an operation of 440 days the sdm reactor was fed at organic loading rate of 6 70 kgcod m3 d to generate 2 52 l ch4 l d molecular information of leachate dom was acquired by using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with orbitrap mass spectrometry a dom classification based on venn diagram was proposed to divide leachate dom into seven categories it revealed that 76 84 of final effluent dom stemmed from biological derivation posteriori non target screening showed anthropogenic micropollutants e g phosphate flame retardants and industrial agents probably contributed to the remnant native inert dom in the effluent at the levels of 5 200 Œºg l dom classification also showed a portion of bio derived dom can be completely removed by sdm as processes while the rest bio derived dom can be partially removed depending on dom nature and the recirculation ratio the removal and production rate of a specific bio derived molecule in respective sdm and as units theoretically satisfied a hyperbolical and dual relationship in

in wastewater treatment far and wide however refractory dissolved organic matters dom inevitably emerge in final effluents regardless of process types this phenomenon is particularly prominent for fresh waste leachate treatment since the typical chemical oxygen demand cod of the effluent posterior to different biological processes is still as high as 700 3000 mg l im et al 2001 peng et al 2008 wei et al 2012 yin et al 2017 with influent cod and total nitrogen tn being up to 60 000 80 000 mg l and 2000 4000 mg l respectively he et al 2009 dang et al 2016 lei et al 2019 soluble microbial products generated from bio reactions are extensively considered as a vast fraction in sewage wastewater treatment plants wwtp effluents barker and stuckey 1999 aquino et al 2009 kunacheva and stuckey 2014 whereas waste leachate also comprises refractory humic substances he et al 2006 dang et al 2016 and various xenobiotic micro pollutants with extremely higher concentrations than sewage wastewater kjeldsen et al 2002 zheng et al 2007 eggen et al 2010 thus whether endogenous bio derived dom or extraneous inert compounds dominate the effluent from biotreatments of fresh leachate remains a conundrum the effluent dom can induce fouling of membrane systems jarusutthirak and amy 2006 and generate disinfection by products which are detrimental to human health and ecosystem ding et al 2013 yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 thereby it is crucial to recognize the transformation of these remnant dom in bio treatment processes and diminish the occurrence thereof kunacheva and stuckey 2014 wang and chen 2018 several researches have focused on the effect of influent substrates composition zhang et al 2016 ly et al 2018 cao et al 2019 du et al 2019 and external operational conditions xie et al 2013 simsek et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 yang et al 2018 hu et al 2019 on the yield and property of final bio derived dom from activated sludge systems for synthetic wastewater still and all it is unclear how and how much effluent dom compounds are newly produced and removed during treatment serial by combined biological technologies a methodology to differentiate the composition of effluent dom is the indispensable basis for developing innovative approaches and operation strategies to diminish the organic carbon of the effluents xie et al 2012 hu et al 2020 however it is a challenge to recognize and distinguish native or bio derived dom from real wastewater treatment as each analytical method could singly reveal specific properties of part dom kunacheva and stuckey 2014 kellerman et al 2015 qiu et al 2020 to this point optical and magnetic spectrum instruments have the shortcoming of only looking into bulk structure property of blended dom mesfioui et al 2012 in comparison high resolution mass spectrometry spotlighted in recent years is shown to be a unique method kellerman et al 2014 to offer a molecular recognition into various wastewater yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 qiu et al 2020 and n containing bio derived dom mesfioui et al 2012 hu et al 2019 thousands of detected molecular formulae facilitate to understand dom evolution trend during wastewater treatment serial mesfioui et al 2012 yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 and degradation processes of natural organics in sequencing batch logue et al 2016 kamjunke et al 2017 some studies have investigated molecular transformation in parallel or sequential connected wastewater processes yuan et al 2017 nurenberg et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 nonetheless there were few reports that analysed dom evolution in wastewater treatment system with backflow for both organics and nitrogen removal especially concentrated on differentiating bio derived and native dom additionally the system with backflow is a ubiquitous form for wastewater treatment e g anoxic oxic process lu et al 2014 compared with sequential processes the backflow setting would make it difficult to clarify the turnover of dom since the input and output of the water treatment system are multi paths simultaneous denitrification and methanogenesis with activated sludge sdm as system can reduce nitrogen and organic contaminants in a single anaerobic reactor chen and lin 1993 which has been successfully applied into the treatment of wastewater with high carbon and nitrogen organic loading e g landfill leachate im et al 2001 peng et al 2008 slaughterhouse wastewater del pozo and diez 2003 piggery wastewater huang et al 2007 brewery wastewater baloch et al 2006 and oceanic biofoulings akizuki and toda 2018 the nitrogen removal depends on the recirculation of no 3 no 2 into anaerobic system so as to obtain 100 of denitrification efficiency im et al 2001 del pozo and diez 2003 peng et al 2008 allochthonous organics are demonstrated to be dispensable carbon source for microbe s growth in natural ecosystems tranvik 1988 n containing bio derived dom from wwtp are also shown be labile in natural waters mesfioui et al 2012 hu et al 2019 in this regard based on the recirculation of no 3 no 2 we hypothesized part of aerobic bio derived dom can be removed by sdm unit therefore aiming at elucidating the persistence of bio derived and native dom this study selected raw fresh leachate from waste to energy plant to investigate dom transformation in a sdm as system using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with orbitrap mass spectrometry uplc orbitrap ms the refractory compounds of high abundance in the effluent were also tentatively identified by posteriori non target screening with tandem orbitrap ms venn analysis supported to distinguish the bio derived and native dom based on the high throughput ms dataset a quantitative relation was further deduced to describe the production and removal of bio derived dom the outcomes of this study could provide a novel insight into the molecular composition turnover of wastewater bio treatment with backflow for helping develop new biological technologies to reduce the effluent dom 2 materials and methods 2 1 start up of sdm as reactor the sdm as reactor scheme is visualized in fig 1 an up flow anaerobic bio film

http www chemspider com and pubchem https pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov to confirm chemical possibility venn analysis swinton 2009 was conducted to divide dom into seven categories table 1 the quantification method of each fraction is based on the richness and abundance richness is the number of mass features in each fraction and abundance is based on weighted average of peak area logue et al 2016 patriarca et al 2018 qiu et al 2020 bulk molecular indexes were calculated according to the equations see eqs s1 s6 in supplementary information si modified from koch and dittmar 2006 and

after 440 days operation respectively the sdm unit worked at a steady ph of 7 58 0 12 the concentration of methane was 69 2 v v 78 cod was removed in sdm unit to recover 244 ml ch4 g cod 126 l ch4 d c2 c8 organic acids were also not detected in sdm digestate in fig s1a cod of sdm effluent was 2530 1700 mg l but soluble cod dropped to 1065 190 mg l it indicated that the fraction of particulate cod in sdm effluent was high which should be split from deciduous anaerobic bio film torretta et al 2016 soluble cod in the effluent was similar as cod bod5 decreased to 2 mg l and cod was reduced to 854 120 mg l after as unit soluble cod in sdm digestate appeared to resemble final effluent implying sufficient degradation of organics by sdm as processes totally nearly 100 of no 3 and no 2 was denitrified in sdm unit to reduce 83 7 of input tn additionally nh 4 was nitrified to 10 mg l in as unit it completely corresponded to the theoretical nitrogen removal rate r r 1 82 7 r q c q r recirculation flow ratio see fig 1 of sdm as processes im et al 2001 for the as unit mlss concentration was stable at 1 4 g l and mlvss concentration was around 1 0 g l with a nitrification rate of 0 11 kg nh 4 n m3 d the nitrification rate was lower than those in previous researches 0 3 0 84 kg nh 4 n m3 d im et al 2001 peng et al 2008 to avoid ammonia accumulation under high r huang et al 2007 3 2 dom transformation in sdm as processes as shown in fig s1 bulk parameters cod and bod5 drastically dropped by 90 but two fold more mass features emerged in the sdm digestate than raw leachate table s4 33 of mass features were reduced after as unit these phenomena were also observed in a full scale integrated chemical wastewater treatment plant zhang et al 2019 raw leachate contained high portion of biodegradable organics with bod5 cod of 0 36 sdm unit consumed almost all of these labile organics it resulted in increasing dom molecular weight distribution from 128 210 da to 225 264 da table s5 consistent with previous studies he et al 2006 qiu et al 2020 in fig 2 a after treatment of sdm and as units aromaticity index ai show the aromatization of dom see eq s2 distribution of leachate dom shifted to two fold increase in both esi and esi mode similar as the aging of leachate qiu et al 2020 sdm and as units contributed to the significant rise p 0 01 lsd analysis of h c and fall p 0 01 lsd analysis of double bond equivalent dbe represent the unsaturation of dom see eq s3 in fig 2b and c the h c of the final effluent decreased to 1 00 in esi mode resembling to natural koch et al 2005 yuan et al 2017 and stabilized chen et al 2018 dom in aerobic system the oxidation of alcoholic hydroxyl and phenol group can contribute to the attenuation of h c koch and dittmar 2006 therefore dbe went up in fig 2b mainly because of losing h atoms of leachate dom after dehydrogenation and dehydration reaction schollee et al 2015 it was conspicuous for nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc show redox status of carbon see eq s4 in leachate dom to increase during the sdm as processes additionally atom c of digestate dom was oxidized p 0 01 lsd analysis even in anaerobic sdm unit in fig 2d1 corresponding to the decreasing trend of h c this was probably because most electrons were transported to ch4 and n2 kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2010 these results suggested the refractoriness trend of the dom turnover during the sdm as processes nevertheless n c and o c went into crosscurrent by esi and esi in fig 2e and f it can be ascribed to various proton gain and loss capacity of miscellaneous dom esi facilities to ionize acidic organics with high o c while esi facilities to ionize amino amide compounds with alkaline sleighter and hatcher 2007 in this regard we did not focus on the esi result of o c and n c as nearly 70 studies singly using esi for dom molecular analysis ohno et al 2016 in anaerobic sdm unit carboxyl cooh or acetyl ch3 co on labile organics would be transformed to co2 and h2o and the released co2 is hard to be utilized to biologically synthesize dom again even in aerobic condition einsiedl et al 2007 valle et al 2019 it is the main reason for leachate dom to be deoxygenated during sdm as treatment procedure as reflected by o c decreasing p 0 01 lsd analysis from 0 37 to 0 27 in esi mode the generation of n containing bio derived dom e g amino acids and nucleic acids might favour the increasing n c p 0 01 lsd analysis from 0 031 to 0 121 mesfioui et al 2012 hu et al 2019 3 3 leachate dom classification based on venn diagram to clarify the turnover of labile and recalcitrant dom the dom transformation in the sdm as reactor has been generally assessed by bulk molecular indexes furthermore leachate dom were classified by venn analysis according to presence absence of mass features visualized in fig 3 category g is supposed to be of plausible nonexistence in the sdm as processes otherwise it belongs to special compounds similar to conjugates from human metabolites nurenberg et al 2019 which can be transformed in anaerobic condition and recovered in aerobic system anyway category g only accounted for 3 4 richness of total detected mass features implying few cross contaminations occurring in the test serial as majority of organics became biogas in sdm unit category a was completely removed in the sdm unit corresponding to the red dash line i e œâ i sdm 1 in fig 4 however 29 39 richness of dom category b in raw leachate still slid into sdm digestate in fig 3 anyway the average œâ i sdm of category b was 72 77 unit suggesting the biodegradability thereof comparatively the average œâ i sdm of category c dropped to 44 51 and the average œâ i as was 24 36 waste leachate is a source of various xenobiotic micropollutants kjeldsen et al 2002 eggen et al 2010 the majority of native inert dom category c were halogenated and phosphorus compounds in table s2 therefore it was not strange that category c contributed the abundance of 15 23 table s6 in final effluent even though the richness was 4 6 fig 3 thereof it can confirm that the persistence of native dom is c b a the other evidence is that native inert dom category c showed lower h c and higher dbe than labile native category b dom as well in fig 5 a and fig 5b furthermore venn diagram also favours distinguishing dom sources in sdm as processes thus categories a b c and categories d e f represented native dom in raw leachate and bio derived dom during sdm as processes respectively the compounds of high abundance in table s2 were almost bio derived dom category e and f it is similar as the wwtp effluent which contains more than 60 of bio derived dom nurenberg et al 2019 native dom showed higher h c p 0 01 lsd analysis and lower dbe p 0 01 lsd analysis than bio derived dom by esi in fig 5a and b concretely the h c distribution drifted from 1 0 to 2 0 to 1 5 0 5 ai is directly related to aromatic structure of natural dom koch and dittmar 2006 in fig 5c average ai of bio derived dom increased from 0 2 of native dom to 0 4 moreover nosc of bio derived dom was also lower than that of native dom by using esi in fig 5d1 the aged aquatic dom are mainly regarded as microbial degradation products kellerman et al 2018 these results implied effluent dom from sdm as processes were refractory natural aliphatic compounds evolve to aromatic compounds along with nosc varying from low to high kellerman et al 2015 during sdm as processes aliphatics were degraded and condensing aromatic structure and lignin like dom accounted for the majority of bio derived dom patriarca et al 2018 3 4 refractory dom in the effluent six of eight compounds were confirmed by standards in table 2 however the annotated dom were mainly phosphate flame retardants and other industrial agents which have also been found in sewage wastewater blum et al 2018 gago ferrero et al 2018 zwart et al 2020 typical concentrations of anthropogenic micropollutants in waste leachate are at ppb levels qi et al 2018 so annotated compounds occupied 0 5 5 abundance of effluent dom with the concentrations of 5 200 Œºg l to our knowledge 1 2 3 benzotriazole bz was firstly found in waste leachate with ten fold concentration in wwtp effluent gago ferrero et al 2018 as similar as concentration levels of diphenylphosphinic acid dphp and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep however only three bio derived dom of high abundance in the effluent were annotated at probable structure level schymanski et al 2014 in table s3 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole 5mbz was solely confirmed also not detected in the blank it is likely these bio derived dom were almost undocumented compounds boes et al 2018 it is hard to decide production pathway of 5mbz in this study however we tried to confirm 5mbz was not conversed from bz using eawag bbd pathway prediction system http eawag bbd ethz ch predict even though 5mbz is only a methyl away from bz additionally diethyl phosphate dep triethyl phosphate tep and dphp were shown to be absolutely persistent in the sdm as processes while other anthropogenic micropollutants can be reduced by 50 70 in table 2 generally combining the results of dom molecular information and non target analysis implied anthropogenic micropollutants became non neglectful to contribute to bulk cod and toc in effluent of waste leachate after biological treatment because labile dom category a and b were degraded this may explain the abundance of category c was as high as 16 24 in the effluent 3 5 removal of bio derived dom by sdm as processes it was done to test previous hypothesis that the circulation of no 3 no 2 could contribute to removal of bio derived dom generated from as unit the recirculation of no 3 no 2 into sdm reactor can take along aerobic bio derived dom to be removed as an extra function other than nitrogen removal in fig 3 nearly half richness of bio derived dom from sdm unit corresponding to category d was reduced to lower than ms detection limit by as unit similarly 40 richness of bio derived dom from as unit corresponding to category e was also removed by sdm unit average toc reduction in as unit 34 mg l fig s1e was closed to the average difference between produced category e and removed category d 25 mg l furthermore the abundance based on mass peak area of category e in the final effluent was as low as 19 27 table s6 compared with the richness thereof up to 41 42 fig 3 these results indicated removal of category e and d could be ascribed to dom degradation but not merely transformation to new metabolites although quite a few dom would generate transformation products during biological treatment schollee et al 2015 it is probable because bio derived dom would be hydrolysed to be bioavailable to heterotrophs under anaerobic condition xie et al 2012 whereas category f was the key component in the sdm as treated effluent as its richness was 51 53 fig 3 with abundance up to 57 table s6 transformation of category f in sdm or as unit predominately influence cod in the effluent to be urgent to recognize category f only appeared in e and d so a i r c i r is zero then trade off relationship œâ i sdm and œâ i as of f is quantitatively given in eq 6 after joining eq 4 and eq 5 6 q d q c 1 œâ i sdm 1 œâ i as for considering the deviation rate of category f there is no harm in supposing œâ i as 0 then œâ i sdm q r q c it is possible for q c then œâ i sdm 0 as shown in fig s2 therefore it is rational to obverse that only 5 1 5 2 fig 3 of dom belonging to category f e seemed to be derived in both sdm and as units œâ i sdm and œâ i as 0 due to analytical error of orbitrap ms probably in fact both œâ i sdm and œâ i as absolute value of removal rate is derivation rate when removal rate is less that zero were less 10 in such circumstance these results indicated bio derived dom should be produced from either sdm or as unit the hyperbolical curve for production and removal of f was shown in fig 6 a furthermore this hyperbolical relationship between 1 œâ i sdm and 1 œâ i as is appropriate for all bio derived dom category d e and f œâ i sdm and œâ i as just corresponded to category d and e respectively it implied the intrinsic difference among category d e and f is the removal rate and different detection limits for various dom by using orbitrap ms in terms of analytical chemistry additionally 1 œâ i sdm and 1 œâ i as represented residual rate of f in sdm and as units respectively 1 œâ i sdm 1 œâ i as could be decreased by enhancing recirculation flow ratio but would be convergent to 1 even q c in fig s2 this dual theory showed category f and e are inevitable refractory fractions in the circulation between sdm and as units in the regards of thermodynamics comparably there is only category d that can be completely removed by sdm as process according to eq 4 and eq 5 category f could be further divided into f a and f s table 1 removal rate of each molecule of category f is visualized in fig 6b different from category d and e the removal rate of f varied in a big range 0 100 during sdm as processes these bio derived dom were mainly lignin like compounds o c 0 1 0 6 h c 0 6 1 7 patriarca et al 2018 so most molecules of category f were removed at levels of 5 50 in either sdm unit or as unit lignin like compounds are regarded as fairly refractory dom in natural system kamjunke et al 2017 chen et al 2018 and combined wastewater treatment processes yuan et al 2017 three categories of bio derived dom d e and f were similar in molecular index distribution in fig 5 this was probable because category f was mixture of bio derived dom from both sdm and as units however recalcitrant category f a and f s appeared to be significantly different wilcoxon test dbe p 4 1 10 16 atoms c p 1 6 10 16 at the molecular level in fig s3 carbon skeleton of category f a was much larger than f s average of atom c increased from 12 7 to 13 8 to 15 6 15 9 with recalcitrant bio derived dom evolving from sdm to as unit additionally category f a also possessed 0 7 1 4 more dbe than f s implying the recalcitrant aerobic bio derived dom are more condensed koch et al 2005 koch and dittmar 2006 this molecular discrepancy indicated category f a was more refractory than category f s thus abundance of category f a being most recalcitrant bio derived dom fraction was shown to be 2 3 3 1 times that of f s in the effluent in table s6 generally category d can be completely removed by sdm as process sdm can completely reduce category e but the overall removal rate of e is still limited by no 3 no 2 circulation ratio therefore the persistence of each bio derived dom category can be speculated as f a f f s e d during sdm as processes 4 outlook and limitation the posterior aerobic unit after anaerobic digestion is common in the fresh leachate treatment serial renou et al 2008 torretta et al 2016 and category d can be removed by such combination similar to the wwtp komatsu et al 2020 comparatively our results suggested that aerobic bio derived dom could be ex situ removed under anaerobic condition by the mode of sdm as highlighting the auxiliary function of sdm unit it can be a new advantage for sdm as processes compared with other biological technologies for organics and nitrogen removal of fresh waste leachate to obtain a low toc effluent nevertheless as to a sewage wwtp it may be difficult to guarantee the compatibility between requirement of phosphorus removal and anaerobic degradation of aerobic bio derived dom by backflow due to the short hydraulic retention time a prospective hint is to develop in situ technologies to remove bio derived dom aerobic granular sludge and bio film technology may form gradient of ecological niche that inside anaerobic microbes can degrade aerobic bio derived dom especially category e under a specific operation condition some simple transformation reactions of bio derived dom can be speculated according to discrepancy among accurate molecular weight schollee et al 2015 whereas association between precursor and product should be further linked so that dom classification can directly distinguish utilization associated and biomass associated inducements barker and stuckey 1999 ni et al 2011 among copious bio derived dom moreover the pathway of removing bio derived dom e g mineralization partly transformation and adsorption by sludge still remained unclear in this study in the future the related microbes which can degrade bio derived dom should be clarified as well motivating novel strategies to strengthen removal of bio derived dom 5 conclusion in this study sdm as reactor steadily performed for 440 days to remove 98 6 cod and 83 7 tn from raw leachate dom transformation was further analysed by uplc orbitrap ms to conclude that uplc orbitrap ms and venn analysis can offer a novel method to differentiate native and bio derived dom in a wastewater treatment system with backflow sdm as processes persistence of native and bio derived dom is c b a and f a f f s e d respectively bio derived dom contributed the 76 84 of effluent dom which is predominated by category f sdm unit can remove 25 32 of bio derived category e dom by the recirculation of no 3 no 2 but produce bio derived dom occupying 36 52 of sdm digestate in terms of abundance similarly as unit can remove 72 73 of bio derived category d dom from sdm but produce bio derived dom holding 58 64 of final effluent a hyperbolical and dual relationship can theoretically explain the bio derived dom production and removal behaviour in sdm and as units enhancing no 3 no 2 circulation ratio may facilitate the removal bio derived dom with diminishing marginal benefit inert native dom accounting for 16 24 effluent dom and partly confirmed as anthropogenic micropollutants e g phosphate flame retardants and industrial agents were at levels of 5 200 Œºg l sdm as processes hardly can remove and degrade such compounds the subsequent treatment processes should put the remnant anthropogenic micropollutants in concern from the

18034,biological treatment of wastewater always leaves plenty of refractory dissolved organic matters dom in effluents specifically for fresh waste leachate aiming at comprehending the production and removal of these compounds this study investigated dom transformation in a simultaneous denitrification and methanogenesis with activated sludge sdm as system with no 3 no 2 backflow for raw fresh leachate chemical oxygen demand cod was reduced to 854 120 mg l from 63000 470 mg l and total nitrogen tn decreased from 2500 647 mg l to 404 75 mg l during an operation of 440 days the sdm reactor was fed at organic loading rate of 6 70 kgcod m3 d to generate 2 52 l ch4 l d molecular information of leachate dom was acquired by using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with orbitrap

levels of 5 200 Œºg l dom classification also showed a portion of bio derived dom can be completely removed by sdm as processes while the rest bio derived dom can be partially removed depending on dom nature and the recirculation ratio the removal and production rate of a specific bio derived molecule in respective sdm and as units theoretically satisfied a hyperbolical and dual relationship in

in wastewater treatment far and wide however refractory dissolved organic matters dom inevitably emerge in final effluents regardless of process types this phenomenon is particularly prominent for fresh waste leachate treatment since the typical chemical oxygen demand cod of the effluent posterior to different biological processes is still as high as 700 3000 mg l im et al 2001 peng et al 2008 wei et al 2012 yin et al 2017 with influent cod and total nitrogen tn being up to 60 000 80 000 mg l and 2000 4000 mg l respectively he et al 2009 dang et al 2016 lei et al 2019 soluble microbial products generated from bio reactions are extensively considered as a vast fraction in sewage wastewater treatment plants wwtp effluents barker and stuckey 1999 aquino et al 2009 kunacheva and stuckey 2014 whereas waste leachate also comprises refractory humic substances he et al 2006 dang et al 2016 and various xenobiotic micro pollutants with extremely higher concentrations than sewage wastewater kjeldsen et al 2002 zheng et al 2007 eggen et al 2010 thus whether endogenous bio derived dom or extraneous inert compounds dominate the effluent from biotreatments of fresh leachate remains a conundrum the effluent dom can induce fouling of membrane systems jarusutthirak and amy 2006 and generate disinfection by products which are detrimental to human health and ecosystem ding et al 2013 yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 thereby it is crucial to recognize the transformation of these remnant dom in bio treatment processes and diminish the occurrence thereof kunacheva and stuckey 2014 wang and chen 2018 several researches have focused on the effect of influent substrates composition zhang et al 2016 ly et al 2018 cao et al 2019 du et al 2019 and external operational conditions xie et al 2013 simsek et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 yang et al 2018 hu et al 2019 on the yield and property of final bio derived dom from activated sludge systems for synthetic wastewater still and all it is unclear how and how much effluent dom compounds are newly produced and removed during treatment serial by combined biological technologies a methodology to differentiate the composition of effluent dom is the indispensable basis for developing innovative approaches and operation strategies to diminish the organic carbon of the effluents xie et al 2012 hu et al 2020 however it is a challenge to recognize and distinguish native or bio derived dom from real wastewater treatment as each analytical method could singly reveal specific properties of part dom kunacheva and stuckey 2014 kellerman et al 2015 qiu et al 2020 to this point optical and magnetic spectrum instruments have the shortcoming of only looking into bulk structure property of blended dom mesfioui et al 2012 in comparison high resolution mass spectrometry spotlighted in recent years is shown to be a unique method kellerman et al 2014 to offer a molecular recognition into various wastewater yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 qiu et al 2020 and n containing bio derived dom mesfioui et al 2012 hu et al 2019 thousands of detected molecular formulae facilitate to understand dom evolution trend during wastewater treatment serial mesfioui et al 2012 yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 and degradation processes of natural organics in sequencing batch logue et al 2016 kamjunke et al 2017 some studies have investigated molecular transformation in parallel or sequential connected wastewater processes yuan et al 2017 nurenberg et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 nonetheless there were few reports that analysed dom evolution in wastewater treatment system with backflow for both organics and nitrogen removal especially concentrated on differentiating bio derived and native dom additionally the system with backflow is a ubiquitous form for wastewater treatment e g anoxic oxic process lu et al 2014 compared with sequential processes the backflow setting would make it difficult to clarify the turnover of dom since the input and output of the water treatment system are multi paths simultaneous denitrification and methanogenesis with activated sludge sdm as system can reduce nitrogen and organic contaminants in a single anaerobic reactor chen and lin 1993 which has been successfully applied into the treatment of wastewater with high carbon and nitrogen organic loading e g landfill

toda 2018 the nitrogen removal depends on the recirculation of no 3 no 2 into anaerobic system so as to obtain 100 of denitrification efficiency im et al 2001 del pozo and diez 2003 peng et al 2008 allochthonous organics are demonstrated to be dispensable carbon source for microbe s growth in natural ecosystems tranvik 1988 n containing bio derived dom from wwtp are also shown be labile in natural waters mesfioui et al 2012 hu et al 2019 in this regard based on the recirculation of no 3 no 2 we hypothesized part of aerobic bio derived dom can be removed by sdm unit therefore aiming at elucidating the persistence of bio derived and native dom this study selected raw fresh leachate from waste to energy plant to investigate dom transformation in a sdm as system using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with orbitrap mass spectrometry uplc orbitrap ms the refractory compounds of high abundance in the effluent were also tentatively identified by posteriori non target screening with tandem orbitrap ms venn analysis supported to distinguish the bio derived and native dom based on the high throughput ms dataset a quantitative relation was further deduced to describe the production and removal of bio derived dom the outcomes of this study could provide a novel insight into the molecular composition turnover of wastewater bio treatment with backflow for helping develop new biological technologies to reduce the effluent dom 2 materials and methods 2 1 start up of sdm as reactor the sdm as reactor scheme is visualized in fig 1 an up flow anaerobic bio film

molecular transformation analysis the temperature of as unit was stable around 19 23 c for 135 days 5 fold hydraulic retention time before sampling to avoid the effect of temperature on the property of bio derived dom hu et al 2019 dom were extracted in triplicate from raw leachate r digestate of sdm d and final effluent e using solid phase extraction spe dittmar et al 2008 three experimental blanks were implemented according to the identical procedure dom extraction efficiency was determined using published method dittmar et al 2008 molecular information was acquired using uplc orbitrap

samples if rt drifting 0 05 min and mass discrepancy 5 ppm were merged incidental mass peaks were abandoned if occurring only one time in three of replicates veenaas et al 2018 or appearing in the blank molecular formulae of these legal precursor ions were iteratively calculated within the range between c2h2 and c90h190o18n10f6cl4p3s4br3 calculated formulae were further checked in chemspider http www chemspider com and pubchem https pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov to confirm chemical possibility venn analysis swinton 2009 was conducted to divide dom into seven categories table 1 the quantification method of each fraction is based on the richness and abundance richness is the number of mass features in each fraction and abundance is based on weighted average of peak area logue et al 2016 patriarca et al 2018 qiu et al 2020 bulk molecular indexes were calculated according to the equations see eqs s1 s6 in supplementary information si modified from koch and dittmar 2006 and kellerman et al 2015 mann whitney wilcoxon test and least significant difference lsd with significant level of Œ± 0 01 after bonferroni correction analysis were conducted to assess the difference of molecular index distribution data analysis was processed by homemade programs on the platform of r3 6 1 and matlab 2018b 2 5 2 removal rate of dom removal rate œâ i sdm by the sdm unit and œâ i as by the as unit of each molecule i is calculated to assess the persistence of dom we hypothesize recovery Œ∑ of each molecule by spe is the same in raw leachate r digestate of sdm d and final effluent e 1 Œ∑ i r Œ∑ i d Œ∑ i e Œ∑ i the concentration of detected molecule c i j can be assumed to be directly proportional to peak area a i j nurenberg et al 2019 where i is the i th dom in j r d e 2 k i r k i

respectively where j r d e removal rate of each molecule œâ i sdm or œâ i as then is deduced by combining eq 1 eq 3 4 œâ i sdm 1 a i d q d v r v e a i r q r v d v e a i e q c v r v d 5 œâ i as 1 a i e v d a i d v e definition of q r q d and q c is recorded in fig 1 œâ i as and œâ i sdm are always 1 œâ i sdm and œâ i as 0 indicate i th dom is removed while œâ i sdm or œâ i as 0 indicates bio derived dom are produced 3 results and discussion 3 1 general performance of sdm reactor organic loading rate and nitrogen loading rate of sdm reactor reached up to 6 70 kgcod m3 d and 0 19 kg no 3 n m3 d after 440 days operation respectively the sdm unit worked at a steady ph of 7 58 0 12 the concentration of methane was 69 2 v v 78 cod was removed in sdm unit to recover 244 ml ch4 g cod 126 l ch4 d c2 c8 organic acids were also not detected in sdm digestate in fig s1a cod of sdm effluent was 2530 1700 mg l but soluble cod dropped to 1065 190 mg l it indicated that the fraction of particulate cod in sdm effluent was high which should be split from deciduous anaerobic bio film torretta et al 2016 soluble cod in the effluent was similar as cod bod5 decreased to 2 mg l and cod was reduced to 854 120 mg l after as unit soluble cod in sdm digestate appeared to resemble final effluent implying sufficient degradation of organics by sdm as processes totally nearly 100 of no 3 and no 2 was denitrified in sdm unit to reduce 83 7 of input tn additionally nh 4 was nitrified to 10 mg l in as unit it completely corresponded to the theoretical nitrogen removal rate r r 1 82 7 r q c q r recirculation flow ratio see fig 1 of sdm as processes im et al 2001 for the as unit mlss concentration was stable at 1 4 g l and mlvss concentration was around 1 0 g l with a nitrification rate of 0 11 kg nh 4 n m3 d the nitrification rate was lower than those in previous researches 0 3 0 84 kg nh 4 n m3 d im et al 2001 peng et al 2008 to avoid ammonia accumulation under high r huang et al 2007 3 2 dom transformation in sdm as processes as shown in fig s1 bulk parameters cod and bod5 drastically dropped by 90 but two fold more mass features emerged in the sdm digestate than raw leachate table s4 33 of mass features were reduced after as unit these phenomena were also observed in a full scale integrated chemical wastewater treatment plant zhang et al 2019 raw leachate contained high portion of biodegradable organics with bod5 cod of 0 36 sdm unit consumed almost all of these labile organics it resulted in increasing dom molecular weight distribution from 128 210 da to 225 264 da table s5 consistent with previous studies he et al 2006 qiu et al 2020 in fig 2 a after treatment of sdm and as units aromaticity index ai show the aromatization of dom see eq s2 distribution of leachate dom shifted to two fold increase in both esi and esi mode similar as the aging of leachate qiu et al 2020 sdm and as units contributed to the significant rise p 0 01 lsd analysis of h c and fall p 0 01 lsd analysis of double bond equivalent dbe represent the unsaturation of dom see eq s3 in fig 2b and c the h c of the final effluent decreased to 1 00 in esi mode resembling to natural koch et al 2005 yuan et al 2017 and stabilized chen et al 2018 dom in aerobic system the oxidation of alcoholic hydroxyl and phenol group can contribute to the attenuation of h c koch and dittmar 2006 therefore dbe went up in fig 2b mainly because of losing h atoms of leachate dom after dehydrogenation and dehydration reaction schollee et al 2015 it was conspicuous for nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc show redox status of carbon see eq s4 in leachate dom to increase during the sdm as processes additionally atom c of digestate dom was oxidized p 0 01 lsd analysis even in anaerobic sdm unit in fig 2d1 corresponding to the decreasing trend of h c this was probably because most electrons were transported to ch4 and n2 kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2010 these results suggested the refractoriness trend of the dom turnover during the sdm as processes nevertheless n c and o c went into crosscurrent by esi and esi in fig 2e and f it can be ascribed to various proton gain and loss capacity of miscellaneous dom esi facilities to ionize acidic organics with high o c while esi facilities to ionize amino amide compounds with alkaline sleighter and hatcher 2007 in this regard we did not focus on the esi result of o c and n c as nearly 70 studies singly using esi for dom molecular analysis ohno et al 2016 in anaerobic sdm unit carboxyl cooh or acetyl ch3 co on labile organics would be transformed to co2 and h2o and the released co2 is hard to be utilized to biologically synthesize dom again even in aerobic condition einsiedl et al 2007 valle et al 2019 it is the main reason for leachate dom to be deoxygenated during sdm as treatment procedure as reflected by o c decreasing p 0 01 lsd analysis from 0 37 to 0 27 in esi mode the generation of n containing bio derived dom e g amino acids and nucleic acids might favour the increasing n c p 0 01 lsd analysis from 0 031 to 0 121 mesfioui et al 2012 hu et al 2019 3 3 leachate dom classification based on venn diagram to clarify the turnover of labile and recalcitrant dom the dom transformation in the sdm as reactor has been generally assessed by bulk molecular indexes furthermore leachate dom were classified by venn analysis according to presence absence of mass features visualized in fig 3 category g is supposed to be of plausible nonexistence in the sdm as processes otherwise it belongs to special compounds similar to conjugates from human metabolites nurenberg et al 2019 which can be transformed in anaerobic condition and recovered in aerobic system anyway category g only accounted for 3 4 richness of total detected mass features implying few cross contaminations occurring in the test serial as majority of organics became biogas in sdm unit category a was completely removed in the sdm unit corresponding to the red dash line i e œâ i sdm 1 in fig 4 however 29 39 richness of dom category b in raw leachate still slid into sdm digestate in fig 3 anyway the average œâ i sdm of category b was 72 77 unit suggesting the biodegradability thereof comparatively the average œâ i sdm of category c dropped to 44 51 and the average œâ i as was 24 36 waste leachate is a source of various xenobiotic micropollutants kjeldsen et al 2002 eggen et al 2010 the majority of native inert dom category c were halogenated and phosphorus compounds in table s2 therefore it was not strange that category c contributed the abundance of 15 23 table s6 in final effluent even though the richness was 4 6 fig 3 thereof it can confirm that the persistence of native dom is c b a the other evidence is that native inert dom category c showed lower h c and higher dbe than labile native category b dom as well in fig 5 a and fig 5b furthermore venn diagram also favours distinguishing dom sources in sdm as processes thus categories a b c and categories d e f represented native dom in raw leachate and bio derived dom during sdm as processes respectively the compounds of high abundance in table s2 were almost bio derived dom category e and f it is similar as the wwtp effluent which contains more than 60 of bio derived dom nurenberg et al 2019 native dom showed higher h c p 0 01 lsd analysis and lower dbe p 0 01 lsd analysis than bio derived dom by esi in fig 5a and b concretely the h c distribution drifted from 1 0 to 2 0 to 1 5 0 5 ai is directly related to aromatic structure of natural dom koch and dittmar 2006 in fig 5c average ai of bio derived dom increased from 0 2 of native dom to 0 4 moreover nosc of bio derived dom was also lower than that of native dom by using esi in fig 5d1 the aged aquatic dom are mainly regarded as microbial degradation products kellerman et al 2018 these results implied effluent dom from sdm as processes were refractory natural aliphatic compounds evolve to aromatic compounds along with nosc varying from low to high kellerman et al 2015 during sdm as processes aliphatics were degraded and condensing aromatic structure and lignin like dom accounted for the majority of bio derived dom patriarca et al 2018 3 4 refractory dom in the effluent six of eight compounds were confirmed by standards in table 2 however the annotated dom were mainly phosphate flame retardants and other industrial agents which have also been found in sewage wastewater blum et al 2018 gago ferrero et al 2018 zwart et al 2020 typical concentrations of anthropogenic micropollutants in waste leachate are at ppb levels qi et al 2018 so annotated compounds occupied 0 5 5 abundance of effluent dom with the concentrations of 5 200 Œºg l to our knowledge 1 2 3 benzotriazole bz was firstly found in waste leachate with ten fold concentration in wwtp effluent gago ferrero et al 2018 as similar as concentration levels of diphenylphosphinic acid dphp and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep however only three bio derived dom of high abundance in the effluent were annotated at probable structure level schymanski et al 2014 in table s3 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole 5mbz was solely confirmed also not detected in the blank it is likely these bio derived dom were almost undocumented compounds boes et al 2018 it is hard to decide production pathway of 5mbz in this study however we tried to confirm 5mbz was not conversed from bz using eawag bbd pathway prediction system http eawag bbd ethz ch predict even though 5mbz is only a methyl away from bz additionally diethyl phosphate dep triethyl phosphate tep and dphp were shown to be absolutely persistent in the sdm as processes while other anthropogenic micropollutants can be reduced by 50 70 in table 2 generally combining the results of dom molecular information and non target analysis implied anthropogenic micropollutants became non neglectful to contribute to bulk cod and toc in effluent of waste leachate after biological treatment because labile dom category a and b were degraded this may explain the abundance of category c was as high as 16 24 in the effluent 3 5 removal of bio derived dom by sdm as processes it was done to test previous hypothesis that the circulation of no 3 no 2 could contribute to removal of bio derived dom generated from as unit the recirculation of no 3 no 2 into sdm reactor can take along aerobic bio derived dom to be removed as an extra function other than nitrogen removal in fig 3 nearly half richness of bio derived dom from sdm unit corresponding to category d was reduced to lower than ms detection limit by as unit similarly 40 richness of bio derived dom from as unit corresponding to category e was also removed by sdm unit average toc reduction in as unit 34 mg l fig s1e was closed to the average difference between produced category e and removed category d 25 mg l furthermore the abundance based on mass peak area of category e in the final effluent was as low as 19 27 table s6 compared with the richness thereof up to 41 42 fig 3 these results indicated removal of category e and d could be ascribed to dom degradation but not merely transformation to new metabolites although quite a few dom would generate transformation products during biological treatment schollee et al 2015 it is probable because bio derived dom would be hydrolysed to be bioavailable to heterotrophs under anaerobic condition xie et al 2012 whereas category f was the key component in the sdm as treated effluent as its richness was 51 53 fig 3 with abundance up to 57 table s6 transformation of category f in sdm or as unit predominately influence cod in the effluent to be urgent to recognize category f only appeared in e and d so a i r c i r is zero then trade off relationship œâ i sdm and œâ i as of f is quantitatively given in eq 6 after joining eq 4 and eq 5 6 q d q c 1 œâ i sdm 1 œâ i as for considering the deviation rate of category f there is no harm in supposing œâ i as 0 then œâ i sdm q r q c it is possible for q c then œâ i sdm 0 as shown in fig s2 therefore it is rational to obverse that only 5 1 5 2 fig 3 of dom belonging to category f e seemed to be derived in both sdm and as units œâ i sdm and œâ i as 0 due to analytical error of orbitrap ms probably in fact both œâ i sdm and œâ i as absolute value of removal rate is derivation rate when removal rate is less that zero were less 10 in such circumstance these results indicated bio derived dom should be produced from either sdm or as unit the hyperbolical curve for production and removal of f was shown in fig 6 a furthermore this hyperbolical relationship between 1 œâ i sdm and 1 œâ i as is appropriate for all bio derived dom category d e and f œâ i sdm and œâ i as just corresponded to category d and e respectively it implied the intrinsic difference among category d e and f is the removal rate and different detection limits for various dom by using orbitrap ms in terms of analytical chemistry additionally 1 œâ i sdm and 1 œâ i as represented residual rate of f in sdm and as units respectively 1 œâ i sdm 1 œâ i as could be decreased by enhancing recirculation flow ratio but would be convergent to 1 even q c in fig s2 this dual theory showed category f and e are inevitable refractory fractions in the circulation between sdm and as units in the regards of thermodynamics comparably there is only category d that can be completely removed by sdm as process according to eq 4 and eq 5 category f could be further divided into f a and f s table 1 removal rate of each molecule of category f is visualized in fig 6b different from category d and e the removal rate of f varied in a big range 0 100 during sdm as processes these bio derived dom were mainly lignin like compounds o c 0 1 0 6 h c 0 6 1 7 patriarca et al 2018 so most molecules of category f were removed at levels of 5 50 in either sdm unit or as unit lignin like compounds are regarded as fairly refractory dom in natural system kamjunke et al 2017 chen et al 2018 and combined wastewater treatment processes yuan et al 2017 three categories of bio derived dom d e and f were similar in molecular index distribution in fig 5 this was probable because category f was mixture of bio derived dom from both sdm and as units however recalcitrant category f a and f s appeared to be significantly different wilcoxon test dbe p 4 1 10 16 atoms c p 1 6 10 16 at the molecular level in fig s3 carbon skeleton of category f a was much larger than f s average of atom c increased from 12 7 to 13 8 to 15 6 15 9 with recalcitrant bio derived dom evolving from sdm to as unit additionally category f a also possessed 0 7 1 4 more dbe than f s implying the recalcitrant aerobic bio derived dom are more condensed koch et al 2005 koch and dittmar 2006 this molecular discrepancy indicated category f a was more refractory than category f s thus abundance of category f a being most recalcitrant bio derived dom fraction was shown to be 2 3 3 1 times that of f s in the effluent in table s6 generally category d can be completely removed by sdm as process sdm can completely reduce category e but the overall removal rate of e is still limited by no 3 no 2 circulation ratio therefore the persistence of each bio derived dom category can be speculated as f a f f s e d during sdm as processes 4 outlook and limitation the posterior aerobic unit after anaerobic digestion is common in the fresh leachate treatment serial renou et al 2008 torretta et al 2016 and category d can be removed by such combination similar to the wwtp komatsu et al 2020 comparatively our results suggested that aerobic bio derived dom could be ex situ removed under anaerobic condition by the mode of sdm as highlighting the auxiliary function of sdm unit it can be a new advantage for sdm as processes compared with other biological technologies for organics and nitrogen removal of fresh waste leachate to obtain a low toc effluent nevertheless as to a sewage wwtp it may be difficult to guarantee the compatibility between requirement of phosphorus removal and anaerobic degradation of aerobic bio derived dom by backflow due to the short hydraulic retention time a prospective hint is to develop in situ technologies to remove bio derived dom aerobic granular sludge and bio film technology may form gradient of ecological niche that inside anaerobic microbes can degrade aerobic bio derived dom especially category e under a specific operation condition some simple transformation reactions of bio derived dom can be speculated according to discrepancy among accurate molecular weight schollee et al 2015 whereas association between precursor and product should be further linked so that dom classification can directly distinguish utilization associated and biomass associated inducements barker and stuckey 1999 ni et al 2011 among copious bio derived dom moreover the pathway of removing bio derived dom e g mineralization partly transformation and adsorption by sludge still remained unclear in this study in the future the related microbes which can degrade bio derived dom should be clarified as well motivating novel strategies to strengthen removal of bio derived dom 5 conclusion in this study sdm as reactor steadily performed for 440 days to remove 98 6 cod and 83 7 tn from raw leachate dom transformation was further analysed by uplc orbitrap ms to conclude that uplc orbitrap ms and venn analysis can offer a novel method to differentiate native and bio derived dom in a wastewater treatment system with backflow sdm as processes persistence of native and bio derived dom is c b a and f a f f s e d respectively bio derived dom contributed the 76 84 of effluent dom which is predominated by category f sdm unit can remove 25 32 of bio derived category e dom by the recirculation of no 3 no 2 but produce bio derived dom occupying 36 52 of sdm digestate in terms of abundance similarly as unit can remove 72 73 of bio derived category d dom from sdm but produce bio derived dom holding 58 64 of final effluent a hyperbolical and dual relationship can theoretically explain the bio derived dom production and removal behaviour in sdm and as units enhancing no 3 no 2 circulation ratio may facilitate the removal bio derived dom with diminishing marginal benefit inert native dom accounting for 16 24 effluent dom and partly confirmed as anthropogenic micropollutants e g phosphate flame retardants and industrial agents were at levels of 5 200 Œºg l sdm as processes hardly can remove and degrade such compounds the subsequent treatment processes should put the remnant anthropogenic micropollutants in concern from the
