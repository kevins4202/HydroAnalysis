13195,coking wastewater is a typical refractory industrial wastewater with complex hazardous materials and high organic content a novel heterogeneous electro fenton system with a homemade iron loaded activated carbon cathode was used to treat coking wastewater based on response surface methodology chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n were used as research indicators for the optimization of the reaction parameters under the optimal conditions of 1 cm electrode spacing 10 v applied voltage and initial ph of 3 88 the cod removal rate in several experiments was 88 91 96 65 and the nh3 n removal rate in several experimental runs was up to 100 we used ultraviolet visible spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence gas chromatography mass spectrometry and color analysis for analyses and found that the cyclic aromatic compounds and hazardous materials containing unsaturated double and triple bonds could be effectively degraded by the modified electro fenton method additionally the color of the coking wastewater can also be effectively removed using this technique the studied mechanisms and uv254 analysis illustrated that the modified electro fenton method can effectively degrade cod and nh3 n remove most hazardous materials and improve the biodegradability of coking wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords coking wastewater fe ac ni cathode modified electro fenton response surface methodology spectroscopy analysis 1 introduction coking wastewater is generated by coal coking coal gas purification and as the by product of recovery processes in coking production 1 it comprises mainly wastewater from dust removal dephenol and ammonia distillation processes 2 3 coking wastewater contains pollutants such as benzene phenols oxygen sulfur and or nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons cyanide sulfide ammonia and thiocyanide most of which are highly toxic and carcinogenic 4 7 therefore for the treatment of coking wastewater special attention should be paid to the reduction of conventional pollution indicators such as cod and nh3 n as well as the removal of toxic and harmful substances to deal with this type of refractory wastewater an advanced oxidation process aop seems to be a promising option 8 9 aops utilize hydroxyl radicals oh with powerful oxidation potential e0 2 80 v vs nhe which generated from chemical photochemical photocatalytic or electrochemical processes to oxidize and degrade various pollutants 10 11 due to its high processing efficiency the electro fenton process is one of the most promising aops 12 14 in this process h2o2 is produced in situ via the two electron reduction of o2 eq 1 h2o2 further reacts to form oh under the catalytic action of the ferrous ions which was added to the solution eq 2 15 16 oh is associated with the oxidative degradation of pollutants eq 3 in a study by zhang et al under optimal conditions of 30 9 ma cm 2 current density 0 35 mg l 1 fe2 concentration and initial ph of 4 05 the toc removal efficiency was up to 73 8 17 1 o 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 fe 2 h fe 3 h 2 o oh 3 oh pollutants co 2 h 2 o compared to the chemical fenton process the electro fenton process avoids the risks associated with the transport storage and treatment of h2o2 and has higher degradation rates of organic pollutants less sludge production and is easier to automate 18 however a small amount of iron sludge is still produced in the homogeneous fenton process an iron loaded activated carbon based foamed nickel composite cathode fe ac ni cathode was developed by our group which overcomes the problem of iron sludge precipitation during the traditional electro fenton reaction in the process of treating landfill leachate nanofiltration concentration the removal rates of cod nh3 n and color reached 79 9 73 2 and 99 9 respectively 19 in the treatment of landfill leachate evaporation concentrates the removal rates of cod and color were 100 and 99 8 respectively 20 the removal mechanism includes the degradation of organic pollutants and nh3 n by oh and the active chlorine generated from the chloride ions contained in the wastewater under the action of an electric field however coking wastewater has a limited concentration of chloride ions and contains more toxic components than landfill leachate the question of how the degradation limiting effects of the heterocyclic toxic components of coking wastewater can be dealt with has become an important consideration there are no literature reports on the use of a homogeneous electro fenton process to treat raw coking wastewater a study on the degradation efficiency reaction conditions and mechanism of heterogeneous electro fenton treatment of refractory pollutants in coking wastewater is a key and necessary step for the successful application of this method to solve the environmental issue of coking wastewater pollution in this study a novel electro fenton system was constructed using fe ac ni and dsa electrodes as the cathode and anode respectively single factor experiments and response surface methodology rsm were used to obtain the optimal treatment parameters ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence 3d eem and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms were used to analyze organic pollutant degradation and hazardous material removal mechanisms the aims were to obtain the optimal parameters for the treatment of toxic pollutants in coking wastewater using the modified electro fenton method and to provide a novel electro fenton technology without iron sludge precipitation for the treatment of coking wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of coking wastewater the coking wastewater sample used in this study was obtained from the conditioning tank of a coking factory in a steel plant located in liaoning china it had been treated by gravity sedimentation air flotation and degreasing on site the parameter attributes of the coking wastewater are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental design and data analysis in this study fe ac ni cathode and dsa anode were used to construct an electro fenton reaction system the electrode spacing applied voltage initial ph and reaction time were considered single factor variables and cod was used as the dependent variable for the evaluating the influence each factor had on the treatment the optimal combination of single factor conditions for the experimental treatment of coking wastewater was also obtained rsm is a very effective statistical method for solving multiple variable problems it is a comprehensive technique that combines experimental design data statistics and parameter optimization experimental data are often used to determine the optimum variable conditions for various processes 21 22 in this experiment the electro fenton method was used to treat coking wastewater and its treatment efficacy was analyzed using rsm the influencing factors were subsequently discussed the range and values of the experimental variables labelled with codes for the removal of cod and nh3 n in the rsm analysis are presented in table 2 based on the optimal conditions identified ftir uv vis 3d eem gc ms and color analysis methods were used to analyze and characterize the pollutants in the system before during and after the electrochemical reaction and to study the removal mechanism of the pollutants in the coking wastewater 2 3 analysis methods cod nh3 n and nitrate nitrogen were determined using standard analytical methods specified in the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater 23 color was determined by the dilution multiple method gb t11903 1989 china phenol concentrations were determined using high performance liquid chromatography lc 20a shimadzu japan the ph and conductivity were measured using electrodes uv vis spectra were measured using a uv vis spectrometer lambda750 s american platinum elmer instrument co ltd usa the uv vis analysis parameters were set as follows scanning speed 266 nm min 1 wavelength 185 500 nm slit width 2 nm ftir was measured using a nichols infrared spectrometer nicolet is 10 nichols instruments usa in the ftir spectroscopy characterization experiment the residual solids obtained by evaporating and drying the wastewater sample were collected and stored in a drying cabinet then appropriate residual solids and dried kbr were placed in an agate mortar at a ratio of 1 10 and evenly ground for approximately 10 min after that an appropriate amount of powder was taken and laid evenly in a specific mold the pellets were prepared at 15 mpa with a yp 2 presser and a pure and dried kbr pallet was used as a blank sample control 3d eem was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer ls 55 perkin elmer company usa the test parameters were as follows excitation source 150 w xenon arc lamp excitation and emission slit widths 5 nm excitation wavelength ex 200 450 nm emission wavelength em 280 550 nm excitation and emission spectra 5 nm scanning speed 1200 nm min 1 photomultiplier tube voltage 700 v for gc ms analysis wastewater samples pretreated with trichloromethane liquid liquid extraction were used for gc ms analysis using an agilent 7890 series gc system with a 5975 mass selective detector the gc program was as follows 6 24 injector temperature 280 c column temperature 60 110 280 c oven temperature was maintained at 60 c for 2 min held at 5 c min 1 to 110 c for 10 min and then held at 25 c min 1 to 280 c for 15 min carrier gas helium split ratio 10 1 total flow rate 1 0 ml min 1 the pseudo first order reaction for the removal of cod from coking wastewater can be calculated using eq 4 4 ln c 0 c kt here c is the cod concentration at time t mg l 1 c0 is the initial cod concentration mg l 1 k is the apparent pseudo first order reaction rate constant min 1 and t is the reaction time min 3 results and discussions 3 1 influencing factors many factors affect the processing efficiency of an electro fenton system the electrode spacing applied voltage initial ph and reaction time were selected as analytical factors for the single factor experiment and their influence on the degradation efficiency of coking wastewater was assessed the impact of various factors on the cod removal efficiency depicted in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 a as the electrode spacing increased the cod removal rate decreased this is because the current density decreases as the electrode spacing increases 25 the strength of the reaction is determined by the current density in the electrochemical system and when the current density was low the yield of h2o2 or oh decreased therefore an optimal electrode spacing of 1 cm was selected to ensure the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants in this system 26 the applied voltage was the force that drove the electrochemical reaction as shown in fig 1 b as the applied voltage increased the cod removal rate increased when the applied voltage reached 10 v the cod removal rate was up to 87 28 as the applied voltage increased the electrochemical oxidation rate of oh increased the electro fenton reaction rate was accelerated and the efficiency of organic pollutant degradation increased correspondingly however excessively high applied voltages also caused the current density to increase and the electro fenton reaction started to become hindered by side reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction 27 therefore the optimal value of 10 v was chosen for the applied voltage as shown in fig 1 c the cod removal rate was optimal up to 81 11 when the initial ph was 3 when the initial ph was lower than 3 the h concentration was higher and according to the fenton reaction principle side reactions h2o2 2h 2e 2h2o hindered the progress of the electro fenton reaction 26 28 when the initial ph was greater than 3 and with further increases in the initial ph value the cod removal rate declined by varying degrees this may be because some h2o2 was formed by the electrophilic h3o2 in solution and fe3 was less effectively reduced to fe2 and because fe2 may have complexed with oh to form a hydroxyl complex that covered the fe ac ni cathode surface inhibiting the progress of the fenton reaction 29 generally the optimal initial ph range of wastewater treatment using the electro fenton method is 2 8 3 5 30 31 therefore the optimal initial ph value of 3 was chosen for use in this study as shown in fig 1 d the removal rate of cod from the coking wastewater continuously increased with extensions in the reaction time of the electro fenton system when the reaction time reached 420 min the system had the highest cod removal rate at 89 91 however it was observed that the rate per hour of cod removal efficiency by the electro fenton reaction from the coking wastewater in the first 240 min of the reaction was much higher than that of the last 240 min the system provided a sufficient amount of oxidizing substances such as oh for the organic matter in the coking wastewater to be oxidized after 240 min of the reaction the remaining organic bonds in the coking wastewater sample reached saturation their structures remained relatively stable and chemical bond breaking required more energy 32 this explains the decline in the cod removal rate after 420 min the cod removal efficiency decreased slightly this fluctuation can be attributed to the stronger oxidative capacity of oh than potassium dichromate the latter being the oxidizing agent used in the measurement of cod some organic substances in the solution that could not be oxidized by potassium dichromate were oxidized by oh into organic products that could then be oxidized by potassium dichromate resulting in the slight increase in the cod detection value and a decrease in the cod removal efficiency at 420 min from fig 1 d it can be observed that the optimal reaction time was 420 min 3 2 response surface methodology to obtain the optimal conditions for the treatment of coking wastewater an experiment was designed and carried out using the rsm based on box behnken experimental design bbd as shown in table 2 quadratic regression models were established between the variables electrode spacing applied voltage and initial ph and corresponding values cod and nh3 n removal rsm was used to determine the significance of the effects of each variable and their interactions on cod and nh3 n removal from the coking wastewater while the optimal process parameters were determined during the coking wastewater treatment procedure the experimental conditions of the coded variables and the obtained cod and nh3 n values are listed in table 3 the experimental data from table 3 were analyzed using the rsm based on bbd and a second order polynomial regression model with the experimental data was obtained as eqs 5 and 6 tables 4 and 5 show the analysis of variance anova results for cod and nh3 n removal rates respectively 5 y 1 78 99 7 18 x 1 9 19 x 2 0 1 x

respectively the magnitudes of the f values and p values represent the significance of the correlation coefficient the p value of the model results was below 0 01 indicating that the model result was statistically significant 33 lack of fit is an important factor for evaluating the reliability of the model the lack of fit was insignificant which indicates that the model could be used for data analysis as shown in table 4 the p value of lack of fit was 0 0886 indicating that the mismatch term was insignificant and the model fit well in the response area the larger the value of the multivariate correlation coefficient r 2 the better the correlation the r 2 of the model was 0 9424 which indicated that the model could explain 94 24 of the results within the range of the experimental conditions the adj r 2 was 0 8684 which was very close to that of the r 2 the coefficient of variation c v was 4 61 which was much less than 10 indicating that the reliability and accuracy of the experimental data were very high these results indicate that the model was reasonably accurate 34 the order of significance of the three factors on the cod removal rate was applied voltage electrode spacing initial ph according to the response surface analysis experiment the optimal conditions for coking wastewater treatment were obtained as follows electrode spacing 1 cm applied voltage 10 v and initial ph 3 6 as shown in table 5 the p values of the model and lack of fit were 0 0028 and 0 0510 respectively indicating that the mismatch term was insignificant and the model fit well in the response area the larger the value of the multivariate correlation coefficient r 2 the better the correlation the r 2 of the model was 0 9298 which indicates that the model can explain 92 98 of the results within the experimental setting range the adj r 2 was 0 8396 which was very close to r 2 indicating that the reliability and accuracy of the experimental data are very high this proves that the model was reasonable the order of significance of the three factors on the nh3 n removal rate was applied voltage electrode spacing initial ph according to the response surface analysis experiment the optimal conditions for nh3 n removal from coking wastewater treatment were obtained as follows electrode spacing of 1 cm applied voltage of 10 v and initial ph of 3 88 the optimal conditions obtained by the response surface experiment were as follows cod removal rate electrode spacing of 1 cm applied voltage of 10 v and initial ph of 3 6 nh3 n removal rate electrode spacing of 1 cm applied voltage of 10 v and initial ph of 3 88 considering the changes in the cod and nh3 n removal rate the nh3 n removal rate reached a maximum range of 100 and the cod removal rate reached a maximum of 89 29 the 100 nh3 n removal rate included the conditions where the cod removal rate reached its maximum therefore we selected the optimal reaction conditions as follows electrode spacing of 1 cm reaction voltage of 10 v and initial ph of 3 88 by setting the above conditions in the corresponding response surface model equations eqs 5 and 6 the predicted values of cod and nh3 n removal rates were 89 29 and 117 03 respectively in the verification experiment the actual values of cod and nh3 n contents were assessed the actual removal rate of cod was between 88 91 and 96 65 and the actual removal rate of nh3 n was 100 in the 3d plot analysis of the interaction of the two factors on the response surface the steeper the surface of the 3d map the greater the interaction between the two factors in contrast the effect of the interaction was weak 35 the 3d plots of rsm for cod and nh3 n removal rates are shown in fig 2 it can be seen from fig 2 that the interactions between various factors have the same effects on the degradation of cod and nh3 n we present the findings of the interactions between the applied voltage and electrode spacing on the cod and nh3 n removal rates in fig 2 a and d compared with the impact of electrode spacing the effect of applied voltage on the cod and nh3 n treatments was smaller it is known from the analysis of variance tables tables 4 and 5 that the f value of the electrode spacing was greater than the f value of the applied voltage when the electrode spacing was nearly 1 cm the cod and nh3 n removal rates did not increase significantly as the applied voltage increased as the applied voltage increased the system current density increased causing side reactions in the reaction system that hindered the electro fenton reaction under the constraints of the experimental conditions the maximum applied voltage for the experiment was 10 v as depicted in the interaction diagrams for the applied voltage and the initial ph fig 2 b and e as the initial ph of the coking wastewater increased the cod and nh3 n removal rates decreased when the applied voltage was 10 v the maximum removal rate was at initial ph values 2 5 4 in the diagram depicting the interaction between electrode spacing and initial ph value fig 2 c and f we can see that the treatment had a good effect when the electrode spacing was 1 cm and the initial ph was 2 3 as the electrode spacing increased the treatment effect was less than that for the electrode spacing of 1 cm regardless of the initial ph change 3 3 mechanism according to response surface methodology experiment research we know that the modified electro fenton process has a good treatment effect on the degradation of nh3 n and cod in coking wastewater the graphs of nh3 n nitrate nitrogen and cod concentrations over time are shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 there was no change in the concentration of nh3 n but the cod value dropped sharply in the first 4 h of the reaction this indicated that the main targets for the degradation of oh were the carbon containing organic compounds with complex structures in the coking wastewater the macromolecular organic matter easily degradable was oxidatively degraded into inorganic matter or small molecule sized refractory organic matter cod removal was mainly obtained and nh3 n did not degrade during this period after the reaction had been running for 4 h the nh3 n content in the coking wastewater decreased markedly and the nh3 n removal rate was significantly increased after 6 h the nh3 n removal rate reached 100 and the cod removal rate reached a maximum the concentration of nitrate nitrogen did not change during the entire reaction process therefore the priority of nh3 n degradation is lower than that of cod in the nh3 n degradation process part of the nh3 n was degraded into n2 and h2o through the pathways described by eqs 7 9 36 the remaining nh3 n was oxidized to non polluting n2 by the oxidation of oh eq 10 37 7 2 cl 2 e cl 2 8 cl 2 h 2 o hclo h 3 cl 9 2 nh 4 3 clo n 2 2 h 3 cl 3 h 2 o 10 nh 3 n oh h 2 o n 2 to clarify the cod degradation kinetics during the electro fenton treatment of coking wastewater the experimental data were fitted using pseudo zero pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetics the calculations show that the fitted coefficients r 2 were 0 90906 0 97462 and 0 90938 respectively therefore we know that the cod removal processes observed by this study followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics with the reaction kinetic constant calculated to be 0 00554 min 1 using eq 4 the result of the pseudo first order reaction kinetic fitting is shown in the inset of fig 1 d to ensure the formation of oh in the electro fenton process with the fe ac ni cathode classical scavenging experiments were carried out under optimal conditions phenol representing the characteristic contaminants of coking wastewater was selected as the treatment target a solution of 1250 mg l 1 phenol equivalent to the cod of the coking wastewater and 0 05 m na2so4 was used as the electrolyte and 10 ml isopropyl alcohol was added as an oh scavenger experiments without the addition of isopropanol were carried out under the same conditions as the control the experimental results are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the oh generated by the experimental electro fenton system can effectively degrade phenol without oh scavengers with the phenol removal rate reaching 99 9 after 420 min during the reaction process when the reaction system contained sufficient oh scavengers the phenol removal rate decreased significantly because the oh generated by the electro fenton system was consumed by the oh scavengers and the oxidative degradation efficiency of phenol was reduced the phenol removal rate only reached 61 16 after 420 min of reaction the results suggest that oh can be effectively produced in the electro fenton system constructed in this experiment 3 4 analytical characterization 3 4 1 uv vis analysis in general coking wastewater contains monocyclic aromatic compounds polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons benzene rings and heterocyclic compounds the detection range for analysis in this experiment was set to 185 500 nm and the uv vis analysis of the coking wastewater treatment by the electro fenton system over 1 7 h is depicted in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the coking wastewater has a strong absorption peak at 190 nm which can be attributed to a cyclic aromatic compound and a more obvious absorption peak around 275 nm which can be attributed to a benzene ring or an unsaturated aldehyde ketones and other substances 38 as can be observed in fig 5 the absorption peaks of each stage continuously decreased during the electro fenton process after 5 h of treatment the absorption peak at 275 nm completely disappeared leaving only a segment of the absorption peak at approximately 190 nm which indicates that the remaining organic pollutants were cyclic aromatic compounds after 7 h of reaction the absorption band at 220 240 nm disappeared and only one absorption band remained at 190 nm it can be concluded that only a few aromatic compounds remained in the wastewater sample after 7 h of reaction time the uv254 value characterizes the absorbance of some organic substances in wastewater samples at 254 nm wavelength ultraviolet light which reflects the amount of pollutants naturally present in wastewater including humus like macromolecular organic substances and aromatic compounds containing cc double bonds and co double bonds these wastewater components are refractory and have poor biodegradability 39 if the uv254 value is small it means that the wastewater contains a few humus macromolecular organics and aromatic compounds therefore when the uv254 value gradually decreased as the reaction progressed and the biodegradability of the wastewater improved the change in uv254 over time in this study is shown in the inset of fig 5 it can be seen that the uv254 value dropped from 0 155 to 0 005 after 7 h of reaction time this result implies that the modified electro fenton system can improve the biodegradability of coking wastewater 3 4 2 ftir analysis the organic matter in coking wastewater includes long chain alkanes amines benzenes and heterocyclic compounds 40 in this experiment the coking wastewater samples were analyzed by ftir analysis before and after treatment under optimal conditions electrode spacing 1 cm applied voltage 10 v and initial ph 3 88 the results are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the ftir absorption peaks of the characteristic pollutants in the coking wastewater appeared in similar positions before and after the treatment with six absorption peaks being identical 41 43 there was an obvious hydroxyl stretching vibration band at the 3447 58 cm 1 absorption peak indicating that both before and after the reaction the coking wastewater samples contained carboxyl phenol or alcohol hydroxyl considering the characteristics of the coking wastewater composition phenolic hydroxyl was most likely present there was a weak absorption peak at 2360 3 cm 1 and a strong absorption peak at 2071 6 cm 1 this was due to the stretching vibrations of unsaturated double bonds triple bonds and the cumulative vibrations of double bonds the absorption peak at 1636 3 cm 1 was stronger before the reaction and weaker after the reaction after the reaction the coking wastewater sample had two weaker absorption peaks at 1717 15 cm 1 and 1618 18 cm 1 which were the result of aromatic ring double bond stretching due to vibration past the absorption peaks at 1143 47 cm 1 the water samples had absorption peaks at 1022 73 cm 1 and 1002 17 cm 1 which were attributed to the stretching vibrations of ethers after the reaction process the water samples had absorption peaks at 967 47 cm 1 and 940 53 cm 1 which were co stretching vibrations of carboxylic acids the water samples had a peak at 627 66 cm 1 before the reaction and after the reaction the water samples had absorption peaks at 757 69 cm 1 and 621 73 cm 1 all of which were ch vibration and nh out of plane bending absorption peaks the above results indicated that phenolic compounds unsaturated double bonds triple bonds aromatic compounds alkanes and other organic compounds were present in the coking wastewater sample before the reaction after the reaction the intensity of each absorption peak was reduced by diversely varying degrees indicating that the electro fenton method can remove these toxic organic pollutants quite effectively the absorption peak at 2071 6 cm 1 disappeared specifically indicating that the unsaturated double bonds and triple bonds were removed especially the cumulative double bonds 3 4 3 3d eem fluorescence spectra coking wastewater contains fluorescent organic pollutants which can produce a specific wavelength fluorescence spectrum under a certain range of light wavelengths 44 45 under the illumination of a light source different organic pollutants produce distinctively characteristic fluorescence intensity peaks and depending on their location and intensity the types of organic pollutants in the sample can be determined 3d eem was used to analyze the coking wastewater samples before and after the reaction under the optimal conditions electrode spacing 1 cm applied voltage 10 v and initial ph 3 88 the results are visualized in fig 7 it can be observed from fig 7 a that there were three fluorescence peaks in the coking wastewater before the reaction marked as a b and c located at 275 nm 285 nm ex em 235 nm 340 nm and 240 nm 360 nm respectively the organic pollutants in the coking wastewater were mainly in regions i ii and iv regions i and ii were aromatic protein analogs and region iv was a microbial by product analog 46 as shown in fig 7 b the fluorescence peaks in regions ⅳ and ⅱ peaks a and c disappeared after 7 h of treatment under optimal experimental conditions and only a relatively weak fluorescent peak peak b remained in region ii indicating that most of the organic pollutants in regions i and iv can be removed by the electro fenton method there were still weak fluorescence peaks in region ii indicating that the organic pollutants in region ii aromatic protein analogs were relatively more difficult to remove in general the results of treating coking wastewater with the electro fenton method are ideal 3 4 4 gc ms analysis gc ms uses both the strong separation power of gas chromatographic technology and the high discriminatory power of mass spectra it was very suitable for the qualitative identification of mixtures in this experiment the results of the gc ms analysis of coking wastewater before and after the reaction under the optimal reaction conditions electrode spacing 1 cm applied voltage 10 v and initial ph 3 88 are shown in fig 8 the types of organic substances present in coking wastewater are complex and diverse but most organic compounds are detectable by gc ms therefore the pollutant content was determined based on the relative area of the obtained peaks the results for the analysis of the coking wastewater are shown in table 6 as shown in table 6 the main pollutants in the coking wastewater sample before the reaction were phenol o cresol m cresol indole and 3 5 dimethylphenol among them the content of phenols was the highest and several phenols accounted for 88 28 of the total area of chromatographic peaks of organic components in addition it contained small amounts of pyridine heptone and various alkanes the phenolic substances were completely degraded after 7 h of reaction time under the optimal reaction conditions which indicated that the electro fenton oxidation system is a good method for the effective treatment of macromolecular organic compounds as well as for its ring opening and chain breaking effects on macromolecular organic compounds 47 however the long chain alkane species were still present in the water sample after the reaction which indicated that the electro fenton oxidation process had a relatively weaker treatment effects on long chain alkane species 3 4 5 color no iron sludge precipitation was observed during the electro fenton reaction and the coking wastewater gradually changed from brown to colorless the color of wastewater is usually determined by the chromophores and auxochromic groups it contained the chromophores contained in the coking wastewater included cho chch no2 cooh and cnh2o the auxochrome groups were ch3 nh2 sh nhr nr2 or etc color analysis was conducted before and after the electro fenton treatment under optimal conditions electrode spacing 1 cm applied voltage 10 v and initial ph 3 88 in this experiment it can be seen that the color of coking wastewater can be reduced 200 fold after 7 h of reaction time from its original color to colorless fig 9 the extent of color removal in this experiment was up to 99 5 because the chromophore and auxochrome groups were destroyed during the reaction a finding confirmed by gc ms characterization analysis after 4 h of reaction time the wastewater sample was nearly colorless which is consistent with the cod removal curve this indicates that the modified electro fenton method is a good method for effectively removing the color of coking wastewater 4 conclusion in this study an fe ac ni electrode was used as the cathode in an electro fenton reaction system which when used to treat coking wastewater can effectively remove cod and nh3 n without producing secondary iron sludge pollution the response surface methodology results demonstrated that the order of magnitude of the effects on cod and nh3 n removal rate was as follows applied voltage electrode spacing initial ph the optimized conditions based on a bbd were an electrode spacing of 1 cm applied voltage of 10 v and initial ph of 3 88 under these conditions the cod removal rate of several experiments was 88 91 96 65 and the nh3 n removal rate reached 100 the combination of uv vis ftir 3d eem gc ms color analysis and mechanism investigation were used to evaluate the efficacy of the modified electro fenton method for treating coking wastewater it was found that cyclic aromatic compounds could be efficiently removed the unsaturated double and triple bonds could be broken up and toxic organic compounds and ammonium salt in the wastewater could be effectively degraded thus this study provides an improved heterogeneous electro fenton technology that can degrade most refractory pollutants and significantly

radicals oh with powerful oxidation potential e0 2 80 v vs nhe which generated from chemical photochemical photocatalytic or electrochemical processes to oxidize and degrade various pollutants 10 11 due to its high processing efficiency the electro fenton process is one of the most promising aops 12 14 in this process h2o2 is produced in situ via the two electron reduction of o2 eq 1 h2o2 further reacts to form oh under the catalytic action of the ferrous ions which was added to the solution eq 2 15 16 oh is associated with the oxidative degradation of pollutants eq 3 in a study by zhang et al under optimal conditions of 30 9 ma cm 2 current density 0 35 mg l 1 fe2 concentration and initial ph of 4 05 the toc removal efficiency was up to 73 8 17 1 o 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 fe 2 h fe 3 h 2 o oh 3 oh pollutants co 2 h 2 o compared to the chemical fenton process the electro fenton process avoids the risks associated with the transport storage and treatment of h2o2 and has higher degradation rates of organic pollutants less sludge production and is easier to automate 18 however a small amount of iron sludge is still produced in the homogeneous fenton process an iron loaded activated carbon based foamed nickel composite cathode fe ac ni cathode was developed by our group which overcomes the problem of iron sludge precipitation during the traditional electro fenton reaction in the process of treating landfill leachate nanofiltration concentration the removal rates of cod nh3 n and color reached 79 9 73 2 and 99 9 respectively 19 in the treatment of landfill leachate evaporation concentrates the removal rates of cod and color were 100 and 99 8 respectively 20 the removal mechanism includes the degradation of organic pollutants and nh3 n by oh and the active chlorine generated from the chloride ions contained in the wastewater under the action of an electric field however coking wastewater has a limited concentration of chloride ions and contains more toxic components than landfill leachate the question of how the degradation limiting effects of the heterocyclic toxic components of coking wastewater can be dealt with has become an important consideration there are no literature reports on the use of a homogeneous electro fenton process to treat raw coking wastewater a study on the degradation efficiency reaction conditions and mechanism of heterogeneous electro fenton treatment of refractory pollutants in coking wastewater is a key and necessary step for the successful application of this method to solve the environmental issue of coking wastewater pollution in this study a novel electro fenton system was constructed using fe ac ni and dsa electrodes as the cathode and anode respectively single factor experiments and response surface methodology rsm were used to obtain the optimal treatment parameters ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence 3d eem and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms were used to analyze organic pollutant degradation and hazardous material removal mechanisms the aims were to obtain the optimal parameters for the treatment of toxic pollutants in coking wastewater using the modified electro fenton method and to provide a novel electro fenton technology without iron sludge precipitation for the treatment of coking wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of coking wastewater the coking wastewater sample used in this study was obtained from the conditioning tank of a coking factory in a steel plant located in liaoning china it had been treated by gravity sedimentation air flotation and degreasing on site the parameter attributes of the coking wastewater are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental design and data analysis in this study fe ac ni cathode and dsa anode were used to construct an electro fenton reaction system the electrode spacing applied voltage initial ph and reaction time were considered single factor variables and cod was used as the dependent variable for the evaluating the influence each factor had on the treatment the optimal combination of single factor conditions for the experimental treatment of coking wastewater was also obtained rsm is a very effective statistical method for solving multiple variable problems it is a comprehensive technique that combines experimental design data statistics and parameter optimization experimental data are often used to determine the optimum variable conditions for various processes 21 22 in this experiment the electro fenton method was used to treat coking wastewater and its treatment efficacy was analyzed using rsm the influencing factors were subsequently discussed the range and values of the experimental variables labelled with codes for the removal of cod and nh3 n in the rsm analysis are presented in table 2 based on the optimal conditions identified ftir uv vis 3d eem gc ms and color analysis methods were used to analyze and characterize the pollutants in the system before during and after the electrochemical reaction and to study the removal mechanism of the pollutants in the coking wastewater 2 3 analysis methods cod nh3 n and nitrate nitrogen were determined using standard analytical methods specified in the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater 23 color was determined by the dilution multiple method gb t11903 1989 china phenol concentrations were determined using high performance liquid chromatography lc 20a shimadzu japan the ph and conductivity were measured using electrodes uv vis spectra were measured using a uv vis spectrometer lambda750 s american platinum elmer instrument co ltd usa the uv vis analysis parameters were set as follows scanning speed 266 nm min 1 wavelength 185 500 nm slit width 2 nm ftir was measured using a nichols infrared spectrometer nicolet is 10 nichols instruments usa in the ftir spectroscopy characterization experiment the residual solids obtained by evaporating and drying the wastewater sample were collected and stored in a drying cabinet then appropriate residual solids and dried kbr were placed in an agate mortar at a ratio of 1 10 and evenly ground for approximately 10 min after that an appropriate amount of powder was taken and laid evenly in a specific mold the pellets were prepared at 15 mpa with a yp 2 presser and a pure and dried kbr pallet was used as a blank sample control 3d eem was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer ls 55 perkin elmer company usa the test parameters were as follows excitation source 150 w xenon arc lamp excitation and emission slit widths 5 nm excitation wavelength ex 200 450 nm emission wavelength em 280 550 nm excitation and emission spectra 5 nm scanning speed 1200 nm min 1 photomultiplier tube voltage 700 v for gc ms analysis wastewater samples pretreated with trichloromethane liquid liquid extraction were used for gc ms analysis using an agilent 7890 series gc system with a 5975 mass selective detector the gc program was as follows 6 24 injector temperature 280 c column temperature 60 110 280 c oven temperature was maintained at 60 c for 2 min held at 5 c min 1 to 110 c for 10 min and then held at 25 c min 1 to 280 c for 15 min carrier gas helium split ratio 10 1 total flow rate 1 0 ml min 1 the pseudo first order reaction for the removal of cod from coking wastewater can be calculated using eq 4 4 ln c 0 c kt here c is the cod concentration at time t mg l 1 c0 is the initial cod concentration mg l 1 k is the apparent pseudo first order reaction rate constant min 1 and t is the reaction time min 3 results and discussions 3 1 influencing factors many factors affect the processing efficiency of an electro fenton system the electrode spacing applied voltage initial ph and reaction time were selected as analytical factors for the single factor experiment and their influence on the degradation efficiency of coking wastewater was assessed the impact of various factors on the cod removal efficiency depicted in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 a as the electrode spacing increased the cod removal rate decreased this is because the current density decreases as the electrode spacing increases 25 the strength of the reaction is determined by the current density in the electrochemical system and when the current density was low the yield of h2o2 or oh decreased therefore an optimal electrode spacing of 1 cm was selected to ensure the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants in this system 26 the applied voltage was the force that drove the electrochemical reaction as shown in fig 1 b as the applied voltage increased the cod removal rate increased when the applied voltage reached 10 v the cod removal rate was up to 87 28 as the applied voltage increased the electrochemical oxidation rate of oh increased the electro fenton reaction rate was accelerated and the efficiency of organic pollutant degradation increased correspondingly however excessively high applied voltages also caused the current density to increase and the electro fenton reaction started to become hindered by side reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction 27 therefore the optimal value of 10 v was chosen for the applied voltage as shown in fig 1 c the cod removal rate was optimal up to 81 11 when the initial ph was 3 when the initial ph was lower than 3 the h concentration was higher and according to the fenton reaction principle side reactions h2o2 2h 2e 2h2o hindered the progress of the electro fenton reaction 26 28 when the initial ph was greater than 3 and with further increases in the initial ph value the cod removal rate declined by varying degrees this may be because some h2o2 was formed by the electrophilic h3o2 in solution and fe3 was less effectively reduced to fe2 and because fe2 may have complexed with oh to form a hydroxyl complex that covered the fe ac ni cathode surface inhibiting the progress of the fenton reaction 29 generally the optimal initial ph range of wastewater treatment using the electro fenton method is 2 8 3 5 30 31 therefore the optimal initial ph value of 3 was chosen for use in this study as shown in fig 1 d the removal rate of cod from the coking wastewater continuously increased with extensions in the reaction time of the electro fenton system when the reaction time reached 420 min the system had the highest cod removal rate at 89 91 however it was observed that the rate per hour of cod removal efficiency by the electro fenton reaction from the coking wastewater in the first 240 min of the reaction was much higher than that of the last 240 min the system provided a sufficient amount of oxidizing substances such as oh for the organic matter in the coking wastewater to be oxidized after 240 min of the reaction the remaining organic bonds in the coking wastewater sample reached saturation their structures remained relatively stable and chemical bond breaking required more energy 32 this explains the decline in the cod removal rate after 420 min the cod removal efficiency decreased slightly this fluctuation can be attributed to the stronger oxidative capacity of oh than potassium dichromate the latter being the oxidizing agent used in the measurement of cod some organic substances in the solution that could not be oxidized by potassium dichromate were oxidized by oh into organic products that could then be oxidized by potassium dichromate resulting in the slight increase in the cod detection value and a decrease in the cod removal efficiency at 420 min from fig 1 d it can be observed that the optimal reaction time was 420 min 3 2 response surface methodology to obtain the optimal conditions for the treatment of coking wastewater an experiment was designed and carried out using the rsm based on box behnken experimental design bbd as shown in table 2 quadratic regression models were established between the variables electrode spacing applied voltage and initial ph and corresponding values cod and nh3 n removal rsm was used to determine the significance of the effects of each variable and their interactions on cod and nh3 n removal from the coking wastewater while the optimal process parameters were determined during the coking wastewater treatment procedure the experimental conditions of the coded variables and the obtained cod and nh3 n values are listed in table 3 the experimental data from table 3 were analyzed using the rsm based on bbd and a second order polynomial regression model with the experimental data was obtained as eqs 5 and 6 tables 4 and 5 show the analysis of variance anova results for cod and nh3 n removal rates respectively 5 y 1 78 99 7 18 x 1 9 19 x 2 0 1 x

respectively the magnitudes of the f values and p values represent the significance of the correlation coefficient the p value of the model results was below 0 01 indicating that the model result was statistically significant 33 lack of fit is an important factor for evaluating the reliability of the model the lack of fit was insignificant which indicates that the model could be used for data analysis as shown in table 4 the p value of lack of fit was 0 0886 indicating that the mismatch term was insignificant and the model fit well in the response area the larger the value of the multivariate correlation coefficient r 2 the better the correlation the r 2 of the model was 0 9424 which indicated that the model could explain 94 24 of the results within the range of the experimental conditions the adj r 2 was 0 8684 which was very close to that of the r 2 the coefficient of variation c v was 4 61 which was much less than 10 indicating that the reliability and accuracy of the experimental data were very high these results indicate that the model was reasonably accurate 34 the order of significance of the three factors on the cod removal rate was applied voltage electrode spacing initial ph according to the response surface analysis experiment the optimal conditions for coking wastewater treatment were obtained as follows electrode spacing 1 cm applied voltage 10 v and initial ph 3 6 as shown in table 5 the p values of the model and lack of fit were 0 0028 and 0 0510 respectively indicating that the mismatch term was insignificant and the model fit well in the response area the larger the value of the multivariate correlation coefficient r 2 the better the correlation the r 2 of the model was 0 9298 which indicates that the model can explain 92 98 of the results within the experimental setting range the adj r 2 was 0 8396 which was very close to r 2 indicating that the reliability and accuracy of the experimental data are very high this proves that the model was reasonable the order of significance of the three factors on the nh3 n removal rate was applied voltage electrode spacing initial ph according to the response surface analysis experiment the optimal conditions for nh3 n removal from coking wastewater treatment were obtained as follows electrode spacing of 1 cm applied voltage of 10 v and initial ph of 3 88 the optimal conditions obtained by the response surface experiment were as follows cod removal rate electrode spacing of 1 cm applied voltage of 10 v and initial ph of 3 6 nh3 n removal rate electrode spacing of 1 cm applied voltage of 10 v and initial ph of 3 88 considering the changes in the cod and nh3 n removal rate the nh3 n removal rate reached a maximum range of 100 and the cod removal rate reached a maximum of 89 29 the 100 nh3 n removal rate included the conditions where the cod removal rate reached its maximum therefore we selected the optimal reaction conditions as follows electrode spacing of 1 cm reaction voltage of 10 v and initial ph of 3 88 by setting the above conditions in the corresponding response surface model equations eqs 5 and 6 the predicted values of cod and nh3 n removal rates were 89 29 and 117 03 respectively in the verification experiment the actual values of cod and nh3 n contents were assessed the actual removal rate of cod was between 88 91 and 96 65 and the actual removal rate of nh3 n was 100 in the 3d plot analysis of the interaction of the two factors on the response surface the steeper the surface of the 3d map the greater the interaction between the two factors in contrast the effect of the interaction was weak 35 the 3d plots of rsm for cod and nh3 n removal rates are shown in fig 2 it can be seen from fig 2 that the interactions between various factors have the same effects on the degradation of cod and nh3 n we present the findings of the interactions between the applied voltage and electrode spacing on the cod and nh3 n removal rates in fig 2 a and d compared with the impact of electrode spacing the effect of applied voltage on the cod and nh3 n treatments was smaller it is known from the analysis of variance tables tables 4 and 5 that the f value of the electrode spacing was greater than the f value of the applied voltage when the electrode spacing was nearly 1 cm the cod and nh3 n removal rates did not increase significantly as the applied voltage increased as the applied voltage increased the system current density increased causing side reactions in the reaction system that hindered the electro fenton reaction under the constraints of the experimental conditions the maximum applied voltage for the experiment was 10 v as depicted in the interaction diagrams for the applied voltage and the initial ph fig 2 b and e as the initial ph of the coking wastewater increased the cod and nh3 n removal rates decreased when the applied voltage was 10 v the maximum removal rate was at initial ph values 2 5 4 in the diagram depicting the interaction between electrode spacing and initial ph value fig 2 c and f we can see that the treatment had a good effect when the electrode spacing was 1 cm and the initial ph was 2 3 as the electrode spacing increased the treatment effect was less than that for the electrode spacing of 1 cm regardless of the initial ph change 3 3 mechanism according to response surface methodology experiment research we know that the modified electro fenton process has a good treatment effect on the degradation of nh3 n and cod in coking wastewater the graphs of nh3 n nitrate nitrogen and cod concentrations over time are shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 there was no change in the concentration of nh3 n but the cod value dropped sharply in the first 4 h of the reaction this indicated that the main targets for the degradation of oh were the carbon containing organic compounds with complex structures in the coking wastewater the macromolecular organic matter easily degradable was oxidatively degraded into inorganic matter or small molecule sized refractory organic matter cod removal was mainly obtained and nh3 n did not degrade during this period after the reaction had been running for 4 h the nh3 n content in the coking wastewater decreased markedly and the nh3 n removal rate was significantly increased after 6 h the nh3 n removal rate reached 100 and the cod removal rate reached a maximum the concentration of nitrate nitrogen did not change during the entire reaction process therefore the priority of nh3 n degradation is lower than that of cod in the nh3 n degradation process part of the nh3 n was degraded into n2 and h2o through the pathways described by eqs 7 9 36 the remaining nh3 n was oxidized to non polluting n2 by the oxidation of oh eq 10 37 7 2 cl 2 e cl 2 8 cl 2 h 2 o hclo h 3 cl 9 2 nh 4 3 clo n 2 2 h 3 cl 3 h 2 o 10 nh 3 n oh h 2 o n 2 to clarify the cod degradation kinetics during the electro fenton treatment of coking wastewater the experimental data were fitted using pseudo zero pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetics the calculations show that the fitted coefficients r 2 were 0 90906 0 97462 and 0 90938 respectively therefore we know that the cod removal processes observed by this study followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics with the reaction kinetic constant calculated to be 0 00554 min 1 using eq 4 the result of the pseudo first order reaction kinetic fitting is shown in the inset of fig 1 d to ensure the formation of oh in the electro fenton process with the fe ac ni cathode classical scavenging experiments were carried out under optimal conditions phenol representing the characteristic contaminants of coking wastewater was selected as the treatment target a solution of 1250 mg l 1 phenol equivalent to the cod of the coking wastewater and 0 05 m na2so4 was used as the electrolyte and 10 ml isopropyl alcohol was added as an oh scavenger experiments without the addition of isopropanol were carried out under the same conditions as the control the experimental results are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the oh generated by the experimental electro fenton system can effectively degrade phenol without oh scavengers with the phenol removal rate reaching 99 9 after 420 min during the reaction process when the reaction system contained sufficient oh scavengers the phenol removal rate decreased significantly because the oh generated by the electro fenton system was consumed by the oh scavengers and the oxidative degradation efficiency of phenol was reduced the phenol removal rate only reached 61 16 after 420 min of reaction the results suggest that oh can be effectively produced in the electro fenton system constructed in this experiment 3 4 analytical characterization 3 4 1 uv vis analysis in general coking wastewater contains monocyclic aromatic compounds polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons benzene rings and heterocyclic compounds the detection range for analysis in this experiment was set to 185 500 nm and the uv vis analysis of the coking wastewater treatment by the electro fenton system over 1 7 h is depicted in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the coking wastewater has a strong absorption peak at 190 nm which can be attributed to a cyclic aromatic compound and a more obvious absorption peak around 275 nm which can be attributed to a benzene ring or an unsaturated aldehyde ketones and other substances 38 as can be observed in fig 5 the absorption peaks of each stage continuously decreased during the electro fenton process after 5 h of treatment the absorption peak at 275 nm completely disappeared leaving only a segment of the absorption peak at approximately 190 nm which indicates that the remaining organic pollutants were cyclic aromatic compounds after 7 h of reaction the absorption band at 220 240 nm disappeared and only one absorption band remained at 190 nm it can be concluded that only a few aromatic compounds remained in the wastewater sample after 7 h of reaction time the uv254 value characterizes the absorbance of some organic substances in wastewater samples at 254 nm wavelength ultraviolet light which reflects the amount of pollutants naturally present in wastewater including humus like macromolecular organic substances and aromatic compounds containing cc double bonds and co double bonds these wastewater components are refractory and have poor biodegradability 39 if the uv254 value is small it means that the wastewater contains a few humus macromolecular organics and aromatic compounds therefore when the uv254 value gradually decreased as the reaction progressed and the biodegradability of the wastewater improved the change in uv254 over time in this study is shown in the inset of fig 5 it can be seen that the uv254 value dropped from 0 155 to 0 005 after 7 h of reaction time this result implies that the modified electro fenton system can improve the biodegradability of coking wastewater 3 4 2 ftir analysis the organic matter in coking wastewater includes long chain alkanes amines benzenes and heterocyclic compounds 40 in this experiment the coking wastewater samples were analyzed by ftir analysis before and after treatment under optimal conditions electrode spacing 1 cm applied voltage 10 v and initial ph 3 88 the results are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the ftir absorption peaks of the characteristic pollutants in the coking wastewater appeared in similar positions before and after the treatment with six absorption peaks being identical 41 43 there was an obvious hydroxyl stretching vibration band at the 3447 58 cm 1 absorption peak indicating that both before and after the reaction the coking wastewater samples contained carboxyl phenol or alcohol hydroxyl considering the characteristics of the coking wastewater composition phenolic hydroxyl was most likely present there was a weak absorption peak at 2360 3 cm 1 and a strong absorption peak at 2071 6 cm 1 this was due to the stretching vibrations of unsaturated double bonds triple bonds and the cumulative vibrations of double bonds the absorption peak at 1636 3 cm 1 was stronger before the reaction and weaker after the reaction after the reaction the coking wastewater sample had two weaker absorption peaks at 1717 15 cm 1 and 1618 18 cm 1 which were the result of aromatic ring double bond stretching due to vibration past the absorption peaks at 1143 47 cm 1 the water samples had absorption peaks at 1022 73 cm 1 and 1002 17 cm 1 which were attributed to the stretching vibrations of ethers after the reaction process the water samples had absorption peaks at 967 47 cm 1 and 940 53 cm 1 which were co stretching vibrations of carboxylic acids the water samples had a peak at 627 66 cm 1 before the reaction and after the reaction the water samples had absorption peaks at 757 69 cm 1 and 621 73 cm 1 all of which were ch vibration and nh out of plane bending absorption peaks the above results indicated that phenolic compounds unsaturated double bonds triple bonds aromatic compounds alkanes and other organic compounds were present in the coking wastewater sample before the reaction after the reaction the intensity of each absorption peak was reduced by diversely varying degrees indicating that the electro fenton method can remove these toxic organic pollutants quite effectively the absorption peak at 2071 6 cm 1 disappeared specifically indicating that the unsaturated double bonds and triple bonds were removed especially the cumulative double bonds 3 4 3 3d eem fluorescence spectra coking wastewater contains fluorescent organic pollutants which can produce a specific wavelength fluorescence spectrum under a certain range of light wavelengths 44 45 under the illumination of a light source different organic pollutants produce distinctively characteristic fluorescence intensity peaks and depending on their location and intensity the types of organic pollutants in the sample can be determined 3d eem was used to analyze the coking wastewater samples before and after the reaction under the optimal conditions electrode spacing 1 cm applied voltage 10 v and initial ph 3 88 the results are visualized in fig 7 it can be observed from fig 7 a that there were three fluorescence peaks in the coking wastewater before the reaction marked as a b and c located at 275 nm 285 nm ex em 235 nm 340 nm and 240 nm 360 nm respectively the organic pollutants in the coking wastewater were mainly in regions i ii and iv regions i and ii were aromatic protein analogs and region iv was a microbial by product analog 46 as shown in fig 7 b the fluorescence peaks in regions ⅳ and ⅱ peaks a and c disappeared after 7 h of treatment under optimal experimental conditions and only a relatively weak fluorescent peak peak b remained in region ii indicating that most of the organic pollutants in regions i and iv can be removed by the electro fenton method there were still weak fluorescence peaks in region ii indicating that the organic pollutants in region ii aromatic protein analogs were relatively more difficult to remove in general the results of treating coking wastewater with the electro fenton method are ideal 3 4 4 gc ms analysis gc ms uses both the strong separation power of gas chromatographic technology and the high discriminatory power of mass spectra it was very suitable for the qualitative identification of mixtures in this experiment the results of the gc ms analysis of coking wastewater before and after the reaction under the optimal reaction conditions electrode spacing 1 cm applied voltage 10 v and initial ph 3 88 are shown in fig 8 the types of organic substances present in coking wastewater are complex and diverse but most organic compounds are detectable by gc ms therefore the pollutant content was determined based on the relative area of the obtained peaks the results for the analysis of the coking wastewater are shown in table 6 as shown in table 6 the main pollutants in the coking wastewater sample before the reaction were phenol o cresol m cresol indole and 3 5 dimethylphenol among them the content of phenols was the highest and several phenols accounted for 88 28 of the total area of chromatographic peaks of organic components in addition it contained small amounts of pyridine heptone and various alkanes the phenolic substances were completely degraded after 7 h of reaction time under the optimal reaction conditions which indicated that the electro fenton oxidation system is a good method for the effective treatment of macromolecular organic compounds as well as for its ring opening and chain breaking effects on macromolecular organic compounds 47 however the long chain alkane species were still present in the water sample after the reaction which indicated that the electro fenton oxidation process had a relatively weaker treatment effects on long chain alkane species 3 4 5 color no iron sludge precipitation was observed during the electro fenton reaction and the coking wastewater gradually changed from brown to colorless the color of wastewater is usually determined by the chromophores and auxochromic groups it contained the chromophores contained in the coking wastewater included cho chch no2 cooh and cnh2o the auxochrome groups were ch3 nh2 sh nhr nr2 or etc color analysis was conducted before and after the electro fenton treatment under optimal conditions electrode spacing 1 cm applied voltage 10 v and initial ph 3 88 in this experiment it can be seen that the color of coking wastewater can be reduced 200 fold after 7 h of reaction time from its original color to colorless fig 9 the extent of color removal in this experiment was up to 99 5 because the chromophore and auxochrome groups were destroyed during the reaction a finding confirmed by gc ms characterization analysis after 4 h of reaction time the wastewater sample was nearly colorless which is consistent with the cod removal curve this indicates that the modified electro fenton method is a good method for effectively removing the color of coking wastewater 4 conclusion in this study an fe ac ni electrode was used as the cathode in an electro fenton reaction system which when used to treat coking wastewater can effectively remove cod and nh3 n without producing secondary iron sludge pollution the response surface methodology results demonstrated that the order of magnitude of the effects on cod and nh3 n removal rate was as follows applied voltage electrode spacing initial ph the optimized conditions based on a bbd were an electrode spacing of 1 cm applied voltage of 10 v and initial ph of 3 88 under these conditions the cod removal rate of several experiments was 88 91 96 65 and the nh3 n removal rate reached 100 the combination of uv vis ftir 3d eem gc ms color analysis and mechanism investigation were used to evaluate the efficacy of the modified electro fenton method for treating coking wastewater it was found that cyclic aromatic compounds could be efficiently removed the unsaturated double and triple bonds could be broken up and toxic organic compounds and ammonium salt in the wastewater could be effectively degraded thus this study provides an improved heterogeneous electro fenton technology that can degrade most refractory pollutants and significantly enhance the biodegradability of coking wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

13196,human urine contains high concentration of pharmaceuticals a concern that must be addressed if used as a fertiliser this study systematically evaluated granular activated carbon gac adsorption in removing five most commonly found pharmaceuticals in the environment naproxen nap carbamazepine cbz ibuprofen ibp acetaminophen apap and metronidazole mtz from hydrolysed urine fixed bed column experiments were conducted to obtain breakthrough curves and assess gac 1000 m2g 1 performance in the adsorption of pharmaceuticals at different adsorbent mass 4 12 g l 1 flow rate 1 15 4 32 l d 1 and adsorption contact time at ambient room temperature and ph 9 the highest adsorption capacity was observed at a lower adsorbent mass 4 g l 1 and lower flow rate 1 15 l d 1 for all micropollutants the breakthrough curves showed the highest gac adsorption capacity for cbz 56 1 mg g 1 while mtz 32 2 mg g 1 with the lowest adsorption will be the design limiting for column adsorption application thomas and yoon nelson models fitted well for predicting empirical breakthrough curves for fixed bed gac column adsorption the artificial neural network ann modelling was able to predict the removal

the range of parameters studied graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ann modelling breakthrough curves gac column adsorption hydrolysed urine pharmaceutical removal 1 introduction over the past 50 years studies have indicated that approximately 200 000 tons of pharmaceuticals are consumed worldwide annually 1 based on the present consumption rate global pharmaceutical use is expected to increase by approximately 15 by 2030 2 due to frequent presence of pharmaceutical compounds in the environment there is growing concern about the antimicrobial resistant bacteria furthermore vast amounts of pharmaceutical pollutants have been reported in the groundwater surface water and soil therefore there is a growing concern about their harmful effects of pharmaceuticals not only to the aquatic environment but also to the humans and wildlife because of the potential toxicity it can cause by the synergistic effects of parent compounds and metabolites existing in the environment 3 4 most conventional wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and therefore cannot attain adequate removal of these organic compounds 5 which all finally lands up in the aquatic environment nutrient recovery via urine collection mainly from toilets was first suggested in the 1990s because urine contains up to 88 of nitrogen 67 of phosphorus and 73 of potassium in the domestic wastewater 6 7 source separation of urine offers a unique opportunity for diversion of pharmaceuticals from the wastewater because urine is the major source of pharmaceuticals that enters wastewater treatment plants although urine accounts less than 1 by volume of the total wastewater flow to the treatment plant 8 however only limited studies have been focussed so far on the pharmaceuticals removal from urine solutions zhang et al 9 applied a combined uv and h2o2 processes while dodd et al 10 investigated advanced oxidation process using ozone to remove micropollutants from hydrolysed urine both studies observed that micropollutants could be partially eliminated by oxidants formed from other compositions present in the urine de wilt et al 11 reported that high levels of diclofenac metoprolol and paracetamol 60 100 were removed but trimethoprim and carbamazepine were only partially removed 30 and 60 respectively using biodegradation and photolysis sun et al 12 reported that a combination of biochar adsorption and h2o2 were able to remove 39 74 71 and 49 of sulfadiazine sulfamethazine sulfadimethoxine and sulfamethoxazole respectively from urine at 1 gl 1 biochar dosage pronk et al 13 observed that over 90 of micropollutants and nutrients present in the urine were removed via nanofiltration membrane process so an additional step is necessary to separate the micropollutants from the nutrients using electrodialysis or microfiltration as pre treatment step to nanofiltration it resulted in higher micropollutant removal rates although the combined process is complicated and requires additional processes and longer operation times moreover zhang et al 14 observed that a fixed bed biochar column adsorption combined with peroxydisulfate removed 75 of n4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole and 98 of sulfamethoxazole from the urine duygan et al 15 reported that over 90 of pharmaceuticals is removed from the nitrified using 200 mg l 1 of powdered activated carbon granular activated carbon gac is widely employed in the removal of natural or synthetic micropollutants and hence can be utilized either in the form of a fixed bed column or stirred tank reactors most recent studies are related to gac removal of pharmaceuticals from the surface water and wastewater 16 21 and only limited studies are dedicated to the removal of pharmaceuticals from the urine matrix 6 15 22 gac column adsorption is one of the most common technologies for water and wastewater treatment because of its high treatment efficiency ease of expansion into industrial applications and simple operations 23 gac adsorption may result in high pharmaceutical removal nevertheless however with time the gac bed column will become saturated needing regeneration or replacement 24 studies on bed column adsorption is important because it can provide valuable information such as breakthrough curves and acquire treatment performance data essential for system design for actual applications following column saturation gac can be generally regenerated and reused making the process more sustainable and economical 25 lab scale column experiments and sample analysis of micropollutants to evaluate their removal performances from wastewater is both expensive and time consuming predicting micropollutant removal through robust modelling and simulation under various operating conditions is a more useful and cost effective approach to understanding the likely performances of the gac column adsorption in addition the application of numerical modelling can help researchers with the process predesign making it more efficient and cost effective 26 27 as a machine artificial neural network ann is inspired by human brain where this machine can demonstrate human like behaviour one of the key abilities of ann is learning both non linear and linear relationships between the dependent and independent factors in ann modelling the actual results with the experimental condition feed the network to train it and the trained model is then validated and tested for prediction 26 therefore the trained ann models have been employed effectively to forecast micropollutants removal systems efficiency during the wastewater treatment process 28 29 more precisely ann has been used to develop models for kinetics 30 31 isotherms 32 33 breakthrough curves 34 as well as process optimisation 35 unlike other traditional models this versatility is due to the fact that ann learns immediately from empirical results without making suppositions about the nature of physicochemical which influence mechanism adsorption although few studies have been published on the fixed bed columns adsorption for pharmaceutical removal from a urine matrix 14 15 22 to the best of our knowledge an analysis of gac s breakthrough curves and behaviour under various conditions using ann predictive modelling of pharmaceuticals in hydrolysed urine has not yet been evaluated therefore the objectives of the study include evaluating the pharmaceutical removal from hydrolysed urine by fixed bed gac column including understanding the impacts of major operating conditions apply mathematical models to reproduce breakthrough curves for pharmaceutical adsorption and acquire column adsorption parameters and apply it for ann modelling to predict pharmaceutical removal from the hydrolysed urine 2 material and method 2 1 adsorbent and adsorbate five pharmaceutical compounds were selected for this study cbz nap ibp apap and mtz sigma aldrich australia pharmaceutically active compounds were selected based on their frequent occurrence and in high percentage up to 90 in the urine matrix molecular structure and various physicochemical properties such as hydrophobicity and molecular size as shown in table 1 stock solutions of each micropollutant were prepared by dissolving them in 100 meoh solution due to their low solubility in water the concentrations of all five pharmaceutical in the hydrolysed urine were spiked to an initial concentration of 0 2 mm to work within a detectable limit the coal based gac mdw 4050cb used in this study was supplied by james cumming sons pty ltd australia before use the gac was washed with water to eliminate surface impurities then drier at 100 c for 24 h in an oven the bet surface area of gac was sbet 1000 m2 g 1 and gac particle size ranging from 0 42 to 1 68 mm with majority within 0 42 0 60 mm range 36 the synthetic hydrolysed urine composition used for all the tests in this work are shown in table s1 2 2 fixed bed column experiments the column adsorption experiments were performed using acrylic columns with 2 cm internal diameter and 30 cm length a stainless steel mesh was placed at the bottom to prevent the gac adsorbent from flowing out with the effluent the fixed bed column was filled with gac and supported by glass beads at the top to improve influent flow distribution and ensure full wetting of the adsorbent as shown in fig s1 the influent was fed in down flow mode at a controlled flow rate using peristaltic pump masterflex cole parmer usa the hydrolysed urine flow varied between 1 15 l d 1 and 4 32 l d 1 and all tests were performed at 25 c 2 3 gac column adsorption analysis the micropollutant adsorption on the fixed bed gac column were assessed by plotting breakthrough curves ct c0 where c0 is the initial concentration of micropollutants and ct represents the micropollutants concentration at the end of the fixed bed at a time t against operation time days the breakthrough point was determined using breakthrough curve experiments which identify the time at which the concentration of the effluent reaches a relatively specified percentage of the influent concentration and is usually 5 37 saturation time was defined as when the effluent concentration of micropollutants reached the 95 of influent concentration the breakthrough point which allows the system to calculate treated effluent volume is an important parameter the region above the breakthrough curve therefore determines the highest adsorption capacity q t mg g 1 and can be calculated as follows 1 q t q c 0 m t 0 t total 1 c t c 0 dt where m represents the adsorbent mass in the column g q the flow rate l d 1 and t represents the total time d 37 the height of mass transfer zone hmtz is the adsorbent length in the fixed bed which is unsaturated and thus contributes to mass transfer the form of the hmtz is depends on the adsorption mechanism the mass transfer conditions operational conditions related to bed length and the flow rate 38 the hmtz calculation can be expressed as follows 2 h mtz 1 q b q t h where h is the bed height cm q b and q t are the adsorption capacities mg g 1 at the breakthrough point effluent concentration reaches 5 of influent and the highest adsorption capacity at saturation effluent concentration reaches 95 of influent respectively additionally the adsorbent usage rate ur the fraction of bed utilization fbu and empty bed contact time ebct are helpful factors for the breakthrough curves analysis fbu is linked to hmtz and ebct or time of residence which impact the influent treatment volume and the breakthrough curve s nature can be expressed as follows 3 u r m v a 4 fbu q b q t 5 bect v q here v represents the fixed bed volume l v a represents the volume that was treated at breakthrough l 25 2 4 data collection and ann modelling to establish a sophisticated and accurate analysis of the process the empirical results of a series of fixed bed column adsorption were used to evolve computer models under various conditions involving contact time adsorbent mass and flow rate to decrease the complication of the computation and evade overtraining the empirical data of the input and output were randomized and ranged from 0 1 to 0 9 as expressed in eq 6 6 normalized value a i a i a max a max a min 0 9 0 1 0 1 where a min and a max represent the values of minimum and maximum of the network s inputs or outputs whereas ai represents the value of any input or output 39 in this work five feed forward ann models were developed using matlab r2018b to predict each pharmaceutical removal by fixed bed gac column adsorption ann modelling is carried out in three phases for example training validation and testing in the training phase the model is trained and developed and then the developed model is validated and tested in the validation and testing phases respectively each developed ann model has three layers the input hidden and output layers the numbers of the input and output variables show the numbers of the neurons in the input and output layers the number of neurons in a hidden layer is determined through modelling process the contact time adsorbent mass and flow rates were used as input variables in all five models whereas the percentages of nap cbz ibp apap and mtz removal were considered the output variables for each of the developed models to calculate the precision of the models in all three training validation and testing phases the determination coefficient r 2 and the mean square error mse were used as statistical indicators depending on which model was chosen as shown in table 2 in order to model the processes all the experimental data were randomly sectioned on two divisions of 80 and 20 the first division was employed with fractions of 70 15 and 15 for training validation and test respectively while the second division was employed for an additional test to check more the viability of the models levenberg marquardt was used as a backpropagation training algorithm to develop the models furthermore the output and hidden layers employed a function of linear transfer purelin and a function of a tangent sigmoid transfer tansig respectively various numbers of neurons ranging from 1 to 20 were studied in the hidden layer of the neural networks to determine the most suitable number additionally such modelling was repeated five times to develop a model with minimum errors ratio and maximum precision and output predictions 2 5 breakthrough curve modelling the breakthrough occurrence time and the saturation curve shape are fundamental properties for process design and dynamic response as they directly influence the technical and economic feasibility of the adsorption process to design a fixed bed column to facilitate adsorption accurate predictions for the effluent s breakthrough curve are needed the shape of the curve provides insight into the dynamic behaviour of the process in which in and out phase mass transfer and propagation increase resistance to adsorption 40 many mathematical models can be employed to describe the fixed bed column adsorption process the model developed by thomas is one of the most widely and commonly applied in fixed bed column performances 41 this model supposes that the rate of adsorption can be described using the kinetics of langmuir adsorption disregarding intraparticle mass transfer external liquid film resistance and pivotal dispersion in the column 25 it is expressed as follows 7 c 0 c t 1 1 exp k th q q 0 m c 0 qt where q 0 and k th are the theoretical adsorption capacities mg g 1 and the thomas model rate constant l d 1 mg 1 respectively regarding the yoon nelson model it was developed to reduce the error ratio related to the thomas theory at period of time this model supposes that the rate of decrease in the micropollutant adsorption eventuality is proportionate to the eventuality of the micropollutant adsorption and the eventuality of micropollutant breakthrough on the adsorbent 25 the model can be represented as follows 8 c 0 c t exp k yn t t 50 k yn 1 exp k yn t t 50 k yn where k yn and t 50 represent the rate constant of the yoon nelson d 1 and the time required to reach 50 of micropollutant breakthrough d respectively 2 6 pharmaceutical compounds analysis the pharmaceutical concentrations were analysed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lcms 8060 provided using a cortecs c18 column 2 7 μm with dimensions of 2 1 mm and 75 mm for inner diameter and length respectively the esi negative mode was used for the analyses of ibp and nap whereas the esi positive mode was employed for cbz apap and mtz all analytes were revealed simultaneously two mobile phases were applied for these analytes a was 100 methanol and b was milli q water the gradient elution used for the flow rate was persistent at 0 6 ml min 1 as follows mobile phase a remained at 50 0 01 0 10 min increased to 95 0 10 1 50 min and remained at 95 1 50 3 50 min and declined to 50 after that 3 51 5 50 min the multiple reaction modes chosen for the analytes were as follows apap 152 110 es mtz 172 128 es cbz 237 194 es ibp 205 161 es and nap 229 185 es calibration curves were also created for all mircopollutants at various concentrations of 2 5000 nm and also the determination coefficient r 2 was more than 0 99 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of operational conditions on pharmaceuticals removal 3 1 1 influence of flow rate the empirical breakthrough curves for the gac column adsorption of pharmaceuticals in hydrolysed urine are shown in fig 1 the breakthrough curves exemplify the rate of final concentration ct at different times and the initial concentration c0 against time the plot shows how the column adsorption of micropollutants onto gac is influenced by the flow rates moreover the breakthrough curve is significantly affected by the adsorption ratio or the mass moving from solution to adsorption active sites inside the gac particles the plots were nearest to an s shaped breakthrough curve especially at lower flow rates which indicated a higher adsorption rate and slower process on the other hand the breakthrough point time or t5 and saturation time decreased as the flow rate increased from 1 15 l d 1 to 4 32 l d 1 for all micropollutants as shown in table 3 this is expected because of the increased mass loading of micropollutants into the column at higher flow rates thereby saturating faster the trend in the values of breakthrough point t5 volume treated at breakthrough va and highest adsorption capacity at saturation qt were cbz nap aap ibp mtz indicating that gac adsorption is most favourable for cbz while the mtz being least favourable will be the limiting design of gac column adsorption amongst the five studied micropollutants the maximum adsorption capacities calculated were 56 1 53 4 36 3 34 9 and 32 2 mg g 1 at a flow rate of 1 15 l d 1 which decreases to 46 9 40 1 26 2 21 7 and 12 1 mg g 1 at the highest flow rate of 4 32 l d 1 for cbz nap ibp apap and mtz respectively although the micropollutant loading rate increases at higher flow rates however the decrease in the adsorption capacity at higher flow rates could be attributed to insufficient residence time for micropollutants to adsorb in the column and potential hydraulic short circuiting similar findings were reported for the adsorption of flumequine on activated carbon 38 and were explicated by the lower residence time in the column at higher flow rate competence and mass transfer parameters obtained from empirical breakthrough curves on the column experiment of micropollutants from the urine matrix are displayed in table 3 these parameters indicate that a low flow rate may produce a longer operating time to t5 along with a larger of va fbu which represents the ratio of the micropollutants adsorbed at breakthrough point qb to total adsorbed at saturation qt varied 0 32 0 12 at flow rate of 1 15 l d 1 but decreased to 0 22 0 01 at 4 32 l d 1 these fbu values are within the range reported in the literature the decrease in the fbu values at higher flow rates can be due to the inadequate contact time between the gac and micropollutants as reported in other studies 41 43 the ur value increases at higher flow rate which is a significant increase from 1 15 to 4 32 l d 1 this is expected because the high flow rates reduce the liquid film thickness surrounding the gac particles which results in a lower resistance of mass transfer and a higher mass transfer rate the explanation being that the value of ur increases as the flow rate increases 25 3 1 2 influence of adsorbent mass fixed bed experiments were conducted at different adsorbent mass reflected by adsorbent column height of 4 0 g 3 50 cm 6 0 g 5 2 cm and 12 0 g 10 4 cm to study the influence of adsorbent mass on the breakthrough curve and adsorption performance as presented in fig 2 as expected smaller bed height resulted in a quicker breakthrough compared to higher bed height leading to the faster saturation and exhaustion of the adsorbent a higher bed height can result in longer breakthrough time and obviously higher volume of urine treatment besides providing increased adsorption surface area the use of more gac mass increases the column length and hence the travel length and contact time of the micropollutants with the adsorbent resulting in a much higher adsorption at breakthrough 44 45 table 3 shows the symmetrical and calculated lengths of the mass transfer the trend in the values of t5 va and qt were cbz nap aap ibp mtz similar to the one observed earlier at different flow rates the mass adsorption capacity qb increased when a higher adsorbent height is used while the qt decreased a possible explanation for the reduced adsorption capacity could be the π bond intervention of the extra gac with each other which prevents the fashioning of π bonds between the pharmaceuticals and gac in the column 46 although this resulted in gradual increase in the fbu which is good but this also contributed to increased hmtz especially at the highest column height of 10 4 cm indicating the increase in the non ideality of the adsorption process at larger adsorbent height this is further supported by the decrease in the ur at higher adsorbent height a smaller hmtz is preferable as this brings the adsorption process closer to ideality resulting in higher utilization rates and less adsorbent wastage however for practical applications the adsorbent height cannot be too short as this could significantly increase the column area diameter resulting in increased footprint which is less desirable the fbu values increased when larger mass of adsorbent was used besides providing increased adsorption surface area the use of more gac mass increases the column length and hence the travel length and contact time of the micropollutants with the adsorbent resulting in a much higher adsorption at breakthrough resulting in improved fbu 38 3 2 breakthrough curves modelling the performance of gac column adsorption can be predicted via an analytical modelling approach of the breakthrough curves the analytical models of thomas and yoon nelson were used to describe the empirical data of the breakthrough curves as shown in fig 3 mathematical parameters and coefficients of determination of modelling under various operating conditions of the empirical design are presented in the table 4 the thomas equation is a two parameter neutralization that has a kinetic constant kth from table 4 it can be seen that the kth value increased at higher flow rates but decreased at higher adsorbent mass or bed height indicating that the mass transfer resistance reduces and proportionally the pivotal dispersion and fluid film thickness on the surface of particle also decrease 25 similar observations were found by de franco et al 41 that reported higher kth values at lower adsorbent mass for the adsorption of the diclofenac onto the gac sotelo et al 38 also found lower kth values at lower flow rates for a fixed bed column of flumequine by activated carbon thus it could be supposed that the high flow rates increased the driving strength of the mass transfer in the liquid film in addition the maximum adsorption capacity for the micropollutants has been calculated using thomas model q0 the predicted values were somewhat similar to experimentally calculated values in table 3 results showed that the maximum capacity q0 of micropollutants decreased in the following order cbz nap ibp apap mtz similar to the trend reported earlier in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 however the value of q0 decreased when a larger adsorption bed height was used the regression coefficient r 2 values of the thomas kinetic model are 0 95 0 96 0 95 0 92 and 0 96 for cbz nap ibp apap and mtz respectively in fig 3 indicating good agreement with the empirical results regarding the yoon nelson model it assumes the predicted time required to reach 50 of micropollutant breakthrough tpred 50 as can be seen in table 4 the value of the model parameter of tpred 50 increased at a higher adsorbent mass but decreased at a higher flow rate with the flow rate increased from 1 15 to 4 32 l d 1 the estimated tpred 50 values decreased from 4 59 2 90 to 1 20 0 375 day close to the experimental calculated values in table 3 the value of rate constant kyn however increased at a higher flow rate but decreased at a higher adsorbent mass as shown in table 4 fig 3 shows the breakthrough curve based on the yoon nelson model fitting with the experimental data as well as high yoon nelson regression coefficients r 2 values of 0 95 0 96 0 95 0 92 and 0 96 for cbz nap ibp apap and mtz respectively therefore the outcomes presented in table 4 indicate that the thomas and yoon nelson models are suitable for predicting the breakthrough curves for pharmaceutical adsorption onto gac in the fixed bed column 3 3 modelling of pharmaceuticals removal using ann the results point out that the topologies of 3 12 1 3 16 1 3 16 1 3 5 1 and 3 12 1 pointing out 12 16 16 5 and 12 neurons in hidden layers were the best fit for cbz nap ibp apap and mtz models respectively the determination coefficients for all training validation and testing provided good performance for the models in the forecast of the outputs figs s2 s6 fig 4 shows the values of r 2 for all data of the evolved models which were 0 997 0 999 0 996 0 844 and 0 995 for cbz nap ibp apap and mtz respectively furthermore fig 5 shows residual errors from the established models as noted the mse of the models were respectively 3 92 0 913 6 54 276 158 and 7 95 for cbz nap ibp apap and mtz that are negligible the evolved models therefore can foresee the effectiveness of the removal of the cbz nap ibp apap and mtz from urine solutions with 99 7 99 9 99 6 84 5 and 99 5 respectively eq 9 shows the prediction for the removal of all micropollutants using the ann models the values of the weights and biases for five micropollutants are displayed in tables s2 s6 9 ann equation purelin l w tansing iw contact time adsorbent mass flow rate b 1 b 2 as shown in fig 5 the residual error distribution was very low in the prediction of cbz nap ibp and mtz whereas the residual errors of apap model in which five experimental results could not fit very well with the developed model as mentioned in other studies the results of these modelling procedures can be different in various applications and the nature of the data are very important in this regard therefore it can be attributed to the mentioned reasons 39 47 nevertheless all of the other 78 data sets from 83 ones could mimic very well with the model and demonstrated very low errors fig 5 in a way that the additional test for apap removal model indicted better performance in fig 6 with r 2 0 934 and mse 73 36 which means that the mentioned five actual data which increase the residual errors of the model and decline the r 2 of the model could not generally decrease the performance of the developed model furthermore as apap the additional tests were accomplished for other four compounds models with 20 of the experimental data as well as observed in fig 6 the r 2 and mse of the additional tests for the cbz nap ibp and mtz models are 0 986 0 914 0 995 and 0 958 and 3 427 1 746 3 27 and 6 41 respectively previous studies reported that ann models can predict pharmaceutical adsorption with high accuracy almuntashiri et al 6 predicted the removal of ibuprofen naproxen metronidazole acetaminophen and carbamazepine via the developed ann models which feature r 2 values of 0 984 0 991 0 991 0 99 and 0 992 respectively in addition the high prediction and strength of ann models were reported in other studies in various applications hosseinzadeh et al 26 found that the ann models were able to foresee experimental and predicted values of nutrient recovery from solid waste by vermicomposting with high accuracy of 0 99 the results of hosseinzadeh et al 48 indicated the high accuracy of ann models in predicting levels of benzene toluene xylene and ethyl xylene from polluted airstreams in non thermal plasma as compared to response surface models due to the high accuracy and prediction of ann models such models are projected to be employed effectively in predicting pharmaceuticals removal 3 4 adsorption of pharmaceuticals onto gac gac characteristics are very important in determining the adsorption capacity of different micropollutants e g specific surface area porosity and pore size distribution granular sizes etc most of the adsorption process occurs when the macro pores act as paths for the adsorbate to reach micro pores on the other hand the acidity constant pka and octanol water partition coefficient kow of these micropollutants could have a fundamental effect on the ratio and level of adsorbent adsorption 23 consequently all properties have been documented in earlier literature reviews based on the literature hydrophobicity is a valuable factor in evaluating the sorption capacity of pharmaceuticals which affects the sorption capacity of pharmaceuticals on the adsorbent as expressed by log kow the log kow values of the five compounds ranked in decreasing order are ibp nap cbz apap and mtz nap however displayed relatively less adsorption affinity compared to cbz results similar to those observed by yu et al 49 and westerhoff et al 50 who applied various dosages of activated carbon in pure water spiked with micropollutants this is due to the dissociation of the acid at values of ph 6 4 8 2 which was noted in these studies the pka of pharmaceuticals varies according to their molecular structure ionisable compounds might manifest either as anions or cations based on their ph in the aqueous solution additionally the surface charge of gac has an important role in the removal process zeta potential that measures the charge of external surface for the gac enhances the understanding of how the adsorption process occurs 38 the surface charge of the gac therefore possesses an oscillating character that could have either a negative or positive charge depending on ph values thereby resulting directly in an effect regarding electrostatic interactions 6 51 consequently when the value of ph is lower than the point of a zero charge phpzc value the surface of the gac is positively charged and hence favours absorbing the anionic compounds and vice versa the value of the phpzc of the gac was determined to be ph 4 8 in our previous study 6 this shows that the surface of the gac possessed a negative charge during the adsorption mechanism because the phpzc value was less than the ph of the hydrolysed urine in our study the five active pharmaceutical compounds have been divided into two groups based on their pka values compared to the ph of the aqueous solution ph 9 as shown in the table 1 nap and ibp possessed negative charges while cbz apap and mtz possessed neutral charges although both nap and ibp being negatively charged in the urine matrix are expected to experience electrostatic repulsion with the negatively charged gac surface however their high removal rates indicates the less role of the electrostatic interactions their interaction with the gac surface might be because of other interactive forces such as π π bonding h bonding van der waals forces etc that might have contributed to their removal 36 which needs further studies to understand its actual removal mechanism on the other hand cbz apap and mtz are neutral in the urine matrix and are therefore expected to exhibit more electrostatic interactions with a negative charge on the gac surface compared to nap and ibp the results showed that mtz was the least adsorbed in the fixed bed column compared to other micropollutants from this it can be deduced that mtz adsorption onto gac is probably fundamentally physio sorption with a ph range of 4 11 52 in contrast cbz exhibited the highest sorption affinity to the gac surface due to the fact that physicochemical properties such as the pka described above and high molecular weight play an important role in the adsorption processes 23 53 human urine can contain hundreds or even thousands of different types of pharmaceuticals and at wide ranging concentrations and this column adsorption study has shown that depending on their properties such as physio chemical properties molecular weight surface charges pka values etc their removal mechanism breakthrough curve and their maximum removal rates 36 by gac adsorption can also vary significantly the breakthrough curve results of the five studied pharmaceuticals indicates that the gac column can be saturated much earlier for certain pharmaceutical e g mtz than the other pharmaceuticals that can have a significant impact on the process design and the capital costs these results also show that the designer must consider options such as multiple column different adsorbent in each column adsorption or multi adsorbent column different adsorbent mixed as multi sorption media in order to optimise both the removal effectiveness and their costs while the former option can be simulated using the empirical breakthrough models thomas model and yoon nelson model applied in this study however the second option will need further studies using different adsorbent media targeting those micropollutants that are less adsorbed and removed by gac 4 conclusion a fixed bed gac column adsorption was studied for the removal of five selected pharmaceuticals from hydrolysed urine synthetic the gac column study revealed that adsorbent mass and flow rate influenced both breakthrough point and saturation time a higher flow rates led to a quicker breakthrough resulting in the faster saturation and exhaustion of the adsorbent a smaller bed height resulted in faster breakthrough time and lower volume for urine treatment the adsorption affinity of the micropollutants were as follows cbz nap aap ibp mtz indicating for gac column adsorption application mtz would be the limiting micropollutants in the adsorption column design amongst the five studied micropollutants this study showed that the gac adsorption of pharmaceuticals depends on their physicochemical properties log kow and molecular weight the thomas model fitted well in describing the empirical breakthrough curves by gac column adsorption while the yoon nelson model described well for 50 of the column saturation time under the operation conditions tested in this study the ann models employed were capable to estimate the empirical and predicted values of pharmaceuticals removal from hydrolysed urine very effectively this study has shown that gac column adsorption can be highly effective in the removal of micropollutant from the hydrolysed urine however it must be acknowledged that this study was not extensive in the range of performance parameters tested such as gac properties types of pharmaceuticals and concentration range gac regeneration capacity etc which must be considered for future studies including the impact of competing organics such as creatinine and the regeneration capacity of the gac

13196,human urine contains high concentration of pharmaceuticals a concern that must be addressed if used as a fertiliser this study systematically evaluated granular activated carbon gac adsorption in removing five most commonly found pharmaceuticals in the environment naproxen nap carbamazepine cbz ibuprofen ibp acetaminophen apap and metronidazole mtz from hydrolysed urine fixed bed column experiments were conducted to obtain breakthrough curves and assess gac 1000 m2g 1 performance in the adsorption of pharmaceuticals at different adsorbent mass 4 12 g l 1 flow rate 1 15 4 32 l d 1 and adsorption contact time at ambient room temperature and ph 9 the highest adsorption capacity was observed at a lower adsorbent mass 4 g l 1 and lower flow rate 1 15 l d 1 for all micropollutants the breakthrough curves showed the highest gac adsorption capacity for cbz 56 1 mg g 1 while mtz 32 2 mg g 1 with the lowest adsorption will be the design limiting for column adsorption application thomas and yoon nelson models fitted well for predicting empirical breakthrough curves for fixed bed gac column adsorption the artificial neural network ann modelling was able to predict the removal effectiveness of over 99 except for apap at 84 5 the study showed that the potential application of gac column adsorption for micropollutant removal is significant although this study was limited in the range of parameters studied graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ann modelling breakthrough curves gac column adsorption hydrolysed urine pharmaceutical removal 1 introduction over the past 50 years studies have indicated that approximately 200 000 tons of pharmaceuticals are consumed worldwide annually 1 based on the present consumption rate global pharmaceutical use is expected to increase by approximately 15 by 2030 2 due to frequent presence of pharmaceutical compounds in the environment there is growing concern about the antimicrobial resistant bacteria furthermore vast amounts of pharmaceutical pollutants have been reported in the groundwater surface water and soil therefore there is a growing concern about their harmful effects of pharmaceuticals not only to the aquatic environment but also to the humans and wildlife because of the potential toxicity it can cause by the synergistic effects of parent compounds and metabolites existing in the environment 3 4 most conventional wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and therefore cannot attain adequate removal of these organic compounds 5 which all finally lands up in the aquatic environment nutrient recovery via urine collection mainly from toilets was first suggested in the 1990s because urine contains up to 88 of nitrogen 67 of phosphorus and 73 of potassium in the domestic wastewater 6 7 source separation of urine offers a unique opportunity for diversion of pharmaceuticals from the wastewater because urine is the major source of pharmaceuticals that enters wastewater treatment plants although urine accounts less than 1 by volume of the total wastewater flow to the treatment plant 8 however only limited studies have been focussed so far on the pharmaceuticals removal from urine solutions zhang et al 9 applied a combined uv and h2o2 processes while dodd et al 10 investigated advanced oxidation process using ozone to remove micropollutants from hydrolysed urine both studies observed that micropollutants could be partially eliminated by oxidants formed from other compositions present in the urine de wilt et al 11 reported that high levels of diclofenac metoprolol and paracetamol 60 100 were removed but trimethoprim and carbamazepine were only partially removed 30 and 60 respectively using biodegradation and photolysis sun et al 12 reported that a combination of biochar adsorption and h2o2 were able to remove 39 74 71 and 49 of sulfadiazine sulfamethazine sulfadimethoxine and sulfamethoxazole respectively from urine at 1 gl 1 biochar dosage pronk et al 13 observed that over 90 of micropollutants and nutrients present in the urine were removed via nanofiltration membrane process so an additional step is necessary to separate the micropollutants from the nutrients using electrodialysis or microfiltration as pre treatment step to nanofiltration it resulted in higher micropollutant removal rates although the combined process is complicated and requires additional processes and longer operation times moreover zhang et al 14 observed that a fixed bed biochar column adsorption combined with peroxydisulfate removed 75 of n4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole and 98 of sulfamethoxazole from the urine duygan et al 15 reported that over 90 of pharmaceuticals is removed from the nitrified using 200 mg l 1 of powdered activated carbon granular activated carbon gac is widely employed in the removal of natural or synthetic micropollutants and hence can be utilized either in the form of a fixed bed column or stirred tank reactors most recent studies are related to gac removal of pharmaceuticals from the surface water and wastewater 16 21 and only limited studies are dedicated to the removal of pharmaceuticals from the urine matrix 6 15 22 gac column adsorption is one of the most common technologies for water and wastewater treatment because of its high treatment efficiency ease of expansion into industrial applications and simple operations 23 gac adsorption may result in high pharmaceutical removal nevertheless however with time the gac bed column will become saturated needing regeneration or replacement 24 studies on bed column adsorption is important because it can provide valuable information such as breakthrough curves and acquire treatment performance data essential for system design for actual applications following column saturation gac can be generally regenerated and reused making the process more sustainable and economical 25 lab scale column experiments and sample analysis of micropollutants to evaluate their removal performances from wastewater is both expensive and time consuming predicting micropollutant removal through robust modelling and simulation under various operating conditions is a more useful and cost effective approach to understanding the likely performances of the gac column adsorption in addition the application of numerical modelling can help researchers with the process predesign making it more efficient and cost effective 26 27 as a machine artificial neural network ann is inspired by human brain where this machine can demonstrate human like behaviour one of the key abilities of ann is learning both non linear and linear relationships between the dependent and independent factors in ann modelling the actual results with the experimental condition feed the network to train it and the trained model is then validated and tested for prediction 26 therefore the trained ann models have been employed effectively to forecast micropollutants removal systems efficiency during the wastewater treatment process 28 29 more precisely ann has been used to develop models for kinetics 30 31 isotherms 32 33 breakthrough curves 34 as well as process optimisation 35 unlike other traditional models this versatility is due to the fact that ann learns immediately from empirical results without making suppositions about the nature of physicochemical which influence mechanism adsorption although few studies have been published on the fixed bed columns adsorption for pharmaceutical removal from a urine matrix 14 15 22 to the best of our knowledge an analysis of gac s breakthrough curves and behaviour under various conditions using ann predictive modelling of pharmaceuticals in hydrolysed urine has not yet been evaluated therefore the objectives of the study include evaluating the pharmaceutical removal from hydrolysed urine by fixed bed gac column including understanding the impacts of major operating conditions apply mathematical models to reproduce breakthrough curves for pharmaceutical adsorption and acquire column adsorption parameters and apply it for ann modelling to predict pharmaceutical removal from the hydrolysed urine 2 material and method 2 1 adsorbent and adsorbate five pharmaceutical compounds were selected for this study cbz nap ibp apap and mtz sigma aldrich australia pharmaceutically active compounds were selected based on their frequent occurrence and in high percentage up to 90 in the urine matrix molecular structure and various physicochemical properties such as hydrophobicity and molecular size as shown in table 1 stock solutions of each micropollutant were prepared by dissolving them in 100 meoh solution due to their low solubility in water the concentrations of all five pharmaceutical in the hydrolysed urine were spiked to an initial concentration of 0 2 mm to work within a detectable limit the coal based gac mdw 4050cb used in this study was supplied by james cumming sons pty ltd australia before use the gac was washed with water to eliminate surface impurities then drier at 100 c for 24 h in an oven the bet surface area of gac was sbet 1000 m2 g 1 and gac particle size ranging from 0 42 to 1 68 mm with majority within 0 42 0 60 mm range 36 the synthetic hydrolysed urine composition used for all the tests in this work are shown in table s1 2 2 fixed bed column experiments the column adsorption experiments were performed using acrylic columns with 2 cm internal diameter and 30 cm length a stainless steel mesh was placed at the bottom to prevent the gac adsorbent from flowing out with the effluent the fixed bed column was filled with gac and supported by glass beads at the top to improve influent flow distribution and ensure full wetting of the adsorbent as shown in fig s1 the influent was fed in down flow mode at a controlled flow rate using peristaltic pump masterflex cole parmer usa the hydrolysed urine flow varied between 1 15 l d 1 and 4 32 l d 1 and all tests were performed at 25 c 2 3 gac column adsorption analysis the micropollutant adsorption on the fixed bed gac column were assessed by plotting breakthrough curves ct c0 where c0 is the initial concentration of micropollutants and ct represents the micropollutants concentration at the end of the fixed bed at a time t against operation time days the breakthrough point was determined using breakthrough curve experiments which identify the time at which the concentration of the effluent reaches a relatively specified percentage of the influent concentration and is usually 5 37 saturation time was defined as when the effluent concentration of micropollutants reached the 95 of influent concentration the breakthrough point which allows the system to calculate treated effluent volume is an important parameter the region above the breakthrough curve therefore determines the highest adsorption capacity q t mg g 1 and can be calculated as follows 1 q t q c 0 m t 0 t total 1 c t c 0 dt where m represents the adsorbent mass in the column g q the flow rate l d 1 and t represents the total time d 37 the height of mass transfer zone hmtz is the adsorbent length in the fixed bed which is unsaturated and thus contributes to mass transfer the form of the hmtz is depends on the adsorption mechanism the mass transfer conditions operational conditions related to bed length and the flow rate 38 the hmtz calculation can be expressed as follows 2 h mtz 1 q b q t h where h is the bed height cm q b and q t are the adsorption capacities mg g 1 at the breakthrough point effluent concentration reaches 5 of influent and the highest adsorption capacity at saturation effluent concentration reaches 95 of influent respectively additionally the adsorbent usage rate ur the fraction of bed utilization fbu and empty bed contact time ebct are helpful factors for the breakthrough curves analysis fbu is linked to hmtz and ebct or time of residence which impact the influent treatment volume and the breakthrough curve s nature can be expressed as follows 3 u r m v a 4 fbu q b q t 5 bect v q here v represents the fixed bed volume l v a represents the volume that was treated at breakthrough l 25 2 4 data collection and ann modelling to establish a sophisticated and accurate analysis of the process the empirical results of a series of fixed bed column adsorption were used to evolve computer models under various conditions involving contact time adsorbent mass and flow rate to decrease the complication of the computation and evade overtraining the empirical data of the input and output were randomized and ranged from 0 1 to 0 9 as expressed in eq 6 6 normalized value a i a i a max a max a min 0 9 0 1 0 1 where a min and a max represent the values of minimum and maximum of the network s inputs or outputs whereas ai represents the value of any input or output 39 in this work five feed forward ann models were developed using matlab r2018b to predict each pharmaceutical removal by fixed bed gac column adsorption ann modelling is carried out in three phases for example training validation and testing in the training phase the model is trained and developed and then the developed model is validated and tested in the validation and testing phases respectively each developed ann model has three layers the input hidden and output layers the numbers of the input and output variables show the numbers of the neurons in the input and output layers the number of neurons in a hidden layer is determined through modelling process the contact time adsorbent mass and flow rates were used as input variables in all five models whereas the percentages of nap cbz ibp apap and mtz removal were considered the output variables for each of the developed models to calculate the precision of the models in all three training validation and testing phases the determination coefficient r 2 and the mean square error mse were used as statistical indicators depending on which model was chosen as shown in table 2 in order to model the processes all the experimental data were randomly sectioned on two divisions of 80 and 20 the first division was employed with fractions of 70 15 and 15 for training validation and test respectively while the second division was employed for an additional test to check more the viability of the models levenberg marquardt was used as a backpropagation training algorithm to develop the models furthermore the output and hidden layers employed a function of linear transfer purelin and a function of a tangent sigmoid transfer tansig respectively various numbers of neurons ranging from 1 to 20 were studied in the hidden layer of the neural networks to determine the most suitable number additionally such modelling was repeated five times to develop a model with minimum errors ratio and maximum precision and output predictions 2 5 breakthrough curve modelling the breakthrough occurrence time and the saturation curve shape are fundamental properties for process design and dynamic response as they directly influence the technical and economic feasibility of the adsorption process to design a fixed bed column to facilitate adsorption accurate predictions for the effluent s breakthrough curve are needed the shape of the curve provides insight into the dynamic behaviour of the process in which in and out phase mass transfer and propagation increase resistance to adsorption 40 many mathematical models can be employed to describe the fixed bed column adsorption process the model developed by thomas is one of the most widely and commonly applied in fixed bed column performances 41 this model supposes that the rate of adsorption can be described using the kinetics of langmuir adsorption disregarding intraparticle mass transfer external liquid film resistance and pivotal dispersion in the column 25 it is expressed as follows 7 c 0 c t 1 1 exp k th q q 0 m c 0 qt where q 0 and k th are the theoretical adsorption capacities mg g 1 and the thomas model rate constant l d 1 mg 1 respectively regarding the yoon nelson model it was developed to reduce the error ratio related to the thomas theory at period of time this model supposes that the rate of decrease in the micropollutant adsorption eventuality is proportionate to the eventuality of the micropollutant adsorption and the eventuality of micropollutant breakthrough on the adsorbent 25 the model can be represented as follows 8 c 0 c t exp k yn t t 50 k yn 1 exp k yn t t 50 k yn where k yn and t 50 represent the rate constant of the yoon nelson d 1 and the time required to reach 50 of micropollutant breakthrough d respectively 2 6 pharmaceutical compounds analysis the pharmaceutical concentrations were analysed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lcms 8060 provided using a cortecs c18 column 2 7 μm with dimensions of 2 1 mm and 75 mm for inner diameter and length respectively the esi negative mode was used for the analyses of ibp and nap whereas the esi positive mode was employed for cbz apap and mtz all analytes were revealed simultaneously two mobile phases were applied for these analytes a was 100 methanol and b was milli q water the gradient elution used for the flow rate was persistent at 0 6 ml min 1 as follows mobile phase a remained at 50 0 01 0 10 min increased to 95 0 10 1 50 min and remained at 95 1 50 3 50 min and declined to 50 after that 3 51 5 50 min the multiple reaction modes chosen for the analytes were as follows apap 152 110 es mtz 172 128 es cbz 237 194 es ibp 205 161 es and nap 229 185 es calibration curves were also created for all mircopollutants at various concentrations of 2 5000 nm and also the determination coefficient r 2 was more than 0 99 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of operational conditions on pharmaceuticals removal 3 1 1 influence of flow rate the empirical breakthrough curves for the gac column adsorption of pharmaceuticals in hydrolysed urine are shown in fig 1 the breakthrough curves exemplify the rate of final concentration ct at different times and the initial concentration c0 against time the plot shows how the column adsorption of micropollutants onto gac is influenced by the flow rates moreover the breakthrough curve is significantly affected by the adsorption ratio or the mass moving from solution to adsorption active sites inside the gac particles the plots were nearest to an s shaped breakthrough curve especially at lower flow rates which indicated a higher adsorption rate and slower process on the other hand the breakthrough point time or t5 and saturation time decreased as the flow rate increased from 1 15 l d 1 to 4 32 l d 1 for all micropollutants as shown in table 3 this is expected because of the increased mass loading of micropollutants into the column at higher flow rates thereby saturating faster the trend in the values of breakthrough point t5 volume treated at breakthrough va and highest adsorption capacity at saturation qt were cbz nap aap ibp mtz indicating that gac adsorption is most favourable for cbz while the mtz being least favourable will be the limiting design of gac column adsorption amongst the five studied micropollutants the maximum adsorption capacities calculated were 56 1 53 4 36 3 34 9 and 32 2 mg g 1 at a flow rate of 1 15 l d 1 which decreases to 46 9 40 1 26 2 21 7 and 12 1 mg g 1 at the highest flow rate of 4 32 l d 1 for cbz nap ibp apap and mtz respectively although the micropollutant loading rate increases at higher flow rates however the decrease in the adsorption capacity at higher flow rates could be attributed to insufficient residence time for micropollutants to adsorb in the column and potential hydraulic short circuiting similar findings were reported for the adsorption of flumequine on activated carbon 38 and were explicated by the lower residence time in the column at higher flow rate competence and mass transfer parameters obtained from empirical breakthrough curves on the column experiment of micropollutants from the urine matrix are displayed in table 3 these parameters indicate that a low flow rate may produce a longer operating time to t5 along with a larger of va fbu which represents the ratio of the micropollutants adsorbed at breakthrough point qb to total adsorbed at saturation qt varied 0 32 0 12 at flow rate of 1 15 l d 1 but decreased to 0 22 0 01 at 4 32 l d 1 these fbu values are within the range reported in the literature the decrease in the fbu values at higher flow rates can be due to the inadequate contact time between the gac and micropollutants as reported in other studies 41 43 the ur value increases at higher flow rate which is a significant increase from 1 15 to 4 32 l d 1 this is expected because the high flow rates reduce the liquid film thickness surrounding the gac particles which results in a lower resistance of mass transfer and a higher mass transfer rate the explanation being that the value of ur increases as the flow rate increases 25 3 1 2 influence of adsorbent mass fixed bed experiments were conducted at different adsorbent mass reflected by adsorbent column height of 4 0 g 3 50 cm 6 0 g 5 2 cm and 12 0 g 10 4 cm to study the influence of adsorbent mass on the breakthrough curve and adsorption performance as presented in fig 2 as expected smaller bed height resulted in a quicker breakthrough compared to higher bed height leading to the faster saturation and exhaustion of the adsorbent a higher bed height can result in longer breakthrough time and obviously higher volume of urine treatment besides providing increased adsorption surface area the use of more gac mass increases the column length and hence the travel length and contact time of the micropollutants with the adsorbent resulting in a much higher adsorption at breakthrough 44 45 table 3 shows the symmetrical and calculated lengths of the mass transfer the trend in the values of t5 va and qt were cbz nap aap ibp mtz similar to the one observed earlier at different flow rates the mass adsorption capacity qb increased when a higher adsorbent height is used while the qt decreased a possible explanation for the reduced adsorption capacity could be the π bond intervention of the extra gac with each other which prevents the fashioning of π bonds between the pharmaceuticals and gac in the column 46 although this resulted in gradual increase in the fbu which is good but this also contributed to increased hmtz especially at the highest column height of 10 4 cm indicating the increase in the non ideality of the adsorption process at larger adsorbent height this is further supported by the decrease in the ur at higher adsorbent height a smaller hmtz is preferable as this brings the adsorption process closer to ideality resulting in higher utilization rates and less adsorbent wastage however for practical applications the adsorbent height cannot be too short as this could significantly increase the column area diameter resulting in increased footprint which is less desirable the fbu values increased when larger mass of adsorbent was used besides providing increased adsorption surface area the use of more gac mass increases the column length and hence the travel length and contact time of the micropollutants with the adsorbent resulting in a much higher adsorption at breakthrough resulting in improved fbu 38 3 2 breakthrough curves modelling the performance of gac column adsorption can be predicted via an analytical modelling approach of the breakthrough curves the analytical models of thomas and yoon nelson were used to describe the empirical data of the breakthrough curves as shown in fig 3 mathematical parameters and coefficients of determination of modelling under various operating conditions of the empirical design are presented in the table 4 the thomas equation is a two parameter neutralization that has a kinetic constant kth from table 4 it can be seen that the kth value increased at higher flow rates but decreased at higher adsorbent mass or bed height indicating that the mass transfer resistance reduces and proportionally the pivotal dispersion and fluid film thickness on the surface of particle also decrease 25 similar observations were found by de franco et al 41 that reported higher kth values at lower adsorbent mass for the adsorption of the diclofenac onto the gac sotelo et al 38 also found lower kth values at lower flow rates for a fixed bed column of flumequine by activated carbon thus it could be supposed that the high flow rates increased the driving strength of the mass transfer in the liquid film in addition the maximum adsorption capacity for the micropollutants has been calculated using thomas model q0 the predicted values were somewhat similar to experimentally calculated values in table 3 results showed that the maximum capacity q0 of micropollutants decreased in the following order cbz nap ibp apap mtz similar to the trend reported earlier in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 however the value of q0 decreased when a larger adsorption bed height was used the regression coefficient r 2 values of the thomas kinetic model are 0 95 0 96 0 95 0 92 and 0 96 for cbz nap ibp apap and mtz respectively in fig 3 indicating good agreement with the empirical results regarding the yoon nelson model it assumes the predicted time required to reach 50 of micropollutant breakthrough tpred 50 as can be seen in table 4 the value of the model parameter of tpred 50 increased at a higher adsorbent mass but decreased at a higher flow rate with the flow rate increased from 1 15 to 4 32 l d 1 the estimated tpred 50 values decreased from 4 59 2 90 to 1 20 0 375 day close to the experimental calculated values in table 3 the value of rate constant kyn however increased at a higher flow rate but decreased at a higher adsorbent mass as shown in table 4 fig 3 shows the breakthrough curve based on the yoon nelson model fitting with the experimental data as well as high yoon nelson regression coefficients r 2 values of 0 95 0 96 0 95 0 92 and 0 96 for cbz nap ibp apap and mtz respectively therefore the outcomes presented in table 4 indicate that the thomas and yoon nelson models are suitable for predicting the breakthrough curves for pharmaceutical adsorption onto gac in the fixed bed column 3 3 modelling of pharmaceuticals removal using ann the results point out that the topologies of 3 12 1 3 16 1 3 16 1 3 5 1 and 3 12 1 pointing out 12 16 16 5 and 12 neurons in hidden layers were the best fit for cbz nap ibp apap and mtz models respectively the determination coefficients for all training validation and testing provided good performance for the models in the forecast of the outputs figs s2 s6 fig 4 shows the values of r 2 for all data of the evolved models which were 0 997 0 999 0 996 0 844 and 0 995 for cbz nap ibp apap and mtz respectively furthermore fig 5 shows residual errors from the established models as noted the mse of the models were respectively 3 92 0 913 6 54 276 158 and 7 95 for cbz nap ibp apap and mtz that are negligible the evolved models therefore can foresee the effectiveness of the removal of the cbz nap ibp apap and mtz from urine solutions with 99 7 99 9 99 6 84 5 and 99 5 respectively eq 9 shows the prediction for the removal of all micropollutants using the ann models the values of the weights and biases for five micropollutants are displayed in tables s2 s6 9 ann equation purelin l w tansing iw contact time adsorbent mass flow rate b 1 b 2 as shown in fig 5 the residual error distribution was very low in the prediction of cbz nap ibp and mtz whereas the residual errors of apap model in which five experimental results could not fit very well with the developed model as mentioned in other studies the results of these modelling procedures can be different in various applications and the nature of the data are very important in this regard therefore it can be attributed to the mentioned reasons 39 47 nevertheless all of the other 78 data sets from 83 ones could mimic very well with the model and demonstrated very low errors fig 5 in a way that the additional test for apap removal model indicted better performance in fig 6 with r 2 0 934 and mse 73 36 which means that the mentioned five actual data which increase the residual errors of the model and decline the r 2 of the model could not generally decrease the performance of the developed model furthermore as apap the additional tests were accomplished for other four compounds models with 20 of the experimental data as well as observed in fig 6 the r 2 and mse of the additional tests for the cbz nap ibp and mtz models are 0 986 0 914 0 995 and 0 958 and 3 427 1 746 3 27 and 6 41 respectively previous studies reported that ann models can predict pharmaceutical adsorption with high accuracy almuntashiri et al 6 predicted the removal of ibuprofen naproxen metronidazole acetaminophen and carbamazepine via the developed ann models which feature r 2 values of 0 984 0 991 0 991 0 99 and 0 992 respectively in addition the high prediction and strength of ann models were reported in other studies in various applications hosseinzadeh et al 26 found that the ann models were able to foresee experimental and predicted values of nutrient recovery from solid waste by vermicomposting with high accuracy of 0 99 the results of hosseinzadeh et al 48 indicated the high accuracy of ann models in predicting levels of benzene toluene xylene and ethyl xylene from polluted airstreams in non thermal plasma as compared to response surface models due to the high accuracy and prediction of ann models such models are projected to be employed effectively in predicting pharmaceuticals removal 3 4 adsorption of pharmaceuticals onto gac gac characteristics are very important in determining the adsorption capacity of different micropollutants e g specific surface area porosity and pore size distribution granular sizes etc most of the adsorption process occurs when the macro pores act as paths for the adsorbate to reach micro pores on the other hand the acidity constant pka and octanol water partition coefficient kow of these micropollutants could have a fundamental effect on the ratio and level of adsorbent adsorption 23 consequently all properties have been documented in earlier literature reviews based on the literature hydrophobicity is a valuable factor in evaluating the sorption capacity of pharmaceuticals which affects the sorption capacity of pharmaceuticals on the adsorbent as expressed by log kow the log kow values of the five compounds ranked in decreasing order are ibp nap cbz apap and mtz nap however displayed relatively less adsorption affinity compared to cbz results similar to those observed by yu et al 49 and westerhoff et al 50 who applied various dosages of activated carbon in pure water spiked with micropollutants this is due to the dissociation of the acid at values of ph 6 4 8 2 which was noted in these studies the pka of pharmaceuticals varies according to their molecular structure ionisable compounds might manifest either as anions or cations based on their ph in the aqueous solution additionally the surface charge of gac has an important role in the removal process zeta potential that measures the charge of external surface for the gac enhances the understanding of how the adsorption process occurs 38 the surface charge of the gac therefore possesses an oscillating character that could have either a negative or positive charge depending on ph values thereby resulting directly in an effect regarding electrostatic interactions 6 51 consequently when the value of ph is lower than the point of a zero charge phpzc value the surface of the gac is positively charged and hence favours absorbing the anionic compounds and vice versa the value of the phpzc of the gac was determined to be ph 4 8 in our previous study 6 this shows that the surface of the gac possessed a negative charge during the adsorption mechanism because the phpzc value was less than the ph of the hydrolysed urine in our study the five active pharmaceutical compounds have been divided into two groups based on their pka values compared to the ph of the aqueous solution ph 9 as shown in the table 1 nap and ibp possessed negative charges while cbz apap and mtz possessed neutral charges although both nap and ibp being negatively charged in the urine matrix are expected to experience electrostatic repulsion with the negatively charged gac surface however their high removal rates indicates the less role of the electrostatic interactions their interaction with the gac surface might be because of other interactive forces such as π π bonding h bonding van der waals forces etc that might have contributed to their removal 36 which needs further studies to understand its actual removal mechanism on the other hand cbz apap and mtz are neutral in the urine matrix and are therefore expected to exhibit more electrostatic interactions with a negative charge on the gac surface compared to nap and ibp the results showed that mtz was the least adsorbed in the fixed bed column compared to other micropollutants from this it can be deduced that mtz adsorption onto gac is probably fundamentally physio sorption with a ph range of 4 11 52 in contrast cbz exhibited the highest sorption affinity to the gac surface due to the fact that physicochemical properties such as the pka described above and high molecular weight play an important role in the adsorption processes 23 53 human urine can contain hundreds or even thousands of different types of pharmaceuticals and at wide ranging concentrations and this column adsorption study has shown that depending on their properties such as physio chemical properties molecular weight surface charges pka values etc their removal mechanism breakthrough curve and their maximum removal rates 36 by gac adsorption can also vary significantly the breakthrough curve results of the five studied pharmaceuticals indicates that the gac column can be saturated much earlier for certain pharmaceutical e g mtz than the other pharmaceuticals that can have a significant impact on the process design and the capital costs these results also show that the designer must consider options such as multiple column different adsorbent in each column adsorption or multi adsorbent column different adsorbent mixed as multi sorption media in order to optimise both the removal effectiveness and their costs while the former option can be simulated using the empirical breakthrough models thomas model and yoon nelson model applied in this study however the second option will need further studies using different adsorbent media targeting those micropollutants that are less adsorbed and removed by gac 4 conclusion a fixed bed gac column adsorption was studied for the removal of five selected pharmaceuticals from hydrolysed urine synthetic the gac column study revealed that adsorbent mass and flow rate influenced both breakthrough point and saturation time a higher flow rates led to a quicker breakthrough resulting in the faster saturation and exhaustion of the adsorbent a smaller bed height resulted in faster breakthrough time and lower volume for urine treatment the adsorption affinity of the micropollutants were as follows cbz nap aap ibp mtz indicating for gac column adsorption application mtz would be the limiting micropollutants in the adsorption column design amongst the five studied micropollutants this study showed that the gac adsorption of pharmaceuticals depends on their physicochemical properties log kow and molecular weight the thomas model fitted well in describing the empirical breakthrough curves by gac column adsorption while the yoon nelson model described well for 50 of the column saturation time under the operation conditions tested in this study the ann models employed were capable to estimate the empirical and predicted values of pharmaceuticals removal from hydrolysed urine very effectively this study has shown that gac column adsorption can be highly effective in the removal of micropollutant from the hydrolysed urine however it must be acknowledged that this study was not extensive in the range of performance parameters tested such as gac properties types of pharmaceuticals and concentration range gac regeneration capacity etc which must be considered for future studies including the impact of competing organics such as creatinine and the regeneration capacity of the gac

13197,oil water separating membranes exhibiting contrasting wetting characteristics for oil and water superhydrophobicity and superoleophility were fabricated by dip coating different concentrations 5 10 and 20 of trichloro octadecyl silane on the micro porous stainless steel mesh the static contact angles of the fabricated surface in solid air water and solid air oil interfaces are found to be 152 and 0 respectively when trichloro octadecyl silane coated stainless steel membrane was used as a separating medium in the gravity driven oil water separating system 99 oil water separating efficiency was achieved in a single pass and in addition to this the fabricated membrane retained its wetting characteristics and oil water separating efficiency even after 10 consecutive passes of oily water through the membrane when the oily water comes in contact with the surface of the separating membrane the water solid interface gets into cassie baxter wetting state where the air in the micro nano structured pits renders low affinity of water on the membrane surface whereas the surface roughness enhances the affinity of oil on the solid surface and hence the coated surface attracts the oil phase to the pore boundaries of the mesh and at the same time pushes the water phase to the top the morphological characteristics and the elemental composition with fe sem eds elemental mapping and xps characterizations and the surface wettability of the coated membrane by measuring the interfacial contact angles were also carried out graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords oil water separation surface engineering superhydrophobic surface superoleophilic surface cassie baxter wetting 1 introduction the ever growing industrialization and the excessive dependence on the fossil fuels create many avenues for the accidental and intentional mixing of oil and water and this reckless human activity particularly from the petrochemical industries has been a cause of great environmental concern every day an enormous quantity of produced water which is the byproduct of the oil excavation is generated from the ageing oil wells as the ageing wells necessitates the injection of a large amount of water to extract more quantity of oil and if this produced water is left untreated and discarded in water bodies it ends up not only in the wastage of a huge quantity of water but also have a catastrophic effect on our environment 1 4 another major source of oil water mixing is from the accidental and intentional leaking of oil and oil waste into the sea from oil cargo ships oil wells and rigs which also wreak havoc to the marine eco system 5 12 with growing awareness of environmental repercussions and the stringent national and international environmental legislations the need for purifying the oily water is more demanding than ever 12 14 since the separation of oily water is technologically very challenging and cumbersome various oil water separation techniques have been applied particularly the very conventional methods like magnetic separation separation with oil absorbing materials centrifugal machine filtration flotation and oil skimmers have proven to be less efficient more expensive necessitate cumbersome instrumentation and post purifications 15 17 in the last decade many membranes based gravity driven and force driven oil water separation techniques have been reported and the major constraint of these methods is the rapid fouling of the membrane surface which drastically reduce the separating efficiency of the system and in recent days there have been a significant research focus on membrane surfaces with selective oil and water wettability 18 20 the oil water separation based on the selective wettability of oil and water on the separating membrane surface has proven to be very simple effective and economical 21 26 the key for developing such membrane surface is to use the surface coating material with suitable chemical composition and appropriate surface roughness to achieve the desired wettability for oil and water phases in order to develop a surface with contrasting wettability for oil and water the surface materials with suitable the interfacial surface energies of oil and water on the surface should be realized for example in the case of the surfaces with characteristic water repulsion and oil affinity superhydrophobic superoleophilic the surface energy of the coating material should be more than the surface tensions of oil 20 30 mn m 1 and at the same time less than that of water 72 mn m 1 also for the above wettability the surface energy of the metallic mesh substrate on which the coating is made should be highly hydrophilic higher than the surface tension of water 21 the second important factor that influences the wettability of the surface is the roughness of the surface and in the case of superhydrophobic superoleophilic surfaces when the oily water comes in contact with the surface the trapped air in the micro nano structured rough surface render low adhesion of water on the solid surface and hence the surface roughness further magnifies the hydrophobicity of the surface this hydrophobicity can be further enhanced by introducing the hierarchical surface roughness by adopting the suitable method of material deposition on the stainless steel mesh membranes it should be noted that the surfaces with this class of in air wettability are bound to have water oleophilicity 21 quite conversely in the case of the surface with characteristic oil repulsion and water affinity superhydrophilic superoleophobic the surface energy of the material should be higher than the surface tension of water and this water drenched surface naturally repels the oil and makes the surface underwater superoleophobic the high hydrophilicity results in the trapping of water in pores of the mesh and repels oil leading the surface to become underwater superoleophobic and this superoleophobicity increases with the increasing hydrophilicity of the surface hence the water attracting and oil repelling surfaces superhydrophilic superoleophobic can be effectively used as water passing oil water separating system which naturally leaves less oil fouling of the surface 25 however in the case of surfaces with superhydrophilic superoleophobic wettability due to the low surface energy the organic pollutants in the oil water mixture can easily attach to the surface to deteriorate the superhydrophilicity of the surface which in turn reduces the performance of oil water separation the major constraint in using the surfaces with former category of wettability superhydrophobic superoleophilic for oil water separation is naturally the rapid oil fouling of the surface however this oil fouling on the surface can be minimized by the selection of right coating materials coating process proper surface engineering and topographic structures 21 the positive attribute of the surfaces with this kind of wettability is that they render high level of stability for oil water separation owing to the fact that the high surface energy of the material prevents the accumulation of organic pollutants that deteriorates the characteristic wettability of the surface the chemical composition of the coated surface which gives the desired interfacial surface energy and the appropriate coating method which introduces the necessary hierarchical roughness to the surface are instrumental in developing the superhydrophobic superoleophilic surfaces there have been many methods of coating like spray coating chemical vapor deposition electrodeposition that has been reported for the fabrication of the superhydrophobic superoleophilic filter membranes 21 the morphology of the coated surface depends on the method of coating which results in desired surface roughness and this is instrumental for imparting superhydrophobic superoleophilic characteristics to the surface of the filter membrane also many surface materials and surface modifications have been reported to achieve the surfaces with superhydrophobic and superoleophilic wetting characteristics for oil water separation 21 26 the fabrication of micro nanostructured hierarchical surface with superhydrophobic and superoleophilic wetting characteristics by spray coating ptfe on stainless steel mesh was reported by feng et al for oil water separation crick et al developed superhydrophobic superoleophilic surfaces on the copper mesh substrate by using more controllable chemical vapor deposition method to coat silicone elastomer another notable work on the development of the surface with this kind of wettability using silicon based material was reported by cao et al by spray coating modified polyurethane and hydrophobic silica nanoparticles on the copper mesh silane containing materials have many advantages for the fabrication of superwettable membrane surfaces for oil water separation owing to their abundance and environmental friendliness in this work we fabricated superhydrophobic superoleophilic membrane surface for oil water separation by single step dip coating of trichloro octadecyl silane tcods on the stainless steel mesh and used this surface as the filtering membrane in the oil water separation system the system equipped with the coated membrane with unique wettability showed a substantial oil water separation performance 99 9 the morphological and structural characterizations and elemental analysis were carried out using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds elemental mapping analysis and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps also the surface wettability of the membrane for both oil and water was carried out by measuring the contact angles to explain the high oil water separation efficiency of the membrane 2 experimental 2 1 materials stainless steel mesh ssm was procured from twp inc usa the

c12h26 99 paraffin oil c15h11clo7 used for this study were procured from sigma aldrich 2 2 fabrication of super hydrophobic and superoleophilic surfaces schematic diagram for the fabrication of tcods coated ssm membrane is shown in fig 1 for the dip coating three different concentrations of silane solution 5 10 and 20 in hexane were prepared at room temperature with magnetic stirrer and they are marked as 5 tcods 10 tcods and 20 tcods prior to dip coating ssm membranes were washed with acetone and deionized di water and dried at 85 c for 4 h the clean ssm was moisturized with di water before dip coating with the tcods solution as the moisture on the membrane surface facilitates the hydrolysis and condensation reactions in order to establish a proper adhesion to the ssm surface the surface was kept in tcods solution for 1 h and subsequently dried under ambient conditions 2 3 characterization techniques a contact angle goniometer kruss germany was used to measure the surface wettability of ssm membranes the fe sem images the eds spectra eds elemental mapping were carried out using field emission scanning electron microscope tescan lyra3 equipped with eds the whole surface of the specimen was scanned and images were captured from different areas and at different magnifications both the coated and uncoated substrates were analyzed to study the effect of coating on the surface morphology x ray photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out using x ray photoelectron spectrometer escalab mk ii vg instruments equipped with aluminum ka monochromator x ray source both survey scan in 0 1600 ev region and high resolution scan for the detected elemental peaks were recorded 2 4 oil water separation system for the evaluation of oil water separation efficiency of tcods coated ssm membrane the gravity driven method was used for the gravity driven system two glass tubes of 2 5 cm diameter and 20 cm long were joined by teflon connecter which can also house the 2 5 cm coated ssm membranes in between the glass tubes the oil water mixture was poured into the upper tube of the assembly which was kept vertical using a lab stand and the permeating oil was collected in a beaker while the water phase retained in the top tube the residual oil content in the filtered water was estimated using thermogravimetry in order to study the robustness and recyclability of the coated membrane same used separating membrane was used for different cycles of oil water separation by pouring new oily water in the feed side in each cycle and tested for surface intactness by measuring the static contact and oil water separation efficiency 3 results and discussions 3 1 wettability of tcods coated surfaces the wettability of a solid surface for any liquid is experimentally quantified with the interfacial contact angles that the liquid makes in the solid liquid interface where larger the contact angle lower the wettability fig 2 a and b respectively shows the goniometric images of water solid air water interface and oil solid air oil interface on the uncoated ssm surface where both water and oil show complete wetting on the ssm surface indicating that the surface is hydrophilic water affinity and oleophilic oil affinity this is because the solid air interfacial energy of the ssm is higher than the solid liquid interfacial energies for both oil and water which makes the contact angles smaller for both water and oil in their respective interfaces according to young s equation 21 the surfaces with such wetting conditions cannot be used for oil water separation as the surface cannot discriminate the oil and water contents in the oil water mixture fig 2 a1 and b1 respectively shows the photographic images corresponding to fig 2 a and b the same wetting behaviors of water solid air water interface and oil solid air oil interface on the tcods coated surface are shown in the goniometric images in fig 2 c and d respectively in this case water on the tcods coated surface beads whereas the oil on the surface show a complete wetting indicating that tcods coating made the surface superhydrophobic water repulsion and superoleophilic oil affinity in this case solid air interfacial energy of tcods coated surface is less than the solid water interfacial energy and higher than the solid oil interfacial energy which makes the water oil contact angle of water larger and that of oil still smaller according to young s equation this contrasting wetting conditions of water and oil on the tcods coated surface is so favorable for oil water separation it was also observed that the hydrophobicity of the of the tcods coated surface increases with the increase of tcods concentration on the ssm membranes which is manifested in the measured static contact angles presented in fig 3 for 5 10 and 20 concentrations of tcods on the ssm membrane surfaces as it is quite obvious in fig 3 that the static contact angles of water on tcods coated surface are ca 134 143 and 152 for 5 tcods 10 tcods and 20 tcods respectively on ssm membrane surfaces it should be noted that only the surface coated with 20 tcods became superhydrophobic as the contact angle is more than 150 the wetting behavior of the tcods coated surface in solid air liquid interface can be can be extrapolated to solid water liquid interface by combining the individual young s equations for water in air oil in air and oil in water as shown in eq 1 which is known as young dupre equation 22 26 1 cos θ ow γ oa cos θ o γ wa cos θ w γ ow this equation depicts oil in water contact angle θ ow in terms of water in air contact angle θ o and oil in air contact angle θ w where γ oa γ wa and γ ow are the oil air water air and oil water interfacial energies according to this equation a surface like plain stainless steel which is hydrophilic γ sa γ sw and oleophilic γ sa γ so in solid air liquid interface can become oleophilic in the solid water oil interface when γ oa cos θ o is less than γ wa cos θ ow and this condition is not favorable on the other hand a surface like tcods coated surface which is hydrophobic γ sa γ sw and oleophilic γ sa γ so in the solid air liquid interface can be oleophilic in the solid water oil interface low θ ow this in air hydrophobic and oleophilic wetting behavior of the tcods coated surface observed from the wettability studies primarily promote this surface suitable membrane for oil water separation as it is evident from the previous section the interfacial surface energies primarily decide the wettability of a surface in different interfaces according to young s equation wenzel modified young s equation by considering the actual roughness of the surface where the liquid medium can fill in the pits of roughness and the effect of which is reflected on the appropriate contact angles as in eq 2 22 26 where r is the roughness parameter ratio between the surface areas of flat surface and the actual rough surface θ young is the contact angle according to the basic young s equation of wetting without considering the surface roughness and θ wenzel is the modified contact angle when the surface roughness is taken into consideration cassie baxter further modified the equation by considering the air pocket filled in the pits of roughness which makes the actual contact between the surface and the liquid and is shown in eq 3 22 26 the factor f 0 f 1 is the fractional surface area and r f is the new surface roughness with water filling in the pits 2 cos θ wenzel r cos θ young 3 cos θ cassie baxter f 1 r f cos θ young 1 hence wenzel equation and cassie baxter equation represent two different equilibrium states of the liquid on the solid surface when the pit size is small liquid hovers on the fractional surface and the pits are filled with air and the surface is in cassie baxter state and when the pits size gets larger water fills in the pits and the surface transforms from cassie baxter to wenzel state it is quite evident that the surface roughness plays a crucial role in deciding the wettability of a surface and hence the study of the morphology of the tcods coated surface is important 3 2 morphological characterization of tcods coated surfaces the fe sem images of uncoated ssm in fig 4 a a1 a2 a3 in different magnifications and even at the very high magnification the surface is quite smooth lack of roughness which lead the surface to be superhydrophilic and superoleophilic in nature fig 4 b b1 b2 b3 c c1 c2 c3 and d d1 d2 d3 shows the fe sem images of different magnification for 5 10 and 20 tcods coated ssm membranes where rose petal like deposition of tcods on ssm membrane surface can be seen in the high resolution picture it is quite evident from the images that the introduction of surface roughness increases with tcods concentration and also the images at different magnifications reveal the micro nano hierarchical surface roughness on the membrane surface this unique surface roughness with trapped air inside the pits of roughness along with the compatible interfacial surface energy γ sa γ sw transformed the surface into superhydrophobic in the cassie baxter state and also this hydrophobicity increases with increased surface roughness as it is clear from the fe sem images for 20 tcods coated ssm membrane and the corresponding contact angle depicted in fig 2 on the other hand tcods coating on the ssm did not bring in any change in the oil wettability and remained superoleophilic on the coated surface in spite of the introduced surface roughness and this is because oil is trapped in the pits of roughness as in the case of wenzel state the elemental analysis of the uncoated and coated ssm membrane surfaces using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds was also carried out in this method the high energy electron beam ejects the electrons in the inner shell of the element and creates an electron vacancy which is instantly filled by the electrons in the higher shells and during this electron transfer the x ray with the characteristic wavelength of the element is emitted fig 5 a and a1 respectively shows the low magnification fe sem image and the corresponding eds spectrum of the uncoated ssm membrane and the elemental detection in fig 5 a1 clearly show the presence of cr fe ni and c which is just the characteristic elemental composition of typical stainless steel mesh fig 5 b c and d respectively shows the low magnification fe sem images of 5 tcods 10 tcods and 20 tcods whose corresponding eds spectra are depicted in fig 5 b1 c1 and d1 from these eds spectra in addition to the cr fe ni the presence of si and c which is the major element present in silane is not only evident but also increases with the increasing silane concentration on the coated surface in addition to single eds analysis on sample surface eds elemental mapping using a series of eds analyses was carried out in a particular area of the sample where each colored point represents the eds intensity of the element under investigation hence these mapping images of the constituent elements give a visible feel of the relative abundance of the elements present in on the surface under study the image set consists of fig 6 a to e is fe sem image and the eds mapping of carbon c chromium cr iron fe and oxygen o respectively on the uncoated ssm membrane surface and similarly the image set consists of fig 6 f to k is the fe sem image and the eds mapping of carbon c chromium cr iron fe oxygen o and silicon si respectively on the 20 tcods coated ssm membrane surface the emergence of silicon and the increased level of carbon in the latter set of images are clearly from tcods coating which substantiate the strong adhesion of tcods on the ssm membrane surface which is instrumental for bringing about the desired wettability of the oil water separating membrane surface 3 3 surface analysis using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy in addition to the electron based elemental analysis described in the previous section x ray photoelectron spectroscopy was also carried out for surface elemental analysis and the xps survey scan of 5 tcods 10 tcods and 20 tcods coated surfaces are shown in fig 7 where the presence of the peaks of oxygen o carbon c and silicon si from the tcods surface material can be seen in order to assign the chemical environments of the detected elements according to the small variations in binding energies of the xps spectra c o and si peaks for 5 tcods 10 tcods and 20 tcods surfaces were deconvoluted and are shown if fig 8 c 1s in fig 8 a a1 and a2 has two component peaks with binding energies at 284 8 ev and 282 7 ev which are respectively assigned to sp3 hybridized carbon and the carbon in csi bond the relative intensity of the c 1s in csi bond increases with the increasing concentration of tcods on the ssm membrane surface which indicate the change of chemical environment with coating on the other hand as it is clear from fig 8 b b1 b2 c c1 and c2 o 1s peak and si 2p peak show only one component peak irrespective of the concentration of tcods on ssm membrane surface of at the binding energies of 530 8 ev and 101 5 ev respectively 3 4 evaluation of oil water separation efficiency as it is quite clear from the earlier section that all the tcods coated ssm membranes in general showed in air superhydrophobic and superoleophilic wetting characteristics particularly the contact angles for water and oil in air for 20 tcods coated ssm membrane surface are 152 and 0 respectively with these in air wetting characteristics of oil and water the surface is expected to show a strong under water oil affinity according to young dupre equation and all these wetting characteristics are amplified by the favorable surface roughness as dictated by wenzel and cassie baxter theories having established this kind of wettability we used this tcods coated ssm membranes as the separating medium for the gravity driven oil water separating system when the oily water touches the membrane the water is repelled by the surface due to superhydrophobicity and at the same time the oil in the water is attracted toward the surface due to underwater superoleophilicity and this let the oil permeate through the membrane surface while keeping water above the membrane it should be noted that when the oily water is poured into the oil water separation system with uncoated ssm membrane as expected both oil and water phases permeated through the membrane due to the superoleophilicity and superhydrophilicity of the uncoated surface as shown in fig 2 which indicates that the uncoated ssm membrane alone in not capable of carrying out oil water separation for this study 40 ml of oil water mixture taken in 1 1 volume ratio was used and for the visual examination the oil and water are colored with red and blue dye as in fig 9 the photograph in fig 9 a shows the permeation of both oil and water phases through the uncoated ssm membrane in the oil water separation system whereas fig 9 b clearly show the permeation of the oil phase and the retention of water phase through the 20 tcods coated ssm membrane in the oil water separation system when tcod coated ss membrane is used as a filtering medium the passage of oil medium is so fast that we cannot normally have the chance to retain both the phases in the inlet or feed side unless we put a stopper hence fig 9 b depicts only the two separated phases water in the feed side and oil in the collection side with the coated membrane contrary to the one depicted in fig 9 a where both oil and water phases pass through the uncoated stainless steel mesh fig 10 a shows the oil water separation efficiency of five different oils hexadecane dodecane octane olive oil and paraffin oil quantified using eq 4 22 26 where co and cp are the oil contents in water before and after carrying out the separation process the densities and the viscosities of the above oils used in this work are listed in table s1 in the supplementary section it should be noted that all the data presented in fig 10 is using 20 tcods coated ssm membrane 4 separation efficiency 1 c p c o 100 after the oil medium passed out of the separating membrane the water retained in the feed side still has some residual oil content in order to find cp which is the oil content in the retained water was measured using thermogravimetry and from this measurement the separation efficiency was estimated it is quite clear from fig 10 a that for all the five oils under study the separation efficiency of 99 was estimated which can be attributed to simultaneous superhydrophobic and superoleophilic wettability of the membrane combined with the interfacial energies of tcods coated ssm membrane with oil and water and also the required surface roughness introduced by the dip coating the coating materials and methods the resulting surface wettability contact angle and the oil water separation efficiency of some of the earlier works are compared and listed in table 1 27 31 and from this table it is quite clear that our tcods coated ssm membrane recorded a considerable enhancement of oil water separation efficiency 99 unlike in the case of water passing oil water separating membrane oil passing membrane is expected to be fouled by the oil when the oil permeates through the membrane surface which is expected to deteriorate the separating efficiencies of subsequent oil water separation in order to study the possible fouling of oil on the membrane surface and consequent decline of oil water separating efficiency we carried out the repeatability test for the membrane the oil water separation efficiency was estimated for each cycle of separation and fig 10 b shows the oil water separation efficiency for 10 such repeated cycles where the separation efficiency remains constant in all 10 cycles of filtration from fig 10 b it is quite clear that the surface retains its characteristic wettability and mechanical robustness and also the surface resists the fouling up of oil in spite of ten cycles of filtration moreover the oil water separation efficiency under harsh experimental conditions such as acidic alkaline basic and in extreme ph conditions different acidic and basic conditions have been carried out figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary and it was noticed that under harsh experimental conditions the oil water separation efficiency remains the same which indicates that wettability of the surface is quite intact under these conditions also the oil fouling and the level of adhesion on the coated surface are characterized by the photographic images of the time evolution of an oil droplet on the coated surface as shown in fig s3 as it is quite clear from the images that within 1 s the oil is completed depleted off the surface and this indicates that the coated surface to certain extent resists the oil fouling and adhesion the pure oil passing and pure water passing nature of the membrane depends of the in air contact angles on the membrane surface of oil and water and also the surface energies of oil and water in the case of in air superhydrophobic surface the intrusion pressure is positive and hence the water is prevented from passing as in fig 11 a and in the case of in air superoleophilic surface the intrusion pressure in the oil air interface becomes negative and hence water is allowed to pass as in fig 11 b in our case the more relevant is the permeability of oil in oil water interface where the passing of oil through the separating membrane is dictated by the hydrostatic pressure difference of oil and water in oil water interface which in turn depends on the pore size of the membrane oil in water contact angle and oil water interfacial energy governed by young laplace eq 5 19 21 where δp is the hydrostatic pressure θ ow is oil in water contact angle and γ ow is oil in water interfacial energy 5 δ p 2 γ ow cos θ ow d when the wettability of the surface as in the case of tcods coated ssm membrane surface is superhydrophobic and superoleophilic in air the surface is expected to exhibit superoleophilicity under the water θ ow 90 according to young dupre equation which makes δp in eq 5 to become negative under the negative δp the hydrostatic pressure of oil is more than that of water which facilitates the passage of oil through the membrane as in fig 11 c fig 11 d show the general schematic of oil water separation using 20 tcod coated ssm membrane 4 conclusion membrane surface exhibiting unique wettability of in air superhydrophobicity in air superoleophilicity and under water superoleophilicity was fabricated by depositing three different concentrations of commercially procured trichloro octadecyl silane on the microporous stainless steel mesh membranes by simple dip coating the contact angles of the surface in solid air water and solid air oil interfaces were measured and are 152 and 0 respectively the morphological characterization along with the elemental analysis of the coated surfaces carried out and this revealed that the dip coating of trichloro octadecyl silane on the stainless steel mesh membrane surface brought about the favorable hierarchical surface roughness that amplified the above wettability of the surface according to cassie baxter wetting theory this trichloro octadecyl silane coated stainless steel mesh membrane was applied for the gravity driven oil passing oil water separating system a remarkable separation efficiency 99 in a single pass was achieved also it was found that the coated membrane surface was so robust and retained its unique wettability even after multiple cycles of use declaration of

13197,oil water separating membranes exhibiting contrasting wetting characteristics for oil and water superhydrophobicity and superoleophility were fabricated by dip coating different concentrations 5 10 and 20 of trichloro octadecyl silane on the micro porous stainless steel mesh the static contact angles of the fabricated surface in solid air water and solid air oil interfaces are found to be 152 and 0 respectively when trichloro octadecyl silane coated stainless steel membrane was used as a separating medium in the gravity driven oil water separating system 99 oil water separating efficiency was achieved in a single pass and in addition to this the fabricated membrane retained its wetting characteristics and oil water separating efficiency even after 10 consecutive passes of oily water through the membrane when the oily water comes in contact with the surface of the separating membrane the water solid interface gets into cassie baxter wetting state where the air in the micro nano structured pits renders low affinity of water on the membrane surface whereas the surface roughness enhances the affinity of oil on the solid surface and hence the coated surface attracts the oil phase to the pore boundaries of the mesh and at the same time pushes the water phase to the top the morphological characteristics and the elemental composition with fe sem eds elemental mapping and xps characterizations and the surface wettability of the coated membrane by measuring the interfacial contact angles were also carried out graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords oil water separation surface engineering superhydrophobic surface superoleophilic surface cassie baxter wetting 1 introduction the ever growing industrialization and the excessive dependence on the fossil fuels create many avenues for the accidental and intentional mixing of oil and water and this reckless human activity particularly from the petrochemical industries has been a cause of great environmental concern every day an enormous quantity of produced water which is the byproduct of the oil excavation is generated from the ageing oil wells as the ageing wells necessitates the injection of a large amount of water to extract more quantity of oil and if this produced water is left untreated and discarded in water bodies it ends up not only in the wastage of a huge quantity of water but also have a catastrophic effect on our environment 1 4 another major source of oil water mixing is from the accidental and intentional leaking of oil and oil waste into the sea from oil cargo ships oil wells and rigs which also wreak havoc to the marine eco system 5 12 with growing awareness of environmental repercussions and the stringent national and international environmental legislations the need for purifying the oily water is more demanding than ever 12 14 since the separation of oily water is technologically very challenging and cumbersome various oil water separation techniques have been applied particularly the very conventional methods like magnetic separation separation with oil absorbing materials centrifugal machine filtration flotation and oil skimmers have proven to be less efficient more expensive necessitate cumbersome instrumentation and post purifications 15 17 in the last decade many membranes based gravity driven and force driven oil water separation techniques have been reported and the major constraint of these methods is the rapid fouling of the membrane surface which drastically reduce the separating efficiency of the system and in recent days there have been a significant research focus on membrane surfaces with selective oil and water wettability 18 20 the oil water separation based on the selective wettability of oil and water on the separating membrane surface has proven to be very simple effective and economical 21 26 the key for developing such membrane surface is to use the surface coating material with suitable chemical composition and appropriate surface roughness to achieve the desired wettability for oil and water phases in order to develop a surface with contrasting wettability for oil and water the surface materials with suitable the interfacial surface energies of oil and water on the surface should be realized for example in the case of the surfaces with characteristic water repulsion and oil affinity superhydrophobic superoleophilic the surface energy of the coating material should be more than the surface tensions of oil 20 30 mn m 1 and at the same time less than that of water 72 mn m 1 also for the above wettability the surface energy of the metallic mesh substrate on which the coating is made should be highly hydrophilic higher than the surface tension of water 21 the second important factor that influences the wettability of the surface is the roughness of the surface and in the case of superhydrophobic superoleophilic surfaces when the oily water comes in contact with the surface the trapped air in the micro nano structured rough surface render low adhesion of water on the solid surface and hence the surface roughness further magnifies the hydrophobicity of the surface this hydrophobicity can be further enhanced by introducing the hierarchical surface roughness by adopting the suitable method of material deposition on the stainless steel mesh membranes it should be noted that the surfaces with this class of in air wettability are bound to have water oleophilicity 21 quite conversely in the case of the surface with characteristic oil repulsion and water affinity superhydrophilic superoleophobic the surface energy of the material should be higher than the surface tension of water and this water drenched surface naturally repels the oil and makes the surface underwater superoleophobic the high hydrophilicity results in the trapping of water in pores of the mesh and repels oil leading the surface to become underwater superoleophobic and this superoleophobicity increases with the increasing hydrophilicity of the surface hence the water attracting and oil repelling surfaces superhydrophilic superoleophobic can be effectively used as water passing oil water separating system which naturally leaves less oil fouling of the surface 25 however in the case of surfaces with superhydrophilic superoleophobic wettability due to the low surface energy the organic pollutants in the oil water mixture can easily attach to the surface to deteriorate the superhydrophilicity of the surface which in turn reduces the performance of oil water separation the major constraint in using the surfaces with former category of wettability superhydrophobic superoleophilic for oil water separation is naturally the rapid oil fouling of the surface however this oil fouling on the surface can be minimized by the selection of right coating materials coating process proper surface engineering and topographic structures 21 the positive attribute of the surfaces with this kind of wettability is that they render high level of stability for oil water separation owing to the fact that the high surface energy of the material prevents the accumulation of organic pollutants that deteriorates the characteristic wettability of the surface the chemical composition of the coated surface which gives the desired interfacial surface energy and the appropriate coating method which introduces the necessary hierarchical roughness to the surface are instrumental in developing the superhydrophobic superoleophilic surfaces there have been many methods of coating like spray coating chemical vapor deposition electrodeposition that has been reported for the fabrication of the superhydrophobic superoleophilic filter membranes 21 the morphology of the coated surface depends on the method of coating which results in desired surface roughness and this is instrumental for imparting superhydrophobic superoleophilic characteristics to the surface of the filter membrane also many surface materials and surface modifications have been reported to achieve the surfaces with superhydrophobic and superoleophilic wetting characteristics for oil water separation 21 26 the fabrication of micro nanostructured hierarchical surface with superhydrophobic and superoleophilic wetting characteristics by spray coating ptfe on stainless steel mesh was reported by feng et al for oil water separation crick et al developed superhydrophobic superoleophilic surfaces on the copper mesh substrate by using more controllable chemical vapor deposition method to coat silicone elastomer another notable work on the development of the surface with this kind of wettability using silicon based material was reported by cao et al by spray coating modified polyurethane and hydrophobic silica nanoparticles on the copper mesh silane containing materials have many advantages for the fabrication of superwettable membrane surfaces for oil water separation owing to their abundance and environmental friendliness in this work we fabricated superhydrophobic superoleophilic membrane surface for oil water separation by single step dip coating of trichloro octadecyl silane tcods on the stainless steel mesh and used this surface as the filtering membrane in the oil water separation system the system equipped with the coated membrane with unique

0 1600 ev region and high resolution scan for the detected elemental peaks were recorded 2 4 oil water separation system for the evaluation of oil water separation efficiency of tcods coated ssm membrane the gravity driven method was used for the gravity driven system two glass tubes of 2 5 cm diameter and 20 cm long were joined by teflon connecter which can also house the 2 5 cm coated ssm membranes in between the glass tubes the oil water mixture was poured into the upper tube of the assembly which was kept vertical using a lab stand and the permeating oil was collected in a beaker while the water phase retained in the top tube the residual oil content in the filtered water was estimated using thermogravimetry in order to study the robustness and recyclability of the coated membrane same used separating membrane was used for different cycles of oil water separation by pouring new oily water in the feed side in each cycle and tested for surface intactness by measuring the static contact and oil water separation efficiency 3 results and discussions 3 1 wettability of tcods coated surfaces the wettability of a solid surface for any liquid is experimentally quantified with the interfacial contact angles that the liquid makes in the solid liquid interface where larger the contact angle lower the wettability fig 2 a and b respectively shows the goniometric images of water solid air water interface and oil solid air oil interface on the uncoated ssm surface where both water and oil show complete wetting on the ssm surface indicating that the surface is hydrophilic water affinity and oleophilic oil affinity this is because the solid air interfacial energy of the ssm is higher than the solid liquid interfacial energies for both oil and water which makes the contact angles smaller for both water and oil in their respective interfaces according to young s equation 21 the surfaces with such wetting conditions cannot be used for oil water separation as the surface cannot discriminate the oil and water contents in the oil water mixture fig 2 a1 and b1 respectively shows the photographic images corresponding to fig 2 a and b the same wetting behaviors of water solid air water interface and oil solid air oil interface on the tcods coated surface are shown in the goniometric images in fig 2 c and d respectively in this case water on the tcods coated surface beads whereas the oil on the surface show a complete wetting indicating that tcods coating made the surface superhydrophobic water repulsion and superoleophilic oil affinity in this case solid air interfacial energy of tcods coated surface is less than the solid water interfacial energy and higher than the solid oil interfacial energy which makes the water oil contact angle of water larger and that of oil still smaller according to young s equation this contrasting wetting conditions of water and oil on the tcods coated surface is so favorable for oil water separation it was also observed that the hydrophobicity of the of the tcods coated surface increases with the increase of tcods concentration on the ssm membranes which is manifested in the measured static contact angles presented in fig 3 for 5 10 and 20 concentrations of tcods on the ssm membrane surfaces as it is quite obvious in fig 3 that the static contact angles of water on tcods coated surface are ca 134 143 and 152 for 5 tcods 10 tcods and 20 tcods respectively on ssm membrane surfaces it should be noted that only the surface coated with 20 tcods became superhydrophobic as the contact angle is more than 150 the wetting behavior of the tcods coated surface in solid air liquid interface can be can be extrapolated to solid water liquid interface by combining the individual young s equations for water in air oil in air and oil in water as shown in eq 1 which is known as young dupre equation 22 26 1 cos θ ow γ oa cos θ o γ wa cos θ w γ ow this equation depicts oil in water contact angle θ ow in terms of water in air contact angle θ o and oil in air contact angle θ w where γ oa γ wa and γ ow are the oil air water air and oil water interfacial energies according to this equation a surface like plain stainless steel which is hydrophilic γ sa γ sw and oleophilic γ sa γ so in solid air liquid interface can become oleophilic in the solid water oil interface when γ oa cos θ o is less than γ wa cos θ ow and this condition is not favorable on the other hand a surface like tcods coated surface which is hydrophobic γ sa γ sw and oleophilic γ sa γ so in the solid air liquid interface can be oleophilic in the solid water oil interface low θ ow this in air hydrophobic and oleophilic wetting behavior of the tcods coated surface observed from the wettability studies primarily promote this surface suitable membrane for oil water separation as it is evident from the previous section the interfacial surface energies primarily decide the wettability of a surface in different interfaces according to young s equation wenzel modified young s equation by considering the actual roughness of the surface where the liquid medium can fill in the pits of roughness and the effect of which is reflected on the appropriate contact angles as in eq 2 22 26 where r is the roughness parameter ratio between the surface areas of flat surface and the actual rough surface θ young is the contact angle according to the basic young s equation of wetting without considering the surface roughness and θ wenzel is the modified contact angle when the surface roughness is taken into consideration cassie baxter further modified the equation by considering the air pocket filled in the pits of roughness which makes the actual contact between the surface and the liquid and is shown in eq 3 22 26 the factor f 0 f 1 is the fractional surface area and r f is the new surface roughness with water filling in the pits 2 cos θ wenzel r cos θ young 3 cos θ cassie baxter f 1 r f cos θ young 1 hence wenzel equation and cassie baxter equation represent two different equilibrium states of the liquid on the solid surface when the pit size is small liquid hovers on the fractional surface and the pits are filled with air and the surface is in cassie baxter state and when the pits size gets larger water fills in the pits and the surface transforms from cassie baxter to wenzel state it is quite evident that the surface roughness plays a crucial role in deciding the wettability of a surface and hence the study of the morphology of the tcods coated surface is important 3 2 morphological characterization of tcods coated surfaces the fe sem images of uncoated ssm in fig 4 a a1 a2 a3 in different magnifications and even at the very high magnification the surface is quite smooth lack of roughness which lead the surface to be superhydrophilic and superoleophilic in nature fig 4 b b1 b2 b3 c c1 c2 c3 and d d1 d2 d3 shows the fe sem images of different magnification for 5 10 and 20 tcods coated ssm membranes where rose petal like deposition of tcods on ssm membrane surface can be seen in the high resolution picture it is quite evident from the images that the introduction of surface roughness increases with tcods concentration and also the images at different magnifications reveal the micro nano hierarchical surface roughness on the membrane surface this unique surface roughness with trapped air inside the pits of roughness along with the compatible interfacial surface energy γ sa γ sw transformed the surface into superhydrophobic in the cassie baxter state and also this hydrophobicity increases with increased surface roughness as it is clear from the fe sem images for 20 tcods coated ssm membrane and the corresponding contact angle depicted in fig 2 on the other hand tcods coating on the ssm did not bring in any change in the oil wettability and remained superoleophilic on the coated surface in spite of the introduced surface roughness and this is because oil is trapped in the pits of roughness as in the case of wenzel state the elemental analysis of the uncoated and coated ssm membrane surfaces using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds was also carried out in this method the high energy electron beam ejects the electrons in the inner shell of the element and creates an electron vacancy which is instantly filled by the electrons in the higher shells and during this electron transfer the x ray with the characteristic wavelength of the element is emitted fig 5 a and a1 respectively shows the low magnification fe sem image and the corresponding eds spectrum of the uncoated ssm membrane and the elemental detection in fig 5 a1 clearly show the presence of cr fe ni and c which is just the characteristic elemental composition of typical stainless steel mesh fig 5 b c and d respectively shows the low magnification fe sem images of 5 tcods 10 tcods and 20 tcods whose corresponding eds spectra are depicted in fig 5 b1 c1 and d1 from these eds spectra in addition to the cr fe ni the presence of si and c which is the major element present in silane is not only evident but also increases with the increasing silane concentration on the coated surface in addition to single eds analysis on sample surface eds elemental mapping using a series of eds analyses was carried out in a particular area of the sample where each colored point represents the eds intensity of the element under investigation hence these mapping images of the constituent elements give a visible feel of the relative abundance of the elements present in on the surface under study the image set consists of fig 6 a to e is fe sem image and the eds mapping of carbon c chromium cr iron fe and oxygen o respectively on the uncoated ssm membrane surface and similarly the image set consists of fig 6 f to k is the fe sem image and the eds mapping of carbon c chromium cr iron fe oxygen o and silicon si respectively on the 20 tcods coated ssm membrane surface the emergence of silicon and the increased level of carbon in the latter set of images are clearly from tcods coating which substantiate the strong adhesion of tcods on the ssm membrane surface which is instrumental for bringing about the desired wettability of the oil water separating membrane surface 3 3 surface analysis using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy in addition to the electron based elemental analysis described in the previous section x ray photoelectron spectroscopy was also carried out for surface elemental analysis and the xps survey scan of 5 tcods 10 tcods and 20 tcods coated surfaces are shown in fig 7 where the presence of the peaks of oxygen o carbon c and silicon si from the tcods surface material can be seen in order to assign the chemical environments of the detected elements according to the small variations in binding energies of the xps spectra c o and si peaks for 5 tcods 10 tcods and 20 tcods surfaces were deconvoluted and are shown if fig 8 c 1s in fig 8 a a1 and a2 has two component peaks with binding energies at 284 8 ev and 282 7 ev which are respectively assigned to sp3 hybridized carbon and the carbon in csi bond the relative intensity of the c 1s in csi bond increases with the increasing concentration of tcods on the ssm membrane surface which indicate the change of chemical environment with coating on the other hand as it is clear from fig 8 b b1 b2 c c1 and c2 o 1s peak and si 2p peak show only one component peak irrespective of the concentration of tcods on ssm membrane surface of at the binding energies of 530 8 ev and 101 5 ev respectively 3 4 evaluation of oil water separation efficiency as it is quite clear from the earlier section that all the tcods coated ssm membranes in general showed in air superhydrophobic and superoleophilic wetting characteristics particularly the contact angles for water and oil in air for 20 tcods coated ssm membrane surface are 152 and 0 respectively with these in air wetting characteristics of oil and water the surface is expected to show a strong under water oil affinity according to young dupre equation and all these wetting characteristics are amplified by the favorable surface roughness as dictated by wenzel and cassie baxter theories having established this kind of wettability we used this tcods coated ssm membranes as the separating medium for the gravity driven oil water separating system when the oily water touches the membrane the water is repelled by the surface due to superhydrophobicity and at the same time the oil in the water is attracted toward the surface due to underwater superoleophilicity and this let the oil permeate through the membrane surface while keeping water above the membrane it should be noted that when the oily water is poured into the oil water separation system with uncoated ssm membrane as expected both oil and water phases permeated through the membrane due to the superoleophilicity and superhydrophilicity of the uncoated surface as shown in fig 2 which indicates that the uncoated ssm membrane alone in not capable of carrying out oil water separation for this study 40 ml of oil water mixture taken in 1 1 volume ratio was used and for the visual examination the oil and water are colored with red and blue dye as in fig 9 the photograph in fig 9 a shows the permeation of both oil and water phases through the uncoated ssm membrane in the oil water separation system whereas fig 9 b clearly show the permeation of the oil phase and the retention of water phase through the 20 tcods coated ssm membrane in the oil water separation system when tcod coated ss membrane is used as a filtering medium the passage of oil medium is so fast that we cannot normally have the chance to retain both the phases in the inlet or feed side unless we put a stopper hence fig 9 b depicts only the two separated phases water in the feed side and oil in the collection side with the coated membrane contrary to the one depicted in fig 9 a where both oil and water phases pass through the uncoated stainless steel mesh fig 10 a shows the oil water separation efficiency of five different oils hexadecane dodecane octane olive oil and paraffin oil quantified using eq 4 22 26 where co and cp are the oil contents in water before and after carrying out the separation process the densities and the viscosities of the above oils used in this work are listed in table s1 in the supplementary section it should be noted that all the data presented in fig 10 is using 20 tcods coated ssm membrane 4 separation efficiency 1 c p c o 100 after the oil medium passed out of the separating membrane the water retained in the feed side still has some residual oil content in order to find cp which is the oil content in the retained water was measured using thermogravimetry and from this measurement the separation efficiency was estimated it is quite clear from fig 10 a that for all the five oils under study the separation efficiency of 99 was estimated which can be attributed to simultaneous superhydrophobic and superoleophilic wettability of the membrane combined with the interfacial energies of tcods coated ssm membrane with oil and water and also the required surface roughness introduced by the dip coating the coating materials and methods the resulting surface wettability contact angle and the oil water separation efficiency of some of the earlier works are compared and listed in table 1 27 31 and from this table it is quite clear that our tcods coated ssm membrane recorded a considerable enhancement of oil water separation efficiency 99 unlike in the case of water passing oil water separating membrane oil passing membrane is expected to be fouled by the oil when the oil permeates through the membrane surface which is expected to deteriorate the separating efficiencies of subsequent oil water separation in order to study the possible fouling of oil on the membrane surface and consequent decline of oil water separating efficiency we carried out the repeatability test for the membrane the oil water separation efficiency was estimated for each cycle of separation and fig 10 b shows the oil water separation efficiency for 10 such repeated cycles where the separation efficiency remains constant in all 10 cycles of filtration from fig 10 b it is quite clear that the surface retains its characteristic wettability and mechanical robustness and also the surface resists the fouling up of oil in spite of ten cycles of filtration moreover the oil water separation efficiency under harsh experimental conditions such as acidic alkaline basic and in extreme ph conditions different acidic and basic conditions have been carried out figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary and it was noticed that under harsh experimental conditions the oil water separation efficiency remains the same which indicates that wettability of the surface is quite intact under these conditions also the oil fouling and the level of adhesion on the coated surface are characterized by the photographic images of the time evolution of an oil droplet on the coated surface as shown in fig s3 as it is quite clear from the images that within 1 s the oil is completed depleted off the surface and this indicates that the coated surface to certain extent resists the oil fouling and adhesion the pure oil passing and pure water passing nature of the membrane depends of the in air contact angles on the membrane surface of oil and water and also the surface energies of oil and water in the case of in air superhydrophobic surface the intrusion pressure is positive and hence the water is prevented from passing as in fig 11 a and in the case of in air superoleophilic surface the intrusion pressure in the oil air interface becomes negative and hence water is allowed to pass as in fig 11 b in our case the more relevant is the permeability of oil in oil water interface where the passing of oil through the separating membrane is dictated by the hydrostatic pressure difference of oil and water in oil water interface which in turn depends on the pore size of the membrane oil in water contact angle and oil water interfacial energy governed by young laplace eq 5 19 21 where δp is the hydrostatic pressure θ ow is oil in water contact angle and γ ow is oil in water interfacial energy 5 δ p 2 γ ow cos θ ow d when the wettability of the surface as in the case of tcods coated ssm membrane surface is superhydrophobic and superoleophilic in air the surface is expected to exhibit superoleophilicity under the water θ ow 90 according to young dupre equation which makes δp in eq 5 to become negative under the negative δp the hydrostatic pressure of oil is more than that of water which facilitates the passage of oil through the membrane as in fig 11 c fig 11 d show the general schematic of oil water separation using 20 tcod coated ssm membrane 4 conclusion membrane surface exhibiting unique wettability of in air superhydrophobicity in air superoleophilicity and under water superoleophilicity was fabricated by depositing three different concentrations of commercially procured trichloro octadecyl silane on the microporous stainless steel mesh membranes by simple dip coating the contact angles of the surface in solid air water and solid air oil interfaces were measured and are 152 and 0 respectively the morphological characterization along with the elemental analysis of the coated surfaces carried out and this revealed that the dip coating of trichloro octadecyl silane on the stainless steel mesh membrane surface brought about the favorable hierarchical surface roughness that amplified the above wettability of the surface according to cassie baxter wetting theory this trichloro octadecyl silane coated stainless steel mesh membrane was applied for the gravity driven oil passing oil water separating system a remarkable separation efficiency 99 in a single pass was achieved also it was found that the coated membrane surface was so robust and retained its unique wettability even after multiple cycles of use declaration of

remove these pollutants from aqueous solutions such as ion exchange redox membrane filtration chemical deposition and adsorption using various materials 2 adsorption materials have attracted tremendous attention due to their effectiveness ease of fabrication and use 3 the adsorption method of purifying water relies mainly on the adsorbent to adsorb the impurities in the water using numerous materials for water purification from different impurities because of its good processing effect less secondary pollution to the environment and low cost 4 the adsorption method relies on

aerogel from different materials 5 aerogels are obtained by removing the pore fluid from a gel without changing the material s structural integrity resulting in ultralight weight and high porous material the porosity of aerogels is an essential parameter that highly affects its functionality numerous factors such as the precursor material its concentration the cross linkers drying method and other additives greatly impact the porosity and pore size of the aerogel 6 7 although many aerogels already exist the authors are convinced that a lot more new aerogel types will be discovered in the following years especially in their use in polluted water treatment 8 many other hybrid material aerogels combinations are yet to be discovered the interest in aerogels just kept growing as indicated by the number of publications each year fig 1a many aerogels composites can be produced with modifying properties by adding new functional material for water treatment and other applications the effectiveness of modified aerogel in polluted water treatment applications has motivated scientists to continuously develop novel aerogel as presented in fig 1b the past few years have witnessed great

mesoporous solid foam composed of a network of interconnected nanostructures and exhibits a porosity non solid volume of no less than 50 16 the term mesoporous refers to a material that contains pores ranging from 2 to 50 nm in diameter thus nanostructured aerogels are the types of aerogels that have nano pores and possess superior properties such as the extremely high surface to volume ratio in addition to the unique surface properties creating a variety of new advanced functionalities 17 nano aerogel materials are characterized by pore diameter between 2 and 50 nm ultralow material density high porosity and surface area 18 as discussed in the following subsections these materials have been extensively developed since their discovery in their precursor material s fabrication methods and modification techniques to enhance their functionalities 2 1 chronological development of aerogels the chronological order of aerogel development started since its discovery back in 1931 by samuel stephens kistler who prepared water glass aerogel by using sodium silicate as precursor materials to form silica gel which then heated in an autoclave above the critical temperature and pressures 19 this technique later became known as supercritical drying kistler continued developing the aerogels by various synthetizing aerogels from other materials including metal oxides organic materials and even polymers 20 21 kistler also patented a novel approach for developing his initial silica aerogel to hydrophobic silica aerogels by using trichloro methyl silane water repellent for the silylation 22 in 1959 the first fabrication of hydrophobic aerogels was made from metal oxides and some organic compounds by the silylation of precursors with trichloro methyl silane this has opened more research on the application of aerogel in water treatment many researchers started the investigation of utilizing such material as adsorbent of filter which even enhanced after teichner and nicoloan developed kistler approach to a unique technique by replacing the water glass with tetramethyl orthosilicate tmos which was significantly easier to be removed during the drying phase 22 in 1972 alumina aerogels were experimented with adsorption of nitrogen and carbon tetrachloride by aerogels the aerogel was strongly micro porous with excellent adsorption ability 23 a few years later numerous organic materials were utilized in aerogel production including biomasses and biopolymers which had advanced properties such as high porosity ultra light density and high surface area 24 26 the end of the previous century witnessed rapid supercritical drying which significantly improved aerogel production as a fast low cost route compared with the previous one 27 activated carbon aerogels were prepared for the first time in 1996 from organic polymers by co2 activation of carbon aerogels and it was also investigated for its adsorption ability 28 since then aerogel have been fabricated from numerous of precursor materials fig 2 presents a summary for the basic events of aerogel development and its utilization for various environmental applications 2 2 types of aerogel functional materials many materials have been used in a pure state or combined with other cross linkers to fabricate aerogels each material s physical chemical mechanical and biological properties eventually determine the prospected aerogel properties the precursor materials of aerogels can be classified into five basic types biomass aerogels inorganic carbon aerogels polymeric aerogels silica aerogels metal oxides aerogels and other aerogels 2 2 1 biomass and organic polymer based aerogels biomass refers to natural organic material that derives from living organisms including plants animals or microorganisms biomass is the most abundant and cost effective precursor material that has been utilized in aerogel synthesis for different applications 29 these novel precursors including cellulose 30 chitin 31 chitosan 32 lignin 33 tannin 34 alginates 35 and biomass waste 36 provide hopeful applications in variety of polluted water treatment applications fig 3 presents a summary of these biomass aerogels cellulose is one of the most utilized biopolymers in aerogel fabrication it has been combined with numerous organic and inorganic materials to enhance its properties 37 li et al 38 fabricated cellulose based ternary doped n s and fe aerogels from the cocoon as precursor materials and reported that the aerogel had bet surface area of 714 14 m2 g compared with chitosan based aerogel obtained by garcia et al 39 the latter reported a specific surface area of 350 m2 g for chitosan aerogels however the same authors prepared alginate chitosan aerogel composites and obtained a higher specific surface area owing to the nano sized pores and micro pore volume of their aerogel the surface area of the aerogel was significantly increased eco friendly and multi functional sodium alginate incorporated with tannic acid aerogel was prepared for emulsion separation by a freeze drying approach 40 the aerogel possesses high porosity and rough microstructure strong super hydrophilicity anti crude oil fouling performance underwater super oleophobicity and self cleaning effect the authors reported excellent performance for this aerogel to separate oil in water emulsion the improved mechanical strength stable wettability even at different chemical environments and good adsorption properties for oil and dyes enable this aerogel to serve as a polluted water treatment functional material biomass based aerogels are characterized by high porosity ultra light density high surface area biodegradability renewability and biocompatibility making these aerogels the perfect choice for many applications 41 43 2 2 2 inorganic carbon based aerogels inorganic carbon based aerogels are composed mainly of carbon allotropes including amorphous carbon carbon nanotubes diamond graphite and graphene 44 depending on the type of allotropes carbon based aerogel will exhibit different properties however most carbon aerogels have the typical properties of aerogels such as high porosity large surface area and low density 45 moreover they also possess excellent mechanical properties compared with the aerogel obtained from other materials consequently they have enjoyed steady growth in research interest since their invention in the early 1990s 46 graphene nanostructured aerogels are one of the most used aerogels in polluted water treatment applications which attracted tremendous attention due to their high absorption capacity excellent physicochemical and mechanical properties including the extremely large surface area elastically and reversibly deformable the higher porosity than regular aerogel more than 99 chemical stability in acid and basic conditions in addition to the low bulk density 47 48 different techniques have been used in the fabrication of graphene based aerogels to improve the adsorption capacity and general properties graphite is a material composed of stacked graphene sheets on top of each other with an extremely tiny interlayer distance 49 graphene layers are extremely strong material with ultimate tensile strength and young s modulus of 130 gpa and 1 tpa respectively 49 due to these strong mechanical properties graphene and graphite based aerogels can be ideal for numerous functionalities including in water treatment applications carbon nanotubes are unique tubular structures of nanometer diameter and large length diameter ratio 50 however graphene is yet another novel nano material with a 2d honeycomb lattice of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms 51 there are numerous properties for all carbon allotropes including cnts and graphene which take full advantage of their unique properties of aspect ratio mechanical strength electrical and thermal conductivity cnts graphene hybrid aerogel is one of the most effective absorbance hybrid aerogels it has been used in the adsorption of hazardous organic pollutants 52 high performance heavy metal ions removal 53 water soluble toxic pollutants as well as noxious greenhouse gases 54 55 2 2 3 inorganic polymer based aerogels various inorganic polymers have been utilized in aerogel fabrication a novel aerogel composite from phenolic resin and silicon was developed with significantly enhanced thermal mechanical and ablative properties 56 the novel composite exhibited high compressive strength due to phenolic resin ultra low density and thermal conductivity 56 similarly polyimide based aerogels have been applied to high thermal and acoustic insulation due to their thermal stability and strength 42 polyimide aerogel has been produced by crosslinking aromatic triamine with anhydride capped polyamic acid oligomers in a solution followed by chemically imidizing to form polyimide gel 57 the subsequent polyimides gel was then dried using supercritical carbon dioxide to form polyimide aerogels with a low density of 0 14g cm3 and high surface areas 512 m2 g interestingly the mechanical strength of polyimide aerogel has been reported to be 500 times higher than the conventional silica aerogels furthermore it can provide bulk thermal and acoustic insulation its thermal conductivity can be increased by adjusting certain factors due to its monolithic nature 58 polyurea and polyurethane have been used in the preparation of highly flexible aerogel 59 60 the authors concluded that the high flexibility indirectly correlated with the molecular properties of the monomer the fabrication of such aerogels has potential use in many applications to enhance or add some properties to polymer based aerogels mix polymers or incorporate nano fillers into the aerogel to prepare polymer hybrid aerogels common fillers include cellulose nanofibrils graphene carbon nanotube graphene oxide silicon oxide and so on 61 the hybrid aerogels always possess better performance than the pure polymer aerogel in terms of mechanical thermal or even multi functional properties ke shang et al 62 reported that the pure polyvinyl alcohol aerogel has poor mechanical properties and low viscosity compared to composite aerogels that he developed moreover cross linking of polymer with other materials results in more matrix expansion and thus will have higher motility and space to a more ordered internal structure therefore the application of hybrid aerogel has started gaining more interest in almost all applications a novel aerogel composite based on cellulose nano fibre incorporated with polyvinyl alcohol has been utilized and evaluated for large scale oil and chemical spill clean up 63 the authors reported that the hybrid aerogel adsorption ability was significantly higher than in pure cellulose nano fibre aerogel 2 2 4 silica based aerogels the initial aerogel was based on silica characterized by poor thermal conductivity and high surface area 64 65 silica aerogels has been prepared from variety of materials including sodium silicate na2sio3 66 silicon alkoxide si or 4 67 tetraethyl orthosilicate teos 68 methyltrimethoxysilane mtms 69 and tetramethyl orthosilicate tmos 70 pure silica aerogel has been used as a thermal insulator and effective adsorption materials for organic dies 71 and oils 72 however the widespread use of pure silica based aerogels has been prevented due to concerns about dust release 73 and their weak mechanical properties 74 numerous silica based aerogel composites have been fabricated to overcome these limitations for many applications silica pectin aerogel has been fabricated to improve the poor mechanical strength and dust release of pure silica aerogel 75 this composite possesses minimal dust release and its mechanical properties have been significantly enhanced the authors reported that the thermal insulation properties remain as in pure silica aerogel which can be concluded that integration of the biopolymer pectin enhances the mechanical strength and prevent dust release from pure silica aerogel 75 similarly other silica based hybrids have been fabricated to enhance the mechanical strength of thermal insulation silica was impregnated with cotton and pet 76 poly methyl methacrylate 77 cellulose 78 methltrimethoxysilane 79 and poly styrene 77 chitosan silica aerogel has been used to remove cadmium ions from water 80 moreover the different composites incorporated with carbon nanotubes have been developed and tested for argon oxygen separation among them silica alginate aerogel hybrid incorporated with 30 wt carbon nanotubes had the best adsorption results 81 another silica based hybrid was prepared from silicon nanocrystal the evaluation of this hybrid revealed its potential use as a sensing platform for high energy materials 82 2 2 5 metal oxides based aerogels since the development of the sol gel process back in the late 1960s many different aerogels compositions have been prepared including single or mixed metal oxides aerogels such as zirconium oxide 83 titanium oxide 84 and aluminium oxide 85 the high production costs poor multifunctionality and limited properties of pure metal oxide aerogels have limited their usage as pure metal based aerogels thus metal oxides are usually combined with different materials to enhance or produce novel combinations with exceptional properties the cross linking of carbon storm cellar and metal oxide makes a synergistic impact that takes advantage of merits and relieves the defects of both materials 86 metal oxide organic hybrid aerogels have been used in adsorption 87 separation 88 catalysis 89 energy conversion 90 synthesis of batteries 91 and supercapacitors 92 among the metal oxides iron oxide is one of the widest used metals in many applications it has been utilized to prepare flexible hybrid aerogel incorporated with carbon nanotube 93 carbon nanotubes in this hybrid served as frameworks for the growth of magnetic ferrite nanoparticles the authors reported that the resulting magnetic aerogel is highly porous and significantly effective for microwave absorption it can also be utilized in other applications such as biochemistry catalyst and even energy storage 93 copper oxide is one of many transition metals oxides exhibit high energy density abundant resources low toxicity and low cost it has been widely studied as an electrode material in lithium ion batteries it shows an excellent li ion storage capability indicating that it can act as an electrochemical material through a redox reaction 94 96 chalcogels based aerogel is composed of one of the groups six elements oxygen sulfur selenium tellurium polonium that have the unique ability to filter toxins such as mercury 97 remediation of radioactive materials 98 lead and cadmium out of the water 99 100 the extremely light high porosity and ultra low density of chalcogels based aerogel make them an excellent candidate for such water treatment application 2 3 preparation and properties of aerogels the methods of aerogel preparation have initially started with converting the liquid part of the mixture into a gas within the silica s nano pores without the structure collapsing which is now known as the supercritical drying technique although using supercritical drying for aerogel preparation was effective it was also dangerous time consuming and relatively expensive 66 a few years later modifications have been made to the supercritical drying method such as developing a sol gel route by replacing water glass with tmos then removing it at supercritical conditions other modified techniques include freeze drying and solvent casting and practical leaching gas foaming electrospinning and thermal induced phase separation 101 these techniques were done considering the bulk surface properties of the materials and the proposed function of the aerogels 102 freeze drying has been one of the widely used traditional techniques that uses water and ice crystals instead of organic solvents depending on the type of aerogel and it does not require high temperature thus the pore size of the resulting scaffolds is manageable but still not possible to get homogenous pores however venkatesan et al 103 reported some drawbacks in this technique such as energy consumption and irregular sized pores the salt leaching preparation technique uses different solvents and salt particles evaporating leaving pores adjusted based on these particles kanimozhi et al 104 compared freeze drying and salt leaching techniques to fabricate composite cellulose aerogel and revealed that salt leached aerogel was easier to form into desired shapes however eltom et al 105 reported that the salt leaching technique cannot guarantee interconnectivity of pores due to the adjacent salt particles in contact with each other the salt contact results in inconsistent macrostructure and microstructure of the prepared aerogel to solve this problem chen et al 106 combining particle leaching with freeze drying resulting in better mechanical strength easy to handle procedure and lower cost in the past two decades the fabrication of aerogel become easier using rapid prototyping technologies stereolithography injection moulding fused deposition modeling selective laser sintering and 3d printing are some examples of the recent techniques that depend on the computer for the fabrication process 107 108 different shapes porosity and pore size of the aerogel can be easily adjusted by changing the concentration of precursor materials and or the preparation conditions 109 111 the biggest advantage of rapid prototyping techniques over conventional preparation techniques is the ability to individualize application needs to apply aerogel efficiently furthermore rapid prototyping can be controlled and the inner pore structure with high reproducibility can be controlled 3 modification of aerogels to suit polluted water treatment applications modification of aerogels in most cases is required to achieve the desired application for the preparation material most pure precursors lack important properties for polluted water treatment such as hydrophobicity limited adsorption performance weak mechanical properties and uncontrollable adsorption desorption behavior in the past few years much research has been done to enhance aerogels to become multifunctional materials that can satisfy sophisticated requirements for different polluted water treatment applications 112 however the modification of these materials is still challenging and has attracted the attention for more and more enhancement before they go for large scale commercialization loading the aerogel with functional material could enhance its adsorption capacity due to the scattered functional groups spread on the high surface of the aerogels however some materials such as certain biomass have the advantage of high adsorption capacity but lack mechanical strength due to their hydrophilicity thus such material modification is necessary for them to be used in polluted water treatment applications in this section we discuss four of the most used modification for aerogels to suit polluted water treatment applications including improving the adsorption performance of aerogels by introducing surface functional groups changing the hydrophilic nature of some precursor materials improving the weak mechanical properties and controlling the adsorption desorption behavior of aerogels fig 4 3 1 improving the adsorption capacity of aerogels different cross linkers were found to affect the absorption capacity of nanostructured aerogels of various pollutants due to the changes in the surface properties of the aerogel liang et al 113 fabricated a novel 3d nitrogen doped ultra light graphene oxide aerogel using a hydrothermal self assembly approach followed by a freeze drying process the authors modified their aerogel by using pyrrole and tetraethylene tetramine as cross linking agents introduced as amino functional group sources however the aerogel possesses significantly enhanced adsorption capacity for cr vi anions than the control owing to the numerous surface functional groups that can adsorb different water pollutants pei et al 104 used acrylamide thiosemicarbazide to modify cellulose aerogel and enhance its mechanical properties the aerogel was used in the removal of low content heavy metals the adsorbent efficiency of the aerogel was significantly enhanced toward low content of cr vi due to the well developed pore structure and modified surface area with nh2 cs and cs functional groups the large surface functional groups of many biopolymers can be used for the adsorption of a variety of materials gao et al 114 took this vantage and fabricated a ternary blend aerogel composed of three biopolymers with different surface functional groups the authors introduced chitosan and melamine for their abundant functional groups to the alginate aerogel and obtained one composite aerogel with superior properties and significantly enhanced adsorption capacity for heavy metal ions introducing chitosan and melamine was found to increase the aerogel adsorbing sites for lead ions and reinforce the 3d network skeleton structure of the aerogel and thus can serve for more adsorption regeneration cycles chelation reaction could have occurred due to introducing such biopolymers due to their retch surface area with oh cooh groups which interact with heavy metal ions such as pb ii 115 the amino groups also provide lone electrons which can pair with the heavy metal ions increasing binding energy and enhancing adsorption 116 the main removal mechanisms for biopolymeric aerogel were owed to the abundant nh2 oh and cooh in the surface of the aerogel the heavy metal ions were caught during the direct contact which stuck on its surface structure 114 117 some heavy metal ions such as lead are removed by ion exchange with calcium ions also present in such an aerogel structure for the regeneration process of these biopolymeric aerogels the authors used hno3 and they were able to release all the pb ii ions without any loss in the absorptive ability 114 in a different study wu et al 108 modified graphene aerogels by two methods amino functionalized graphene aerogel and carbon nanotubes enhanced graphene aerogel to improve its physical chemical and absorption properties for water treatment applications introducing carbon nanotubes was found to support the mechanical properties of graphene aerogel and improve its microstructure the authors used ethylenediamine as a reduction agent for introducing the amino functional groups on the surface of graphene layers which can interact with oxygen containing groups of graphene owing to the chemical reaction between the amino groups nh2 and formaldehyde a significant improvement of the adsorption capacity of formaldehyde was achieved 0 62 mg g however incorporating the carbon nanotubes with this modified aerogel enhanced the adsorption of modified aerogel using the two methods of modification resulted in adsorption capacity reaching 27 43 mg g these results indicate that chemical adsorption can be used to adsorb other chemicals than formaldehyde by modifying the surface chemistry of aerogel carbon aerogel has been used as a promising metal free catalyst due to its excellent electrical conductivity good chemical stability under both acidic and basic conditions as well as high thermal stability 118 for the first time jiang et al 110 fabricated a novel porous carbon aerogel with d glucose aniline and ammonium persulfate using a hydro thermal carbonization approach for the activation of persulfate to degrade rhodamine b organic dye the nature carbon aerogel and the defective edges at its boundary facilitated the rhodamine b removal the authors indicated that persulfate bonded with cc in the sp2 hybridized system directly degrading rhodamine b this approach considers a new strategy in polluted water treatment the complex system of the porous aerogels can even be furtherly modified for degrading other compounds in the water 3 2 modifying the hydrophilic nature of precursor materials biopolymer based aerogels have also been used in oil separation and other polluted water treatment applications the chemical modification of hydrophilic polymers such as cellulose is required to turn the aerogel hydrophobic rafieian et al 119 developed low density and high porosity hydrophobic nanostructured aerogels from nano cellulose by a simple freeze drying approach the authors used chemical vapour deposition of hexadecyl trimethoxysilane to modify the aerogel and remove oil and organic pollutants from the water the authors stated that all their modified aerogel had a greater than 90 contact angle classified as hydrophobic materials the porosity of aerogel was also enhanced after the modification and the density also increased furthermore the modified aerogel was found to have better adsorption capacities to motor and cooking oils in a different study cervin et al 112 used vapour phase deposition and treated nanocellulose aerogels with octyl trichlorosilane to obtain cellulose based aerogel s super hydrophobic surfaces in the vapour deposition process it has been reported that the hydroxyls are removed by their interaction with silane which changes the nature of the aerogel into a hydrophobic state zhang et al 120 explained the mechanism of this process fig 5 after the successful preparation of a novel hydrophobic poly vinyl chloride carbon nanotubes aerogels the authors dispersed a certain amount of carbon nanotubes in water and combined it with poly vinyl chloride solution in the presence of ferric iron this composition then underwent a hydrothermal process followed by freeze thawing and freeze drying to obtain the aerogel which was finally modified by the vapour deposition of trimethyl chloro silane tmcs to obtain the hydrophobic aerogel ferric iron was found to play an essential role in this process by forming a transition state structure with the polymer particles through the complexation of hydroxyl groups the hydroxyl groups under the ferric iron catalysis can be activated and converted giving them a chance to form various chemical links on the polymer chain such as carbon oxygen double bonds and carbon carbon as the degree of reaction increases the hydrophobic groups cause shrinkage of some polymer regions making the hydrophobic segments gradually agglomerate 3 3 modifying the mechanical properties of aerogels as a porous material the mechanical properties of aerogels are very important in many applications especially infiltration and polluted water treatment which require good compressive elasticity 121 the mechanical strength and elasticity are directly proportional to the concentration of precursor materials karamikamkar et al 122 reported several approaches that can be used to improve aerogels mechanical properties including the use of flexible precursor material s changing the concentration of precursor material s and adding suitable materials surface cross linker s and changing the fabrication method pure cellulose aerogel is known to have weak mechanical properties it s held together by hydrogen bonds and physical entanglement 123 thus bending damage to hydrogen bonds usually occur upon subjecting the aerogel to any external force causing severe damage to physical crosslinking points finally the aerogel remains slippage or unwrapping 124 numerous attempts have been made to enhance the performance improve the mechanical strength of cellulose aerogels by adding inorganic fillers such as tio2 125 nano silica 126 hydroxyapatite 127 and graphene 128 in a recent study tang et al 129 modified wheat straw cellulose aerogel by using the polyester plasticizer poly propylene glycol adipate by directly mixing the two materials and reported significant enhancement in mechanical strength of cellulose aerogel and the adsorption capacity for dyes great efforts have been made in the past few years regarding improving the elasticity of inorganic aerogels such as graphene aerogels using various strategies including adjusting the pore structure to different shapes 130 changing the solvent for self assembly 131 and using cross linkers 132 many studies have reported significant improvement in graphene aerogel s elasticity upon changing the pores shape 130 133 graphene oxide has been used as a reinforcing filler to enhance sodium alginate aerogel s mechanical strength and elasticity 134 the sodium alginate graphene oxide aerogel compression strength was 324 kpa without major reduction even after five compression cycles the integration of graphene oxide was also found to improve the porous aerogel structure which is essential in enhancing absorbability and strength toughness 135 yang et al 136 demonstrated that the self assembled chemically modified graphene aerogels have intrinsic compressive elasticity in addition to reversible transition from elasticity to plasticity upon water adsorption in a different study graphene oxide has been incorporated with carboxymethyl chitosan aerogels to increase compressive strength enhance its elasticity and resist pressure 137 the modified aerogel had elastic modulus and compressive strength of 368 35 and 16 77 mpa respectively higher than the control silica aerogels have fine structures and highly hydrophilic surfaces and are fragile and impractical for adsorbing non polar solvents limiting their utilization in water treatment applications to improve the mechanical properties of silica aerogels shi et al 138 incorporated small amounts of poly acrylonitrile fibers into the aerogel mixture at mild temperatures they reported significant changes in pore structure size and surface morphology the modified aerogel was superhydrophobic due to converting the hydroxyl and alkoxy surface groups to stable methyl groups with a surprising contact angle as high as 169 owing to the strong mechanical properties the authors reported that sorption and desorption process of modified aerogel can be repeated at least 100 times 3 4 modification aerogels for controllable adsorption desorption behavior although many aerogels have been developed to have excellent adsorption performance for various water pollutants the regeneration ability and the reusability of these aerogels have always been a great challenge they are probably the prime factor in determining the feasibility and production cost of the aerogel in practical applications 114 graphene oxide based aerogels have been linked with difficulty completely recovering after the adsorption of some heavy metal ions such as uranium u vi due to the low density of its functional groups however liao et al 139 have utilized the special chemical properties of poly dopamine to modify the surface of graphene oxide aerogel and then cross link it with chitosan to fabricate highly porous 3d aerogel with modified regeneration ability the authors reported that modified aerogel showed enhanced active sites for the adsorption of uranium ions the adsorption rate was very fast with significantly enhanced adsorption capacity 415 9 mg g furthermore due to modified aerogel s high thermal and mechanical stability the authors could recycle the aerogel six times without decreasing adsorption rate or capacity this modification enhanced the adsorption and desorption of heavy metals providing a promising potential for developing advanced functional materials for water treatment in different studies aiming to avoid chemical usage and reduce costs fan et al 140 have modified chitosan aerogel adsorbent to be responsive to co2 the authors fabricated the aerogel by physicochemical double crosslinking of chitosan with co2 responsive poly acrylic acid 2 dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate and enhanced the adsorption capacity by 162 interestingly the authors could desorb the adsorbed pollutant by co2 bubbling with a desorption rate exceeding 80 fig 6 co2 as a desorption agent is safer than a strong acid as much biopolymer based aerogel cannot resist the strong acidic condition different acids such as hcl h2so4 and hno3 have been used as eluents for aerogel adsorbents due to the high affinity of h for adsorption onto the electron donating groups present in the surface of the aerogel resulting in the replacement of adsorbed ions from the adsorbent 114 modified aerogel has recently been fabricated to respond to specific stimuli as smart adsorbent materials for polluted water treatment applications these smart aerogels were designed to reversibly adsorb and desorb the specific water pollutant under a variety of external stimulation including magnetic field 141 ph 142 temperature 143 light 144 and carbon dioxide 145 etc wei et al 139 used ferroferric oxide fe3o4 nanoparticles to fabricate cellulose based magnetic hybrid aerogel with controllable recovery under magnetic conditions in a recent investigation the magnetic hybrid aerogel possesses excellent adsorption efficiency to heavy metals with high ferromagnetic characteristics with 53 69 emu g saturation magnetization value enabling the effective and controllable recovery of the magnetic hybrid aerogel under pressure magnetic condition 4 nanostructured aerogels in polluted water treatment applications water pollution is still arousing wide attention among scientists due to its close relationship with human and animal health especially with the massive development of industrial society 146 many materials including heavy metal ions pesticides organic dyes oils and other substances have been reported to cause serious health problems upon their consumption or even exposure 147 nano aerogels possesses attractive merits in water treatment application including extremely high porosity ultra light density and large specific surface area which promoted these materials for successful adsorption of different water pollutant 148 in this review we extensively discuss the ability of different types of nano aerogels to remove heavy metal ions organic pollutants oil water separation pesticides and herbicides in addition to pharmaceutical and toxins from aqueous solutions see fig 7 4 1 nanostructured aerogels for heavy metal ions adsorption from aqueous solutions the two decades witnessed rapid development in the industry and agriculture which led to excessive use of chemical products increasing chemical waste 149 water pollution with different heavy metals has always been a continuous threat to human health and the environment various techniques have been developed to adsorb and remove heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions such as ion exchange redox membrane filtration chemical deposition and adsorption 2 150 activated carbon and other adsorption materials are widely used as effective adsorbents however the high production costs due to their difficult preparation have limitate their usage in addition to that their adsorption is not easily observed 151 aerogels have been extensively investigated for the adsorption of heavy metal ions which have extremely large surface areas able to adsorb large quantities of ions graphene oxide carboxymethyl chitosan aerogels were fabricated via vacuum assisted self assembly followed by freeze drying 137 the aerogels had excellent metal ions adsorption resulting from the unique surface chemistry and the interaction of hydrogen bonding between carboxymethyl chitosan chains and the surface of graphene oxide in addition to the crosslinks of glutaraldehyde or triphosphoric acid owing to the graphene oxide the aerogel had excellent compressive strength and elastic modulus in addition to high adsorption capacities to a variety of heavy metal ions including 249 38 mg g for pb2 151 30 mg g for ag and 95 37 mg g for cu2 137 in another study li et al 146 developed a novel composite aerogel made from metals and biopolymers to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions the authors developed bet specific surface area by adding zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 to the aerogel from 8 4 m2 g in the bacterial cellulose chitosan aerogel to 268 7 m2 g of the composite the authors reported a high adsorption capacity of cu2 and cr6 200 6 mg g and 152 1 mg g and a 100 removal rate toward organic dyes through one time of adsorption song et al 152 prepared a composite aerogel by mixing carbon quantum dots with cellulose nanofibres using a green synthesis route for heavy metal adsorption and detection interestingly the aerogel monitored the adsorption behavior of the heavy metal ions fig 8 the fluorescence effect of the carbon quantum dots in the material was found to decrease with the increase of adsorbed heavy metal ions these results may open the doors to developing advanced sensors that simultaneously detect and adsorb heavy metal ions to better perception for heavy metal ion adsorption the adsorption mechanism its kinetic predictions and the ph condition are essential to understand the adsorption equilibrium of each heavy metal the required time and adsorption rate 153 several researchers have presented numerous adsorption kinetic models including intraparticle diffusion pseudo first and second order sips and langmuir 154 ph was also essential to optimize the removal efficiency for most heavy metal ions the maximum adsorption capacity reported in a ph ranged from 4 to 6 table 2 presents the adsorption capacity of several aerogels with the mechanism of adsorption at their optimum ph values 4 2 nanostructured aerogels for removal of dyes and organic pollutants the rapid development of organic and inorganic dyes has caused a significant threat to humans and the aquatic ecosystem most synthetic dyes are considered toxic to both humans and aquatic life many of them have been proved to be carcinogenic even at low concentrations 167 graphene carbon nanotubes aerogel showed good performance for methylene blue removal from aqueous solution with an excellent adsorption capacity of 81 97 mg g 168 similarly zhou et al 169 fabricated graphene carbon nanotubes aerogel and reported adsorption capacity ranging from 100 to 270 times of the own weight of the aerogel by a hydrothermal redox reaction the aerogel was prepared by hydrothermal redox reaction and possessed ultra light densities 6 2 to 12 8 mg cm3 and significantly high specific surface area compared to the pure aerogel of graphene and carbon nanotubes in a recent investigation by wang et al 170 graphene based aerogel was fabricated by hydrothermal process then employed as a template for carbon nanotubes the authors were able to make this hybrid aerogel selectively adsorb a variety of organics materials from water due to its improved properties and enhanced specific surface area in addition to the extraordinary meso and micro scale pores resulting from growing carbon nanotubes on the sheet of graphene aerogel such advanced material can be even more modify to target another water pollutant the excellent mechanical properties of graphene and carbon nanotubes make them a suitable material for developing selective water filters for different organic compounds aiming to reduce large scale production costs and sustainably wang et al 171 fabricated eco friendly ultralight and super porous carbon aerogel from the cheap and widely available agarose biomass the authors introduced zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 into the aerogel to enable heteroatom doping and increase the surface area the modified aerogel had a low density of only 24 mg cm3 and an extremely high surface area of 516 m2 g which has high potential in the adsorption of organic pollutants hybrid aerogel has been prepared from cellulose nanofibrils and carbon nanomaterials to remove cationic and anionic dyes methylene blue and congo red in single and binary systems 172 carbon nanomaterials carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoplates were incorporated into the aerogel to enhance its mechanical properties the best performance was reported in cellulose nanofibrils graphene nanoplates 3 1 hybrid which showed maximal adsorption capacities of 1178 5 mg g and 585 3 mg g for the methylene blue and congo red respectively the ability of such hybrid aerogel to adsorb both cationic and anionic dyes from water suggests a high potential in polluted water treatment application as an effective functional material wan et al 168 achieved fast passive capillary absorption of organic leakages with low flow resistance by using novel anisotropic carbon aerogel in a different study the authors reported that the aerogel exhibited high selectivity to separate the organic pollutants it shows high absorption capacity to broad spectrum of such pollutants ranging from 13 27 to 31 59 g g in addition to superior recyclability without any significant loss of absorption capacity still 98 7 retention after five cycles xiao et al 173 developed a novel versatile graphene oxide cellulose nanofiber aerogel by introducing cellulose acetate nanofibers into the graphene sheets to prevent them from over stacking on each other and to enhance the connectivity of cell walls the novel aerogel exhibited excellent underwater stability with extremely high adsorption capacity toward cationic dyes 800 mg g interestingly the reshaping ability of the aerogel when it was modified with co deposition of poly dopamine and poly ethyleneimine transformed it to super hydrophilic underwater super oleophobic in addition to shape stable material for the quick separation of organic pollutant from water with a high flux 19 000 l m2 h bar the same authors cross linked the aerogel via vapour deposition of hexadecyl trimethoxysilane to enhance its hydrophobicity they obtained superhydrophobic and super elastic material to adsorb various organic liquids with high adsorption capacity ranging from 230 to 734 g g depending on the material fig 9 the results of this novel aerogel are superior to most conventional adsorbents and even pure aerogels the easy regeneration of this material suggests promising potential as a simple and multifunctional material for various applications in water treatment 4 3 nanostructured aerogel for oil adsorbent the industrial activities associated with crude oil including its extraction transportation refining and even processing have raised the risk of environmental pollution and the possibility of oil discharges to the surrounding environment causing a serious ecological issue throughout the world 148 graphene aerogels have been widely used in oil water separation and other treatment applications owing to their desired characteristics and unique properties as ideal oil sorbent materials 174 numerous studies have used superhydrophobic graphene aerogels and aerogel like materials in oil absorption applications such as graphene polymer hybrid aerogels 175 graphene carbon nanotube aerogels 169 pure graphene aerogels 176 etc zhao et al 177 stated that graphene aerogel could be assembled by hydrothermal treatment of graphene oxide sheets with the assistance of thiourea the authors were able to significantly improve the absorptive capacity of the aerogel by changing the fabrication approach similarly cork like graphene aerogels have been fabricated by the eda ammonia double hydro thermal reduction method 178 the fabricated aerogels were hydrophobic and displayed extremely high porosity and exceptional mechanical properties the authors reported higher adsorption efficiency for oil 130 10 g g than conventional adsorbents 71 67 g g furthermore the same authors stated that their aerogel possesses impressive recycling performance a continuous water treatment process was proposed for the same aerogel giving such material great potential applications for oil spills and environmental clean up 178 3d graphene based materials have been prepared in a different study with unique properties for oil adsorbent applications 179 the aerogel was super hydrophobic and super oleophilic and was prepared by freeze drying of hydrothermal reacted graphene oxide in the presence of dopamine the authors reported they used fluoroalkyl silane to induce subsequent surface modification of the aerogel by a vapour liquid deposition method resulting in a high oil absorbent aerogel with a water contact angle of 156 5 and 0 oil contact angle 179 such super hydrophobic aerogel could selectively adsorb any other oily or even inorganic solvents giving it high priority in many pharmaceutical applications as well as oil polluted water remediation in a different investigation qu et al 180 used pyrrole to fabricate n doped graphene framework which showed surprising oil adsorption capacity 200 600 times its weight which was much higher than conventional carbonaceous sorbents such as sponge 20 86 times 181 graphene aerogel 10 37 times 182 carbon nanofiber aerogels 51 139 times 183 carbon aerogel 16 50 times 88 and carbon nanotube aerogel 80 180 times 184 in a recent investigation cao et al 185 reported a mild and green fabrication approach of a 3d columnar graphene aerogel using stearic acid and polyvinyl alcohol as cross linkers to construct a framework of rgo the interaction between polyvinyl alcohol stearic acid and stacked reduced graphene oxide sheets generated a mechanically very robust aerogel the authors reported that their aerogel possesses a very low density of 4 9 to 10 mg cm in addition to ultra light performance and excellent mechanical properties interestingly the aerogel possesses good fire resistance and ultra fast oil absorption less than 1 s the adsorptive capacities ranged from 105 to 250 times of the original weight of the aerogel for variety of organic liquids as presented in fig 10 a this type of aerogels can be used in practical oil remediation it is a cost effective durable and reusable material even after several times of absorbing squeezing 174 wang et al 186 fabricated mesoporous silica based aerogel membrane exhibiting ultrahigh hydrophobicity for water in oil emulsions separation fig 10b the authors were able to achieve 99 9 separation of surfactant stabilized water in oil as well as corrosive water in oil emulsions suggesting such functional materials for high efficient removing of emulsified water droplets from oil some drawbacks have been reported in activated carbon and some graphene based aerogels including poor oil absorption efficiency co adsorption of water and the relatively high cost of fabrications 187 silica aerogels are the initially fabricated aerogel experimented with various applications including oil absorbents 188 the high fragility and brittleness of such aerogels limit their use in oil absorbent applications 188 numerous studies have used carbon nanotube aerogels due to their excellent mechanical properties and good oil absorption capacity 170 189 gui et al 184 reported an 80 180 times oil absorption capacity of the original weight of their prepared carbon nanotube aerogel however as an inorganic material carbon nanotubes are also considered more costly and they can only be used in the adsorption of small quantities of oils biopolymer based aerogels have attracted tremendous attention as a sustainable and eco friendly material in water treatment applications 190 owing to their high availability renewability and low cost in addition to exhibiting high oil absorption capacity they have promising potential for being suitable oil absorbents for large scale water treatment applications cervin et al 191 used hydrophobic cellulose based aerogel for the separation of oil from water similarly korhonen et al 192 used atomic layer deposition of cnfs based aerogels functionalized with a layer of tio2 for oil removal these deposition approaches are limited to using sophisticated equipment complicating the removal process and rising costs as a solution chin et al 187 reported a facile approach to fabricate highly hydrophobic and magnetic cellulose based aerogel the authors in situ incorporated magnetic nanoparticles into the aerogels and coated the surface with a thin layer of tio2 fast oil separation was achieved the aerogel absorbed 28 times its weight in only 10 min with high recovery ability by an external magnet zhang et al 183 developed chitosan cellulose aerogel with robust salt tolerant and superoleophobic properties in a different study the aerogel was highly efficient in oil seawater separation in addition to maintaining its super oleophobicity underwater even at high salinity seawater for about 30 days making it a promising candidate as a future solution for oil separation

microstructure strong super hydrophilicity anti crude oil fouling performance underwater super oleophobicity and self cleaning effect the authors reported excellent performance for this aerogel to separate oil in water emulsion the improved mechanical strength stable wettability even at different chemical environments and good adsorption properties for oil and dyes enable this aerogel to serve as polluted water treatment functional material table 3 presents a collection of studies about biopolymer based aerogel in oil absorption applications 4 4 nanostructured aerogels for pesticides and herbicides adsorption the massive increase in the world population demands for accelerated quantity as well as quality food a large portion of agricultural production is destroyed by many pests diseases and weeds making the use of pesticides and herbicides necessary to reduce these losses 205 although these chemical compounds have brought significant benefits to our agricultural production their misuse has polluted the environment and become a serious threat to living organisms 206 a complex aerogel based on modified graphene oxide grafted stainless steel mesh combined with zirconium dioxide zro2 nanoparticles and poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride has been fabricated and experimented with for detection and extraction of organo phosphorus pesticides 207 introducing zro2 nanoparticles into the aerogel brought selective adsorption for organo phosphorus pesticides due to the phosphate group in the pesticide as a lewis base and combining with the nanoparticles the lewis acid site the authors were also able to detect pesticides with a 0 2 to 1 0 μg l limit of detection similarly a fast and stable acetyl cholinesterase biosensor has been fabricated from platinum carbon aerogels for pesticides detection 208 the detection limits of the aerogel biosensor were found to be 0 05 μg l for methamidophos and 0 6 μg l for monocrotophos these results suggest great potential in developing such advanced material for monitoring chemicals or toxins in the water it could also be developed into small size test strips able to detect different undesired compounds carbon aerogel has been prepared by polycondensation process of resorcinol and formaldehyde in sodium carbonate catalysis and showed good adsorption ability for alpha cypermethrin pesticide from water samples 209 in different studies a 3d graphene based aerogel was synthesized through a chemical reduction process of graphene oxides aqueous solution with ethylene diaminethermal and used for solid phase extraction of pesticides from water 210 the aerogel detected and removed six organophosphorus pesticides including trichlorfon ethoprophos dimethoate parathion fenthion and fenitrothion with limits of detection ranging from 0 12 to 0 58 μg l 210 liang et al 211 developed carbon nanotube based aerogels for herbicides removal from water by loading two different metal organic frameworks nanoparticles in the aerogel zif 8 or uio66 nh2 the two aerogel composites had good hydrophilia and could adsorb chipton and alachlor herbicides 227 3 mg g the authors reported that the addition of metal organic frameworks nanoparticles significantly enhanced the adsorption capacity for both pesticides compared with the pure carbon nanotube aerogel due to some environmental safety concerns regarding using metal organic frameworks nanoparticles the authors did biosafety experiments for their aerogel they confirmed its safety and the aerogel can be safely used to reduce the risk of metal organic frameworks nanoparticles leakage into the environment fig 11 presents an illustration of the fabrication procedure and adsorption results of the aerogel 4 5 nanostructured aerogels for pharmaceutical separation separation processes are inevitably needed in the pharmaceutical industry whether for purification or separation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient or intermediate compounds this industry has benefited from aerogels in many aspects although many of such applications are still in the research stage they offer promising potentials for the pharmaceutical industry conventional techniques such as precipitation chromatography and membrane chromatographic techniques are linked with high costs low adsorption capacity and low separation efficiency 212 alginate graphene nanostructured aerogel has been fabricated for tetracycline adsorption to overcome the disadvantages of conventional zif 67 crystal powder such as difficulty in recycling excessive growth and easy aggregation 213 the alginic acid chain and strong graphene oxide interaction give the aerogel excellent mechanical properties and prevent aggregation of graphene oxide the authors achieved a maximum removal of tetracycline 456 62mg g which is way higher than the control 105 49 mg g in a different study peydayesh et al 214 developed bio aerogel from amyloid fibrils as an ideal adsorber for some pharmaceutical pollutants bentazone bisphenol a and ibuprofen from water the authors reported that their aerogel possesses excellent physicochemical and mechanical properties in addition to outstanding removal efficiencies for bentazone bisphenol a and ibuprofen 92 78 and 98 respectively these results point to the bio aerogel as an eco friendly sustainable efficient and inexpensive

aerogel from different materials 5 aerogels are obtained by removing the pore fluid from a gel without changing the material s structural integrity resulting in ultralight weight and high porous material the porosity of aerogels is an essential parameter that highly affects its functionality numerous factors such as the precursor material its concentration the cross linkers drying method and other additives greatly impact the porosity and pore size of the aerogel 6 7 although many aerogels already exist the authors are convinced that a lot more new aerogel types will be discovered in the following years especially in their use in polluted water treatment 8 many other hybrid material aerogels combinations are yet to be discovered the interest in aerogels just kept growing as indicated by the number of publications each year fig 1a many aerogels composites can be produced with modifying properties by adding new functional material for water treatment and other applications the effectiveness of modified aerogel in polluted water treatment applications has motivated scientists to continuously develop novel aerogel as presented in fig 1b the past few years have witnessed great

mesoporous solid foam composed of a network of interconnected nanostructures and exhibits a porosity non solid volume of no less than 50 16 the term mesoporous refers to a material that contains pores ranging from 2 to 50 nm in diameter thus nanostructured aerogels are the types of aerogels that have nano pores and possess superior properties such as the extremely high surface to volume ratio in addition to the unique surface properties creating a variety of new advanced functionalities 17 nano aerogel materials are characterized by pore diameter between 2 and 50 nm ultralow material density high porosity and surface area 18 as discussed in the following subsections these materials have been extensively developed since their discovery in their precursor material s fabrication methods and modification techniques to enhance their functionalities 2 1 chronological development of aerogels the chronological order of aerogel development started since its discovery back in 1931 by samuel stephens kistler who prepared water glass aerogel by using sodium silicate as precursor materials to form silica gel which then heated in an autoclave above the critical temperature and pressures 19 this technique later became known as supercritical drying kistler continued developing the aerogels by various synthetizing aerogels from other materials including metal oxides organic materials and even polymers 20 21 kistler also patented a novel approach for developing his initial silica aerogel to hydrophobic silica aerogels by using trichloro methyl silane water repellent for the silylation 22 in 1959 the first fabrication of hydrophobic aerogels was made from metal oxides and some organic compounds by the silylation of precursors with trichloro methyl silane this has opened more research on the application of aerogel in water treatment many researchers started the investigation of utilizing such material as adsorbent of filter which even enhanced after teichner and nicoloan developed kistler approach to a unique technique by replacing the water glass with tetramethyl orthosilicate tmos which was significantly easier to be removed during the drying phase 22 in 1972 alumina aerogels were experimented with adsorption of nitrogen and carbon tetrachloride by aerogels the aerogel was strongly micro porous with excellent adsorption ability 23 a few years later numerous organic materials were utilized in aerogel production including biomasses and biopolymers which had advanced properties such as high porosity ultra light density and high surface area 24 26 the end of the previous century witnessed rapid supercritical drying which significantly improved aerogel production as a fast low cost route compared with the previous one 27 activated carbon aerogels were prepared for the first time in 1996 from organic polymers by co2 activation of carbon aerogels and it was also investigated for its adsorption ability 28 since then aerogel have been fabricated from numerous of precursor materials fig 2 presents a summary for the basic events of aerogel development and its utilization for various environmental applications 2 2 types of aerogel functional materials many materials have been used in a pure state or combined with other cross linkers to fabricate aerogels each material s physical chemical mechanical and biological properties eventually determine the prospected aerogel properties the precursor materials of aerogels can be classified into five basic types biomass aerogels inorganic carbon aerogels polymeric aerogels silica aerogels metal oxides aerogels and other aerogels 2 2 1 biomass and organic polymer based aerogels biomass refers to natural organic material that derives from living organisms including plants animals or microorganisms biomass is the most abundant and cost effective precursor material that has been utilized in aerogel synthesis for different applications 29 these novel precursors including cellulose 30 chitin 31 chitosan 32 lignin 33 tannin 34 alginates 35 and biomass waste 36 provide hopeful applications in variety of polluted water treatment applications fig 3 presents a summary of these biomass aerogels cellulose is one of the most utilized biopolymers in aerogel fabrication it has been combined with numerous organic and inorganic materials to enhance its properties 37 li et al 38 fabricated cellulose based ternary doped n s and fe aerogels from the cocoon as precursor materials and reported that the aerogel had bet surface area of 714 14 m2 g compared with chitosan based aerogel obtained by garcia et al 39 the latter reported a specific surface area of 350 m2 g for chitosan aerogels however the same authors prepared alginate chitosan aerogel composites and obtained a higher specific surface area owing to the nano sized pores and micro pore volume of their aerogel the surface area of the aerogel was significantly increased eco friendly and multi functional sodium alginate incorporated with tannic acid aerogel was prepared for emulsion separation by a freeze drying approach 40 the aerogel possesses high porosity and rough microstructure strong super hydrophilicity anti crude oil fouling performance underwater super oleophobicity and self cleaning effect the authors reported excellent performance for this aerogel to separate oil in water emulsion the improved mechanical strength stable wettability even at different chemical environments and good adsorption properties for oil and dyes enable this aerogel to serve as a polluted water treatment functional material biomass based aerogels are characterized by high porosity ultra light density high surface area biodegradability renewability and biocompatibility making these aerogels the perfect choice for many applications 41 43 2 2 2 inorganic carbon based aerogels inorganic carbon based aerogels are composed mainly of carbon allotropes including amorphous carbon carbon nanotubes diamond graphite and graphene 44 depending on the type of allotropes carbon based aerogel will exhibit different properties however most carbon aerogels have the typical properties of aerogels such as high porosity large surface area and low density 45 moreover they also possess excellent mechanical properties compared with the aerogel obtained from other materials consequently they have enjoyed steady growth in research interest since their invention in the early 1990s 46 graphene nanostructured aerogels are one of the most used aerogels in polluted water treatment applications which attracted tremendous attention due to their high absorption capacity excellent physicochemical and mechanical properties including the extremely large surface area elastically and reversibly deformable the higher porosity than regular aerogel more than 99 chemical stability in acid and basic conditions in addition to the low bulk density 47 48 different techniques have been used in the fabrication of graphene based aerogels to improve the adsorption capacity and general properties graphite is a material composed of stacked graphene sheets on top of each other with an extremely tiny interlayer distance 49 graphene layers are extremely strong material with ultimate tensile strength and young s modulus of 130 gpa and 1 tpa respectively 49 due to these strong mechanical properties graphene and graphite based aerogels can be ideal for numerous functionalities including in water treatment applications carbon nanotubes are unique tubular structures of nanometer diameter and large length diameter ratio 50 however graphene is yet another novel nano material with a 2d honeycomb lattice of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms 51 there are numerous properties for all carbon allotropes including cnts and graphene which take full advantage of their unique properties of aspect ratio mechanical strength electrical and thermal conductivity cnts graphene hybrid aerogel is one of the most effective absorbance hybrid aerogels it has been used in the adsorption of hazardous organic pollutants 52 high performance heavy metal ions removal 53 water soluble toxic pollutants as well as noxious greenhouse gases 54 55 2 2 3 inorganic polymer based aerogels various inorganic polymers have been utilized in aerogel fabrication a novel aerogel composite from phenolic resin and silicon was developed with significantly enhanced thermal mechanical and ablative properties 56 the novel composite exhibited high compressive strength due to phenolic resin ultra low density and thermal conductivity 56 similarly polyimide based aerogels have been applied to high thermal and acoustic insulation due to their thermal stability and strength 42 polyimide aerogel has been produced by crosslinking aromatic triamine with anhydride capped polyamic acid oligomers in a solution followed by chemically imidizing to form polyimide gel 57 the subsequent polyimides gel was then dried using supercritical carbon dioxide to form polyimide aerogels with a low density of 0 14g cm3 and high surface areas 512 m2 g interestingly the mechanical strength of polyimide aerogel has been reported to be 500 times higher than the conventional silica aerogels furthermore it can provide bulk thermal and acoustic insulation its thermal conductivity can be increased by adjusting certain factors due to its monolithic nature 58 polyurea and polyurethane have been used in the preparation of highly flexible aerogel 59 60 the authors concluded that the high flexibility indirectly correlated with the molecular properties of the monomer the fabrication of such aerogels has potential use in many applications to enhance or add some properties to polymer based aerogels mix polymers or incorporate nano fillers into the aerogel to prepare polymer hybrid aerogels common fillers include cellulose nanofibrils graphene carbon nanotube graphene oxide silicon oxide and so on 61 the hybrid aerogels always possess better performance than the pure polymer aerogel in terms of mechanical thermal or even multi functional properties ke shang et al 62 reported that the pure polyvinyl alcohol aerogel has poor mechanical properties and low viscosity compared to composite aerogels that he developed moreover cross linking of polymer with other materials results in more matrix expansion and thus will have higher motility and space to a more ordered internal structure therefore the application of hybrid aerogel has started gaining more interest in almost all applications a novel aerogel composite based on cellulose nano fibre incorporated with polyvinyl alcohol has been utilized and evaluated for large scale oil and chemical spill clean up 63 the authors reported that the hybrid aerogel adsorption ability was significantly higher than in pure cellulose nano fibre aerogel 2 2 4 silica based aerogels the initial aerogel was based on silica characterized by poor thermal conductivity and high surface area 64 65 silica aerogels has been prepared from variety of materials including sodium silicate na2sio3 66 silicon alkoxide si or 4 67 tetraethyl orthosilicate teos 68 methyltrimethoxysilane mtms 69 and tetramethyl orthosilicate tmos 70 pure silica aerogel has been used as a thermal insulator and effective adsorption materials for organic dies 71 and oils 72 however the widespread use of pure silica based aerogels has been prevented due to concerns about dust release 73 and their weak mechanical properties 74 numerous silica based aerogel composites have been fabricated to overcome these limitations for many applications silica pectin aerogel has been fabricated to improve the poor mechanical strength and dust release of pure silica aerogel 75 this composite possesses minimal dust release and its mechanical properties have been significantly enhanced the authors reported that the thermal insulation properties remain as in pure silica aerogel which can be concluded that integration of the biopolymer pectin enhances the mechanical strength and prevent dust release from pure silica aerogel 75 similarly other silica based hybrids have been fabricated to enhance the mechanical strength of thermal insulation silica was impregnated with cotton and pet 76 poly methyl methacrylate 77 cellulose 78 methltrimethoxysilane 79 and poly styrene 77 chitosan silica aerogel has been used to remove cadmium ions from water 80 moreover the different composites incorporated with carbon nanotubes have been developed and tested for argon oxygen separation among them silica alginate aerogel hybrid incorporated with 30 wt carbon nanotubes had the best adsorption results 81 another silica based hybrid was prepared from silicon nanocrystal the evaluation of this hybrid revealed its potential use as a sensing platform for high energy materials 82 2 2 5 metal oxides based aerogels since the development of the sol gel process back in the late 1960s many different aerogels compositions have been prepared including single or mixed metal oxides aerogels such as zirconium oxide 83 titanium oxide 84 and aluminium oxide 85 the high production costs poor multifunctionality and limited properties of pure metal oxide aerogels have limited their usage as pure metal based aerogels thus metal oxides are usually combined with different materials to enhance or produce novel combinations with exceptional properties the cross linking of carbon storm cellar and metal oxide makes a synergistic impact that takes advantage of merits and relieves the defects of both materials 86 metal oxide organic hybrid aerogels have been used in adsorption 87 separation 88 catalysis 89 energy conversion 90 synthesis of batteries 91 and supercapacitors 92 among the metal oxides iron oxide is one of the widest used metals in many applications it has been utilized to prepare flexible hybrid aerogel incorporated with carbon nanotube 93 carbon nanotubes in this hybrid served as frameworks for the growth of magnetic ferrite nanoparticles the authors reported that the resulting magnetic aerogel is highly porous and significantly effective for microwave absorption it can also be utilized in other applications such as biochemistry catalyst and even energy storage 93 copper oxide is one of many transition metals oxides exhibit high energy density abundant resources low toxicity and low cost it has been widely studied as an electrode material in lithium ion batteries it shows an excellent li ion storage capability indicating that it can act as an electrochemical material through a redox reaction 94 96 chalcogels based aerogel is composed of one of the groups six elements oxygen sulfur selenium tellurium polonium that have the unique ability to filter toxins such as mercury 97 remediation of radioactive materials 98 lead and cadmium out of the water 99 100 the extremely light high porosity and ultra low density of chalcogels based aerogel make them an excellent candidate for such water treatment application 2 3 preparation and properties of aerogels the methods of aerogel preparation have initially started with converting the liquid part of the mixture into a gas within the silica s nano pores without the structure collapsing which is now known as the supercritical drying technique although using supercritical drying for aerogel preparation was effective it was also dangerous time consuming and relatively expensive 66 a few years later modifications have been made to the supercritical drying method such as developing a sol gel route by replacing water glass with tmos then removing it at supercritical conditions other modified techniques include freeze drying and solvent casting and practical leaching gas foaming electrospinning and thermal induced phase separation 101 these techniques were done considering the bulk surface properties of the materials and the proposed function of the aerogels 102 freeze drying has been one of the widely used traditional techniques that uses water and ice crystals instead of organic solvents depending on the type of aerogel and it does not require high temperature thus the pore size of the resulting scaffolds is manageable but still not possible to get homogenous pores however venkatesan et al 103 reported some drawbacks in this technique such as energy consumption and irregular sized pores the salt leaching preparation technique uses different solvents and salt particles evaporating leaving pores adjusted based on these particles kanimozhi et al 104 compared freeze drying and salt leaching techniques to fabricate composite cellulose aerogel and revealed that salt leached aerogel was easier to form into desired shapes however eltom et al 105 reported that the salt leaching technique cannot guarantee interconnectivity of pores due to the adjacent salt particles in contact with each other the salt contact results in inconsistent macrostructure and microstructure of the prepared aerogel to solve this problem chen et al 106 combining particle leaching with freeze drying resulting in better mechanical strength easy to handle procedure and lower cost in the past two decades the fabrication of aerogel become easier using rapid prototyping technologies stereolithography injection moulding fused deposition modeling selective laser sintering and 3d printing are some examples of the recent techniques that depend on the computer for the fabrication process 107 108 different shapes porosity and pore size of the aerogel can be easily adjusted by changing the concentration of precursor materials and or the preparation conditions 109 111 the biggest advantage of rapid prototyping techniques over conventional preparation techniques is the ability to individualize application needs to apply aerogel efficiently furthermore rapid prototyping can be controlled and the inner pore structure with high reproducibility can be controlled 3 modification of aerogels to suit polluted water treatment applications modification of aerogels in most cases is required to achieve the desired application for the preparation material most pure precursors lack important properties for polluted water treatment such as hydrophobicity limited adsorption performance weak mechanical properties and uncontrollable adsorption desorption behavior in the past few years much research has been done to enhance aerogels to become multifunctional materials that can satisfy sophisticated requirements for different polluted water treatment applications 112 however the modification of these materials is still challenging and has attracted the attention for more and more enhancement before they go for large scale commercialization loading the aerogel with functional material could enhance its adsorption capacity due to the scattered functional groups spread on the high surface of the aerogels however some materials such as certain biomass have the advantage of high adsorption capacity but lack mechanical strength due to their hydrophilicity thus such material modification is necessary for them to be used in polluted water treatment applications in this section we discuss four of the most used modification for aerogels to suit polluted water treatment applications including improving the adsorption performance of aerogels by introducing surface functional groups changing the hydrophilic nature of some precursor materials improving the weak mechanical properties and controlling the adsorption desorption behavior of aerogels fig 4 3 1 improving the adsorption capacity of aerogels different cross linkers were found to affect the absorption capacity of nanostructured aerogels of various pollutants due to the changes in the surface properties of the aerogel liang et al 113 fabricated a novel 3d nitrogen doped ultra light graphene oxide aerogel using a hydrothermal self assembly approach followed by a freeze drying process the authors modified their aerogel by using pyrrole and tetraethylene tetramine as cross linking agents introduced as amino functional group sources however the aerogel possesses significantly enhanced adsorption capacity for cr vi anions than the control owing to the numerous surface functional groups that can adsorb different water pollutants pei et al 104 used acrylamide thiosemicarbazide to modify cellulose aerogel and enhance its mechanical properties the aerogel was used in the removal of low content heavy metals the adsorbent efficiency of the aerogel was significantly enhanced toward low content of cr vi due to the well developed pore structure and modified surface area with nh2 cs and cs functional groups the large surface functional groups of many biopolymers can be used for the adsorption of a variety of materials gao et al 114 took this vantage and fabricated a ternary blend aerogel composed of three biopolymers with different surface functional groups the authors introduced chitosan and melamine for their abundant functional groups to the alginate aerogel and obtained one composite aerogel with superior properties and significantly enhanced adsorption capacity for heavy metal ions introducing chitosan and melamine was found to increase the aerogel adsorbing sites for lead ions and reinforce the 3d network skeleton structure of the aerogel and thus can serve for more adsorption regeneration cycles chelation reaction could have occurred due to introducing such biopolymers due to their retch surface area with oh cooh groups which interact with heavy metal ions such as pb ii 115 the amino groups also provide lone electrons which can pair with the heavy metal ions increasing binding energy and enhancing adsorption 116 the main removal mechanisms for biopolymeric aerogel were owed to the abundant nh2 oh and cooh in the surface of the aerogel the heavy metal ions were caught during the direct contact which stuck on its surface structure 114 117 some heavy metal ions such as lead are removed by ion exchange with calcium ions also present in such an aerogel structure for the regeneration process of these biopolymeric aerogels the authors used hno3 and they were able to release all the pb ii ions without any loss in the absorptive ability 114 in a different study wu et al 108 modified graphene aerogels by two methods amino functionalized graphene aerogel and carbon nanotubes enhanced graphene aerogel to improve its physical chemical and absorption properties for water treatment applications introducing carbon nanotubes was found to support the mechanical properties of graphene aerogel and improve its microstructure the authors used ethylenediamine as a reduction agent for introducing the amino functional groups on the surface of graphene layers which can interact with oxygen containing groups of graphene owing to the chemical reaction between the amino groups nh2 and formaldehyde a significant improvement of the adsorption capacity of formaldehyde was achieved 0 62 mg g however incorporating the carbon nanotubes with this modified aerogel enhanced the adsorption of modified aerogel using the two methods of modification resulted in adsorption capacity reaching 27 43 mg g these results indicate that chemical adsorption can be used to adsorb other chemicals than formaldehyde by modifying the surface chemistry of aerogel carbon aerogel has been used as a promising metal free catalyst due to its excellent electrical conductivity good chemical stability under both acidic and basic conditions as well as high thermal stability 118 for the first time jiang et al 110 fabricated a novel porous carbon aerogel with d glucose aniline and ammonium persulfate using a hydro thermal carbonization approach for the activation of persulfate to degrade rhodamine b organic dye the nature carbon aerogel and the defective edges at its boundary facilitated the rhodamine b removal the authors indicated that persulfate bonded with cc in the sp2 hybridized system directly degrading rhodamine b this approach considers a new strategy in polluted water treatment the complex system of the porous aerogels can even be furtherly modified for degrading other compounds in the water 3 2 modifying the hydrophilic nature of precursor materials biopolymer based aerogels have also been used in oil separation and other polluted water treatment applications the chemical modification of hydrophilic polymers such as cellulose is required to turn the aerogel hydrophobic rafieian et al 119 developed low density and high porosity hydrophobic nanostructured aerogels from nano cellulose by a simple freeze drying approach the authors used chemical vapour deposition of hexadecyl trimethoxysilane to modify the aerogel and remove oil and organic pollutants from the water the authors stated that all their modified aerogel had a greater than 90 contact angle classified as hydrophobic materials the porosity of aerogel was also enhanced after the modification and the density also increased furthermore the modified aerogel was found to have better adsorption capacities to motor and cooking oils in a different study cervin et al 112 used vapour phase deposition and treated nanocellulose aerogels with octyl trichlorosilane to obtain cellulose based aerogel s super hydrophobic surfaces in the vapour deposition process it has been reported that the hydroxyls are removed by their interaction with silane which changes the nature of the aerogel into a hydrophobic state zhang et al 120 explained the mechanism of this process fig 5 after the successful preparation of a novel hydrophobic poly vinyl chloride carbon nanotubes aerogels the authors dispersed a certain amount of carbon nanotubes in water and combined it with poly vinyl chloride solution in the presence of ferric iron this composition then underwent a hydrothermal process followed by freeze thawing and freeze drying to obtain the aerogel which was finally modified by the vapour deposition of trimethyl chloro silane tmcs to obtain the hydrophobic aerogel ferric iron was found to play an essential role in this process by forming a transition state structure with the polymer particles through the complexation of hydroxyl groups the hydroxyl groups under the ferric iron catalysis can be activated and converted giving them a chance to form various chemical links on the polymer chain such as carbon oxygen double bonds and carbon carbon as the degree of reaction increases the hydrophobic groups cause shrinkage of some polymer regions making the hydrophobic segments gradually agglomerate 3 3 modifying the mechanical properties of aerogels as a porous material the mechanical properties of aerogels are very important in many applications especially infiltration and polluted water treatment which require good compressive elasticity 121 the mechanical strength and elasticity are directly proportional to the concentration of precursor materials karamikamkar et al 122 reported several approaches that can be used to improve aerogels mechanical properties including the use of flexible precursor material s changing the concentration of precursor material s and adding suitable materials surface cross linker s and changing the fabrication method pure cellulose aerogel is known to have weak mechanical properties it s held together by hydrogen bonds and physical entanglement 123 thus bending damage to hydrogen bonds usually occur upon subjecting the aerogel to any external force causing severe damage to physical crosslinking points finally the aerogel remains slippage or unwrapping 124 numerous attempts have been made to enhance the performance improve the mechanical strength of cellulose aerogels by adding inorganic fillers such as tio2 125 nano silica 126 hydroxyapatite 127 and graphene 128 in a recent study tang et al 129 modified wheat straw cellulose aerogel by using the polyester plasticizer poly propylene glycol adipate by directly mixing the two materials and reported significant enhancement in mechanical strength of cellulose aerogel and the adsorption capacity for dyes great efforts have been made in the past few years regarding improving the elasticity of inorganic aerogels such as graphene aerogels using various strategies including adjusting the pore structure to different shapes 130 changing the solvent for self assembly 131 and using cross linkers 132 many studies have reported significant improvement in graphene aerogel s elasticity upon changing the pores shape 130 133 graphene oxide has been used as a reinforcing filler to enhance sodium alginate aerogel s mechanical strength and elasticity 134 the sodium alginate graphene oxide aerogel compression strength was 324 kpa without major reduction even after five compression cycles the integration of graphene oxide was also found to improve the porous aerogel structure which is essential in enhancing absorbability and strength toughness 135 yang et al 136 demonstrated that the self assembled chemically modified graphene aerogels have intrinsic compressive elasticity in addition to reversible transition from elasticity to plasticity upon water adsorption in a different study graphene oxide has been incorporated with carboxymethyl chitosan aerogels to increase compressive strength enhance its elasticity and resist pressure 137 the modified aerogel had elastic modulus and compressive strength of 368 35 and 16 77 mpa respectively higher than the control silica aerogels have fine structures and highly hydrophilic surfaces and are fragile and impractical for adsorbing non polar solvents limiting their utilization in water treatment applications to improve the mechanical properties of silica aerogels shi et al 138 incorporated small amounts of poly acrylonitrile fibers into the aerogel mixture at mild temperatures they reported significant changes in pore structure size and surface morphology the modified aerogel was superhydrophobic due to converting the hydroxyl and alkoxy surface groups to stable methyl groups with a surprising contact angle as high as 169 owing to the strong mechanical properties the authors reported that sorption and desorption process of modified aerogel can be repeated at least 100 times 3 4 modification aerogels for controllable adsorption desorption behavior although many aerogels have been developed to have excellent adsorption performance for various water pollutants the regeneration ability and the reusability of these aerogels have always been a great challenge they are probably the prime factor in determining the feasibility and production cost of the aerogel in practical applications 114 graphene oxide based aerogels have been linked with difficulty completely recovering after the adsorption of some heavy metal ions such as uranium u vi due to the low density of its functional groups however liao et al 139 have utilized the special chemical properties of poly dopamine to modify the surface of graphene oxide aerogel and then cross link it with chitosan to fabricate highly porous 3d aerogel with modified regeneration ability the authors reported that modified aerogel showed enhanced active sites for the adsorption of uranium ions the adsorption rate was very fast with significantly enhanced adsorption capacity 415 9 mg g furthermore due to modified aerogel s high thermal and mechanical stability the authors could recycle the aerogel six times without decreasing adsorption rate or capacity this modification enhanced the adsorption and desorption of heavy metals providing a promising potential for developing advanced functional materials for water treatment in different studies aiming to avoid chemical usage and reduce costs fan et al 140 have modified chitosan aerogel adsorbent to be responsive to co2 the authors fabricated the aerogel by physicochemical double crosslinking of chitosan with co2 responsive poly acrylic acid 2 dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate and enhanced the adsorption capacity by 162 interestingly the authors could desorb the adsorbed pollutant by co2 bubbling with a desorption rate exceeding 80 fig 6 co2 as a desorption agent is safer than a strong acid as much biopolymer based aerogel cannot resist the strong acidic condition different acids such as hcl h2so4 and hno3 have been used as eluents for aerogel adsorbents due to the high affinity of h for adsorption onto the electron donating groups present in the surface of the aerogel resulting in the replacement of adsorbed ions from the adsorbent 114 modified aerogel has recently been fabricated to respond to specific stimuli as smart adsorbent materials for polluted water treatment applications these smart aerogels were designed to reversibly adsorb and desorb the specific water pollutant under a variety of external stimulation including magnetic field 141 ph 142 temperature 143

monitored the adsorption behavior of the heavy metal ions fig 8 the fluorescence effect of the carbon quantum dots in the material was found to decrease with the increase of adsorbed heavy metal ions these results may open the doors to developing advanced sensors that simultaneously detect and adsorb heavy metal ions to better perception for heavy metal ion adsorption the adsorption mechanism its kinetic predictions and the ph condition are essential to understand the adsorption equilibrium of each heavy metal the required time and adsorption rate 153 several researchers have presented numerous adsorption kinetic models including intraparticle diffusion pseudo first and second order sips and langmuir 154 ph was also essential to optimize the removal efficiency for most heavy metal

water in a clean highly safe and effective way adsorb undesired materials graphene and carbon based aerogels have also been highly used these materials may not be as safe as biopolymers still they can be manufactured through an environmentally friendly approach without using hazardous chemicals however a recent study showed the ability of some sludge microorganisms to grow on the surface of the graphene oxide nanocomposites in contrast another study has proved that modification of graphene could significantly enhance its biodegradation 228 229 monitoring of environmental pollutants is an interesting application for many researchers in which aerogels could be furtherly utilized the high surface area of these materials and the ability to alter the surface chemistry open tremendous potential in sensing different pollutants such as heavy metal ions dyes or any other toxic compounds the scientists convening themselves that the era of nanostructured aerogels has just started and

mg l was softened using sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate to precipitate scaling cations after ph adjustment the softened pw contained mainly sodium chloride with some bicarbonate and traces of other elements both the softened pw and a simulated softened pw were converted into diluates and concentrates using electrodialysis in two stages the stages were defined by a fixed recovery of the diluate mass balances for trace ions in the softened produced water revealed a significant effect of sequestration and release by the ion exchange membranes two anionic species bicarbonate and silicate accumulated in the diluate due to low transport through the anion exchange membranes the final diluate had a sufficiently low tds that could be further treated by reverse osmosis the metrics

ii ions range from 5000 to 22 000 mg l if a centralized treatment facility is employed then a major cost and hazard arise from transportation of the pw from the well site to the facility on site treatment to reduce the amount of hypersaline water to be transported may be economically attractive technologies with the capability of processing hypersaline solutions are broadly classified as thermal and membrane methods issues with conventional thermal desalination technologies are high investment costs energy requirements and associated energy costs and large footprints of the thermal methods the most viable for hypersaline solutions is mechanical vapor compression mvc or recompression mvr 2 the specific energy requirements for mvc units depend on feed salinity temperature differences compression efficiencies and recovery ratios typical values range from 10 to 40 kwh m3 of recovered water 4 mvc requires less pretreatment than membrane technologies its upper tds limit is 200 000 mg l it is not compatible with discontinuous power sources 3 membrane distillation md is also capable of desalinating hypersaline solutions with almost complete salt rejection 3 it has a small footprint and is modular with feed solutions at ambient temperatures and using heat recovery specific energies are estimated to be 40 kwh m3 wetting scaling and fouling can compromise the efficiency of md 5 forward osmosis fo requires a draw solution with a very high tds which can be achieved using ammonia carbon dioxide it is also scalable and modular and is projected to have a lower specific energy than mvc 3 as with all membrane technologies scaling can be detrimental to fo efficiency electrodialysis ed is also a potentially useful method for the management of hypersaline pw solutions 6 7 unlike the preceding methods which require a heat source this technology depends entirely on the driving force of an electric field to move ions through selective membranes ed is scalable with little variation in performance with respect to size it is capable of rapid starts and stops on a time scale of seconds and thus is compatible with renewable energy sources and with systems designed to operate at times of lower electricity costs with current reversal ed can handle solutions with mild scaling potentials better than other membrane methods as a treatment for polymer flooded produced water ed has the benefit of retaining some of the polymer in the water for re use 8 however ed is not efficient for the conversion of the feed water into a diluate stream with very low tds in a single step to achieve very low tds ed may be performed in multiple stages of partial desalination or combined with another technology like reverse osmosis 9 or membrane distillation 10 previous studies have shown the technological feasibility of ed for treatment of concentrated nacl brines mcgovern et al performed ten stages of ed to process nacl solutions from 200 000 mg l to 240 mg l 11 the first three stages contained initial diluate concentrations in the hypersaline range 195 000 mg l 152 000 mg l and 90 000 mg l the final concentration of the diluate in each stage determined the initial concentration of the diluate in the following stage the initial concentrations in the concentrate were set at the limiting concentrations defined by osmosis and electro osmosis metrics obtained for each stage included stage process time stage energy consumption and stage cost per unit of salt removed and per unit of product water chehayeb et al explored the optimization of a two stage ed system with continuous counterflow for processing 73 000 mg l nacl solutions to 230 000 mg l 12 yan et al concentrated 36 000 mg l nacl solutions in 1 2 and 3 stages with initial concentrations of diluate and concentrate exceeding 80 000 mg l in the second and third stages 13 real and simulated pws have been processed by ed one simulated pw feed examined by sirivedhin et al contained 97 600 mg l 7 their objective was the production of water for drinking irrigation and livestock the partial desalination of the hypersaline solution did not meet the concentration requirements for any of the applications the effect of multi valent ions scaling ions on the efficiency of ed was reported by severin and hayes a high concentration of calcium 4000 mg l in nacl resulted in scaling on the cathode side of the terminal cem separating the diluate from the na2so4 electrolyte solution 2 a monovalent selective terminal cem mitigated the degradation in desalination efficiency several real pw samples were desalinated using ed with the goal of producing diluate suitable for reuse tds 10 000 mg l 14 prior to ed the pw samples were pre treated by ph adjustment aeration settling and filtration the pre treatment did not reduce the concentrations of group ii scaling cations any sample with a tds greater than 80 000 mg l was diluted to less than 80 000 mg l so that a single ed batch run could achieve the target tds the presence of the divalent group ii cations decreased the overall flux of ions from diluate to concentrate the group ii cations were preferentially transported with respect to sodium voltage reversal temporarily restored high ion fluxes the objective of this study was to examine the treatment and cost effectiveness of ed as a method for treating pw to produce diluants and concentrates suitable for existing commercial desalination technologies i e ro and crystallization both field collected pw and simulated solutions were used in this study to compare relevant chemical and energy metrics rather than trying to achieve targeted tds values in a single stage we emulated the multi stage approach of the lienhard group with each stage designed to minimize energy costs 11 15 the pw feed was converted into a diluate and a concentrate in the first stage the second stage used the diluate from the first stage as the feed solution in both the diluate and concentrate reservoirs stages were terminated when diluate recovery reached 60 this protocol was designed to minimize the energy costs of desalination by avoiding the rise in voltage associated with the onset of limiting current behavior ed was performed using constant current to understand the effects of this key variable on the metrics the constant current and accurate volume measurements revealed the relative effects of osmosis and electro osmosis on the unavoidable transport of water from the diluate to the concentrate because of the high concentrations of group ii ions the pw sample was first softened by treatment with sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide the softened pw contained residual concentrations of group ii ions and silicates and these species were tracked through the two stages of ed mass balances demonstrated that the ion exchange membranes functioned as a reservoir for uptake and release of these species in succeeding batches to avoid ph changes in the electrode solution and potential scaling with sulfate salts 2 sodium bicarbonate was used as the electrolyte multiple performance metrics desalination efficiency chemical fluxes in the form of current efficiencies and energy consumption per volume of recovered diluate and per kilogram of salt transferred are provided in addition treatment costs m3 were estimated using a simple model 11 while the energy costs were not favorable with respect to mechanical vapor compression treatment costs were favorable 2 materials and methods a pw sample from the experimental well at the marcellus shale energy and environment laboratory mseel of west virginia university was obtained in 2020 the tds 161 000 mg l and total concentration of group ii cations 31 000 mg l were substantially higher than the values obtained in 2015 fig s1 other elements present in low 10 mg l concentrations included aluminum cobalt manganese and zinc sulfate concentrations were below the limit of detection the solution as collected contained a visible suspension of a reddish floc the redox potential 407 mv vs she indicated that a fraction of the iron present was in the reduced 2 oxidation state the solution was treated with hydrogen peroxide 1 ml of 30 h2o2 per liter of pw the redox potential rose to a value above 750 mv vs she indicating complete oxidation of iron ii to iron iii this step reduced the consumption of hydroxide in the next step and reduced the time needed to achieve the target ph the ph of the solution was raised to 10 by adding 50 sodium hydroxide solution 6 ml l of pw using the measured hardness the stoichiometric amount of sodium carbonate 52 g l of pw was added slowly in the form of a 3 m na2co3 318 000 mg l solution while stirring the solution vigorously after settling the supernatant was passed through a 0 22 micron pvdf filter the final yield was greater than 0 9 l of softened pw for 1 l of untreated pw since high ph was potentially damaging for the ion exchange membranes the ph of the filtered softened water was adjusted to 7 using concentrated 12 m hydrochloric acid 2 3 ml l of softened pw this solution contained 132 000 mg l tds 1400 mg l nahco3 a hardness of 90 mg l caco3 and traces of other cations and anions table 1 ed was performed with a pccell 64 unit containing 20 pc sa anion exchange membranes 19 pc sk cation exchange membranes and two pc mte terminal cation exchange membranes properties of the membranes are provided in the supplementary material the bolts and nuts clamping the end supports were tightened to a torque setting of 2 8 n m a single peristaltic pump fisher simultaneously delivered diluate concentrate and electrode solutions from three reservoirs to the pccell fig 1 the capacity of the diluate and concentrate reservoirs were 500 ml while the electrode reservoir capacity was 200 ml volume markings on the diluate and concentrate reservoirs permitted volume measurements with a precision of 1 ml the solutions in the reservoirs were magnetically stirred preliminary experiments with varying pumping speeds showed little effect on the cell voltages at constant current the peristaltic pump was operated at a rotation speed of one half of the maximum rotation speed to maximize tubing life the corresponding volume flow rate was approximately 1 ml s for each of the three solutions the electrolyte solution passed through the pump the cathode compartment and then the anode compartment before returning to the electrode reservoir no attempt was made to remove the gas bubbles generated by the cathode hydrogen and anode oxygen the base generated by water reduction in the cathode compartment was expected to be neutralized by the acid generated by water oxidation in the anode compartment preliminary experiments with sodium sulfate as the electrolyte showed that the electrode solution became progressively more alkaline indicating that base and acid productions were not balanced regulation of electrolyte ph was essential because of the stability range for the terminal pc mte cation exchange membranes ph 1 8 the electrode solution containing 84 000 mg l 1 m sodium bicarbonate kept the ph in the 7 8 range titrations of the electrode solution before and after ed showed that a small fraction 10 of the bicarbonate was consumed spacers between the membranes have a nominal thickness of 0 045 cm based on this value the calculated total volume in the 20 diluate chambers 8 8 cm was 58 cm3 the actual dead volume 29 2 cm3 was measured by observing the volume change in the diluate reservoir while filling the cell and correcting for the volume of the tubing the same total dead volume was measured for 20 concentrate chambers the lower value of the measured dead volume is attributed to the volume of mesh spacer between each membrane based on the pumping speed of 1 ml s defined by the capabilities of the peristaltic pump a linear velocity of 0 2 cm s was estimated in the diluate and concentrate chambers of the pccell this velocity was lower than typical flow velocities in electrodialysis cells 1 10 cm s as shown by the linear voltage vs current plots in fig s2 there was no evidence for the onset of limiting current behavior indicating the need for a higher linear velocity the temperature of the electrolyte solution was recorded during electrodialysis the pccell was connected to a solartron model 1287a potentiostat galvanostat maximum current 2 a maximum compliance voltage 15 v and a model 1252a frequency response analyzer for all electrochemical measurements except for experiments in which the current exceeded 2 a for the latter experiments the pccell was connected to a keithley model 2280s precision dc power supply impedance measurements were collected from 300 khz to 300 hz at the open circuit voltage with an applied ac voltage of 20 mv rms and zero dc current the smallest in phase impedance was assigned to the ohmic resistance of the cell all electrodialysis experiments were performed using constant current while monitoring the cell voltage galvodynamic scans fig s2 were performed to obtain polarization resistances defined as dv di and to check for indications of limiting current behavior the general protocol included a conditioning stage in which the reservoirs were filled with the initial pw solutions simulated or real the initial compositions of the diluate and concentrate were identical to minimize osmosis during conditioning while the solutions were circulated the impedance of the cell was collected periodically a galvanodynamic scan current sweep from 0 to 1 92 to 0 a at 50 ma s was performed in each conditioning step generally the ohmic resistance decreased with time to a nearly constant value after conditioning the reservoirs were emptied and re filled and the solutions were circulated for at least 15 min samples of the diluate and concentrate were collected just before ed since actual concentrations deviated slightly from stock concentrations after ed the solutions were immediately back pumped to the reservoirs to halt osmosis and samples of diluate and concentrate were again collected analyses of the samples collected before and after ed were used to determine mass balances and current efficiencies in some cases the impedance of the cell was measured after ed and prior to back pumping the produced water was processed in two stages with the diluate of the first stage used as the initial diluate and concentrate solutions in the second stage initial volumes were 500 ml of diluate 100 ml of concentrate and 180 ml of electrode solution the time of ed was set so that the final volume of the diluate was approximately 70 of the initial volume corresponding to an overall diluate recovery of 60 volumes of the diluate were recorded periodically during ed final volumes of the concentrate were also recorded to confirm total volume changes because of the greater thicknesses of the terminal cation exchange membranes osmotic volume changes were not detected in any of the three solutions during conditioning tds measurements bicarbonate concentrations and hardness were performed using standard methods 16 elemental analyses were performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry performance metrics include recovery ratio of final diluate volume to initial diluate concentrate volume expressed

transport number of the ion the transport number is the flux of the ion relative to the total flux of all ions when eq 1 is applied to the flux of water it is customary to use the term water transport number 11 since sodium accounted for almost all of the positive charge transferred from diluate to concentrate the overall current efficiency expressed as a percentage is equal to the sodium current efficiency energies in kilowatt hours were calculated from the time integrated voltage plots the voltages were corrected for the estimated electrode voltages specific costs were calculated based on a model provided by the lienhard group 11 17 3 results 3 1 simulated softened pw initial ed experiments were performed with simulated softened pw in two stages the impedance spectrum of the pccell in the simulated pw for stage 1 is shown in fig s3 all softened pw solutions both simulated and real yielded similar impedance spectra the ohmic resistance was assigned to the smallest in phase impedance value table 2 summarizes the ohmic resistances obtained by eis for the two stages areal ohmic resistances were 9 9 ω cm2 per aem cem pair for stage 1 and 12 ω cm2 per aem cem pair for stage 2 the 20 increase in ohmic resistances going from stage 1 to stage 2 was less than the 38 decrease in salt concentration at these high salinities ohmic resistance was dominated by the resistances of the membranes the polarization resistance of the cell obtained from the gd scan was 15 25 higher than the ohmic resistance in constant current experiments increasing the current magnitude affected the metrics of ed in positive shorter ed times reduced osmotic water transfer and negative ways reduced current efficiencies increased specific energies a symptom of limiting current behavior is a sharp increase in voltage with increasing current galvanodynamic scans fig s2 to 1 92 a showed that for initial concentrations the voltage was linear with respect to current with little hysteresis between the forward and reverse scan the currents used in the experiments 1 2 1 8 and 2 4 a corresponded to approximate current densities of 200 300 and 400 a m2 the effects of current magnitude for constant current experiments are shown in fig s4 for the simulated pw solution the ed times 1350 s 1800 s and 2700 s were adjusted to achieve a constant total charge 3240 c and nearly identical recoveries of diluate the voltages 7 3 9 5 and 11 2 were nearly constant 0 1 v during ed and did not exhibit the steep rise indicative of limiting current behavior even at 2 4 a fig s4 in experiments in which ohmic resistance was measured immediately after ed the final value was 10 lower than the initial value the decrease in resistance was attributed to temperature changes temperatures for all three currents started near 25 c and increased by 2 4 3 0 and 4 1 c respectively fig s5 the total voltage was divided into three parts electrode voltage differences in electrode potentials ir drop and polarization losses defined as voltage drops across depletion layers formed during current flow 17 18 estimated electrode voltages were 2 6 2 7 and 2 8 v for the three currents subtracting these electrode voltages from the initial cell voltages 7 0 9 1 and 11 3 v yielded 0 22 0 32 and 0 43 v per aem cem pair respectively voltages due to ir drop ohmic resistance times current and the electrode voltages comprised 90 of the cell voltages at all three currents the remaining 10 is assigned to polarization loss due to depletion layers in the membranes the polarization losses account for the higher values of the gd resistances in table 2 the diluate volumes are plotted in fig 2 with respect to time left chart and to charge passed right chart the volume vs time data were fitted to quadratic equations r2 0 9999 the slopes dv dt of the quadratic equations were converted to mol s of water and eq 1 was used to obtain water transport numbers based on the slopes at the beginning of electrodialysis initial water transport numbers of 9 8 0 1 9 5 0 1 and 9 3 0 1 were obtained for 1 2 1 8 and 2 4 a the initial water transport numbers were attributed to electro osmosis since the initial diluate and concentrate solutions were identical the slopes of the quadratic equations near the end of electrodialysis yielded water transport numbers of 14 2 0 2 12 7 0 3 and 12 1 0 2 the increase in the water transport numbers relative to the initial values is attributed to osmosis and is consistent with the reported water permeances of pccell ion exchange membranes by kingsbury et al supplementary information 19 20 table 3 contains the metrics for the synthetic softened water at the three currents in stage 1 current efficiencies for sodium chloride bicarbonate and transport numbers for water were calculated using eq 1 for the entire ed period recoveries overall current efficiencies and chloride current efficiencies were at most weakly dependent on the current the increase in overall current efficiencies from stage 1 to stage 2 was attributed to reductions in the mechanisms that reduce current efficiency such as co transport of cations and anions across membranes and back diffusion as concentrations in the diluate and concentrate diverge the current efficiencies for na and cl were consistent with theoretical salt transport numbers 21 and with values reported for a similar ed cell 11 specific energies were calculated using the final diluate volumes and the voltages vs time after subtracting the estimated electrode voltages the specific energies and salt transport energies increased linearly with current due to the condition of fixed total charge p t v i 2 r q i v where r q and v are constant while final diluate concentrations were slightly dependent on current the final concentrations in the concentrate clearly increased with current and were close to the limit of mvc 200 g l this trend is predicted theoretically 21 and is due to shorter times for osmosis to dilute the concentrate the current efficiencies for bicarbonate were lower than expected based on concentration ratios and electrophoretic mobilities the ratio of chloride molarity to bicarbonate molarity in stage 1 is 17 the ratio of electrophoretic mobilities of chloride to bicarbonate in water is 1 7 so the combined flux ratio of chloride to bicarbonate in water is 29 the predicted current efficiency of bicarbonate in water for stage 1 is 0 027 well above the observed 0 01 mean value in table 2 geise et al 22 noted that transport numbers for bicarbonate in aems were difficult to measure via membrane potentials because of the presence of carbonate as well as bicarbonate so a precedent for this observation was not found the low bicarbonate current efficiencies resulted in an increase in bicarbonate concentration in the diluate and a decrease in the concentrate in stage 2 ed was performed on the combined diluate in the preceding experiment 92 g l nacl 6 g l nahco3 fig s6 the galvanodynamic scan performed during conditioning was linear with little hysteresis up to 1 92 a a constant current of 1 8 a was selected to avoid possible limiting current behavior at a higher current the time for 70 recovery of the diluate was 1610 s 2898 c the voltage rose from 10 2 to 11 0 v these values correspond to 0 38 and 0 42 v per aem cem pair the temperature increased by 3 2 c ohmic voltage drop 6 5 v and estimated electrode voltage 2 7 v accounted for 90 to 83 of the cell voltage relative to stage 1 metrics at 1 8 a overall and specific current efficiencies increased slightly while specific energies were nearly the same for 1 8 a the salt transport energy decreased because of the higher overall current efficiency the salt transport energies in table 3 are similar to the ones reported by mcgovern et al 11 current efficiency numbers for bicarbonate remained low and the bicarbonate concentrations increased slightly in the final diluate solutions based on a quadratic fit of diluate volume vs time the water transport number varied from 10 7 to 14 4 with an average of 12 1 the final diluate concentration tds 56 5 g l was low enough to permit processing by ro the final concentrate tds 163 g l could be mixed with a new batch softened pw for further processing and increased recovery of the final diluate 3 2 softened pw softened pw was mainly 132 g l nacl and 1 4 g l nahco3 fig s7 shows the voltage vs time plots and fig s8 the volume vs time plots for three successive ed trials on the softened pw sample in the first stage after removing the concentrate and diluate from the cell and reservoirs fresh softened pw was placed in the reservoirs for the following trial based on metrics for simulated produced water favoring the highest current the current was fixed at 2 4 a and the ed times at 1350 s total charge 3240 c ohmic resistances before ed were 3 28 3 10 and 3 07 ω 10 ω cm2 per aem cem pair the temperature of the solutions rose 4 c during ed all three trials exhibited nearly constant voltages between 11 and 12 v 0 41 0 46 v per aem cem pair together electrode potentials and the ohmic voltage drop accounted for 90 of the voltage of the cell based on quadratic fits of diluate volume vs charge the initial and final transport numbers for water were 9 4 0 2 and 12 0 0 3 for all 3 trials the average was 10 5 for the overall transport in each of the three trials table 1 lists the final concentrations of all measured species in the diluate in stage 1 and stage 2 table 4 contains the metrics for the three trials for stage 1 ed of softened pw assuming that the major constituents were nacl and nahco3 apart from the nahco3 values the metric values for softened pw were similar to the values listed for the simulated softened pw in table 3 the current efficiency for bicarbonate was at the uncertainty level however the bicarbonate concentration increased in the diluate as it did in the simulated softened pw the ratios of the concentrations in the final diluate and concentrates relative to the initial concentrations are shown in figs 3 and 4 the data falls into two groups the first group shows consistent ratios for the three runs fig 3 chloride is included for reference average diluate ratios were 0 58 for k 1 28 for si and 0 76 for cl and average concentrate ratios were 1 79 for k 0 87 for si and 1 54 for cl the ratios indicate that potassium was transported from diluate to concentrate with greater selectivity than sodium the inverted behavior of silicon was similar to that of bicarbonate we speculate that silicon exists as silicate species and that the anion exchange membranes were permselective against silicates as a result silicates accumulated in the diluate during ed table 1 the concentrations of group ii cations expressed as ratios with respect to initial concentrations in fig 4 increased in both the diluate and concentrate in succeeding trials this behavior suggests that the group ii cations were accumulating in the cation exchange membranes during ed and then releasing back into the diluate and concentrate in the succeeding trial another way of showing the accumulation and release of these ions is through mass balances for the ions in the diluate and concentrate fig s9 mass balances for na and cl were within 1 potassium magnesium strontium and especially calcium and barium exhibited large increases in mass up to 270 for ca relative to the masses in the softened pw an estimate of the total cation exchange capacity of the 19 internal cems pc sk and 2 terminal cems pc mte is 24 meq supplemental information the total milliequivalents of the group ii cations in the initial volumes of the diluate and concentrate 0 6 l 0 47 meq is 2 of the total cation exchange capacity so it is reasonable that the cems can sequester and release these cations from batch to batch a cleaning step was implemented to wash out the accumulated ions before continuing with stage 2 of the ed the cell was conditioned with a solution of 130 g l sodium chloride 5 g l sodium bicarbonate in the diluate and concentrate chambers and 84 g l sodium bicarbonate in the electrode chambers current was passed through the cell to drive out sequestered ions the cell was emptied and then conditioned with current flow using the mixed diluate from stage 1 with current flow the cell was emptied and refilled with fresh mixed diluate before proceeding to stage 2 ed as with the simulated softened pw a current of 1 8 a was applied for 1600 s 2880 c during stage 2 voltage vs time and diluate volume vs time are shown in figs s7 and s8 respectively the voltage was 10 3 0 1 v 0 38 v per aem cem pair and the temperature increased by 3 6 c ohmic voltage drop 6 6 v and estimated electrode voltage 2 7 v accounted for 90 of the cell voltage relative to stage 1 current efficiencies of ions and transport numbers of water increased slightly while the specific energy and salt transport energy decreased table 4 current efficiencies for bicarbonate remained near the uncertainty level and the bicarbonate concentrations showed little change from the quadratic fit of diluate volume vs charge initial and final water transport numbers were 10 4 and 14 9 with an overall average of 12 7 the final diluate concentration tds 54 g l was low enough to permit processing by reverse osmosis the final concentrate tds 158 g l could be mixed with fresh softened pw for further processing the fate of trace elements in stage 2 ed is shown in table 1 fig 5 contains the ratios of the final diluate concentrations and final concentrate concentrations relative to the initial concentrations for the trace elements na and cl ratios are included for comparison relative to na the elements k ca sr and ba exhibited lower ratios for the diluate and higher ratios for the concentrate suggesting that these elements were preferentially transported across the cation exchange membranes silicon exhibited the opposite pattern as it did in stage 1 ed mass balances for these same ions are shown in fig s10 while the mass balances for na and cl were within 0 5 ca exhibited a gain in mass and k mg sr and ba a loss of mass the membranes were releasing ca or absorbing the other ions during this single ed despite the conditioning step 4 cost analysis mcgovern and co workers have provided two models for estimating costs per unit of diluate product the first model 11 23 focuses on energy costs and capital costs while ignoring pre treatment post treatment maintenance and replacement costs pumping power costs are negligible for hypersaline feed solutions 24 the second model includes cost estimates of maintenance such as membrane replacement labor and chemicals 24 the following analysis is based on the first model the specific cost of water spc is given by eq 2 2 spc k e e w k q a m τ w r 1 1 1 1 r t ke is the fixed electricity cost kwh ew is the specific energy for diluate product kwh m3 kq is the specific capital cost of the equipment per unit area of membrane m2 am is the membrane area m2 τw is the specific process time years m3 r is the annualized cost of capital year and t is the lifetime of the system years am is the total membrane area in the pccell 0 128 m2 the remaining parameters are taken from mcgovern and coworkers r 10 year t 20 years ke 0 15 kwh and kq 1500 m2 11 currents ed times final diluate volumes and specific energies obtained for the simulated softened pw in stage 1 3 currents and stage 2 1 current were used to provide values for the energy costs the first term and the capital costs second term fig 6 shows the effect of current in stage 1 energy costs increase linearly with current but capital costs decrease because for a fixed charge the specific process time is inversely proportional to the current the minimum total specific cost 5 6 m3 occurs at 2 4 a for the single current of 1 8 a selected for stage 2 the specific energy cost is 5 7 m3 the sum of the 2 stage specific costs 11 3 m3 compares favorably with the estimated specific cost of mechanical vapor compression 20 m3 11 5 discussion electrodialysis of hypersaline solutions permitted several variations from customary electrodialysis protocols because each stage was stopped at a fixed diluate recovery the diluate concentrations remained high enough to avoid the onset of limiting current behavior consequently pumping speed was not an important variable the low linear velocity 0 2 cm s reduced the back pressures on the membranes the corresponding pumping energy was not estimated but can be expected to be significantly lower than for higher linear velocities other variations included the use of constant current rather than constant voltage and a sodium bicarbonate electrode solution the constant current kept the current density uniform during electrodialysis and permitted close control of the length of time required to reach 60 recovery of diluate sodium bicarbonate buffered the electrode solution sufficiently to avoid ph swings outside the stability range of the terminal cation exchange membranes softening the produced water effectively reduced the concentrations of scaling cations group ii cations fe al to sufficiently low values 10 mg l that scaling was not a problem for electrodialysis in these experiments the resulting softened water was mainly a solution of nacl and nahco3 with the latter concentration depending on the accuracy of the addition of sodium carbonate in stoichiometric amounts this work did not examine the long term effects of processing much larger volumes of water in each stage as noted below periodic flushing of the ed system with pure nacl solutions may be needed to remove scaling ions sequestered in the ion exchange membranes for both the simulated and real softened pw partial desalination sufficient for a diluate product compatible with ro was accomplished in two stages of ed with each stage designed to achieve a 60 recovery of diluate relative to the initial volumes of diluate and concentrate this choice of recovery and the high concentrations of diluate and concentrate in all cases resulted in nearly constant voltages during ed galvanodynamic scans collected during conditioning were linear with little hysteresis between the forward and reverse scans supplementary information there was no hint of limiting current behavior during ed under these conditions while the overall recovery of diluate for the two stages was low 36 the diluate recovery could be improved to 50 by mixing the concentrate product of stage 2 with fresh softened pw for stage 1 processing the recovery of diluate could also be improved by increasing the initial volume ratio of diluate to concentrate the concentrate products of stage 1 ed approached tds values of 200 000 mg l similar to the limiting value for mechanical vapor compression 4 metrics for equivalent processing conditions and stages for softened pw and simulated softened pw were very similar tables 3 and 4 the small differences were attributed in part to the higher concentration of sodium bicarbonate in the simulated softened pw both data sets demonstrated that overall current efficiencies were consistently close to 80 careful measurements of diluate volume vs time or equivalently volume vs charge demonstrated that the volume change was nonlinear with the slope magnitude increasing with time the simplest nonlinear function a quadratic equation of volume vs time fitted the data adequately the slopes of the quadratic equation were used to calculate the water transport number at the beginning and end of each ed period for the conditions used in this study the initial water transport values were 9 5 0 3 for stage 1 and 10 5 0 2 for stage 2 these values were assigned to electro osmosis since the diluate and concentrate had identical initial concentrations the final water transport numbers were 30 higher because of increasing osmosis from the diluate to the concentrate specific energies increased with the applied current and with time choosing 2 4 a for stage 1 and 1 8 a for stage 2 and adhering to the 60 recovery requirement led to specific energies of 20 1 kwh m3 for stage 1 and 16 5 kwh m3 for stage 2 for comparison stage 2 in the study by mcgovern et al converted a diluate with an initial concentration of 152 g l nacl to 90 g l with a specific energy of 42 kwh m3 and stage 3 converted the 90 g l diluate to a 41 g l product using 20 kwh m3 11 these specific energies for partial desalination do not compare favorably with the large scale figures for complete desalination via other technologies 32 50 kwh m3 for mvc with 72 5 recovery 11 40 kwh m3 for md 3 however we believe that ed shows promise for a small scale partial desalination operation and especially for an operation dependent on intermittent electrical power the group ii ions and potassium exhibited a tendency to sequester into the cation exchange membranes and then release back into the diluate and concentrate over repeated batch processing for stage 1 in a single batch ed stage 2 some of the ions k mg sr ba were sequestered and ca is released the effects of ion sequestration and release were exacerbated in this study because of the low ratio of solutions volumes to total ion exchange membrane area permselectivity was observed for two anionic species bicarbonate and silicate these species tended to remain in the diluate and their concentrations increased with ed time for longer time scales and larger volumes it may be necessary to condition the ed cell periodically with clean nacl solutions to avoid scaling problems 6 summary electrodialysis can be a viable option for treating produced water and other hypersaline feedstocks where volume flows are small transportation costs are high and electricity supplies are intermittent softening is recommended for ed of the produced water with high concentrations of group ii ions to minimize energy costs partial desalination was performed in two stages with each stage designed to avoid limiting current behavior with its associated rise in cell voltage for the benefit of the desalination community a plethora of metrics recoveries current efficiencies transport numbers of water specific energies and salt transport energies are provided for two stages of partial desalination of produced water from an experimental fracking well and for simulated softened water the use of constant current and precise volume measurements permitted an evaluation of the relative effects of electro osmosis

13199,electrodialysis ed is one of several technologies for treating hypersaline solutions such as produced water pw a sample of pw collected from an experimental well total dissolved solids 161 000 mg l was softened using sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate to precipitate scaling cations after ph adjustment the softened pw contained mainly sodium chloride with some bicarbonate and traces of other elements both the softened pw and a simulated softened pw were converted into diluates and concentrates using electrodialysis in two stages the stages were defined by a fixed recovery of the diluate mass balances for trace ions in the softened produced water revealed a significant effect of sequestration and release by the ion exchange membranes two anionic species bicarbonate and silicate accumulated in the diluate due to low transport through the anion exchange membranes the final diluate had a sufficiently low tds that could be further treated by reverse osmosis the metrics of the electrodialysis stages current efficiencies of sodium chloride and bicarbonate ions transport number of water specific energies salt transport energies and specific costs and the fate of the trace elements are reported keywords electrodialysis produced water hypersaline softening electrochemical impedance spectroscopy 1 introduction the extraction of oil and gas yields high volumes of hypersaline solutions defined here as solutions with total dissolved solids tds greater than 80 000 mg l produced water pw is the water obtained during the production of oil and gas global volume of pw generated is close to 40 million m3 per day and this figure is expected to increase 1 while reuse of pw in new wells after appropriate treatment is an option 2 the number of new wells is projected to decrease 3 thus requiring other management methods hypersaline desalination technologies should have a low propensity for fouling be modular and scalable for on site treatment and be able to use locally available alternative energy sources 3 in addition the technology must be capable of handling large fluctuations in salinity and composition fig s1 demonstrates the fluctuations in tds and concentrations of na cl and the group ii ions mg ca sr ba over the course of one year in an experimental well the tds values range from 60 000 to 140 000 mg l and the total concentrations of the group ii ions range from 5000 to 22 000 mg l if a centralized treatment facility is employed then a major cost and hazard arise from transportation of the pw from the well site to the facility on site treatment to reduce the amount of hypersaline water to be transported may be economically attractive technologies with the capability of processing hypersaline solutions are broadly classified as thermal and membrane methods issues with conventional thermal desalination technologies are high investment costs energy requirements and associated energy costs and large footprints of the thermal methods the most viable for hypersaline solutions is mechanical vapor compression mvc or recompression mvr 2 the specific energy requirements for mvc units depend on feed salinity temperature differences compression efficiencies and recovery ratios typical values range from 10 to 40 kwh m3 of recovered water 4 mvc requires less pretreatment than membrane technologies its upper tds limit is 200 000 mg l it is not compatible with discontinuous power sources 3 membrane distillation md is also capable of desalinating hypersaline solutions with almost complete salt rejection 3 it has a small footprint and is modular with feed solutions at ambient temperatures and using heat recovery specific energies are estimated to be 40 kwh m3 wetting scaling and fouling can compromise the efficiency of md 5 forward osmosis fo requires a draw solution with a very high tds which can be achieved using ammonia carbon dioxide it is also scalable and modular and is projected to have a lower specific energy than mvc 3 as with all membrane technologies scaling can be detrimental to fo efficiency electrodialysis ed is also a potentially useful method for the management of hypersaline pw solutions 6 7 unlike the preceding methods which require a heat source this technology depends entirely on the driving force of an electric field to move ions through selective membranes ed is scalable with little variation in performance with respect to size it is capable of rapid starts and stops on a time scale of seconds and thus is compatible with renewable energy sources and with systems designed to operate at times of lower electricity costs with current reversal ed can handle solutions with mild scaling potentials better than other membrane methods as a treatment for polymer flooded produced water ed has the benefit of retaining some of the polymer in the water for re use 8 however ed is not efficient for the conversion of the feed water into a diluate stream with very low tds in a single step to achieve very low tds ed may be performed in multiple stages of partial desalination or combined with another technology like reverse osmosis 9 or membrane distillation 10 previous studies have shown the technological feasibility of ed for treatment of concentrated nacl brines mcgovern et al performed ten stages of ed to process nacl solutions from 200 000 mg l to 240 mg l 11 the first three stages contained initial diluate concentrations in the hypersaline range 195 000 mg l 152 000 mg l and 90 000 mg l the final concentration of the diluate in each stage determined the initial concentration of the diluate in the following stage the initial concentrations in the concentrate were set at the limiting concentrations defined by osmosis and electro osmosis metrics obtained for each stage included stage process time stage energy consumption and stage cost per unit of salt removed and per unit of product water chehayeb et al explored the optimization of a two stage ed system with continuous counterflow for processing 73 000 mg l nacl solutions to 230 000 mg l 12 yan et al concentrated 36 000 mg l nacl solutions in 1 2 and 3 stages with initial concentrations of diluate and concentrate exceeding 80 000 mg l in the second and third stages 13 real and simulated pws have been processed by ed one simulated pw feed examined by sirivedhin et al contained 97 600 mg l 7 their objective was the production of water for drinking irrigation and livestock the partial desalination of the hypersaline solution did not meet the concentration requirements for any of the applications the effect of multi valent ions scaling ions on the efficiency of ed was reported by severin and hayes a high concentration of calcium 4000 mg l in nacl resulted in scaling on the cathode side of the terminal cem separating the diluate from the na2so4 electrolyte solution 2 a monovalent selective terminal cem mitigated the degradation in desalination efficiency several real pw samples were desalinated using ed with the goal of producing diluate suitable for reuse tds 10 000 mg l 14 prior to ed the pw samples were pre treated by ph adjustment aeration settling and filtration the pre treatment did not reduce the concentrations of group ii scaling cations any sample with a tds greater than 80 000 mg l was diluted to less than 80 000 mg l so that a single ed batch run could achieve the target tds the presence of the divalent group ii cations decreased the overall flux of ions from diluate to concentrate the group ii cations were preferentially transported with respect to sodium voltage reversal temporarily restored high ion fluxes the objective of this study was to examine the treatment and cost effectiveness of ed as a method for treating pw to produce diluants and concentrates suitable for existing commercial desalination technologies i e ro and crystallization both field collected pw and simulated solutions were used in this study to compare relevant chemical and energy metrics rather than trying to achieve targeted tds values in a single stage we emulated the multi stage approach of the lienhard group with each stage designed to minimize energy costs 11 15 the pw feed was converted into a diluate and a concentrate in the first stage the second stage used the diluate from the first stage as the feed solution in both the diluate and concentrate reservoirs stages were terminated when diluate recovery reached 60 this protocol was designed to minimize the energy costs of desalination by avoiding the rise in voltage associated with the onset of limiting current behavior ed was performed using constant current to understand the effects of this key variable on the metrics the constant current and accurate volume measurements revealed the relative effects of osmosis and electro osmosis on the unavoidable transport of water from the diluate to the concentrate because of the high concentrations of group ii ions the pw sample was first softened by treatment with sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide the softened pw contained residual concentrations of group ii ions and silicates and these species were tracked through the two stages of ed mass balances demonstrated that the ion exchange membranes functioned as a reservoir for uptake and release of these species in succeeding batches to avoid ph changes in the electrode solution and potential scaling with sulfate salts 2 sodium bicarbonate was used as the electrolyte multiple performance metrics desalination efficiency chemical fluxes in the form of current efficiencies and energy consumption per volume of recovered diluate and per kilogram of salt transferred are provided in addition treatment costs m3 were estimated using a simple model 11 while the energy costs were not favorable with respect to mechanical vapor compression treatment costs were favorable 2 materials and methods a pw sample from the experimental well at the marcellus shale energy and environment laboratory mseel of west virginia university was obtained in 2020 the tds 161 000 mg l and total concentration of group ii cations 31 000 mg l were substantially higher than the values obtained in 2015 fig s1 other elements present in low 10 mg l concentrations included aluminum cobalt manganese and zinc sulfate concentrations were below the limit of detection the solution as collected contained a visible suspension of a reddish floc the redox potential 407 mv vs she indicated that a fraction of the iron present was in the reduced 2 oxidation state the solution was treated with hydrogen peroxide 1 ml of 30 h2o2 per liter of pw the redox potential rose to a value above 750 mv vs she indicating complete oxidation of iron ii to iron iii this step reduced the consumption of hydroxide in the next step and reduced the time needed to achieve the target ph the ph of the solution was raised to 10 by adding 50 sodium hydroxide solution 6 ml l of pw using the measured hardness the stoichiometric amount of sodium carbonate 52 g l of pw was added slowly in the form of a 3 m na2co3 318 000 mg l solution while stirring the solution vigorously after settling the supernatant was passed through a 0 22 micron pvdf filter the final yield was greater than 0 9 l of softened pw for 1 l of untreated pw since high ph was potentially damaging for the ion exchange membranes the ph of the filtered softened water was adjusted to 7 using concentrated 12 m hydrochloric acid 2 3 ml l of softened pw this solution contained 132 000 mg l tds 1400 mg l nahco3 a hardness of 90 mg l caco3 and traces of other cations and anions table 1 ed was performed with a pccell 64 unit containing 20 pc sa anion exchange membranes 19 pc sk cation exchange membranes and two pc mte terminal cation exchange membranes properties of the membranes are provided in the supplementary material the bolts and nuts clamping the end supports were tightened to a torque setting of 2 8 n m a single peristaltic pump fisher simultaneously delivered diluate concentrate and electrode solutions from three reservoirs to the pccell fig 1 the capacity of the diluate and concentrate reservoirs were 500 ml while the electrode reservoir capacity was 200 ml volume markings on the diluate and concentrate reservoirs permitted volume measurements with a precision of 1 ml the solutions in the reservoirs were magnetically stirred preliminary experiments with varying pumping speeds showed little effect on the cell voltages at constant current the peristaltic pump was operated at a rotation speed of one half of the maximum rotation speed to maximize tubing life the corresponding volume flow rate was approximately 1 ml s for each of the three solutions the electrolyte solution passed through the pump the cathode compartment and then the anode compartment before returning to the electrode reservoir no attempt was made to remove the gas bubbles generated by the cathode hydrogen and anode oxygen the base generated by water reduction in the cathode compartment was expected to be neutralized by the acid generated by water oxidation in the anode compartment preliminary experiments with sodium sulfate as the electrolyte showed that the electrode solution became progressively more alkaline indicating that base and acid productions were not balanced regulation of electrolyte ph was essential because of the stability range for the terminal pc mte cation exchange membranes ph 1 8 the electrode solution containing 84 000 mg l 1 m sodium bicarbonate kept the ph in the 7 8 range titrations of the electrode solution before and after ed showed that a small fraction 10 of the bicarbonate was consumed spacers between the membranes have a nominal thickness of 0 045 cm based on this value the calculated total volume in the 20 diluate chambers 8 8 cm was 58 cm3 the actual dead volume 29 2 cm3 was measured by observing the volume change in the diluate reservoir while filling the cell and correcting for the volume of the tubing the same total dead volume was measured for 20 concentrate chambers the lower value of the measured dead volume is attributed to the volume of mesh spacer between each membrane based on the pumping speed of 1 ml s defined by the capabilities of the peristaltic pump a linear velocity of 0 2 cm s was estimated in the diluate and concentrate chambers of the pccell this velocity was lower than typical flow velocities in electrodialysis cells 1 10 cm s as shown by the linear voltage vs current plots in fig s2 there was no evidence for the onset of limiting current behavior indicating the need for a higher linear velocity the temperature of the electrolyte solution was recorded during electrodialysis the pccell was connected to a solartron model 1287a potentiostat galvanostat maximum current 2 a maximum compliance voltage 15 v and a model 1252a frequency response analyzer for all electrochemical measurements except for experiments in which the current exceeded 2 a for the latter experiments the pccell was connected to a keithley model 2280s precision dc power supply impedance measurements were collected from 300 khz to 300 hz at the open circuit voltage with an applied ac voltage of 20 mv rms and zero dc current the smallest in phase impedance was assigned to the ohmic resistance of the cell all electrodialysis experiments were performed using constant current while monitoring the cell voltage galvodynamic scans fig s2 were performed to obtain polarization resistances defined as dv di and to check for indications of limiting current behavior the general protocol included a conditioning stage in which the reservoirs were filled with the initial pw solutions simulated or real the initial compositions of the diluate and concentrate were identical to minimize osmosis during conditioning while the solutions were circulated the impedance of the cell was collected periodically a galvanodynamic scan current sweep from 0 to 1 92 to 0 a at 50 ma s was performed in each conditioning step generally the ohmic resistance decreased with time to a nearly constant value after conditioning the reservoirs were emptied and re filled and the solutions were circulated for at least 15 min samples of the diluate and concentrate were collected just before ed since actual concentrations deviated slightly from stock concentrations after ed the solutions were immediately back pumped to the reservoirs to halt osmosis and samples of diluate and concentrate were again collected analyses of the samples collected before and after ed were used to determine mass balances and current efficiencies in some cases the impedance of the cell was measured after ed and prior to back pumping the produced water was processed in two stages with the diluate of the first stage used as the initial diluate and concentrate solutions in the second stage initial volumes were 500 ml of diluate 100 ml of concentrate and 180 ml of electrode solution the time of ed was set so that the final volume of the diluate was approximately 70 of the initial volume corresponding to an overall diluate recovery of 60 volumes of the diluate were recorded periodically during ed final volumes of the concentrate were also recorded to confirm total volume changes because of the greater thicknesses of the terminal cation exchange membranes osmotic volume changes were not detected in any of the three solutions during conditioning tds measurements bicarbonate concentrations and hardness were performed using standard methods 16 elemental analyses were performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry performance metrics include recovery ratio of final diluate volume to initial diluate concentrate volume expressed

transport number of the ion the transport number is the flux of the ion relative to the total flux of all ions when eq 1 is applied to the flux of water it is customary to use the term water transport number 11 since sodium accounted for almost all of the positive charge transferred from diluate to concentrate the overall current efficiency expressed as a percentage is equal to the sodium current efficiency energies in kilowatt hours were calculated from the time integrated voltage plots the voltages were corrected for the estimated electrode voltages specific costs were calculated based on a model provided by the lienhard group 11 17 3 results 3 1 simulated softened pw initial ed experiments were performed with simulated softened pw in two stages the impedance spectrum of the pccell in the simulated pw for stage 1 is shown in fig s3 all softened pw solutions both simulated and real yielded similar impedance spectra the ohmic resistance was assigned to the smallest in phase impedance value table 2 summarizes the ohmic resistances obtained by eis for the two stages areal ohmic resistances were 9 9 ω cm2 per aem cem pair for stage 1 and 12 ω cm2 per aem cem pair for stage 2 the 20 increase in ohmic resistances going from stage 1 to stage 2 was less than the 38 decrease in salt concentration at these high salinities ohmic resistance was dominated by the resistances of the membranes the polarization resistance of the cell obtained from the gd scan was 15 25 higher than the ohmic resistance in constant current experiments increasing the current magnitude affected the metrics of ed in positive shorter ed times reduced osmotic water transfer and negative ways reduced current efficiencies increased specific energies a symptom of limiting current behavior is a sharp increase in voltage with increasing current galvanodynamic scans fig s2 to 1 92 a showed that for initial concentrations the voltage was linear with respect to current with little hysteresis between the forward and reverse scan the currents used in the experiments 1 2 1 8 and 2 4 a corresponded to approximate current densities of 200 300 and 400 a m2 the effects of current magnitude for constant current experiments are shown in fig s4 for the simulated pw solution the ed times 1350 s 1800 s and 2700 s were adjusted to achieve a constant total charge 3240 c and nearly identical recoveries of diluate the voltages 7 3 9 5 and 11 2 were nearly constant 0 1 v during ed and did not exhibit the steep rise indicative of limiting current behavior even at 2 4 a fig s4 in experiments in which ohmic resistance was measured immediately after ed the final value was 10 lower than the initial value the decrease in resistance was attributed to temperature changes temperatures for all three currents started near 25 c and increased by 2 4 3 0 and 4 1 c respectively fig s5 the total voltage was divided into three parts electrode voltage differences in electrode potentials ir drop and polarization losses defined as voltage drops across depletion layers formed during current flow 17 18 estimated electrode voltages were 2 6 2 7 and 2 8 v for the three currents subtracting these electrode voltages from the initial cell voltages 7 0 9 1 and 11 3 v yielded 0 22 0 32 and 0 43 v per aem cem pair respectively voltages due to ir drop ohmic resistance times current and the electrode voltages comprised 90 of the cell voltages at all three currents the remaining 10 is assigned to polarization loss due to depletion layers in the membranes the polarization losses account for the higher values of the gd resistances in table 2 the diluate volumes are plotted in fig 2 with respect to time left chart and to charge passed right chart the volume vs time data were fitted to quadratic equations r2 0 9999 the slopes dv dt of the quadratic equations were converted to mol s of water and eq 1 was used to obtain water transport numbers based on the slopes at the beginning of electrodialysis initial water transport numbers of 9 8 0 1 9 5 0 1 and 9 3 0 1 were obtained for 1 2 1 8 and 2 4 a the initial water transport numbers were attributed to electro osmosis since the initial diluate and concentrate solutions were identical the slopes of the quadratic equations near the end of electrodialysis yielded water transport numbers of 14 2 0 2 12 7 0 3 and 12 1 0 2 the increase in the water transport numbers relative to the initial values is attributed to osmosis and is consistent with the reported water permeances of pccell ion exchange membranes by kingsbury et al supplementary information 19 20 table 3 contains the metrics for the synthetic softened water at the three currents in stage 1 current efficiencies for sodium chloride bicarbonate and transport numbers for water were calculated using eq 1 for the entire ed period recoveries overall current efficiencies and chloride current efficiencies were at most weakly dependent on the current the increase in overall current efficiencies from stage 1 to stage 2 was attributed to reductions in the mechanisms that reduce current efficiency such as co transport of cations and anions across membranes and back diffusion as concentrations in the diluate and concentrate diverge the current efficiencies for na and cl were consistent with theoretical salt transport numbers 21 and with values reported for a similar ed cell 11 specific energies were calculated using the final diluate volumes and the voltages vs time after subtracting the estimated electrode voltages the specific energies and salt transport energies increased linearly with current due to the condition of fixed total charge p t v i 2 r q i v where r q and v are constant while final diluate concentrations were slightly dependent on current the final concentrations in the concentrate clearly increased with current and were close to the limit of mvc 200 g l this trend is predicted theoretically 21 and is due to shorter times for osmosis to dilute the concentrate the current efficiencies for bicarbonate were lower than expected based on concentration ratios and electrophoretic mobilities the ratio of chloride molarity to bicarbonate molarity in stage 1 is 17 the ratio of electrophoretic mobilities of chloride to bicarbonate in water is 1 7 so the combined flux ratio of chloride to bicarbonate in water is 29 the predicted current efficiency of bicarbonate in water for stage 1 is 0 027 well above the observed 0 01 mean value in table 2 geise et al 22 noted that transport numbers for bicarbonate in aems were difficult to measure via membrane potentials because of the presence of carbonate as well as bicarbonate so a precedent for this observation was not found the low bicarbonate current efficiencies resulted in an increase in bicarbonate concentration in the diluate and a decrease in the concentrate in stage 2 ed was performed on the combined diluate in the preceding experiment 92 g l nacl 6 g l nahco3 fig s6 the galvanodynamic scan performed during conditioning was linear with little hysteresis up to 1 92 a a constant current of 1 8 a was selected to avoid possible limiting current behavior at a higher current the time for 70 recovery of the diluate was 1610 s 2898 c the voltage rose from 10 2 to 11 0 v these values correspond to 0 38 and 0 42 v per aem cem pair the temperature increased by 3 2 c ohmic voltage drop 6 5 v and estimated electrode voltage 2 7 v accounted for 90 to 83 of the cell voltage relative to stage 1 metrics at 1 8 a overall and specific current efficiencies increased slightly while specific energies were nearly the same for 1 8 a the salt transport energy decreased because of the higher overall current efficiency the salt transport energies in table 3 are similar to the ones reported by mcgovern et al 11 current efficiency numbers for bicarbonate remained low and the bicarbonate concentrations increased slightly in the final diluate solutions based on a quadratic fit of diluate volume vs time the water transport number varied from 10 7 to 14 4 with an average of 12 1 the final diluate concentration tds 56 5 g l was low enough to permit processing by ro the final concentrate tds 163 g l could be mixed with a new batch softened pw for further processing and increased recovery of the final diluate 3 2 softened pw softened pw was mainly 132 g l nacl and 1 4 g l nahco3 fig s7 shows the voltage vs time plots and fig s8 the volume vs time plots for three successive ed trials on the softened pw sample in the first stage after removing the concentrate and diluate from the cell and reservoirs fresh softened pw was placed in the reservoirs for the following trial based on metrics for simulated produced water favoring the highest current the current was fixed at 2 4 a and the ed times at 1350 s total charge 3240 c ohmic resistances before ed were 3 28 3 10 and 3 07 ω 10 ω cm2 per aem cem pair the temperature of the solutions rose 4 c during ed all three trials exhibited nearly constant voltages between 11 and 12 v 0 41 0 46 v per aem cem pair together electrode potentials and the ohmic voltage drop accounted for 90 of the voltage of the cell based on quadratic fits of diluate volume vs charge the initial and final transport numbers for water were 9 4 0 2 and 12 0 0 3 for all 3 trials the average was 10 5 for the overall transport in each of the three trials table 1 lists the final concentrations of all measured species in the diluate in stage 1 and stage 2 table 4 contains the metrics for the three trials for stage 1 ed of softened pw assuming that the major constituents were nacl and nahco3 apart from the nahco3 values the metric values for softened pw were similar to the values listed for the simulated softened pw in table 3 the current efficiency for bicarbonate was at the uncertainty level however the bicarbonate concentration increased in the diluate as it did in the simulated softened pw the ratios of the concentrations in the final diluate and concentrates relative to the initial concentrations are shown in figs 3 and 4 the data falls into two groups the first group shows consistent ratios for the three runs fig 3 chloride is included for reference average diluate ratios were 0 58 for k 1 28 for si and 0 76 for cl and average concentrate ratios were 1 79 for k 0 87 for si and 1 54 for cl the ratios indicate that potassium was transported from diluate to concentrate with greater selectivity than sodium the inverted behavior of silicon was similar to that of bicarbonate we speculate that silicon exists as silicate species and that the anion exchange membranes were permselective against silicates as a result silicates accumulated in the diluate during ed table 1 the concentrations of group ii cations expressed as ratios with respect to initial concentrations in fig 4 increased in both the diluate and concentrate in succeeding trials this behavior suggests that the group ii cations were accumulating in the cation exchange membranes during ed and then releasing back into the diluate and concentrate in the succeeding trial another way of showing the accumulation and release of these ions is through mass balances for the ions in the diluate and concentrate fig s9 mass balances for na and cl were within 1 potassium magnesium strontium and especially calcium and barium exhibited large increases in mass up to 270 for ca relative to the masses in the softened pw an estimate of the total cation exchange capacity of the 19 internal cems pc sk and 2 terminal cems pc mte is 24 meq supplemental information the total milliequivalents of the group ii cations in the initial volumes of the diluate and concentrate 0 6 l 0 47 meq is 2 of the total cation exchange capacity so it is reasonable that the cems can sequester and release these cations from batch to batch a cleaning step was implemented to wash out the accumulated ions before continuing with stage 2 of the ed the cell was conditioned with a solution of 130 g l sodium chloride 5 g l sodium bicarbonate in the diluate and concentrate chambers and 84 g l sodium bicarbonate in the electrode chambers current was passed through the cell to drive out sequestered ions the cell was emptied and then conditioned with current flow using the mixed diluate from stage 1 with current flow the cell was emptied and refilled with fresh mixed diluate before proceeding to stage 2 ed as with the simulated softened pw a current of 1 8 a was applied for 1600 s 2880 c during stage 2 voltage vs time and diluate volume vs time are shown in figs s7 and s8 respectively the voltage was 10 3 0 1 v 0 38 v per aem cem pair and the temperature increased by 3 6 c ohmic voltage drop 6 6 v and estimated electrode voltage 2 7 v accounted for 90 of the cell voltage relative to stage 1 current efficiencies of ions and transport numbers of water increased slightly while the specific energy and salt transport energy decreased table 4 current efficiencies for bicarbonate remained near the uncertainty level and the bicarbonate concentrations showed little change from the quadratic fit of diluate volume vs charge initial and final water transport numbers were 10 4 and 14 9 with an overall average of 12 7 the final diluate concentration tds 54 g l was low enough to permit processing by reverse osmosis the final concentrate tds 158 g l could be mixed with fresh softened pw for further processing the fate of trace elements in stage 2 ed is shown in table 1 fig 5 contains the ratios of the final diluate concentrations and final concentrate concentrations relative to the initial concentrations for the trace elements na and cl ratios are included for comparison relative to na the elements k ca sr and ba exhibited lower ratios for the diluate and higher ratios for the concentrate suggesting that these elements were preferentially transported across the cation exchange membranes silicon exhibited the opposite pattern as it did in stage 1 ed mass balances for these same ions are shown in fig s10 while the mass balances for na and cl were within 0 5 ca exhibited a gain in mass and k mg sr and ba a loss of mass the membranes were releasing ca or absorbing the other ions during this single ed despite the conditioning step 4 cost analysis mcgovern and co workers have provided two models for estimating costs per unit of diluate product the first model 11 23 focuses on energy costs and capital costs while ignoring pre treatment post treatment maintenance and replacement costs pumping power costs are negligible for hypersaline feed solutions 24 the second model includes cost estimates of maintenance such as membrane replacement labor and chemicals 24 the following analysis is based on the first model the specific cost of water spc is given by eq 2 2 spc k e e w k q a m τ w r 1 1 1 1 r t ke is the fixed electricity cost kwh ew is the specific energy for diluate product kwh m3 kq is the specific capital

diluate volumes and specific energies obtained for the simulated softened pw in stage 1 3 currents and stage 2 1 current were used to provide values for the energy costs the first term and the capital costs second term fig 6 shows the effect of current in stage 1 energy costs increase linearly with current but capital costs decrease because for a fixed charge the specific process time is inversely proportional to the current the minimum total specific cost 5 6 m3 occurs at 2 4 a for the single current of 1 8 a selected for stage 2 the specific energy cost is 5 7 m3 the sum of the 2 stage specific costs 11 3 m3 compares favorably with the estimated specific cost of mechanical vapor compression 20 m3 11 5 discussion electrodialysis of hypersaline solutions permitted several variations from customary electrodialysis protocols because each stage was stopped at a fixed diluate recovery the diluate concentrations remained high enough to avoid the onset of limiting current behavior consequently pumping speed was not an important variable the low linear velocity 0 2 cm s reduced the back pressures on the membranes the corresponding pumping energy was not estimated but can be expected to be significantly lower than for higher linear velocities other variations included the use of constant current rather than constant voltage and a sodium bicarbonate electrode solution the constant current kept the current density uniform during electrodialysis and permitted close control of the length of time required to reach 60 recovery of diluate sodium bicarbonate buffered the electrode solution sufficiently to avoid ph swings outside the stability range of the terminal cation exchange membranes softening the produced water effectively reduced the concentrations of scaling cations group ii cations fe al to sufficiently low values 10 mg l that scaling was not a problem for electrodialysis in these experiments the resulting softened water was mainly a solution of nacl and nahco3 with the latter concentration depending on the accuracy of the addition of sodium carbonate in stoichiometric amounts this work did not examine the long term effects of processing much larger volumes of water in each stage as noted below periodic flushing of the ed system with pure nacl solutions may be needed to remove scaling ions sequestered in the ion exchange membranes for both the simulated and real softened pw partial desalination sufficient for a diluate product compatible with ro was accomplished in two stages of ed with each stage designed to achieve a 60 recovery of diluate relative to the initial volumes of diluate and concentrate this choice of recovery and the high concentrations of diluate and concentrate in all cases resulted in nearly constant voltages during ed galvanodynamic scans collected during conditioning were linear with little hysteresis between the forward and reverse scans supplementary information there was no hint of limiting current behavior during ed under these conditions while the overall recovery of diluate for the two stages was low 36 the diluate recovery could be improved to 50 by mixing the concentrate product of stage 2 with fresh softened pw for stage 1 processing the recovery of diluate could also be improved by increasing the initial volume ratio of diluate to concentrate the concentrate products of stage 1 ed approached tds values of 200 000 mg l similar to the limiting value for mechanical vapor compression 4 metrics for equivalent processing conditions and stages for softened pw and simulated softened pw were very similar tables 3 and 4 the small differences were attributed in part to the higher concentration of sodium bicarbonate in the simulated softened pw both data sets demonstrated that overall current efficiencies were consistently close to 80 careful measurements of diluate volume vs time or equivalently volume vs charge demonstrated that the volume change was nonlinear with the slope magnitude increasing with time the simplest nonlinear function a quadratic equation of volume vs time fitted the data adequately the slopes of the quadratic equation were used to calculate the water transport number at the beginning and end of each ed period for the conditions used in this study the initial water transport values were 9 5 0 3 for stage 1 and 10 5 0 2 for stage 2 these values were assigned to electro osmosis since the diluate and concentrate had identical initial concentrations the final water transport numbers were 30 higher because of increasing osmosis from the diluate to the concentrate specific energies increased with the applied current and with time choosing 2 4 a for stage 1 and 1 8 a for stage 2 and adhering to the 60 recovery requirement led to specific energies of 20 1 kwh m3 for stage 1 and 16 5 kwh m3 for stage 2 for comparison stage 2 in the study by mcgovern et al converted a diluate with an initial concentration of 152 g l nacl to 90 g l with a specific energy of 42 kwh m3 and stage 3 converted the 90 g l diluate to a 41 g l product using 20 kwh m3 11 these specific energies for partial desalination do not compare favorably with the large scale figures for complete desalination via other technologies 32 50 kwh m3 for mvc with 72 5 recovery 11 40 kwh m3 for md 3 however we believe that ed shows promise for a small scale partial desalination operation and especially for an operation dependent on intermittent electrical power the group ii ions and potassium exhibited a tendency to sequester into the cation exchange membranes and then release back into the diluate and concentrate over repeated batch processing for stage 1 in a single batch ed stage 2 some of the ions k mg sr ba were sequestered and ca is released the effects of ion sequestration and release were exacerbated in this study because of the low ratio of solutions volumes to total ion exchange membrane area permselectivity was observed for two anionic species bicarbonate and silicate these species tended to remain in the diluate and their concentrations increased with ed time for longer time scales and larger volumes it may be necessary to condition the ed cell periodically with clean nacl solutions to avoid scaling problems 6 summary electrodialysis can be a viable option for treating produced water and other hypersaline feedstocks where volume flows are small transportation costs are high and electricity supplies are intermittent softening is recommended for ed of the produced water with high concentrations of group ii ions to minimize energy costs partial desalination was performed in two stages with each stage designed to avoid limiting current behavior with its associated rise in cell voltage for the benefit of the desalination community a plethora of metrics recoveries current efficiencies transport numbers of water specific energies and salt transport energies are provided for two stages of partial desalination of produced water from an experimental fracking well and for simulated softened water the use of constant current and precise volume measurements permitted an evaluation of the relative effects of electro osmosis and osmosis mass balances for trace ions in softened produced water revealed a significant effect of sequestration and release by the membranes two anionic species bicarbonate and silicate tended to accumulate in the diluate due to low transport through the anion exchange membranes the final diluate had sufficiently low tds that it could be desalinated efficiently using ro credit authorship
