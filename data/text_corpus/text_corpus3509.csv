17545,a model based study was developed to analyse the behaviour of moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr and integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas reactor configurations for the removal of nitrogen in the main water line of municipal wastewater treatment plants via partial nitritation anammox pn amx the basic principles and underlying mechanisms linking operating conditions to process performance were investigated with particular focus on nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob repression and resulting volumetric conversion rates the external mass transfer resistance is a major factor differentiating granular sludge pn amx processes from mbbr or ifas systems the external mass transfer resistance was found to promote the metabolic coupling between anammox amx and ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob crucial for nob repression in the biofilm operation at low bulk do prevents nob proliferation in the flocs of ifas systems as amx activity limits nitrite availability the so called amx nitrite sink importantly the effectiveness of the amx nitrite sink strongly depends on the amx sensitivity to oxygen also over a broad range of operational conditions the seeding of aob from the biofilm played a crucial role in maintaining their activity in the flocs from a practical perspective while low do promotes nob repression lower nitrogen loads have to be applied to maintain the same effluent quality thus a trade off between nob repression and volumetric conversion capacity needs to be defined to this end ifas allow for higher volumetric rates but the window of operating conditions with effective nob repression is smaller than that for mbbr ultimately this study identified the principles controlling nob in mbbr and ifas systems and the key differences with granular reactors allowing for the interpretation of seemingly contradictory published experimental results graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofilm nitrogen removal anammox boundary layer partial nitritation nob 1 introduction nitrogen removal via partial nitritation anammox pn amx at mainstream conditions is an advantageous wastewater treatment process that is currently under development cao et al 2017 gustavsson et al 2020 laureni et al 2019 pedrouso et al 2019 due to the low growth rate of both aerobic and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox respectively biomass retention is essential to obtain compact installations among the different alternatives to retain the biomass granular sludge and biofilms grown on plastic media are the most commonly used approaches gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2014a 2014b reino et al 2016 reino et al 2018 for biofilm reactors both moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 gustavsson et al 2020 and integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas laureni et al 2019 veuillet et al 2014 have been used for granular sludge reactors two main approaches have been reported splitting the n removal process in two stages with a first reactor devoted to partial nitritation and a second to anammox isanta et al 2015 pérez et al 2015 reino et al 2018 or having both process together in a one stage reactor lotti et al 2014a b nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob repression is crucial for the stability of pn amx processes regardless of the configuration nob repression has been theoretically assessed through mathematical modelling of one stage pn amx granular sludge systems hao et al 2002 2001 pérez et al 2014 as well as for partial nitritation configurations brockmann and morgenroth 2010 jemaat et al 2013 yet few studies have targeted nob repression in biofilm growing on plastic media lackner et al 2008 laureni et al 2019 tao and hamouda 2019 interestingly when mbbr and ifas have been used for nitrogen removal from pre treated sewage with a one stage pn amx configuration better nob repression has been reported at low temperatures gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 laureni et al 2019 compared to that obtained in granular sludge reactors hoekstra et al 2018 lotti et al 2014b why the biofilms growing on protected surfaces of plastic carriers in mbbr and ifas reactors performed better than granular sludge reactors remains as yet unknown investigations devoted to determine the reasons underlying these differences will greatly benefit the application of processes based on pn amx in mbbr systems the biofilms grow primarily on the inner walls of the plastic media and are thus more protected against shear stress than granules nogueira et al 2015 ødegaard 1997 also owing to the low density of the carriers mbbr usually display a less vigorous mixing which further reduces the shear stress ødegaard 1997 as a result the external mass transfer boundary layer in mbbr biofilms is significantly thicker than for granules see for instance nogueira et al 2015 as the external mass transfer resistance controls the actual concentration of substrates available at the biofilm surface eberl et al 2004 our driving hypothesis was that it would play a key role in controlling microbial competition and nob repression in particular here we present a model based study to assess how specific characteristics of mbbr and ifas configurations impact nob repression in one stage biofilm based pn amx processes for nitrogen removal the model is used to assess the role of external boundary layer resistance with respect to bacterial competition and nitrogen removal capacity simulations focus on low temperatures 10 c as these have been identified as the main bottleneck for the implementation of pn amx in the mainstream of municipal wastewater treatment plants hoekstra et al 2018 laureni et al 2019 lotti et al 2014b pedrouso et al 2019 pérez et al 2015 the modelling study pursuits the analysis of the underlying principles leading to effective nob repression by linking existing experimental reports to simulations targeting the main operating conditions such as solids retention time srt and dissolved oxygen do concentration 2 model development the mathematical model developed in this study was based on the model used in pérez et al 2014 with the following modifications i an external mass transfer boundary layer was included for all soluble substrates ii a settler for suspended biomass retention was implemented for the ifas configuration with the possibility to control the srt of flocs srtflocs iii two different sets of kinetic parameters were used for the biofilm and flocs a one dimensional biofilm model was implemented in the aquasim software reichert 1998 wanner and reichert 1996 a planar biofilm constant area was considered an appropriate approximation for biofilms growing on a support the biofilm thickness was set to 800 µm in agreement with previous experimental reports and the geometry of the plastic carriers gilbert et al 2014 veuillet et al 2014 laureni et al 2019 additionally we verified that the reactor performance was not limited by the set biofilm thickness the area was fixed by setting a common ratio of protected biofilm area per reactor volume of 300 m2 m3 this value is in the range reported for this type of mbbr ifas applications considering a filling degree of ca 30 55 with anoxkaldnes k5 veuillet et al 2014 laureni et al 2019 the porosity of the biofilm 80 and the total biomass concentration in the biofilm 90 kg vss m3 were kept constant during all simulations as in pérez et al 2014 simulations were run considering a temperature of 10 c and ph of 7 5 a typical wastewater influent ammonium concentration of 40 gn m3 was chosen the selection of the intrinsic and apparent half saturation coefficients for aob and nob is discussed in the next section the rest of stoichiometric and kinetic parameters were set as in pérez et al 2014 the set of kinetic parameters and rates as well as the stoichiometry matrix are presented in tables s1 s3 the rate expressions implemented to describe growth and decay of the different populations aob nob amx were expressed as a function of temperature equations s1 s4 the implemented flow model allowed the investigation of both the mbbr configuration without active retention of suspended biomass and the ifas one comprising a solid liquid separation unit to retain a set fraction of the biomass detached from the biofilm an explicit expression for the amount of sludge retained based on the efficiency of the settler fsettler see eq 1 was used the equation is a function of the srtflocs and allowed to simulate the operation of ifas systems at a given srtflocs 1 f s e t t l e r 1 v r s r t f l o c s q q r e c where vr is the reactor volume and q and qrec are the wastewater flow rate treated and recirculated from the settler to the reactor respectively to determine the effects of ammonium and oxygen bulk liquid concentrations on the microbial interactions two different control loops were implemented as previously done in similar modelling studies jemaat et al 2013 pérez et al 2014 the simulation strategy consisted mainly of an iterative procedure to determine the minimal ammonium concentration in the bulk liquid required to outcompete nob in the biofilm i e nob activity repression noted as snh4 min a similar iterative procedure was set up to determine the maximum srtflocs allowed to repress nob specifically in the flocs denoted as srtflocs max consistently with pérez et al 2014 nob activity repression was considered effective when the effluent nitrate concentration produced by nob was less than 1 g n m3 at steady state conditions 2 1 oxygen half saturation coefficients of aob and nob in biofilm and flocs the choice of the aob and nob apparent half saturation coefficient ko2 app for oxygen is essential for the correct modelling of their competition in pn amx systems we base our selection on the theoretical analysis performed by picioreanu et al 2016 with a three dimensional model for biofilm and flocs the authors conclude that in biofilms the aob apparent half saturation coefficient for oxygen ko2 aob app is larger i e lower oxygen affinity than that of nob with the exception of the case when aob and nob are stratified however stratification has not been observed for biofilms grown on carriers and performing pn amx at low do persson et al 2017 also the differences in apparent half saturation coefficients can only be observed with 2 d or 3 d biofilm models therefore when using a one dimensional approach e g aquasim a ko2 aob ko2 nob needs to be imposed as intrinsic parameters for biofilms without stratification as starting point for the parameter selection the ko2 nob was selected from the literature study in picioreanu et al 2016 ko2 nob 0 06 g m3 to accomplish with previous conditions ko2 aob was chosen to be ko2 aob 0 12 g m3 in the flocs as diffusion of substrates was not explicitly considered a different set of apparent kinetic parameters was used for the flocculent sludge in principle the larger the flocs or the larger the microcolonies of aob and nob in the flocs e g at longer srt the larger the corresponding apparent oxygen half saturation coefficient pérez et al 2005 picioreanu et al 2016 among others a value of ko2 aob app 0 6 g m3 was chosen as reference case and the impact of this choice was specifically investigated in principle colony sizes in ifas systems are expected to be larger than in activated sludge as they originate by detachment from the biofilm where srts are long this is denoted as seeding and is discussed in the next section therefore this justifies the choice of a rather high ko2 aob app even at low temperatures consistent with picioreanu et al 2016 a much lower value of apparent oxygen half saturation coefficient was selected for nob ko2 nob app 0 06 g m3 as a result the standard case constitutes the worst case scenario for nob repression as nob are favoured in terms of oxygen affinity overall the values chosen as apparent oxygen half saturation coefficients are also in accordance with reported values for ifas systems malovanyy et al 2015 2 2 equivalent aob maximum specific growth rate due to seeding from the biofilm in the ifas reactor configuration biofilm and flocs share the same reactor volume since aob and nob are constantly detached from the biofilm there is a continuous seeding to the bulk liquid a way of describing this process is lumping the maximum specific growth rate µmax and a surplus rate named seeding rate μ m a x s e e d i n g in a single parameter here denominated equivalent maximum specific growth rate μ m a x a o b e q u i v μ m a x a o b s e e d i n g μ m a x a o b see eq 3 in the model the effects of seeding are implicitly determined by the detachment rate and the set maximum biofilm thickness wanner and reichert 1996 reichert 1998 the equivalent maximum specific growth rate is an interesting tool to elucidate the importance of seeding in the ifas configuration we here focused the explanation on aob but the same approach could be applied to other microbial species in the biofilm without seeding aob in the flocs grow at a rate defined by eq 2 2 μ a o b μ m a x a o b s n h 4 s n h 4 k s n h 4 a o b a p p s o 2 s o 2 k o 2 a o b a p p where s is bulk concentration of ammonium nh4 and oxygen o2 and µaob is the specific growth rate for aob kinetics and full description of parameters are available in tables s2 and s3 in the ifas configuration the growth could be described by considering the seeding in a modified monod expression in eq 2 as follows 3 μ a o b μ m a x a o b e q u i v s n h 4 s n h 4 k s n h 4 a o b a p p s o 2 s o 2 k o 2 a o b a p p in this study we used μ m a x a o b e q u i v as a tool to link the effects of seeding with the effects of the operating conditions bulk ammonium concentration do concentration and srtflocs on effective nob repression 3 results and discussion 3 1 external boundary layer thickness the key difference for nob repression between granular sludge and mbbr pn amx reactors external mass transfer resistance controls the actual concentration of substrates available at the biofilm surface and consequently microbial competition however the relevance of the external mass transfer resistance depends on the reactor design and operating conditions for instance granular sludge reactors are generally well mixed and there is a minimal external mass transfer resistance at the biofilm liquid interface i e the biofilm is completely exposed to the flow field whereas in mbbr or ifas reactors the biofilm develops on protected surfaces of plastic carriers therefore neglecting the external mass transfer resistance is the preferred approach for modelling de kreuk et al 2007 hao et al 2002 pérez et al 2014 conversely owing to the different reactor design and operation in mbbr systems the external mass transfer resistance has been reported to be non negligible nogueira et al 2015 gapes and keller 2009 and thus cannot be ignored in the present contribution external mass transfer resistance was taken into account for the description of an mbbr filled with plastic carriers that allow for the development of shear stress protected biofilms as an example the required bulk do and ammonium concentrations for effective nob repression at 10 c with an external boundary layer thickness of 100 µm are presented in fig 1 as a mean of comparison the corresponding curve for a granular sludge reactor without external mass transfer resistance is also plotted pérez et al 2014 compared to the granular sludge reactor the mbbr simulations indicate that the minimal required bulk ammonium concentration for effective nob repression the snh4 min is lower with the exception of high do concentrations 1 4 g m3 in fig 1 this would explain why in literature the trials for nob repression at low temperatures were successful for mbbr gilbert et al 2014 whereas those using granular sludge reactors reported more challenges hoekstra et al 2018 lotti et al 2014b in fact in view of the modelling results presented here external mass transfer resistance appears to be a key regulator for the aob amx metabolic coupling for ammonia removal specifically the main controlling factor is the do concentration at the biofilm liquid interface which depends on the external mass transfer and the given bulk liquid do concentration for thick external boundary layers low bulk do concentrations imply a much lower do concentration in the biofilm see fig 1c operating at low do decreases the rate of aerobic oxidation of ammonia into nitrite by aob as a result residual nitrite concentrations become very low which in turn favours nob repression due to nitrite unavailability known as the amx nitrite sink laureni et al 2019 for instance operating the reactor at a bulk do concentration of 0 3 g m3 results in a do concentration at the liquid biofilm interface of only 0 062 g m3 ll 100µm fig 1c or 0 036 g m3 ll 200µm therefore in mbbr or ifas systems in which the bulk do is kept very low ca 0 2 and 0 17 g m3 as reported by gilbert et al 2014 and laureni et al 2019 respectively the biofilm is maintained under almost anoxic conditions as a consequence of the external mass transfer resistance such microaerophilic conditions have proven successful for nob repression in suspended pn amx systems operated at bulk do below the detection limit i e 0 05 g m3 even at temperatures as low as 12 c hu et al 2013 in the only three studies reporting stable pn amx gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2019 and hu et al 2013 the do was very low while ammonium was always in excess between 2 and 6 mg nh4 n l this combination of operating conditions is of key importance for process performance avoiding nitrate production by nob as indicated by the results of the simulations the same principle applies also for ifas reactors as detailed in section 3 2 in reactor configurations where both aeration and mechanical stirring are used the external mass transfer boundary layer could be regulated by controlling the stirring speed however increasing the boundary layer unavoidably requires larger reactor volumes to treat a given loading rate see details in specific section 3 5 the thicker the external mass transfer boundary layer the smaller the required bulk ammonium concentrations for effective nob repression fig 2 a for a given bulk do concentration increasing the mass transfer resistance i e thicker external mass transfer boundary layer results in lower oxygen concentration at the biofilm this in turn favours the aob amx metabolic coupling for autotrophic ammonia removal 3 2 controlling nob activity in the presence of flocs the ifas configuration 3 2 1 ifas are less impacted by the external mass transfer resistance than mbbr in the ifas reactor configuration consisting of an mbbr with a settler for flocculent biomass retention not only aob but also nob can potentially grow both in the biofilm and the flocs laureni et al 2016 nevertheless recent experimental evidence suggests that nob repression could be successfully achieved in ifas reactors operated for pn amx even at temperatures as low as 15 c laureni et al 2019 thomson et al 2016 to explore the impact of the external mass transfer boundary layer on nob repression in ifas systems a wide range of boundary layer thicknesses was simulated 0 200 µm the resulting snh4 min curves are presented in fig 2b d as a function of bulk ammonium and do concentrations for three fixed flocs srt srtflocs in all cases larger boundary layers result in broader regions for nob repression however the phase diagrams fig 2 differ substantially between the mbbr fig 2a and the ifas in particular at high srtflocs operating at higher srtflocs e g 20 d narrowed down the region for effective nob repression at high do while stable pn amx could still be kept at low do fig 2b d the mathematical model indicates that increasing srtflocs e g from 5 to 10 days at 10 c might compromise the stability of the process due to nob proliferation at high do above 9 g o2 m3 at ll 100 µm see fig 2d importantly simulations suggest that this effect cannot be counterbalanced by operation at higher residual ammonium concentrations as is always the case for mbbr by comparing e g fig 2a and d a clear bending of the snh4 min curve is observed at high bulk ammonium concentrations at high srtflocs operating the reactor at high bulk ammonium concentration directs more aerobic ammonium oxidation to the flocs and is detrimental for nob repression in the flocs see next sections for instance at srtflocs 20 d and do 0 6 g m3 nob are repressed at 2 gnh4 n m3 but not at 8 gnh4 n m3 because nob independently proliferate in the flocs even at high boundary layer thickness that hinder their growth in the biofilm fig 3 3 2 2 the solids retention time of the flocs srtflocs regulates nob growth in the flocs to identify the maximum srtflocs at which nob repression is achieved and pn amx is the dominant process in the ifas system simulations were run for a broad range of srtflocs and boundary layer thicknesses fig 4 in fig 4a a bulk do concentration of 0 3 g m3 and an ammonium concentration of 5 g n m3 were selected for efficient nob repression in the biofilm to be able to independently investigate the impact of srtflocs for a given boundary layer thickness imposing an srtflocs srtflocs max results in nob proliferation in the flocculent sludge irrespective of nob growth on biofilm comparable results with effective nob repression in the flocs were observed in an ifas reactor operated at 15 c on aerobically pre treated municipal wastewater at 0 17g o2 m3 with an aerobic srtflocs of 40 days laureni et al 2019 a set of simulations was carried out to explore the srtflocs max at different bulk do concentrations at lower bulk do concentrations higher srtflocs max values were found with the model fig 4b overall the model identified the region of nob repression in the biofilm as a function of the bulk ammonium and do concentrations and the boundary layer thickness fig 2 on the one hand nob can independently proliferate in the flocs if the srtflocs is above the threshold value srtflocs max on the other hand if nob would proliferate in the biofilm due to too high bulk do concentration or too low bulk ammonium concentration nob would also be present in the flocs irrespective of the srtflocs imposed due to seeding this is why nob proliferate in both biofilm and flocs fig 1a or exclusively in the flocs since nob could be repressed in the biofilm at high bulk ammonium concentrations as already discussed fig 4a 3 2 3 aob and nob seeding from the biofilm plays a crucial role in flocs composition the model was used to assess why nitrite oxidation can be repressed in the flocs while maintaining stable nitritation even at long srtflocs see fig 4b at low bulk do concentrations one of the hypotheses is linked to the constant seeding of aob from the biofilm in other words while the imposed srtflocs is not enough for aob and nob i e srtflocs max to proliferate in the flocs due to the low temperature imposed 10 c they grow in the biofilm and detachment provides a constant seeding eq 4 this was investigated by simulating an ifas configuration in which seeding of aob from the biofilm was switched off two types of aob were used aob detached from biofilm were imposed to be not active in the flocs and an active aob species in flocs with the same kinetics and stoichiometry was independently inoculated as initial condition for the simulation the results showed that washout of aob and nob from the flocs happened for a wide range of conditions fig 5 therefore seeding of aob and nob from the biofilm is crucial to retain ammonium oxidation in the flocs if effective nob repression would be achieved in the biofilm and no seeding of nob from the biofilm into the flocs would occur in general this means that for the modelling of hybrid biofilm systems with biofilm and flocs coexisting like in ifas an adequate description of the detachment is paramount the identification of the maximum srtflocs which assures effective nob repression in the flocs if they are not seeded from the biofilm is a complex problem in continuous suspended growth systems the imposed srt equals the inverse of the minimum specific growth rate required for an organism to be maintained in the system srt 1 µi specifically for the system under study for a given srtflocs the following equalities can be established 4 s r t f l o c s 1 μ a o b 1 μ m a x a o b e q u i v s n h 4 s n h 4 k s n h 4 a o b a p p s o 2 s o 2 k o 2 a o b a p p 1 μ n o b 1 μ m a x n o b e q u i v s n o 2 s n o 2 k s n o 2 n o b a p p s o 2 s o 2 k o 2 n o b a p p from eq 4 stable nitritation and nob repression in the flocs is achieved only when 1 μ n o b s r t f l o c s 1 μ a o b in the case of aob from the definition provided in the model development section μ m a x a o b e q u i v is the sum of μ m a x a o b s e e d i n g and μ max aob while μ max aob depends only on temperature and ph see eq s2 and cannot be manipulated operational conditions can be controlled to enhance the contribution of μ m a x a o b s e e d i n g and consequently μ m a x a o b e q u i v this is achieved by promoting the growth of aob on the biofilm analogously to ensure washout of nob from the flocs μ m a x n o b e q u i v needs to be minimized as μ max nob cannot be controlled conditions need to be established to reduce μ m a x a o b s e e d i n g i e preventing nob growth in the biofilm from eq 4 the impact of each of the operational conditions and parameters on μaob and μnob can be discussed from the monod terms a decrease in bulk do would impact both growth rates with a bigger impact on μaob as we assumed k o 2 a o b a p p k o 2 n o b a p p however low do would also favor aob growth in the biofilm and thus increase μ m a x a o b s e e d i n g while nob growth in biofilm would be repressed see section above moreover the first equality in eq 4 can be used to estimate the contribution of seeding for aob and elucidate the impact of bulk ammonium by simply clearing μ m a x a o b e q u i v from the equation the μ m a x a o b e q u i v was calculated for a wide range of bulk ammonium concentrations at two srtflocs 5 and 20 days and a bulk do concentration of 0 5 g o2 m3 the results were plotted and compared to μ max aob to identify when retention of aob in the flocs is possible only due to seeding fig 6 at low srtflocs e g 5 d the contribution of the seeding to μ m a x a o b e q u i v is significant i e μ m a x a o b e q u i v always above μ m a x a o b and decreases at increasing ammonium concentration at higher srtflocs the contribution of the seeding diminishes for example at an srtflocs of 20 d and ammonium above 5 gn m3 no seeding is required and aob can proliferate independently in the flocs in summary the results indicate that operating the ifas at high srtflocs with high bulk ammonium concentration reduces the relative importance of the aob seeding from the biofilm favoring nob proliferation in the flocs besides imposing low do μnob could be further reduced if the bulk nitrite concentration is kept low e g by enhancing the amx nitrite sink in the biofilm from the second equality in eq 4 related to nob the maximum bulk nitrite concentration for effective nob repression at a given srtflocs could be estimated this threshold nitrite concentration has been computed out of eq 4 or different bulk do concentrations and srtflocs see table s4 at longer srtflocs and at higher bulk do concentrations a stronger aob amx metabolic coupling would be required for effective nob repression i e the threshold nitrite concentration is smaller 3 3 aob partitioning between flocs and biofilm the partitioning of aob between the biofilm and the flocs in ifas reactors was investigated with the mathematical model as a function of srtflocs for a set of operating conditions external boundary layer thickness ll 100 µm bulk ammonium concentration 2 gn m3 bulk do concentration 0 5 g m3 the main results indicate that the relative fraction of aob in the flocs remained significantly smaller than the one in the biofilm even at an srtflocs of 20 days fig 7 a however the mass of aob in the biofilm is rather small if compared to the total solids in the biofilm ca 1 2 on average see fig 7a this small fraction in the biofilm often hampers precise experimental quantification for instance by fish as previously highlighted corbala robles et al 2016 besides the imposed srtflocs fig 7a the partitioning of aob also strongly depends on the apparent fitness of the aob in the flocs understood as competitiveness derived from kinetic parameters this is reflected in the dependency on bulk do fig 7b and ammonium fig 8 concentrations specifically the apparent fitness of the aob located in flocs is shaped by both the floc and the microcolony sizes see manser et al 2005 picioreanu et al 2016 here as a matter of instructing exercise the case of small floc and colony sizes has been selected this was simulated by keeping the apparent substrate and oxygen half saturation coefficients at very low values ko2 aob app 0 06g m3 ks nh4 aob app 1 1gn m3 figs 7 and 8 other factors like for instance the boundary layer thickness have less pronounced effects data not shown independently of the amount of aob in biofilm and flocs fig 7 the corresponding contribution to the overall activity depends on reactor conditions and the apparent aob fitness in flocs to investigate the relative activity of aob in flocs and biofilm their corresponding nitrite production was quantified see figs 7a and 8 while the aob partitioning between flocs and biofilm is not much influenced by the bulk ammonium concentration high bulk ammonium concentrations direct aob activity towards the flocs even with aob being mainly located in the biofilm fig 8 the fraction of nitrite produced in the flocs dominates at 10 gnh4 n m3 ca 70 of the nitrite production happened in the flocs compared to that at 2 g nh4 n m3 ca 38 of nitrite is produced in the flocs fig 8 inevitably higher nitrite production in the bulk favours the growth of nob eq 4 this explains the bending in the phase diagrams for ifas as compared to mbbr at high ammonium concentrations fig 2 also this might be the reason why when using ex situ activity batch tests by adding ammonium as proxy for the abundance of aob in flocs and biofilm as done in laureni et al 2019 the results obtained possibly overestimated the fraction of aob in the flocs and underestimate it in the biofilm consequently when using ex situ activity tests for flocs and biofilm one might have the false impression that the amount of aob in the biofilm is negligible which appears unlikely based on the model outputs 3 4 main factors affecting the performance of the anammox nitrite sink 3 4 1 amx inhibition by oxygen has a major impact the metabolic coupling between aob and amx in engineered ecosystems is favoured at low do as shown in numerous experimental studies among others particularly relevant hu et al 2013 by limiting the do amx are less inhibited and aob produce nitrite at a lower rate compatible with the one of anammox in analogy with the metabolic balance between amx and aob achieved in the oceanic oxygen minimum zones kalvelage et al 2011 in this study when the biofilm was exposed to lower do concentrations e g by increasing the thickness of the boundary layer resistance at constant bulk do the nitrite sink was enhanced leading to a wider region of operating conditions for effective nob repression fig 1 assuring an excess of ammonium in the bulk liquid has also been shown experimentally to be crucial to obtain good pn amx performance at low temperatures gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 2019 from a theoretical standpoint pérez et al 2014 identified the increased aob activity and consequent faster oxygen consumption in the biofilm as the mechanism leading to successful nob repression in granular sludge pn amx reactors at high residual ammonium concentrations differently in the present study the bulk ammonium concentration cannot result in a direct advantage for the oxygen competition between aob and nob as the selected oxygen half saturation coefficients favour nob over aob instead the observed effect of the bulk ammonium concentration on nob repression figs 1 3 is indirect in the model regulating the bulk ammonium concentration at a high value results in shorter oxygen penetration depths in analogy with the granular sludge case this indirectly enhances the amx nitrite sink by reducing the inhibition of anammox by oxygen to demonstrate this mechanism a set of simulations were run by changing the amx inhibitory coefficient ki o amx fig 9 or even neglecting completely anammox inhibition by oxygen i e removing the term k i o a m x k i o a m x s o 2 from rate eq 5 in table s2 the results obtained confirm that the amx inhibitory coefficient regulates the bulk ammonia concentration required for effective nob repression both in mbbr and ifas systems fig 9 with no anammox inhibition the simulations clearly indicated a very effective nob repression even at 10 c with ammonium concentrations below 0 05 g n m3 for the range of tested do concentrations data not shown these results strongly support the key role played by the oxygen anammox inhibition in regulating nob repression the extent of anammox inhibition by oxygen depends on the performance of aob which is a function of the bulk ammonium concentration as a result the residual ammonium concentration impacts the amx nitrite sink in the biofilm and thus the nob repression the interface between the aerobic and anoxic regions i e where aob cell clusters are in contact with amx clusters is particularly sensitive any change in reactor conditions that slow down the oxygen consumption by aob e g a decrease in the reactor temperature would immediately result in more oxygen leaking from the biofilm layers occupied by aob and increasing the fraction of amx inhibited by oxygen recently an experimental study used a similar rationale for improving the performance of pn amx by designing a control strategy to reduce the negative effects of the oxygen penetration depth in cases of a temperature drop wang et al 2019 3 4 2 external boundary layer reduces the availability for amx of nitrite produced in flocs favoring nob in flocs directing aerobic ammonium oxidation towards the flocs in ifas systems might affect the amx nitrite sink as nitrite produced in the flocs needs to diffuse through the boundary layer and biofilm to reach the amx layers to assess the impact of the nitrite boundary layer thickness on the amx nitrite sink a set of simulations were run by setting to zero the llno2 but keeping the external mass transfer resistance for the rest of soluble components e g oxygen for thick external boundary layers ll 200 µm and long srt 20 d a wider window of operating conditions with effective nob repression was found fig s3 the main effect was on the proliferation of nob in the flocs whereas in the biofilm the effect was insignificant fig s3 these results confirm the importance of the amx nitrite sink in controlling nob in the flocs as proposed by laureni at el 2019 also simulations highlight the key role of the external mass transfer resistance for the nitrite produced in the flocs in controlling the amx nitrite sink 3 5 the external mass transfer resistance impacts the nitrogen load that can be treated as already discussed external mass transfer resistance hinders the mass transport towards the biofilm with clear advantages for nob repression however greater external mass transfer resistance i e the external boundary layer is thicker would result in lower removal rates in both mbbr and ifas configurations typical boundary layer thicknesses range between 100 and 200 µm for low aeration regimes nogueira et al 2015 this is in contrast to granular sludge reactors in which the external mass transfer resistance is minimized with however a more challenging control of nob the model has been used to quantify the effects of external mass transfer resistance on the volumetric nitrogen loading rate that the reactor system can treat to produce an effluent with 5 g nh4 n m3 at increasing boundary layer thicknesses the reduction in the applicable rate is remarkable as illustrated fig 10 a also a decrease in the bulk do has major effect in the load that can be treated to better understand the strong effect the do concentrations at the biofilm liquid interface have been computed as reference see fig 10c importantly increasing the srtflocs allows for an improvement in the loading rate that can be treated in particular if the fitness of the aob in the flocs is also increased i e small flocs in fig 10b in conclusion the simulation results are in strong agreement with available experimental results for mbbr or ifas systems operated for pn amx at low temperatures reporting poor nitrogen loading rate despite effective nob repression gilbert at al 2014 laureni et al 2016 gilbert et al 2014 operated an mbbr at 10 c on synthetic influent at mainstream conditions and a do of ca 0 2 g o2 m3 achieving a nitrogen removal rate of 0 015 kgn m3 d with effective nob repression laureni et al 2019 operated an ifas reactor configuration at 15 c to remove nitrogen from aerobically pre treated municipal wastewater at 0 17 g o2 m3 achieving nitrogen removal rates of 0 08 kg n m3 d with effective nob repression and good effluent quality 4 conclusions the results obtained in this modelling study highly consistent with published experimental data allowed to elucidate the principles controlling microbial competition and nob repression in mbbr and ifas systems operated for pn amx the following conclusions could be drawn the higher external mass transfer resistance in mbbr systems as compared to granular reactors results in lower substrate concentrations at the biofilm surface and thereby favour nob repression by enhancing the aob amx metabolic coupling the ifas configuration allows for higher nitrogen removal rates than mbbr but feature a narrower range of operational conditions for nob repression as nob can proliferate in the flocs even if repressed in the biofilm at low bulk ammonium and do concentrations aob are maintained in the flocs primarily due to seeding from the biofilm while nob growth is repressed in the biofilm high do and residual ammonium concentrations promote growth of nob in the flocs independently from the seeding from the biofilm the anammox nitrite sink in the biofilm plays a crucial role in repressing nob proliferation in the flocs by limiting the available nitrite but is strongly affected by the inhibition of anammox by oxygen from a practical perspective a trade off exists between nob repression by increasing boundary layer resistance and the resulting lower nitrogen load that can be treated declaration of competing

17545,a model based study was developed to analyse the behaviour of moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr and integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas reactor configurations for the removal of nitrogen in the main water line of municipal wastewater treatment plants via partial nitritation anammox pn amx the basic principles and underlying mechanisms linking operating conditions to process performance were investigated with particular focus on nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob repression and resulting volumetric conversion rates the external mass transfer resistance is a major factor differentiating granular sludge pn amx processes from mbbr or ifas systems the external mass transfer resistance was found to promote the metabolic coupling between anammox amx and ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob crucial for nob repression in the biofilm operation at low bulk do prevents nob proliferation in the flocs of ifas systems as amx activity limits nitrite availability the so called amx nitrite sink importantly the effectiveness of the amx nitrite sink strongly depends on the amx sensitivity to oxygen also over a broad range of operational conditions the seeding of aob from the biofilm played a crucial role in maintaining their activity in the flocs from a practical perspective while low do promotes nob repression lower nitrogen loads have to be applied to maintain the same effluent quality thus a trade off between nob repression and volumetric conversion capacity needs to be defined to this end ifas allow for higher volumetric rates but the window of operating conditions with effective nob repression is smaller than that for mbbr ultimately this study identified the principles controlling nob in mbbr and ifas systems and the key differences with granular reactors allowing for the interpretation of seemingly contradictory published experimental results graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofilm nitrogen removal anammox boundary layer partial nitritation nob 1 introduction nitrogen removal via partial nitritation anammox pn amx at mainstream conditions is an advantageous wastewater treatment process that is currently under development cao et al 2017 gustavsson et al 2020 laureni et al 2019 pedrouso et al 2019 due to the low growth rate of both aerobic and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox respectively biomass retention is essential to obtain compact installations among the different alternatives to retain the biomass granular sludge and biofilms grown on plastic media are the most commonly used approaches gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2014a 2014b reino et al 2016 reino et al 2018 for biofilm reactors both moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 gustavsson et al 2020 and integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas laureni et al 2019 veuillet et al 2014 have been used for granular sludge reactors two main approaches have been reported splitting the n removal process in two stages with a first reactor devoted to partial nitritation and a second to anammox isanta et al 2015 pérez et al 2015 reino et al 2018 or having both process together in a one stage reactor lotti et al 2014a b nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob repression is crucial for the stability of pn amx processes regardless of the configuration nob repression has been theoretically assessed through mathematical modelling of one stage pn amx granular sludge systems hao et al 2002 2001 pérez et al 2014 as well as for partial nitritation configurations brockmann and morgenroth 2010 jemaat et al 2013 yet few studies have targeted nob repression in biofilm growing on plastic media lackner et al 2008 laureni et al 2019 tao and hamouda 2019 interestingly when mbbr and ifas have been used for nitrogen removal from pre treated sewage with a one stage pn amx configuration better nob repression has been reported at low temperatures gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 laureni et al 2019 compared to that obtained in granular sludge reactors hoekstra et al 2018 lotti et al 2014b why the biofilms growing on protected surfaces of plastic carriers in mbbr and ifas reactors performed better than granular sludge reactors remains as yet unknown investigations devoted to determine the reasons underlying these differences will greatly benefit the application of processes based on pn amx in mbbr systems the biofilms grow primarily on the inner walls of the plastic media and are thus more protected against shear stress than granules nogueira et al 2015 ødegaard 1997 also owing to the low density of the carriers mbbr usually display a less vigorous mixing which further reduces the shear stress ødegaard 1997 as a result the external mass transfer boundary layer in mbbr biofilms is significantly thicker than for granules see for instance nogueira et al 2015 as the external mass transfer resistance controls the actual concentration of substrates available at the biofilm surface eberl et al 2004 our driving hypothesis was that it would play a key role in controlling microbial competition and nob repression in particular here we present a model based study to assess how specific characteristics of mbbr and ifas configurations impact nob repression in one stage biofilm based pn amx processes for nitrogen removal the model is used to assess the role of external boundary layer resistance with respect to bacterial competition and nitrogen removal capacity simulations focus on low temperatures 10 c as these have been identified as the main bottleneck for the implementation of pn amx in the mainstream of municipal wastewater treatment plants hoekstra et al 2018 laureni et al 2019 lotti et al 2014b pedrouso et al 2019 pérez et al 2015 the modelling study pursuits the analysis of the underlying principles leading to effective nob repression by linking existing experimental reports to simulations targeting the main operating conditions such as solids retention time srt and dissolved oxygen do concentration 2 model development the mathematical model developed in this study was based on the model used in pérez et al 2014 with the following modifications i an external mass transfer boundary layer was included for all soluble substrates ii a settler for suspended biomass retention was implemented for the ifas configuration with the possibility to control the srt of flocs srtflocs iii two different sets of kinetic parameters were used for the biofilm and flocs a one dimensional biofilm model was implemented in the aquasim software reichert 1998 wanner and reichert 1996 a planar biofilm constant area was considered an appropriate approximation for biofilms growing on a support the biofilm thickness was set to 800 µm in agreement with previous experimental reports and the geometry of the plastic carriers gilbert et al 2014 veuillet et al 2014 laureni et al 2019 additionally we verified that the reactor performance was not limited by the set biofilm thickness the area was fixed by setting a common ratio of protected biofilm area per reactor volume of 300 m2 m3 this value is in the range reported for this type of mbbr ifas applications considering a filling degree of ca 30 55 with anoxkaldnes k5 veuillet et al 2014 laureni et al 2019 the porosity of the biofilm 80 and the total biomass concentration in the biofilm 90 kg vss m3 were kept constant during all simulations as in pérez et al 2014 simulations were run considering a temperature of 10 c and ph of 7 5 a typical wastewater influent ammonium concentration of 40 gn m3 was chosen the selection of the intrinsic and apparent half saturation coefficients for aob and nob is discussed in the next section the rest of stoichiometric and kinetic parameters were set as in pérez et al 2014 the set of kinetic parameters and rates as well as the stoichiometry matrix are presented in tables s1 s3 the rate expressions implemented to describe growth and decay of the different populations aob nob amx were expressed as a function of temperature equations s1 s4 the implemented flow model allowed the investigation of both the mbbr configuration without active retention of suspended biomass and the ifas one comprising a solid liquid separation unit to retain a set fraction of the biomass detached from the biofilm an explicit expression for the amount of sludge retained based on the efficiency of the settler fsettler see eq 1 was used the equation is a function of the srtflocs and allowed to simulate the operation of ifas systems at a given srtflocs 1 f s e t t l e r 1 v r s r t f l o c s q q r e c where vr is the reactor volume and q and qrec are the wastewater flow rate treated and recirculated from the settler to the reactor respectively to determine the effects of ammonium and oxygen bulk liquid concentrations on the microbial interactions two different control loops were implemented as previously done in similar modelling studies jemaat et al 2013 pérez et al 2014 the simulation strategy consisted mainly of an iterative procedure to determine the minimal ammonium concentration in the bulk liquid required to outcompete nob in the biofilm i e nob activity repression noted as snh4 min a similar iterative procedure was set up to determine the maximum srtflocs allowed to repress nob specifically in the flocs denoted as srtflocs max consistently with pérez et al 2014 nob activity repression was considered effective when the effluent nitrate concentration produced by nob was less than 1 g n m3 at steady state conditions 2 1 oxygen half saturation coefficients of aob and nob in biofilm and flocs the choice of the aob and nob apparent half saturation coefficient ko2 app for oxygen is essential for the correct modelling of their competition in pn amx systems we base our selection on the theoretical analysis performed by picioreanu et al 2016 with a three dimensional model for biofilm and flocs the authors conclude that in biofilms the aob apparent half saturation coefficient for oxygen ko2 aob app is larger i e lower oxygen affinity than that of nob with the exception of the case when aob and nob are stratified however stratification has not been observed for biofilms grown on carriers and performing pn amx at low do persson et al 2017 also the differences in apparent half saturation coefficients can only be observed with 2 d or 3 d biofilm models therefore when using a one dimensional approach e g aquasim a ko2 aob ko2 nob needs to be imposed as intrinsic parameters for biofilms without stratification as starting point for the parameter selection the ko2 nob was selected from the literature study in picioreanu et al 2016 ko2 nob 0 06 g m3 to accomplish with previous conditions ko2 aob was chosen to be ko2 aob 0 12 g m3 in the flocs as diffusion of substrates was not explicitly considered a different set of apparent kinetic parameters was used for the flocculent sludge in principle the larger the flocs or the larger the microcolonies of aob and nob in the flocs e g at longer srt the larger the corresponding apparent oxygen half saturation coefficient pérez et al 2005 picioreanu et al 2016 among others a value of ko2 aob app 0 6 g m3 was chosen as reference case and the impact of this choice was specifically investigated in principle colony sizes in ifas systems are expected to be larger than in activated sludge as they originate by detachment from the biofilm where srts are long this is denoted as seeding and is discussed in the next section therefore this justifies the choice of a rather high ko2 aob app even at low temperatures consistent with picioreanu et al 2016 a much lower value of apparent oxygen half saturation coefficient was selected for nob ko2 nob app 0 06 g m3 as a result the standard case constitutes the worst case scenario for nob repression as nob are favoured in terms of oxygen affinity overall the values chosen as apparent oxygen half saturation coefficients are also in accordance with reported values for ifas systems malovanyy et al 2015 2 2 equivalent aob maximum specific growth rate due to seeding from the biofilm in the ifas reactor configuration biofilm and flocs share the same reactor volume since aob and nob are constantly detached from the biofilm there is a continuous seeding to the bulk liquid a way of describing this process is lumping the maximum specific growth rate µmax and a surplus rate named seeding rate μ m a x s e e d i n g in a single parameter here denominated equivalent maximum specific growth rate μ m a x a o b e q u i v μ m a x a o b s e e d i n g μ m a x a o b see eq 3 in the model the effects of seeding are implicitly determined by the detachment rate and the set maximum biofilm thickness wanner and reichert 1996 reichert 1998 the equivalent maximum specific growth rate is an interesting tool to elucidate the importance of seeding in the ifas configuration we here focused the explanation on aob but the same approach could be applied to other microbial species in the biofilm without seeding aob in the flocs grow at a rate defined by eq 2 2 μ a o b μ m a x a o b s n h 4 s n h 4 k s n h 4 a o b a p p s o 2 s o 2 k o 2 a o b a p p where s is bulk concentration of ammonium nh4 and oxygen o2 and µaob is the specific growth rate for aob kinetics and full description of parameters are available in tables s2 and s3 in the ifas configuration the growth could be described by considering the seeding in a modified monod expression in eq 2 as follows 3 μ a o b μ m a x a o b e q u i v s n h 4 s n h 4 k s n h 4 a o b a p p s o 2 s o 2 k o 2 a o b a p p in this study we used μ m a x a o b e q u i v as a tool to link the effects of seeding with the effects of the operating conditions bulk ammonium concentration do concentration and srtflocs on effective nob repression 3 results and discussion 3 1 external boundary layer thickness the key difference for nob repression between granular sludge and mbbr pn amx reactors external mass transfer resistance controls the actual concentration of substrates available at the biofilm surface and consequently microbial competition however the relevance of the external mass transfer resistance depends on the reactor design and operating conditions for instance granular sludge reactors are generally well mixed and there is a minimal external mass transfer resistance at the biofilm liquid interface i e the biofilm is completely exposed to the flow field whereas in mbbr or ifas reactors the biofilm develops on protected surfaces of plastic carriers therefore neglecting the external mass transfer resistance is the preferred approach for modelling de kreuk et al 2007 hao et al 2002 pérez et al 2014 conversely owing to the different reactor design and operation in mbbr systems the external mass transfer resistance has been reported to be non negligible nogueira et al 2015 gapes and keller 2009 and thus cannot be ignored in the present contribution external mass transfer resistance was taken into account for the description of an mbbr filled with plastic carriers that allow for the development of shear stress protected biofilms as an example the required bulk do and ammonium concentrations for effective nob repression at 10 c with an external boundary layer thickness of 100 µm are presented in fig 1 as a mean of comparison the corresponding curve for a granular sludge reactor without external mass transfer resistance is also plotted pérez et al 2014 compared to the granular sludge reactor the mbbr simulations indicate that the minimal required bulk ammonium concentration for effective nob repression the snh4 min is lower with the exception of high do concentrations 1 4 g m3 in fig 1 this would explain why in literature the trials for nob repression at low temperatures were successful for mbbr gilbert et al 2014 whereas those using granular sludge reactors reported more challenges hoekstra et al 2018 lotti et al 2014b in fact in view of the modelling results presented here external mass transfer resistance appears to be a key regulator for the aob amx metabolic coupling for ammonia removal specifically the main controlling factor is the do concentration at the biofilm liquid interface which depends on the external mass transfer and the given bulk liquid do concentration for thick external boundary layers low bulk do concentrations imply a much lower do concentration in the biofilm see fig 1c operating at low do decreases the rate of aerobic oxidation of ammonia into nitrite by aob as a result residual nitrite concentrations become very low which in turn favours nob repression due to nitrite unavailability known as the amx nitrite sink laureni et al 2019 for instance operating the reactor at a bulk do concentration of 0 3 g m3 results in a do concentration at the liquid biofilm interface of only 0 062 g m3 ll 100µm fig 1c or 0 036 g m3 ll 200µm therefore in mbbr or ifas systems in which the bulk do is kept very low ca 0 2 and 0 17 g m3 as reported by gilbert et al 2014 and laureni et al 2019 respectively the biofilm is maintained under almost anoxic conditions as a consequence of the external mass transfer resistance such microaerophilic conditions have proven successful for nob repression in suspended pn amx systems operated at bulk do below the detection limit i e 0 05 g m3 even at temperatures as low as 12 c hu et al 2013 in the only three studies reporting stable pn amx gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2019 and hu et al 2013 the do was very low while ammonium was always in excess between 2 and 6 mg nh4 n l this combination of operating conditions is of key importance for process performance avoiding nitrate production by nob as indicated by the results of the simulations the same principle applies also for ifas reactors as detailed in section 3 2 in reactor configurations where both aeration and mechanical stirring are used the external mass transfer boundary layer could be regulated by controlling the stirring speed however increasing the boundary layer unavoidably requires larger reactor volumes to treat a given loading rate see details in specific section 3 5 the thicker the external mass transfer boundary layer the smaller the required bulk ammonium concentrations for effective nob repression fig 2 a for a given bulk do concentration increasing the mass transfer resistance i e thicker external mass transfer boundary layer results in lower oxygen concentration at the biofilm this in turn favours the aob amx metabolic coupling for autotrophic ammonia removal 3 2 controlling nob activity in the presence of flocs the ifas configuration 3 2 1 ifas are less impacted by the external mass transfer resistance than mbbr in the ifas reactor configuration consisting of an mbbr with a settler for flocculent biomass retention not only aob but also nob can potentially grow both in the biofilm and the flocs laureni et al 2016 nevertheless recent experimental evidence suggests that nob repression could be successfully achieved in ifas reactors operated for pn amx even at temperatures as low as 15 c laureni et al 2019 thomson et al 2016 to explore the impact of the external mass transfer boundary layer on nob repression in ifas systems a wide range of boundary layer thicknesses was simulated 0 200 µm the resulting snh4 min curves are presented in fig 2b d as a function of bulk ammonium and do concentrations for three fixed flocs srt srtflocs in all cases larger boundary layers result in broader regions for nob repression however the phase diagrams fig 2 differ substantially between the mbbr fig 2a and the ifas in particular at high srtflocs operating at higher srtflocs e g 20 d narrowed down the region for effective nob repression at high do while stable pn amx could still be kept at low do fig 2b d the mathematical model indicates that increasing srtflocs e g from 5 to 10 days at 10 c might compromise the stability of the process due to nob proliferation at high do above 9 g o2 m3 at ll 100 µm see fig 2d importantly simulations suggest that this effect cannot be counterbalanced by operation at higher residual ammonium concentrations as is always the case for mbbr by comparing e g fig 2a and d a clear bending of the snh4 min curve is observed at high bulk ammonium concentrations at high srtflocs operating the reactor at high bulk ammonium concentration directs more aerobic ammonium oxidation to the flocs and is detrimental for nob repression in the flocs see next sections for instance at srtflocs 20 d and do 0 6 g m3 nob are repressed at 2 gnh4 n m3 but not at 8 gnh4 n m3 because nob independently proliferate in the flocs even at high boundary layer thickness that hinder their growth in the biofilm fig 3 3 2 2 the solids retention time of the flocs srtflocs regulates nob growth in the flocs to identify the maximum srtflocs at which nob repression is achieved and pn amx is the dominant process in the ifas system simulations were run for a broad range of srtflocs and boundary layer thicknesses fig 4 in fig 4a a bulk do concentration of 0 3 g m3 and an ammonium concentration of 5 g n m3 were selected for efficient nob repression in the biofilm to be able to independently investigate the impact of srtflocs for a given boundary layer thickness imposing an srtflocs srtflocs max results in nob proliferation in the flocculent sludge irrespective of nob growth on biofilm comparable results with effective nob repression in the flocs were observed in an ifas reactor operated at 15 c on aerobically pre treated municipal wastewater at 0 17g o2 m3 with an aerobic srtflocs of 40 days laureni et al 2019 a set of simulations was carried out to explore the srtflocs max at different bulk do concentrations at lower bulk do concentrations higher srtflocs max values were found with the model fig 4b overall the model identified the region of nob repression in the biofilm as a function of the bulk ammonium and do concentrations and the boundary layer thickness fig 2 on the one hand nob can independently proliferate in the flocs if the srtflocs is above the threshold value srtflocs max on the other hand if nob would proliferate in the biofilm due to too high bulk do concentration or too low bulk ammonium concentration nob would also be present in the flocs irrespective of the srtflocs imposed due to seeding this is why nob proliferate in both biofilm and flocs fig 1a or exclusively in the flocs since nob could be repressed in the biofilm at high bulk ammonium concentrations as already discussed fig 4a 3 2 3 aob and nob seeding from the biofilm plays a crucial role in flocs composition the model was used to assess why nitrite oxidation can be repressed in the flocs while maintaining stable nitritation even at long srtflocs see fig 4b at low bulk do concentrations one of the hypotheses is linked to the constant seeding of aob from the biofilm in other words while the imposed srtflocs is not enough for aob and nob i e srtflocs max to proliferate in the flocs due to the low temperature imposed 10 c they grow in the biofilm and detachment provides a constant seeding eq 4 this was investigated by simulating an ifas configuration in which seeding of aob from the biofilm was switched off two types of aob were used aob detached from biofilm were imposed to be not active in the flocs and an active aob species in flocs with the same kinetics and stoichiometry was independently inoculated as initial condition for the simulation the results showed that washout of aob and nob from the flocs happened for a wide range of conditions fig 5 therefore seeding of aob and nob from the biofilm is crucial to retain ammonium oxidation in the flocs if effective nob repression would be achieved in the biofilm and no seeding of nob from the biofilm into the flocs would occur in general this means that for the modelling of hybrid biofilm systems with biofilm and flocs coexisting like in ifas an adequate description of the detachment is paramount the identification of the maximum srtflocs which assures effective nob repression in the flocs if they are not seeded from the biofilm is a complex problem in continuous suspended growth systems the imposed srt equals the inverse of the minimum specific growth rate required for an organism to be maintained in the system srt 1 µi specifically for the system under study for a given srtflocs the following equalities can be established 4 s r t f l o c s 1 μ a o b 1 μ m a x a o b e q u i v s n h 4 s n h 4 k s n h 4 a o b a p p s o 2 s o 2 k o 2 a o b a p p 1 μ n o b 1 μ m a x n o b e q u i v s n o 2 s n o 2 k s n o 2 n o b a p p s o 2 s o 2 k o 2 n o b a p p from eq 4 stable nitritation and nob repression in the flocs is achieved only when 1 μ n o b s r t f l o c s 1 μ a o b in the case of aob from the definition provided in the model development section μ m a x a o b e q u i v is the sum of μ m a x a o b s e e d i n g and μ max aob while μ max aob depends only on temperature and ph see eq s2 and cannot be manipulated operational conditions can be controlled to enhance the contribution of μ m a x a o b s e e d i n g and consequently μ m a x a o b e q u i v this is achieved by promoting the growth of aob on the biofilm analogously to ensure washout of nob from the flocs μ m a x n o b e q u i v needs to be minimized as μ max nob cannot be controlled conditions need to be established to reduce μ m a x a o b s e e d i n g i e preventing nob growth in the biofilm from eq 4 the impact of each of the operational conditions and parameters on μaob and μnob can be discussed from the monod terms a decrease in bulk do would impact both growth rates with a bigger impact on μaob as we assumed k o 2 a o b a p p k o 2 n o b a p p however low do would also favor aob growth in the biofilm and thus increase μ m a x a o b s e e d i n g while nob growth in biofilm would be repressed see section above moreover the first equality in eq 4 can be used to estimate the contribution of seeding for aob and elucidate the impact of bulk ammonium by simply clearing μ m a x a o b e q u i v from the equation the μ m a x a o b e q u i v was calculated for a wide range of bulk ammonium concentrations at two srtflocs 5 and 20 days and a bulk do concentration of 0 5 g o2 m3 the results were plotted and compared to μ max aob to identify when retention of aob in the flocs is possible only due to seeding fig 6 at low srtflocs e g 5 d the contribution of the seeding to μ m a x a o b e q u i v is significant i e μ m a x a o b e q u i v always above μ m a x a o b and decreases at increasing ammonium concentration at higher srtflocs the contribution of the seeding diminishes for example at an srtflocs of 20 d and ammonium above 5 gn m3 no seeding is required and aob can proliferate independently in the flocs in summary the results indicate that operating the ifas at high srtflocs with high bulk ammonium concentration reduces the relative importance of the aob seeding from the biofilm favoring nob proliferation in the flocs besides imposing low do μnob could be further reduced if the bulk nitrite concentration is kept low e g by enhancing the amx nitrite sink in the biofilm from the second equality in eq 4 related to nob the maximum bulk nitrite concentration for effective nob repression at a given srtflocs could be estimated this threshold nitrite concentration has been computed out of eq 4 or different bulk do concentrations and srtflocs see table s4 at longer srtflocs and at higher bulk do concentrations a stronger aob amx metabolic coupling would be required for effective nob repression i e the threshold nitrite concentration is smaller 3 3 aob partitioning between flocs and biofilm the partitioning of aob between the biofilm and the flocs in ifas reactors was investigated with the mathematical model as a function of srtflocs for a set of operating conditions external boundary layer thickness ll 100 µm bulk ammonium concentration 2 gn m3 bulk do concentration 0 5 g m3 the main results indicate that the relative fraction of aob in the flocs remained significantly smaller than the one in the biofilm even at an srtflocs of 20 days fig 7 a however the mass of aob in the biofilm is rather small if compared to the total solids in the biofilm ca 1 2 on average see fig 7a this small fraction in the biofilm often hampers precise experimental quantification for instance by fish as previously highlighted corbala robles et al 2016 besides the imposed srtflocs fig 7a the partitioning of aob also strongly depends on the apparent fitness of the aob in the flocs understood as competitiveness derived from kinetic parameters this is reflected in the dependency on bulk do fig 7b and ammonium fig 8 concentrations specifically the apparent fitness of the aob located in flocs is shaped by both the floc and the microcolony sizes see manser et al 2005 picioreanu et al 2016 here as a matter of instructing exercise the case of small floc and colony sizes has been selected this was simulated by keeping the apparent substrate and oxygen half saturation coefficients at very low values ko2 aob app 0 06g m3 ks nh4 aob app 1 1gn m3 figs 7 and 8 other factors like for instance the boundary layer thickness have less pronounced effects data not shown independently of the amount of aob in biofilm and flocs fig 7 the corresponding contribution to the overall activity depends on reactor conditions and the apparent aob fitness in flocs to investigate the relative activity of aob in flocs and biofilm their corresponding nitrite production was quantified see figs 7a and 8 while the aob partitioning between flocs and biofilm is not much influenced by the bulk ammonium concentration high bulk ammonium concentrations direct aob activity towards the flocs even with aob being mainly located in the biofilm fig 8 the fraction of nitrite produced in the flocs dominates at 10 gnh4 n m3 ca 70 of the nitrite production happened in the flocs compared to that at 2 g nh4 n m3 ca 38 of nitrite is produced in the flocs fig 8 inevitably higher nitrite production in the bulk favours the growth of nob eq 4 this explains the bending in the phase diagrams for ifas as compared to mbbr at high ammonium concentrations fig 2 also this might be the reason why when using ex situ activity batch tests by adding ammonium as proxy for the abundance of aob in flocs and biofilm as done in laureni et al 2019 the results obtained possibly overestimated the fraction of aob in the flocs and underestimate it in the biofilm consequently when using ex situ activity tests for flocs and biofilm one might have the false impression that the amount of aob in the biofilm is negligible which appears unlikely based on the model outputs 3 4 main factors affecting the performance of the anammox nitrite sink 3 4 1 amx inhibition by oxygen has a major impact the metabolic coupling between aob and amx in engineered ecosystems is favoured at low do as shown in numerous experimental studies among others particularly relevant hu et al 2013 by limiting the do amx are less inhibited and aob produce nitrite at a lower rate compatible with the one of anammox in analogy with the metabolic balance between amx and aob achieved in the oceanic oxygen minimum zones kalvelage et al 2011 in this study when the biofilm was exposed to lower do concentrations e g by increasing the thickness of the boundary layer resistance at constant bulk do the nitrite sink was enhanced leading to a wider region of operating conditions for effective nob repression fig 1 assuring an excess of ammonium in the bulk liquid has also been shown experimentally to be crucial to obtain good pn amx performance at low temperatures gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 2019 from a theoretical standpoint pérez et al 2014 identified the increased aob activity and consequent faster oxygen consumption in the biofilm as the mechanism leading to successful nob repression in granular sludge pn amx reactors at high residual ammonium concentrations differently in the present study the bulk ammonium concentration cannot result in a direct advantage for the oxygen competition between aob and nob as the selected oxygen half saturation coefficients favour nob over aob instead the observed effect of the bulk ammonium concentration on nob repression figs 1 3 is indirect in the model regulating the bulk ammonium concentration at a high value results in shorter oxygen penetration depths in analogy with the granular sludge case this indirectly enhances the amx nitrite sink by reducing the inhibition of anammox by oxygen to demonstrate this mechanism a set of simulations were run by changing the amx inhibitory coefficient ki o amx fig 9 or even neglecting completely anammox inhibition by oxygen i e removing the term k i o a m x k i o a m x s o 2 from rate eq 5 in table s2 the results obtained confirm that the amx inhibitory coefficient regulates the bulk ammonia concentration required for effective nob repression both in mbbr and ifas systems fig 9 with no anammox inhibition the simulations clearly indicated a very effective nob repression even at 10 c with ammonium concentrations below 0 05 g n m3 for the range of tested do concentrations data not shown these results strongly support the key role played by the oxygen anammox inhibition in regulating nob repression the extent of anammox inhibition by oxygen depends on the performance of aob which is a function of the bulk ammonium concentration as a result the residual ammonium concentration impacts the amx nitrite sink in the biofilm and thus the nob repression the interface between the aerobic and anoxic regions i e where aob cell clusters are in contact with amx clusters is particularly sensitive any change in reactor conditions that slow down the oxygen consumption by aob e g a decrease in the reactor temperature would immediately result in more oxygen leaking from the biofilm layers occupied by aob and increasing the fraction of amx inhibited by oxygen recently an experimental study used a similar rationale for improving the performance of pn amx by designing a control strategy to reduce the negative effects of the oxygen penetration depth in cases of a temperature drop wang et al 2019 3 4 2 external boundary layer reduces the availability for amx of nitrite produced in flocs favoring nob in flocs directing aerobic ammonium oxidation towards the flocs in ifas systems might affect the amx nitrite sink as nitrite produced in the flocs needs to diffuse through the boundary layer and biofilm to reach the amx layers to assess the impact of the nitrite boundary layer thickness on the amx nitrite sink a set of simulations were run by setting to zero the llno2 but keeping the external mass transfer resistance for the rest of soluble components e g oxygen for thick external boundary layers ll 200 µm and long srt 20 d a wider window of operating conditions with effective nob repression was found fig s3 the main effect was on the proliferation of nob in the flocs whereas in the biofilm the effect was insignificant fig s3 these results confirm the importance of the amx nitrite sink in controlling nob in the flocs as proposed by laureni at el 2019 also simulations highlight the key role of the external mass transfer resistance for the nitrite produced in the flocs in controlling the amx nitrite sink 3 5 the external mass transfer resistance impacts the nitrogen load that can be treated as already discussed external mass transfer resistance hinders the mass transport towards the biofilm with clear advantages for nob repression however greater external mass transfer resistance i e the external boundary layer is thicker would result in lower removal rates in both mbbr and ifas configurations typical boundary layer thicknesses range between 100 and 200 µm for low aeration regimes nogueira et al 2015 this is in contrast to granular sludge reactors in which the external mass transfer resistance is minimized with however a more challenging control of nob the model has been used to quantify the effects of external mass transfer resistance on the volumetric nitrogen loading rate that the reactor system can treat to produce an effluent with 5 g nh4 n m3 at increasing boundary layer thicknesses the reduction in the applicable rate is remarkable as illustrated fig 10 a also a decrease in the bulk do has major effect in the load that can be treated to better understand the strong effect the do concentrations at the biofilm liquid interface have been computed as reference see fig 10c importantly increasing the srtflocs allows for an improvement in the loading rate that can be treated in particular if the fitness of the aob in the flocs is also increased i e small flocs in fig 10b in conclusion the simulation results are in strong agreement with available experimental results for mbbr or ifas systems operated for pn amx at low temperatures reporting poor nitrogen loading rate despite effective nob repression gilbert at al 2014 laureni et al 2016 gilbert et al 2014 operated an mbbr at 10 c on synthetic influent at mainstream conditions and a do of ca 0 2 g o2 m3 achieving a nitrogen removal rate of 0 015 kgn m3 d with effective nob repression laureni et al 2019 operated an ifas reactor configuration at 15 c to remove nitrogen from aerobically pre treated municipal wastewater at 0 17 g o2 m3 achieving nitrogen removal rates of 0 08 kg n m3 d with effective nob repression and good effluent quality 4 conclusions the results obtained in this modelling study highly consistent with published experimental data allowed to elucidate the principles controlling microbial competition and nob repression in mbbr and ifas systems operated for pn amx the following conclusions could be drawn the higher external mass transfer resistance in mbbr systems as compared to granular reactors results in lower substrate concentrations at the biofilm surface and thereby favour nob repression by enhancing the aob amx metabolic coupling the ifas configuration allows for higher nitrogen removal rates than mbbr but feature a narrower range of operational conditions for nob repression as nob can proliferate in the flocs even if repressed in the biofilm at low bulk ammonium and do concentrations aob are maintained in the flocs primarily due to seeding from the biofilm while nob growth is repressed in the biofilm high do and residual ammonium concentrations promote growth of nob in the flocs independently from the seeding from the biofilm the anammox nitrite sink in the biofilm plays a crucial role in repressing nob proliferation in the flocs by limiting the available nitrite but is strongly affected by the inhibition of anammox by oxygen from a practical perspective a trade off exists between nob repression by increasing boundary layer resistance and the resulting lower nitrogen load that can be treated declaration of competing

17546,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considerable microplastics mps contributors to environmental waters knowledge about the mps degradation process under ultraviolet irradiation was crucial to understanding the fate of mps during and after water disinfection in this study surface alternations of polystyrene ps polyethylene pe polyvinylchloride pvc and polyethylene terephthalate pet under 254 nm uv c and 185 254 nm vacuum ultraviolet vuv irradiation were estimated one way treatment of mps by uv or vuv with the recommended dose for wwtps usepa 180 mj cm 2 had little effect in contrast excessive exposure under twenty times doses irradiation 3600 mj cm 2 resulted in significant alternations on surface morphology chemical feature and hydrophobicity noticeably morphology alterations including cracks wrinkles and protuberances were observed for ps pvc and pet while pe was relatively resistant fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that uv irradiation induced cleavage of chemical bonds besides simultaneous radical oxidation was predominant during vuv treatment which contributed to the increasing generation of oxygen bonds such as co and co on all mps surfaces drastic decreases of contact angle 20 were observed for ps pvc and pet even after 180 mj cm 2 uv irradiation indicating the uv disinfection in wwtps can easily change their surface hydrophobicity all these alternations weakened the adsorption capacity of non polar benzene and polar ciprofloxacin on mps generally regular dose uv and vuv irradiation in water treatment disinfection can only induce slight effects on mps surface characteristics and adsorption performance while extreme dose irradiation can induce a potential reducing risk of organic contaminants migration along with mps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics ultraviolet irradiation wastewater treatment plant vacuum ultraviolet adsorption 1 introduction microplastics mps are an emerging contaminant which is ubiquitous in worldwide aquatic environments e g oceans lakes rivers and urban sewage eerkes medrano et al 2015 mps comprise plastic litter or debris smaller than 5 mm with irregular shapes and various polymers including polystyrene ps polyethylene pe polyvinylchloride pvc polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene etc mps have been generally classified into two types primary mps and secondary mps the former indicates artificial plastic particles that are used as additives in industrial products one typical example is microbeads acted as facial scrubbers chang 2015 fendall and sewell 2009 toothpaste or air blasting media gregory 2009 secondary mps are generated from the fragmentation of large plastics debris in the aqueous medium via sunlight irradiation wind blow water stir and other external environmental disturbances singh and sharma 2008 all these synthetic mps are believed to last for a long period maybe thousands of years before complete degradation in the natural environment barnes et al 2009 thus their long term negative impact on aquatic environment and human health is a concern as important parts of the urban aqueous cycle wastewater treatment plants wwtps are exposed to mps contamination primary mps were speculated to be the dominating ones in domestic wastewater napper et al 2015 van wezel et al 2016 while secondary mps have been poorly defined due to their complicated sources and were considered as the minor part in the urban aqueous system the lightweight nature and small size of mps resulted in their distinct removal in traditional water treatment facilities preliminary investigations have confirmed that primary treatment or secondary treatment can remove most of the mps 90 particularly large particles long et al 2019 murphy et al 2016 however some small size mps were still released with the final effluent of wwtps always 1 particle l 1 browne et al 2011 chang 2015 fendall and sewell 2009 considering that the discharge volume of normal wwtps generally reached 108 109 l d 1 it indicated that a large amount of mps still enters the receiving water as a daily fact talvitie et al 2017 therefore wwtps have been suggested to act as important point sources of mps to received water bodies murphy et al 2016 because of their high polymer nature mps are stable under conventional physical treatments e g screening coagulation sedimentation and flotation ou and zeng 2018 on the contrary they may be broken up under some physicochemical processes such as ultraviolet uv irradiation which is widely applied as the disinfection processes of wwtps hijnen et al 2006 it has been reported that plastic can be degraded under uv a 320 400 nm and uv b 280 320 nm irradiation guo and wang 2019 wang et al 2013 for microplastics long term sunlight exposure enriched by uv a and uv b can induce chemical chain scission o2 h2o addition and environmentally persistent free radicals formation zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 as well as morphological variations such as cracks and flakes cai et al 2018 indeed most of the uv a and uv b experiments spent weeks or months due to the low energy and intensity of light sources implying a slow aging process however the common light sources in wwtps are low pressure mercury lamps which emit uv c 254 nm and vacuum ultraviolet vuv 185 nm irradiation uv c irradiation in wwtps has its characteristics that is high intensity and short time which may induce different degradation patterns compared to uv a and uv b uv c irradiation had higher photon energy 254 nm 4 88 ev which may induce more critical damage on the surface chemical bonds of mps considering that mps can adsorb and accumulate various organic contaminants on their surfaces he et al 2020 li et al 2018a yang et al 2020 and this capacity may alter based on the surface feature huffer et al 2018 it is necessary to estimate the morphology and chemical variations of mps during uv disinfection treatments up to now very little attention has been drawn to the potential degradation of mps under uv c vuv disinfection not to mention their effects on the surface characteristic or adsorption capacity here we report detailed data on the morphology and chemical variations of four mps including ps pe pvc and pet under 254 nm uv c and 185 254 nm uv vuv named vuv irradiation the variations of morphology and surface chemical characteristics were estimated while the hydrophobic feature was also investigated polar ciprofloxacin cip and non polar benzene were selected as the targeted contaminants their adsorption equilibrium and kinetics on pristine mps and uv vuv treated mps were compared these results will improve the knowledge about the fate of mps in water treatment processes as well as the potential impact of mps on environments 2 experimental 2 1 chemical materials cip 98 5 hplc grade was purchased from tci benzene 99 was obtained from merck microplastic polymers including ps pe pvc and pet were purchased from goodfellow cambridge limited and their detailed information was listed in table s1 all reagents were stored at c or 20 c as demand while mps were sealed under n2 atmosphere ultrapure water with 18 2 mω was used to prepare solutions reagents used for electron paramagnetic resonance epr including 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine tempo 99 and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 97 were bought from sigma 2 2 characterization a field emission scanning electron microscope sem evo18 zeiss was applied to detect the surface morphology of mps fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy was recorded using an is50 infrared spectrometer thermo with wavenumber of 4000 400 cm 1 and it was used to identify the surface chemical characteristics in addition absorbance ratio between the peaks related to carbonyl and methylene in ftir data was calculated and it was named carbonyl index ci value this ci value reflects the degree of surface oxidation especially the transformation of methylene to co bond the surface elemental compositions were analyzed by a thermo fisher k alpha x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps while the oxygen to carbon o c ratio was calculated based on the integral area ratio of oxygen and carbon peaks text s1 this o c ratio can reflect the variation tendency of oxygen containing bonds mainly including co and co on the mp surfaces detailed calculation methods of ci value and o c ratio were reported in ref liu et al 2019b contact angle was determined using an optical tension meter kino sl200kb with a photo taking interval at 1 0 s the data were obtained at time 5 s after contact furthermore epr was applied to detect the radicals in uv and vuv reactions detailed parameters of epr are described in text s2 2 3 uv and vuv irradiation a quasi parallel irradiation device was assembled fig s1 with some modifications based on the device reported in our previous study chen et al 2019 besides normal uv vuv treatment is a novel promising advanced oxidation process for water treatment to give a prospective viewpoint about the disinfection methods on mps vuv was also considered therefore low pressure mercury uv lamp 254 nm 10 w gph212t5l 4 and vuv lamp 185 nm 254 nm 10 w gph212t5vh 4 were obtained from heraeus and they were both used as light sources for standard gph212t5vh 4 vuv lamp 254 nm and 185 nm irradiation contributes 94 and 6 of the total energy respectively an illuminometer was used to measure the irradiation intensity of 254 nm uv while some modification factors were considered following the same method reported in our previous study ye et al 2019 for uv treatment uv lamp emitting 254 nm was applied for vuv treatment vuv lamp emitting both 254 nm and 185 nm irradiation was used the irradiation dose mentioned in the subsequent sections all indicates that at 254 nm and 185 nm irradiation dose can be calculated based on it finally the irradiation intensity on the top of mps containing reaction suspension was set at 0 1 mw cm 2 before reaction a uv photometer was used to determine the irradiation intensity at different distances from a uv lamp and then the intensity was adjusted by changing the distance between the lamp and reaction suspension surface based on usepa guide the uv dose required for viruses inactivation 4 log is 186 mj cm 2 usepa 2006 thus we used 180 mj cm 2 as the minimum dose for mps treatment in addition to check the effect under extreme irradiation conditions a twenty times dose 3600 mj cm 2 was applied as the maximum dose for uv and vuv treatments before irradiation reaction mps particles were added into ultrapure water for 2 h with stirring to avoid the interference of surface electric charge subsequently 20 ml of ultrapure water was transferred into the customized reaction vessel and then 100 mg mps were added the customized reaction vessel was air tight with a quartz glass cover on top it had water circulating function and the temperature of circulating water was maintained by a water bath device a magnetic stirrer was set below the reaction vessel to maintained the stirring by adding a magnetic follower mps was suspended during reaction irradiation dose can be obtained by the multiplication of irradiation intensity and time at given time the treated mps samples were filtrated from the suspension and transferred into glass tubes and then dried in shade and stored in a dryer and then 20 30 particles were obtained randomly for ftir xps contact angle analyses control groups were conducted using the same mps immersed in ultrapure water without any light uv or vuv treatment 2 4 batch adsorption and quantitative analysis a series of stock solutions with seven concentration gradients 0 1 0 5 1 0 4 0 8 0 12 5 20 0 mg l 1 of cip and benzene were prepared using methanol water solution 1 methanol before adsorption experiments pristine and treated mps were added into 100 ml stock solutions in glass vials with teflon septa on top the vials were kept tight and shaken in orbit at 30 rpm under 298 k for 7 d all adsorption experiments were performed in triplicate for cip at given time points the mixture was filtrated by 0 22 μm filter the filtered solutions were transferred into amber tubes before analysis quantitative determination of cip was performed by a hplc ms2 ab sciex triplequad 5500 detailed analysis processes were reported in our previous studies hu et al 2019 for benzene a two hours placing of the vials without shaking was conducted before analysis in order to reach the equilibrium of benzene in liquid and gaseous phases endo et al 2008 concentration of benzene was determined by a gc ms shimadzu qp2010 plus with a headspace sampling device an hp 5 gc column agilent j w 19091j 433 was applied and the isothermal oven temperatures were in the range of 75 and 150 c calibration standards of benzene was prepared before analysis the benzene concentration in upper gaseous was detected by gc ms system with a headspace sampling 500 μl with solid phase microextraction since the air water partitioning constants of benzene was known log kaw 0 65 huffer and hofmann 2016 its concentration in liquid phase can be calculated based on henry s law external calibration spiked with naphthalene was applied for quantitative analysis spiked control blank experiments without mps were also conducted to determine the loss of cip and benzene during the experimental procedure without adsorption which was considered in data calculation 2 5 data analysis statistics the variations of ci value and o c ratio were evaluated by one way anova spss 19 0 data having p 0 05 were considered significant in adsorption experiments two adsorption models including freundlich and langmuir were used to fit the adsorption isotherms for both cip and benzene table s2 the calculation and adsorption model fitting followed the similar procedures reported in ref huffer and hofmann 2016 li et al 2018b 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction mechanism of uv and vuv epr was used to evaluate the reaction mechanisms in the uv and vuv systems the trapping agent for radical species was dmpo fig 1 presents the epr results in the uv system no radical adduct of dmpo was observed indicating that there was only direct photolysis in the uv system irradiation of 254 nm uv c can induce the rupture of organic bonds on mps surface on the contrary dmpo adduct of hydroxyl radical oh with four characteristic peaks was detected in the vuv system irradiation at 185 nm from the vuv lamp can induce photolysis of h2o into oh eqs 1 and 2 although the irradiation energy of 185 nm only contributes 6 of the total lamp energy the high quantum yield 0 33 can generate substantial oh in water matrix which would attack the mps surface these distinct reaction mechanisms implied that potential differences of surface morphological and chemical variations would occur between uv and vuv treatments 1 h 2 o h v 185 oh h φ oh 0 33 2 h 2 o h v 185 oh h e a q φ oh 0 04 of note natural water matrixes contained high concentrations of background constituents which can quench and absorb uv c and vuv irradiation during disinfection since only ultrapure water was used as water matrix herein an overestimation of the effects of uv c and vuv on mps may be achieved in the current study 3 2 surface morphology of mps to obtain a visual variation of surface morphology the irradiation dose was set at the maximum value 3600 mj cm 2 at 254 nm after uv and vuv aging processes noticeably alterations including cracks wrinkles and protuberances were observed fig 2 generally the morphology variations undergoing vuv treatment were faster and more intense than uv moreover mps treated by vuv presented an evident melting phenomenon which could be attributed to the oh oxidation of their surface chemical structure microplastics with different polymers showed diversity in changing trends as showed in fig 2b original ps presented relatively smooth textures which became rough and generated flakes after uv irradiation fig 2c furthermore a melted surface was observed after maximum dose vuv exposure fig 2d in contrast pe exhibited resistance to uv irradiation and showed a slightly melting phenomenon when exposed to vuv fig 2e h in the case of pvc wrinkles and numerous nodule like protuberances were developed on the surfaces after 3600 mj cm 2 uv exposure fig 2k correspondingly after vuv treatment pvc surfaces were melted obviously and formed bubble like protuberances these bubbles were hollow and fragile which began to break during sem analysis fig 2l pristine pet processed a homogeneous texture on the surface fig 2m and n however an eroded surface with wrinkles was observed after 3600 mj cm 2 uv irradiation fig 2o for vuv the pet surface was melted and generated some small nodule like protuberances simultaneously fig 2p above all uv and vuv irradiation caused diverse morphology changes which could deconstruct and recombine the surface chemical groups of mps furthermore these variations may alter their surface hydrophobicity and adsorption capacity of organic pollutants 3 3 surface chemical feature irradiation dose at 254 nm was set in the range of 180 3600 mj cm 2 to evaluate the surface chemical feature variations firstly xps was measured fig 3 and figs s2 s4 after the maximum dose irradiation 3600 mj cm 2 at 254 nm it seems that the surface structures of mps were more susceptible to vuv than to uv additionally it showed distinct variation trends among different mps for ps the c1s spectra demonstrated an increasing co bond after both uv and vuv irradiation fig 3 of note a weak o1s peak was observed for pristine ps suggesting that its surface contained some oxygen bonds which may be due to atmospheric oxidation during storage two deconvoluted peaks with corresponding bond energies at 532 4 ev and 533 7 ev were obtained from o1s spectrum which represented alkoxy co and carboxyl co respectively after uv and vuv treatments these two peaks developed obviously indicating that the ps surface was gradually oxidized compared with ps pvc presented a similar variation in the peak of co bond while pe exposed a weaker increase figs s2 and s3 it should be noted that the o1s spectrum decreased for pet after uv irradiation and hardly any variation appeared after vuv treatment fig s4 o c atom ratio was applied to evaluate the oxidation degree of mps surface fig 4 in general vuv induced a more rapid increase of o c ratio than uv with distinctive kinetic models during uv irradiation the o c ratios of ps pe and pvc surfaces followed positive linear correlations based on kinetic analysis which may be due to the photodegradation fig 4a c and e the damage mechanism of these mps surfaces by uv irradiation could be erosion resulting in the breaking of chemical bonds irradiation at 254 nm uv irradiation can excite the polymer surface chemical bonds to excited states which can react with other molecules in water such as o2 oh etc it can form oxygen containing bonds such as co and co resulting in the raise of o c ratio it should be noted that the curve of uv treated pet decreased over time and was more consistent with exponential function rather than linear function suggesting a different damage process fig 4g for vuv irradiation the o c ratios of four mps demonstrated high correlations with pseudo first order kinetics fig 4b d f and h indicating that radical oxidation may dominate the vuv aging process hydroxyl radicals generated by 185 nm vuv irradiation damaged mps surfaces via oxidation resulting in a more rapid degradation than uv in the early stage typically 540 mj cm 2 since oh oxidation tends to be saturated the oxidation was slowed down in the later stage as only slight variations of o c ratio were observed after 254 nm dose increased to 1080 mj cm 2 in vuv treatment data with higher irradiation dose was not included the results of o c ratio variation revealed that the degradation pattern was also depended on mps materials ps had the fastest increase of o c ratio and the highest degree of surface oxidation the o c ratio increased from 4 to 62 after 1080 mj cm 2 uv irradiation fig 4a furthermore it leaped to 117 after 1080 mj cm 2 vuv dose at 254 nm treatment fig 4b benzene ring groups in ps were susceptive to 254 nm uv irradiation and it was vulnerable to radical oxidation on the contrary the o c ratios of pe and pvc only increased 20 and 40 after vuv treatment fig 4d and f this may be due to their tight skeleton framing simple chemical component and long straight chain structure uv and vuv irradiation can only induce limited rupture and oxidation on these two mps surface it should be noted that o c ratio of pet decreased under uv irradiation fig 4g mainly on account of the existence of benzene ring alkoxy and carbonyl groups these bonds broke rapidly under uv irradiation resulting in the decline of oxygen content however an exponential increase was still observed for the o c ratio of pet under vuv treatment fig 4h these findings inferred that oxidation on mps surface may be a dominant reaction mechanism during uv and vuv treatments to further verify the changes in chemical characteristics ftir was measured as shown in fig 5 the ftir spectra revealed new absorption peaks that appeared at 1720 cm 1 in ps and pvc which were identified as the characteristic peaks representing stretching vibration of carbonyl groups co these new peaks suggested the generation of carbonyl structures during uv and vuv treatments even under the minimum irradiation dose at 180 mj cm 2 of note no evident new peak was observed for pe even after 3600 mj cm 2 uv irradiation or under vuv treatment fig s5 this result again indicated the inertness of pe to light irradiation furthermore in the spectra of treated pvc the peaks appeared at 3047 cm 1 and 3143 cm 1 were both assigned to ch stretching vibration for pet mps the peaks at 2846 cm 1 and 2912 cm 1 which attributed to ch2 symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration respectively almost disappeared after vuv treatment carbonyl index calculated from ftir spectra was used as another tool to evaluate the degradation degree of mps fig s6 for uv treatment there was no positive relation between ci and irradiation dose with a tendency of initial increase and then decrease statistically for ps pe and pvc this result also suggested that an accumulation of co bond on these mps surface after low dose irradiation even under 180 mj cm 2 however co bonds were degraded when the irradiation dose increased continuously this trend differed to o c value variation tendency which mainly included co co and benzene oxygen bonds of these three mps a conversion from co to co under uv irradiation may be the reason of note a decrease of ci was observed for pet which was consistent with the o c result fig 4g suggesting the decomposition of oxygen contained bonds on the pet surface regarding vuv irradiation the ci increased followed exponential kinetics with high correlation r 2 0 9943 0 9931 and 0 9999 for ps pe and pvc respectively for pet only a slight increase of ci was observed and no kinetics model can be fitted this result was related to the degradation mechanism of vuv treatment including cleavage of uv irradiation and simultaneous radical oxidation it was also consistent with the o c data fig 4h the obtained ftir and xps results indicated the oxidation of most mps by uv and vuv in the current study further ci index and o c ratio analyses provided more quantitative data to investigate these variations generally all four mps were undergone oxidation on the surfaces excepted the pet under uv treatment of note pe seemed to be the most resistant one generation of oxygen containing bonds would change the surface characteristics of mps although both xps and ftir can reflect the aging degree of mps surfaces some differences are still obvious firstly the functional groups those can be determined by ftir are limited on the contrary data of co ch and other bonds can be obtained clearly by xps with high resolution thus xps can reveal more information about the variation of chemical groups secondly the detection depths of these two methods are variable ftir can detect several millimeters deep from the surface while xps can only detect a depth of nanoscale therefore it is more comprehensive to evaluate the degradation degree of mps based on both xps o c ratio and ftir ci value 3 4 hydrophobic feature the contact angles of pristine and treated mps are presented in figs 6 and s7 the aging process and polymer type both affected the variation of contact angle in both uv and vuv treatments the contact angle reduced with increasing irradiation dose 180 1080 mj cm 2 after the minimum dose uv irradiation 180 mj cm 2 at 254 nm drastic decreases of contact angle 20 30 were observed for ps pvc and pet suggesting that the uv dose applied in water treatment plants can easily change the surface hydrophobicity in general the effect of vuv was more dramatic and rapid as shown in fig 6a the contact angle of ps decreased from 120 0 to 36 2 and 12 2 after 1080 mj cm 2 irradiation at 254 nm in uv and vuv systems respectively similar changes were observed for pvc and pet from 73 3 to 41 2 and 13 2 for pvc from 72 3 to 29 3 and 14 3 for pet combined with the data of ftir and xps these different decrease rates of contact angle could be attributed to the distinct degradation mechanisms of uv and vuv uv photolysis induced chain scission of mps surface while radical induced oxidation played an important role in vuv irradiation leading to the generation of hydroxylated chemical groups such as co coh and cooh these hydroxylated groups were hydrophilic resulting in the transformation of mps surface to hydrophilicity furthermore vuv induced more intense deconstruction on mps surfaces sem result in fig 2 even melting which was also in favor of the wetting also mp types could affect the alteration of contact angle the contact angles of pristine ps pe pet and pvc were 120 0 91 6 72 3 and 73 3 respectively indicating that their surfaces were relatively hydrophobic after 1080 mj cm 2 irradiation at 254 nm in the vuv system the contact angles of ps pvc and pet mps decreased to 12 3 19 6 and 16 1 respectively however pe particles still maintained relatively hydrophobic it could be attributed to the chemical structure of pe which was more inactive than the other three mps to uv and vuv the sem xps and ftir data were consistent with this result the chemical bonds of the other three mps were relatively unstable and heterogeneous which expedited the formation of oxygen containing functional groups on their surfaces resulting in the faster variations of contact angle and hydrophilicity 3 5 adsorption experiments variation of surface hydrophobicity could alter the adsorption behavior of organic contaminants by mps two typical organic pollutants including benzene and cip were selected for the adsorption experiments adsorption isotherms are presented in figs s8 and s9 while fitting adsorption model kinetics are listed in table 1 and table s3 firstly for benzene its adsorption by four mps was confirmed to follow the non linear freundlich model table 1 r 2 0 95 but the langmuir model had an inferior fitting in general the adsorption capacity of benzene decreased following the order ps pet pvc pe it seemed that the mps particle size was not the dominant factor all four mps have a similar mean particle size in the range of 150 300 nm however the ps and pet presented adsorption capacities that were nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of pe thus some other factors such as the chemical structures of benzene and the monomeric compositions of mps may be involved benzene is a nonpolar hydrophobic organic matter which has a strong π π bond its adsorption not only depends on the surface hydrophobicity of mps but also can be affected by the interaction between the π π bond of benzene and mps all four mps had hydrophobic features fig 6 furthermore ps and pet both have benzene functional groups with π π bonds thus these two mps had stronger adsorption of benzene than other pvc and pe it is consistent with a study that had evaluated the adsorption of benzene by several pristine mps huffer and hofmann 2016 these results suggested that adsorption of benzene can be explained by pore surface adsorption mechanism in which benzene can attach onto mps surface with weak interaction guo et al 2012 xing and pignatello 1997 however the adsorption capacity of benzene varied significantly after uv and vuv treatments after low dose uv irradiation 180 mj cm 2 only slight variations were observed for the k f of all mps table 1 on the contrary it dramatically decreased for ps pet and pvc after high dose uv and vuv treatment 1080 mj cm 2 this may be mainly due to the declining hydrophobicity of mp surface fig 6 furthermore the destruction of their surface chemical structure the result of xps fig 3 especially π π bonds also contributed to weaker adsorption of benzene however the adsorption capacity of pe only had a slight decrease only weak deconstruction of pe was observed after uv and vuv treatments figs 2 4 and 5 as well as the slight decline of hydrophobicity fig 6 thus the resistance of pe to uv and vuv irradiation maintained its adsorption capacity of benzene in general for hydrophobic organic pollutants such as benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons their adsorption loads and dissemination risk with these four mps would be reduced after high dose uv and vuv treatments adsorption kinetics data of cip by mps are listed in tables 1 and s3 it matched freundlich model with r 2 0 95 for pristine mps following the order pet ps pe pvc the characteristic chemical structures of cip and mps may both affect the adsorption process ciprofloxacin is a widely used quinolone antibiotic which has high polarity its adsorption may be dominated by the porosity and hydrophobicity of mps ciprofloxacin also contains a benzene group with a π π bond thus it may have interactions with mps that also have a π π bond such as ps and pet furthermore the characteristic chemical structure of cip includes amino and carboxyl groups which may have interactions such as hydrogen bond with amino carboxyl carbonyl and heterocyclic structures on mps ps and pet had higher adsorption kinetic constants than the other two mps table 1 ps had the highest hydrophobicity while ps and pet both had π π bonds and some carboxyl carbonyl groups which may have high interactions with cip furthermore ps and pet both had porous structures on the surface fig 2 on the contrary pvc only had ccl bonds with a dense surface fig 2 resulting in its weak adsorption after a low dose 180 mj cm 2 uv treatment only a slight weakening was observed again the influence was aggravated as the uv dose increased to 1080 mj cm 2 table 1 the characteristic chemical structures of cip and mps can be used to explain the variation tendency firstly the transformation from a hydrophobic surface to a hydrophilic surface weakens the interaction between cip and mps fig 6 secondly decomposition of the surface and chemical structures of these mps were observed which may also be the reasons fig 2 especially the damage of π π bonds in ps and pet also reduced the interactions of cip although the co and co bonds ratios increased for ps pe and pvc fig 4 the opposite variations of cip adsorption suggested that interaction of characteristic chemical structure between cip and mps was the minor mechanism for vuv treatment distinct variations of adsorption capacity were observed table 1 vuv irradiation seemed to have a more significant effect than uv both with low and high doses for the treatment of ps and pe decreasing hydrophobicity and decomposition of the surface structure may be the reasons it should be noted that melting phenomena were observed for ps and pet which may decrease their porous surface structure this also made against the adsorption of cip however the adsorption capacity of pvc raised the generation of nodule like protuberances on the pvc surface fig 2 contributed to the more adsorption of cip liu et al 2019a evaluated the adsorption of cip by pristine and aged pvc and they also found that light aged pvc can adsorb more cip than the pristine one in general after uv treatments the adsorption of cip by four mps declined suggesting a reducing risk of polar organic quinolone antibiotics during the normal disinfection process but it is not true for pvc after vuv treatment which should be noteworthy 4 conclusion uv and vuv both induced decomposition of mps surface which mainly depended on the irradiation dose generally regular dose uv and vuv irradiation in water treatment disinfection can only induce slight effects on mps surface characteristics and adsorption performance of note an overestimation which related to the application of pure polymers and pure water matrixes should be considered in contrast excessive exposure under twenty times doses irradiation resulted in significant alternation on surface morphology chemical feature and hydrophobicity high dose irradiation affected the adsorption capacity of mps mostly weakening suggesting a reducing risk on transportation of both non polar and polar organic contaminants declaration

17546,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considerable microplastics mps contributors to environmental waters knowledge about the mps degradation process under ultraviolet irradiation was crucial to understanding the fate of mps during and after water disinfection in this study surface alternations of polystyrene ps polyethylene pe polyvinylchloride pvc and polyethylene terephthalate pet under 254 nm uv c and 185 254 nm vacuum ultraviolet vuv irradiation were estimated one way treatment of mps by uv or vuv with the recommended dose for wwtps usepa 180 mj cm 2 had little effect in contrast excessive exposure under twenty times doses irradiation 3600 mj cm 2 resulted in significant alternations on surface morphology chemical feature and hydrophobicity noticeably morphology alterations including cracks wrinkles and protuberances were observed for ps pvc and pet while pe was relatively resistant fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that uv irradiation induced cleavage of chemical bonds besides simultaneous radical oxidation was predominant during vuv treatment which contributed to the increasing generation of oxygen bonds such as co and co on all mps surfaces drastic decreases of contact angle 20 were observed for ps pvc and pet even after 180 mj cm 2 uv irradiation indicating the uv disinfection in wwtps can easily change their surface hydrophobicity all these alternations weakened the adsorption capacity of non polar benzene and polar ciprofloxacin on mps generally regular dose uv and vuv irradiation in water treatment disinfection can only induce slight effects on mps surface characteristics and adsorption performance while extreme dose irradiation can induce a potential reducing risk of organic contaminants migration along with mps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics ultraviolet irradiation wastewater treatment plant vacuum ultraviolet adsorption 1 introduction microplastics mps are an emerging contaminant which is ubiquitous in worldwide aquatic environments e g oceans lakes rivers and urban sewage eerkes medrano et al 2015 mps comprise plastic litter or debris smaller than 5 mm with irregular shapes and various polymers including polystyrene ps polyethylene pe polyvinylchloride pvc polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene etc mps have been generally classified into two types primary mps and secondary mps the former indicates artificial plastic particles that are used as additives in industrial products one typical example is microbeads acted as facial scrubbers chang 2015 fendall and sewell 2009 toothpaste or air blasting media gregory 2009 secondary mps are generated from the fragmentation of large plastics debris in the aqueous medium via sunlight irradiation wind blow water stir and other external environmental disturbances singh and sharma 2008 all these synthetic mps are believed to last for a long period maybe thousands of years before complete degradation in the natural environment barnes et al 2009 thus their long term negative impact on aquatic environment and human health is a concern as important parts of the urban aqueous cycle wastewater treatment plants wwtps are exposed to mps contamination primary mps were speculated to be the dominating ones in domestic wastewater napper et al 2015 van wezel et al 2016 while secondary mps have been poorly defined due to their complicated sources and were considered as the minor part in the urban aqueous system the lightweight nature and small size of mps resulted in their distinct removal in traditional water treatment facilities preliminary investigations have confirmed that primary treatment or secondary treatment can remove most of the mps 90 particularly large particles long et al 2019 murphy et al 2016 however some small size mps were still released with the final effluent of wwtps always 1 particle l 1 browne et al 2011 chang 2015 fendall and sewell 2009 considering that the discharge volume of normal wwtps generally reached 108 109 l d 1 it indicated that a large amount of mps still enters the receiving water as a daily fact talvitie et al 2017 therefore wwtps have been suggested to act as important point sources of mps to received water bodies murphy et al 2016 because of their high polymer nature mps are stable under conventional physical treatments e g screening coagulation sedimentation and flotation ou and zeng 2018 on the contrary they may be broken up under some physicochemical processes such as ultraviolet uv irradiation which is widely applied as the disinfection processes of wwtps hijnen et al 2006 it has been reported that plastic can be degraded under uv a 320 400 nm and uv b 280 320 nm irradiation guo and wang 2019 wang et al 2013 for microplastics long term sunlight exposure enriched by uv a and uv b can induce chemical chain scission o2 h2o addition and environmentally persistent free radicals formation zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 as well as morphological variations such as cracks and flakes cai et al 2018 indeed most of the uv a and uv b experiments spent weeks or months due to the low energy and intensity of light sources implying a slow aging process however the common light sources in wwtps are low pressure mercury lamps which emit uv c 254 nm and vacuum ultraviolet vuv 185 nm irradiation uv c irradiation in wwtps has its characteristics that is high intensity and short time which may induce different degradation patterns compared to uv a and uv b uv c irradiation had higher photon energy 254 nm 4 88 ev which may induce more critical damage on the surface chemical bonds of mps considering that mps can adsorb and accumulate various organic contaminants on their surfaces he et al 2020 li et al 2018a yang et al 2020 and this capacity may alter based on the surface feature huffer et al 2018 it is necessary to estimate the morphology and chemical variations of mps during uv disinfection treatments up to now very little attention has been drawn to the potential degradation of mps under uv c vuv disinfection not to mention their effects on the surface characteristic or adsorption capacity here we report detailed data on the morphology and chemical variations of four mps including ps pe pvc and pet under 254 nm uv c and 185 254 nm uv vuv named vuv irradiation the variations of morphology and surface chemical characteristics were estimated while the hydrophobic feature was also investigated polar ciprofloxacin cip and non polar benzene were selected as the targeted contaminants their adsorption equilibrium and kinetics on pristine mps and uv vuv treated mps were compared these results will improve the knowledge about the fate of mps in water treatment processes as well as the potential impact of mps on environments 2 experimental 2 1 chemical materials cip 98 5 hplc grade was purchased from tci benzene 99 was obtained from merck microplastic polymers including ps pe pvc and pet were purchased from goodfellow cambridge limited and their detailed information was listed in table s1 all reagents were stored at c or 20 c as demand while mps were sealed under n2 atmosphere ultrapure water with 18 2 mω was used to prepare solutions reagents used for electron paramagnetic resonance epr including 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine tempo 99 and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 97 were bought from sigma 2 2 characterization a field emission scanning electron microscope sem evo18 zeiss was applied to detect the surface morphology of mps fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy was recorded using an is50 infrared spectrometer thermo with wavenumber of 4000 400 cm 1 and it was used to identify the surface chemical characteristics in addition absorbance ratio between the peaks related to carbonyl and methylene in ftir data was calculated and it was named carbonyl index ci value this ci value reflects the degree of surface oxidation especially the transformation of methylene to co bond the surface elemental compositions were analyzed by a thermo fisher k alpha x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps while the oxygen to carbon o c ratio was calculated based on the integral area ratio of oxygen and carbon peaks text s1 this o c ratio can reflect the variation tendency of oxygen containing bonds mainly including co and co on the mp surfaces detailed calculation methods of ci value and o c ratio were reported in ref liu et al 2019b contact angle was determined using an optical tension meter kino sl200kb with a photo taking interval at 1 0 s the data were obtained at time 5 s after contact furthermore epr was applied to detect the radicals in uv and vuv reactions detailed parameters of epr are described in text s2 2 3 uv and vuv irradiation a quasi parallel irradiation device was assembled fig s1 with some modifications based on the device reported in our previous study chen et al 2019 besides normal uv vuv treatment is a novel promising advanced oxidation process for water treatment to give a prospective viewpoint about the disinfection methods on mps vuv was also considered therefore low pressure mercury uv lamp 254 nm 10 w gph212t5l 4 and vuv lamp 185 nm 254 nm 10 w gph212t5vh 4 were obtained from heraeus and they were both used as light sources for standard gph212t5vh 4 vuv lamp 254 nm and 185 nm irradiation contributes 94 and 6 of the total energy respectively an illuminometer was used to measure the irradiation intensity of 254 nm uv while some modification factors were considered following the same method reported in our previous study ye et al 2019 for uv treatment uv lamp emitting 254 nm was applied for vuv treatment vuv lamp emitting both 254 nm and 185 nm irradiation was used the irradiation dose mentioned in the subsequent sections all indicates that at 254 nm and 185 nm irradiation dose can be calculated based on it finally the irradiation intensity on the top of mps containing reaction suspension was set at 0 1 mw cm 2 before reaction a uv photometer was used to determine the irradiation intensity at different distances from a uv lamp and then the intensity was adjusted by changing the distance between the lamp and reaction suspension surface based on usepa guide the uv dose required for viruses inactivation 4 log is 186 mj cm 2 usepa 2006 thus we used 180 mj cm 2 as the minimum dose for mps treatment in addition to check the effect under extreme irradiation conditions a twenty times dose 3600 mj cm 2 was applied as the maximum dose for uv and vuv treatments before irradiation reaction mps particles were added into ultrapure water for 2 h with stirring to avoid the interference of surface electric charge subsequently 20 ml of ultrapure water was transferred into the customized reaction vessel and then 100 mg mps were added the customized reaction vessel was air tight with a quartz glass cover on top it had water circulating function and the temperature of circulating water was maintained by a water bath device a magnetic stirrer was set below the reaction vessel to maintained the stirring by adding a magnetic follower mps was suspended during reaction irradiation dose can be obtained by the multiplication of irradiation intensity and time at given time the treated mps samples were filtrated from the suspension and transferred into glass tubes and then dried in shade and stored in a dryer and then 20 30 particles were obtained randomly for ftir xps contact angle analyses control groups were conducted using the same mps immersed in ultrapure water without any light uv or vuv treatment 2 4 batch adsorption and quantitative analysis a series of stock solutions with seven concentration gradients 0 1 0 5 1 0 4 0 8 0 12 5 20 0 mg l 1 of cip and benzene were prepared using methanol water solution 1 methanol before adsorption experiments pristine and treated mps were added into 100 ml stock solutions in glass vials with teflon septa on top the vials were kept tight and shaken in orbit at 30 rpm under 298 k for 7 d all adsorption experiments were performed in triplicate for cip at given time points the mixture was filtrated by 0 22 μm filter the filtered solutions were transferred into amber tubes before analysis quantitative determination of cip was performed by a hplc ms2 ab sciex triplequad 5500 detailed analysis processes were reported in our previous studies hu et al 2019 for benzene a two hours placing of the vials without shaking was conducted before analysis in order to reach the equilibrium of benzene in liquid and gaseous phases endo et al 2008 concentration of benzene was determined by a gc ms shimadzu qp2010 plus with a headspace sampling device an hp 5 gc column agilent j w 19091j 433 was applied and the isothermal oven temperatures were in the range of 75 and 150 c calibration standards of benzene was prepared before analysis the benzene concentration in upper gaseous was detected by gc ms system with a headspace sampling 500 μl with solid phase microextraction since the air water partitioning constants of benzene was known log kaw 0 65 huffer and hofmann 2016 its concentration in liquid phase can be calculated based on henry s law external calibration spiked with naphthalene was applied for quantitative analysis spiked control blank experiments without mps were also conducted to determine the loss of cip and benzene during the experimental procedure without adsorption which was considered in data calculation 2 5 data analysis statistics the variations of ci value and o c ratio were evaluated by one way anova spss 19 0 data having p 0 05 were considered significant in adsorption experiments two adsorption models including freundlich and langmuir were used to fit the adsorption isotherms for both cip and benzene table s2 the calculation and adsorption model fitting followed the similar procedures reported in ref huffer and hofmann 2016 li et al 2018b 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction mechanism of uv and vuv epr was used to evaluate the reaction mechanisms in the uv and vuv systems the trapping agent for radical species was dmpo fig 1 presents the epr results in the uv system no radical adduct of dmpo was observed indicating that there was only direct photolysis in the uv system irradiation of 254 nm uv c can induce the rupture of organic bonds on mps surface on the contrary dmpo adduct of hydroxyl radical oh with four characteristic peaks was detected in the vuv system irradiation at 185 nm from the vuv lamp can induce photolysis of h2o into oh eqs 1 and 2 although the irradiation energy of 185 nm only contributes 6 of the total lamp energy the high quantum yield 0 33 can generate substantial oh in water matrix which would attack the mps surface these distinct reaction mechanisms implied that potential differences of surface morphological and chemical variations would occur between uv and vuv treatments 1 h 2 o h v 185 oh h φ oh 0 33 2 h 2 o h v 185 oh h e a q φ oh 0 04 of note natural water matrixes contained high concentrations of background constituents which can quench and absorb uv c and vuv irradiation during disinfection since only ultrapure water was used as water matrix herein an overestimation of the effects of uv c and vuv on mps may be achieved in the current study 3 2 surface morphology of mps to obtain a visual variation of surface morphology the irradiation dose was set at the maximum value 3600 mj cm 2 at 254 nm after uv and vuv aging processes noticeably alterations including cracks wrinkles and protuberances were observed fig 2 generally the morphology variations undergoing vuv treatment were faster and more intense than uv moreover mps treated by vuv presented an evident melting phenomenon which could be attributed to the oh oxidation of their surface chemical structure microplastics with different polymers showed diversity in changing trends as showed in fig 2b original ps presented relatively smooth textures which became rough and generated flakes after uv irradiation fig 2c furthermore a melted surface was observed after maximum dose vuv exposure fig 2d in contrast pe exhibited resistance to uv irradiation and showed a slightly melting phenomenon when exposed to vuv fig 2e h in the case of pvc wrinkles and numerous nodule like protuberances were developed on the surfaces after 3600 mj cm 2 uv exposure fig 2k correspondingly after vuv treatment pvc surfaces were melted obviously and formed bubble like protuberances these bubbles were hollow and fragile which began to break during sem analysis fig 2l pristine pet processed a homogeneous texture on the surface fig 2m and n however an eroded surface with wrinkles was observed after 3600 mj cm 2 uv irradiation fig 2o for vuv the pet surface was melted and generated some small nodule like protuberances simultaneously fig 2p above all uv and vuv irradiation caused diverse morphology changes which could deconstruct and recombine the surface chemical groups of mps furthermore these variations may alter their surface hydrophobicity and adsorption capacity of organic pollutants 3 3 surface chemical feature irradiation dose at 254 nm was set in the range of 180 3600 mj cm 2 to evaluate the surface chemical feature variations firstly xps was measured fig 3 and figs s2 s4 after the maximum dose irradiation 3600 mj cm 2 at 254 nm it seems that the surface structures of mps were more susceptible to vuv than to uv additionally it showed distinct variation trends among different mps for ps the c1s spectra demonstrated an increasing co bond after both uv and vuv irradiation fig 3 of note a weak o1s peak was observed for pristine ps suggesting that its surface contained some oxygen bonds which may be due to atmospheric oxidation during storage two deconvoluted peaks with corresponding bond energies at 532 4 ev and 533 7 ev were obtained from o1s spectrum which represented alkoxy co and carboxyl co respectively after uv and vuv treatments these two peaks developed obviously indicating that the ps surface was gradually oxidized compared with ps pvc presented a similar variation in the peak of co bond while pe exposed a weaker increase figs s2 and s3 it should be noted that the o1s spectrum decreased for pet after uv irradiation and hardly any variation appeared after vuv treatment fig s4 o c atom ratio was applied to evaluate the oxidation degree of mps surface fig 4 in general vuv induced a more rapid increase of o c ratio than uv with distinctive kinetic models during uv irradiation the o c ratios of ps pe and pvc surfaces followed positive linear correlations based on kinetic analysis which may be due to the photodegradation fig 4a c and e the damage mechanism of these mps surfaces by uv irradiation could be erosion resulting in the breaking of chemical bonds irradiation at 254 nm uv irradiation can excite the polymer surface chemical bonds to excited states which can react with other molecules in water such as o2 oh etc it can form oxygen containing bonds such as co and co resulting in the raise of o c ratio it should be noted that the curve of uv treated pet decreased over time and was more consistent with exponential function rather than linear function suggesting a different damage process fig 4g for vuv irradiation the o c ratios of four mps demonstrated high correlations with pseudo first order kinetics fig 4b d f and h indicating that radical oxidation may dominate the vuv aging process hydroxyl radicals generated by 185 nm vuv irradiation damaged mps surfaces via oxidation resulting in a more rapid degradation than uv in the early stage typically 540 mj cm 2 since oh oxidation tends to be saturated the oxidation was slowed down in the later stage as only slight variations of o c ratio were observed after 254 nm dose increased to 1080 mj cm 2 in vuv treatment data with higher irradiation dose was not included the results of o c ratio variation revealed that the degradation pattern was also depended on mps materials ps had the fastest increase of o c ratio and the highest degree of surface oxidation the o c ratio increased from 4 to 62 after 1080 mj cm 2 uv irradiation fig 4a furthermore it leaped to 117 after 1080 mj cm 2 vuv dose at 254 nm treatment fig 4b benzene ring groups in ps were susceptive to 254 nm uv irradiation and it was vulnerable to radical oxidation on the contrary the o c ratios of pe and pvc only increased 20 and 40 after vuv treatment fig 4d and f this may be due to their tight skeleton framing simple chemical component and long straight chain structure uv and vuv irradiation can only induce limited rupture and oxidation on these two mps surface it should be noted that o c ratio of pet decreased under uv irradiation fig 4g mainly on account of the existence of benzene ring alkoxy and carbonyl groups these bonds broke rapidly under uv irradiation resulting in the decline of oxygen content however an exponential increase was still observed for the o c ratio of pet under vuv treatment fig 4h these findings inferred that oxidation on mps surface may be a dominant reaction mechanism during uv and vuv treatments to further verify the changes in chemical characteristics ftir was measured as shown in fig 5 the ftir spectra revealed new absorption peaks that appeared at 1720 cm 1 in ps and pvc which were identified as the characteristic peaks representing stretching vibration of carbonyl groups co these new peaks suggested the generation of carbonyl structures during uv and vuv treatments even under the minimum irradiation dose at 180 mj cm 2 of note no evident new peak was observed for pe even after 3600 mj cm 2 uv irradiation or under vuv treatment fig s5 this result again indicated the inertness of pe to light irradiation furthermore in the spectra of treated pvc the peaks appeared at 3047 cm 1 and 3143 cm 1 were both assigned to ch stretching vibration for pet mps the peaks at 2846 cm 1 and 2912 cm 1 which attributed to ch2 symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration respectively almost disappeared after vuv treatment carbonyl index calculated from ftir spectra was used as another tool to evaluate the degradation degree of mps fig s6 for uv treatment there was no positive relation between ci and irradiation dose with a tendency of initial increase and then decrease statistically for ps pe and pvc this result also suggested that an accumulation of co bond on these mps surface after low dose irradiation even under 180 mj cm 2 however co bonds were degraded when the irradiation dose increased continuously this trend differed to o c value variation tendency which mainly included co co and benzene oxygen bonds of these three mps a conversion from co to co under uv irradiation may be the reason of note a decrease of ci was observed for pet which was consistent with the o c result fig 4g suggesting the decomposition of oxygen contained bonds on the pet surface regarding vuv irradiation the ci increased followed exponential kinetics with high correlation r 2 0 9943 0 9931 and 0 9999 for ps pe and pvc respectively for pet only a slight increase of ci was observed and no kinetics model can be fitted this result was related to the degradation mechanism of vuv treatment including cleavage of uv irradiation and simultaneous radical oxidation it was also consistent with the o c data fig 4h the obtained ftir and xps results indicated the oxidation of most mps by uv and vuv in the current study further ci index and o c ratio analyses provided more quantitative data to investigate these variations generally all four mps were undergone oxidation on the surfaces excepted the pet under uv treatment of note pe seemed to be the most resistant one generation of oxygen containing bonds would change the surface characteristics of mps although both xps and ftir can reflect the aging degree of mps surfaces some differences are still obvious firstly the functional groups those can be determined by ftir are limited on the contrary data of co ch and other bonds can be obtained clearly by xps with high resolution thus xps can reveal more information about the variation of chemical groups secondly the detection depths of these two methods are variable ftir can detect several millimeters deep from the surface while xps can only detect a depth of nanoscale therefore it is more comprehensive to evaluate the degradation degree of mps based on both xps o c ratio and ftir ci value 3 4 hydrophobic feature the contact angles of pristine and treated mps are presented in figs 6 and s7 the aging process and polymer type both affected the variation of contact angle in both uv and vuv treatments the contact angle reduced with increasing irradiation dose 180 1080 mj cm 2 after the minimum dose uv irradiation 180 mj cm 2 at 254 nm drastic decreases of contact angle 20 30 were observed for ps pvc and pet suggesting that the uv dose applied in water treatment plants can easily change the surface hydrophobicity in general the effect of vuv was more dramatic and rapid as shown in fig 6a the contact angle of ps decreased from 120 0 to 36 2 and 12 2 after 1080 mj cm 2 irradiation at 254 nm in uv and vuv systems respectively similar changes were observed for pvc and pet from 73 3 to 41 2 and 13 2 for pvc from 72 3 to 29 3 and 14 3 for pet combined with the data of ftir and xps these different decrease rates of contact angle could be attributed to the distinct degradation mechanisms of uv and vuv uv photolysis induced chain scission of mps surface while radical induced oxidation played an important role in vuv irradiation leading to the generation of hydroxylated chemical groups such as co coh and cooh these hydroxylated groups were hydrophilic resulting in the transformation of mps surface to hydrophilicity furthermore vuv induced more intense deconstruction on mps surfaces sem result in fig 2 even melting which was also in favor of the wetting also mp types could affect the alteration of contact angle the contact angles of pristine ps pe pet and pvc were 120 0 91 6 72 3 and 73 3 respectively indicating that their surfaces were relatively hydrophobic after 1080 mj cm 2 irradiation at 254 nm in the vuv system the contact angles of ps pvc and pet mps decreased to 12 3 19 6 and 16 1 respectively however pe particles still maintained relatively hydrophobic it could be attributed to the chemical structure of pe which was more inactive than the other three mps to uv and vuv the sem xps and ftir data were consistent with this result the chemical bonds of the other three mps were relatively unstable and heterogeneous which expedited the formation of oxygen containing functional groups on their surfaces resulting in the faster variations of contact angle and hydrophilicity 3 5 adsorption experiments variation of surface hydrophobicity could alter the adsorption behavior of organic contaminants by mps two typical organic pollutants including benzene and cip were selected for the adsorption experiments adsorption isotherms are presented in figs s8 and s9 while fitting adsorption model kinetics are listed in table 1 and table s3 firstly for benzene its adsorption by four mps was confirmed to follow the non linear freundlich model table 1 r 2 0 95 but the langmuir model had an inferior fitting in general the adsorption capacity of benzene decreased following the order ps pet pvc pe it seemed that the mps particle size was not the dominant factor all four mps have a similar mean particle size in the range of 150 300 nm however the ps and pet presented adsorption capacities that were nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of pe thus some other factors such as the chemical structures of benzene and the monomeric compositions of mps may be involved benzene is a nonpolar hydrophobic organic matter which has a strong π π bond its adsorption not only depends on the surface hydrophobicity of mps but also can be affected by the interaction between the π π bond of benzene and mps all four mps had hydrophobic features fig 6 furthermore ps and pet both have benzene functional groups with π π bonds thus these two mps had stronger adsorption of benzene than other pvc and pe it is consistent with a study that had evaluated the adsorption of benzene by several pristine mps huffer and hofmann 2016 these results suggested that adsorption of benzene can be explained by pore surface adsorption mechanism in which benzene can attach onto mps surface with weak interaction guo et al 2012 xing and pignatello 1997 however the adsorption capacity of benzene varied significantly after uv and vuv treatments after low dose uv irradiation 180 mj cm 2 only slight variations were observed for the k f of all mps table 1 on the contrary it dramatically decreased for ps pet and pvc after high dose uv and vuv treatment 1080 mj cm 2 this may be mainly due to the declining hydrophobicity of mp surface fig 6 furthermore the destruction of their surface chemical structure the result of xps fig 3 especially π π bonds also contributed to weaker adsorption of benzene however the adsorption capacity of pe only had a slight decrease only weak deconstruction of pe was observed after uv and vuv treatments figs 2 4 and 5 as well as the slight decline of hydrophobicity fig 6 thus the resistance of pe to uv and vuv irradiation maintained its adsorption capacity of benzene in general for hydrophobic organic pollutants such as benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons their adsorption loads and dissemination risk with these four mps would be reduced after high dose uv and vuv treatments adsorption kinetics data of cip by mps are listed in tables 1 and s3 it matched freundlich model with r 2 0 95 for pristine mps following the order pet ps pe pvc the characteristic chemical structures of cip and mps may both affect the adsorption process ciprofloxacin is a widely used quinolone antibiotic which has high polarity its adsorption may be dominated by the porosity and hydrophobicity of mps ciprofloxacin also contains a benzene group with a π π bond thus it may have interactions with mps that also have a π π bond such as ps and pet furthermore the characteristic chemical structure of cip includes amino and carboxyl groups which may have interactions such as hydrogen bond with amino carboxyl carbonyl and heterocyclic structures on mps ps and pet had higher adsorption kinetic constants than the other two mps table 1 ps had the highest hydrophobicity while ps and pet both had π π bonds and some carboxyl carbonyl groups which may have high interactions with cip furthermore ps and pet both had porous structures on the surface fig 2 on the contrary pvc only had ccl bonds with a dense surface fig 2 resulting in its weak adsorption after a low dose 180 mj cm 2 uv treatment only a slight weakening was observed again the influence was aggravated as the uv dose increased to 1080 mj cm 2 table 1 the characteristic chemical structures of cip and mps can be used to explain the variation tendency firstly the transformation from a hydrophobic surface to a hydrophilic surface weakens the interaction between cip and mps fig 6 secondly decomposition of the surface and chemical structures of these mps were observed which may also be the reasons fig 2 especially the damage of π π bonds in ps and pet also reduced the interactions of cip although the co and co bonds ratios increased for ps pe and pvc fig 4 the opposite variations of cip adsorption suggested that interaction of characteristic chemical structure between cip and mps was the minor mechanism for vuv treatment distinct variations of adsorption capacity were observed table 1 vuv irradiation seemed to have a more significant effect than uv both with low and high doses for the treatment of ps and pe decreasing hydrophobicity and decomposition of the surface structure may be the reasons it should be noted that melting phenomena were observed for ps and pet which may decrease their porous surface structure this also made against the adsorption of cip however the adsorption capacity of pvc raised the generation of nodule like protuberances on the pvc surface fig 2 contributed to the more adsorption of cip liu et al 2019a evaluated the adsorption of cip by pristine and aged pvc and they also found that light aged pvc can adsorb more cip than the pristine one in general after uv treatments the adsorption of cip by four mps declined suggesting a reducing risk of polar organic quinolone antibiotics during the normal disinfection process but it is not true for pvc after vuv treatment which should be noteworthy 4 conclusion uv and vuv both induced decomposition of mps surface which mainly depended on the irradiation dose generally regular dose uv and vuv irradiation in water treatment disinfection can only induce slight effects on mps surface characteristics and adsorption performance of note an overestimation which related to the application of pure polymers and pure water matrixes should be considered in contrast excessive exposure under twenty times doses irradiation resulted in significant alternation on surface morphology chemical feature and

17547,in this work the ozonation properties of 2 2 3 4 5 pentachlorodiphenyl sulfide pecdps was systematically studied with special emphasis on the underlying mechanism for the effects of inorganic ions kinetic experiments show that common ions can significantly reduce the oxidative properties of ozone except for so3 2 and cu2 the inhibition effect of anions has been explained through the scavenging effect of free radicals and the generation of other free radicals with weaker oxidation potentials but no research has reported on the effect of free radicals generated by anions on the degradation pathway however so3 2 and cu2 exerted a promoting effect through enhanced formation of oh via the hydrolysis effect and the catalyzed decomposition of o3 respectively according to the intermediate products identified by high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry hplc ms ms analysis direct oxidation of s atom substitution of cl atom with oh group and hydroxylation of the benzene ring were commonly observed the addition of no2 and so3 2 produced new free radicals like no2 so3 and so4 which would attack the parent compound or its primary product thus influencing the degradation efficiency and pathways the radicals initiated reactions and the structures of the corresponding products were further rationalized by density functional theory dft

atom is replaced by sulfur ge et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 pcdpss contain 209 congeners and have a wide range of applications according to literature information pcdpss can be used as pharmaceutical ingredient to prevent and treat eosinophil related diseases naito et al 1995 as lubricant and flame retardant in the industry nakanishi and umemoto 2002 and as an effective acaricide in agriculture yang et al 2011 due to the widespread use pcdpss have been detected in dust from metal recycling plants sinkkonen et al 1994 and in water and sediment from the elbe river schwarzbauer et al 2000 zhang et al zhang et al 2014 reported that the concentration of pcdpss was 0 1 6 9 ng g 1 dry mass and 0 18 2 03 ng l 1 in surface sediments and surface water of the yangtze river respectively in addition previous studies have revealed the carcinogenic and toxicological effects of pcdpss on the human body or other organisms the research of kopponen et al kopponen et al 1994 showed that 3 3 4 4 tcdps can induce cancer in rat liver zhang et al zhang et al 2012 found that pcdpss could affect the superoxide dismutase sod activity and malondialdehyde mda level in mouse liver and the toxicity was dependent on the substitution number and position of chlorine atoms considering the potential toxic effects it is particularly important to adopt some effective treatment methods to remove pcdpss from the environment currently there are few studies on the treatment technologies of pcdpss chen et al chen et al 2018 studied the oxidation of pcdpss by ferrate vi and demonstrated that less toxic oxidation products ops were formed from the parent compound ge et al ge et al 2019 studied the photochemical transformation of 2 2 3 4 5 pcdps on the surface of silica gel sg under simulated solar radiation and found that reactive oxygen species oh 1o2 and o2 played a key role in the removal of this compound however information on the ozone o3 oxidation of pcdpss is still lacking ozonation is a relatively mature technology that has been widely used in wastewater treatment due to its highly effective performance in decolorization rekhate and shrivastava 2020 deodorization azuma 1980 and disinfection von gunten 2003b ozone owns a high oxidation potential 2 07 v at ph 7 and thus is used as a strong oxidant to effectively degrade many organic pollutants jothinathan and hu 2018 malik et al 2020 miao et al 2015 miklos et al 2018 qu et al 2015b song et al 2019 szpyrkowicz et al 2001 wei et al 2019 compared with uv irradiation ozone treatment has a higher rate in removing odorous organic compounds furthermore the by products generated during ozonation were less harmful than in chlorine oxidation process moreover ozonation causes no secondary pollution when permanganate was used for comparison miao et al 2015 therefore ozonation may represent a promising technology to degrade pcdpss boncz et al 2005 muthukumar and selvakumar 2004 perez et al 2019 tanaka and matsumura 2002 as for the co existing anions in natural waters researchers pay more attention to their influences on the oxidation rate or removal efficiency of different organic pollutants by ozone barndok et al 2012 hu et al 2020 tanaka and matsumura 2002 it is generally believed that inorganic anions can inhibit the oxidation efficiency of ozone miao et al 2015 saylor and kupferle 2019 wert et al 2009 but the actual effect modes of different concentrations of ions has not been completely clarified the inhibitory effect of inorganic anions is attributed to the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals with the generation of other less effective free radicals barndok et al 2012 it is assumed that these secondary free radicals could also react with organic compounds to produce some new intermediate products unfortunately there is currently no research illustrating the ozonation pathways of organic compounds in the presence of inorganic anions by contrast some studies have revealed the effect of bromide on the formation of disinfection by products dbp from organic pollutants xiang et al 2019 xiao et al 2014 in real water solid particulate matter is one of the essential components and an important sink of pollutant adsorption alebicjuretic et al 1990 silica gel as an open porous material with a large specific surface area high adsorption capacity and good chemical and thermal stability song et al 2010 younis et al 2020 can be used as a simulated solid carrier of pollutants to investigate their environmental behaviors bello et al 2019 da silva et al 2003 mao and thomas 1995 sotero and arce 2004 qu et al 2018 thus in this study sg was used as a support carrier and 2 2 3 4 5 pcdps pecdps was used as the representative organic pollutant for the systematical investigation of the reaction performance of ozone and organic matter adsorbed on the surface of particulate matter first kinetics experiments were conducted to explore the role of oxidizing species o3 oh and the effects of various factors including the solution ph sample dosage and common inorganic ions then the reaction intermediates and products of pecdps were determined by hplc ms analysis from which the degradation pathways were proposed moreover the dft calculations such as the activation energy of transition state ts the enthalpy and gibbs free energy of the reactions between free radicals and organic molecules were conducted to interpret the reaction mechanisms to our knowledge this is the first attempt to systematically evaluate the degradation of pcdpss in the ozone system this study can better reveal the oxidation process in the actual water and brings a new dimension to the ongoing research effort in the field of ozonation and the results will contribute toward better understanding of the effects of common anions in wastewater on oxidation of organic compounds on solid particulate and arouse researchers concern on the generation of dbp caused by common anions in ozone system 2

finally 1 ml of the extract was dried by anhydrous na2so4 and the concentration of pecdps was measured by gas chromatography gc moreover the degradation data was fitted by the pseudo first order kinetics model 1 ln c t c 0 kt where ct is the concentration of pecdps at a given time t c0 is the initial concentration and k is the observed rate constant 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 gc analysis

during calculation the solvent effect of water was considered using the polarizable continuum model pcm 3 results and discussions 3 1 kinetics 3 1 1 determination of the main reactive species the process of ozone oxidation generally involves direct oxidation and indirect oxidation masten and hoigne 1992 alvares et al 2001 chen et al 2008 hu et al 2016 direct oxidation mainly occurs under acidic conditions where ozone molecules directly attack the organic compound through the electrophilic reaction the reaction rate of the direct oxidation is slow and the selectivity of ozone is strong indirect oxidation refers to the hydroxyl radicals oh initiated reaction which mainly occurs under alkaline conditions oh is formed from the chain decomposition reaction of ozone by oh and has a strong ability to oxidize organic pollutants guittonneau et al 1992 kwan and voelker 2003 van craeynest et al 2003 malvestiti et al 2019 in order to determine the contribution of the direct oxidation of o3 and the indirect oxidation of oh to the degradation of pecdps tert butanol tba was chosen as a radical quencher to perform the experiment tba is generally considered as a strong oh inhibitor and the corresponding reaction rate constant was 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 much higher than that with ozone 3 0 10 3 m 1 s 1 huang et al 2011 it can be seen from fig 1 a that after the addition of different amounts of tba the degradation efficiency of pecdps in 30 min is reduced by 19 5 53 3 indicating that direct o3 oxidation plays a leading role in the ozonation process meanwhile indirect oh oxidation also participate in this process but with a smaller contribution the results were consistent with the study of ye et al 2020 and liu et al 2012 and the reaction rate constants k were shown in fig 1 b 3 1 2 effect of ph on pecdps degradation by ozone in the ozone oxidation system the ph value is an important parameter affecting the decomposition of organic compounds in this work pecdps degradation by ozone was investigated at five initial ph values 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 and 11 0 to examine the effect of solution ph it can be seen from fig 2 that the degradation rate of pecdps is obviously increased with the ph value increasing from 3 0 to 11 0 the reaction rate constant of pecdps at ph 11 0 was calculated as 0 186 min 1 nearly 2 35 times higher than that at ph 3 0 0 079 min 1 obviously the ozonation rate of pcdps is faster under alkaline conditions the results in fig s1 show that the reaction rate constant has a positive correlation with solution ph generally ozone can easily react with the hydroxyl ion to generate oh in the water staehelin and hoigne 1982 hu et al 2020 von gunten 2003a at alkaline conditions the abundant hydroxyl ions could catalyze the decomposition of ozone to form oh qu et al 2015a since oh with a high oxidation potential 2 80 v is more reactive towards organic pollutants than ozone 2 07 v miao et al 2015b staehelin and hoigne 1982 szpyrkowicz et al 2001 the degradation of pecdps was accelerated in alkaline solution 3 1 3 effect of sample dosage on pecdps degradation by ozone the initial concentration of pecdps is one of the factors influencing ozonation degradation of pecdps the effect of sample dosage on the degradation of pecdps was investigated by introducing various amounts of plsgs 0 05 0 10 and 0 20 g into the reaction solution the results showed that the removal efficiency of pecdps decreased markedly with the increasing dosage of plsgs fig 3 in addition the degradation data of pecdps 0 15 min at different dosage of plsgs can be well fitted by the pseudo first order model as seen the reaction rate constant of pecdps decreased from 0 126 min 1 to 0 063 min 1 as the sample dosage increased from 0 05 g to 0 20 g in short the reaction rate constant is negatively affected by the change of the dosage of plsgs when the sample dosage is increased the concentrations of the original contaminant and the generated degradation intermediates increase accordingly this means that the amount of ozone obtained per unit volume concentration of pollutants will be reduced gomes et al 2017 in addition some intermediate products can capture hydroxyl radicals therefore resulting in a decreased k value however in terms of absolute reaction rate it was found that with the dosage of pecdps increasing from 0 05 g to 0 2 g the degradation of pecdps by ozone increased from 0 0204 μg min 1 to 0 0709 μg min 1 in 60 min due to the increased concentration the pecdps molecules would have a higher probability of collision with dissolved o3 molecules per unit time thus resulting in a larger amount of degraded pecdps 3 1 4 effect of typical ions on ozone degradation of pecdps many inorganic ions are present in natural waters and wastewaters which can affect the degradation of target pollutants by ozone in this experiment since sodium nitrate has almost no effect on the ozone oxidation of the substrate fig s2 various sodium salts cl no2 so4 2 and so3 2 and nitrates fe3 mg2 ca2 and cu2 were used to study the effects of anions and cations respectively fig 4 shows the residual pecdps in the solutions containing two different concentrations of ions 0 5 mm and 5 mm as seen ozone oxidation is affected by various experimental conditions in the reaction system the role of inorganic ions is mainly divided into two aspects on the one hand ions promote the decomposition of ozone to oh thereby accelerating the degradation of the substrate via the enhanced indirect oxidation on the other hand the ions scavenge the oh in the system thereby slowing the degradation of the substrate via competition for free radicals these two opposite effects act together on the reaction system in a state of dynamic equilibrium the dominance of which is determined by many factors including ion concentration ozone dosage solution ph ion properties reaction temperature and substrate concentration zhao et al 2019 2 oh cl cl oh k 3 4 3 109 m 1s 1 3 o3 cl clo o2 4 o3 no2 no3 o2 k 1 8 105 m 1s 1 5 o3 no2 o3 no2 6 oh no2 oh no2 k 6 0 109 m 1s 1 7 o3 so3 2 so4 2 o2 8 oh so3 2 oh so3 9 so3 o2 so5 10 so5 so3 2 so4 2 so4 11 so5 o3 so4

53 65 respectively in the 0 5 mm cl no2 and so4 2 groups when the concentration of these three anions was further increased to 5 mm pecdps was degraded by 29 19 45 62 and 43 73 in the corresponding experimental groups therefore no2 so4 2 and especially cl has a significant inhibitory effect on pecdps degradation due to the scavenging of oh by these anions perez et al 2019 saylor and kupferle 2019 yang et al 2017 consistent with this work saylor et al also found that cl can inhibit the ozonation of atrazine saylor and kupferle 2019 it can be seen from eqs 2 3 that cl can react with oh to form the less reactive cl 2 40 v xu et al 2016 or directly consume ozone ghanbari et al 2020 which greatly decreased the degradation rate of the substrate a previous study yang et al 2017 has shown that no2 concentration in the range of 0 20 μm can promote o3 degradation of atrazine however in this study no2 at concentrations of 0 5 or 5 mm inhibited the ozone degradation of pecdps which is similar to the findings of wert et al wert et al 2009 excess no2 leads to the consumption of o3 and oh eqs 4 6 hoigne et al 1985 neta et al 1988 wang and zhuan 2020 yang et al 2017 and the reaction is thus suppressed in addition to our results the inhibitory effect of so4 2 was also observed for the ozone oxidative degradation of phenazone miao et al 2015b and microcystin rr didi et al 2015 this is possibly because so4 2 can scavenge oh to form unreactive sulfato complexes didi et al 2015 by contrast so3 2 showed an obvious promotion effect on the reaction and the removal of pecdps in the experimental groups with 0 5 mm and 5 mm so3 2 reached 69 74 and 74 41 respectively similar to no2 the so3 2 also has a quenching effect on the oxidants o3 and oh eqs 7 8 shi et al 2019 according to literature information the redox potentials neta et al 1988 shih et al 2013 of oh no2 and so3 are 2 80 v 1 03 v and 0 63 v respectively since oh has a high oxidation potential it can not only oxidize the substrate but also oxidize the anions no2 and so3 2 to produce radicals no2 and so3 with lower oxidation potential the reaction with anions will consume hydroxyl radicals thereby decreasing the reaction rate in the ozone system however so3 can be further transformed into highly reactive so4 2 60 v through eqs 9 12 neta et al 1988 shi et al 2019 which may alleviate the adverse effects of so3 2 moreover the ph related indirect effect resulting from the hydrolysis of so3 2 eqs 13 14 shi et al 2019 may dominate during the reaction process as shown in fig s3 the ph of after reaction solution containing so3 2 increased by 1 0 1 4 unit compared with that without so3 2 the hydrolysis of so3 2 makes the o3 reaction solution alkaline which would promote the degradation of the substrate 15 oh cu2 cu oh 2 k 3 5 3 8 108 m 1s 1 16 o3 cu2 h2o cu oh 2 o2 oh 17 oh o3 ho2 o2 k 1 108 2 109 m 1s 1 18 ho2 cu oh 2 o2 cu2 h2o fig 4b shows that only cu2 promoted the ozone degradation of pecdps while the other cations inhibited the reaction compared with the removal of 60 51 in the blank group 35 24 56 16 58 66 and 74 49 of pecdps were degraded in the experimental group with the addition of 0 5 mm fe3 mg2 ca2 and cu2 respectively by contrast the corresponding degradation efficiency changed to 29 19 45 62 55 73 and 69 82 in the 5 mm experimental group according to the study of sui et al sui et al 2010 the presence of mg2 can significantly improve the degradation and mineralization efficiency of nitrobenzene by ozonation zhao et al zhao et al 2019 further concluded that mg2 and ca2 at concentrations of 10 0 10 3 mm has a promoting effect on the ozone degradation of nitrobenzene and the effect becomes not significant at 10 20 0 10 3 mm by contrast they show inhibitory effect at a higher concentration under the current experimental conditions the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 0 5 and 5 mm are much larger than 20 0 10 3 mm thus exerting an inhibitory effect for pecdps degradation the observed phenomenon that fe3 show obvious inhibition may be because fe3 is easily hydrolyzed in water to produce h making the solution acidic fig s3 this is unfavorable for the formation of oh therefore inhibiting the degradation of pecdps moreover the fe oh 3 colloid produced by fe3 hydrolysis may prevent the transfer of ozone and reduce the contact of oxidizing species with the substrate to reduce the reaction rate as shown in eqs 15 18 khuntia et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 cu2 can act as a scavenger to quench oh or as a catalyst to catalyze the decomposition of o3 to produce oh under the conditions of this experiment the catalytic effect of cu2 may dominate over the quenching effect which would thus promote the oxidative degradation of o3 similar result was obtained in the study of khuntia khuntia et al 2016 3 2 identification of ozonation intermediates and products in order to examine the effect of anions on degradation pathways we analyzed the degradation products in reaction solutions containing anions no2 or so3 2 by hplc ms ms a total of 12 intermediate products were identified by the careful analysis of the high resolution time of flight mass spectrum the chemical structure of the degradation product is assigned according to 1 mass charge ratio m z of the molecular ion peak obtained by high resolution mass spectrometry 2 chlorine isotope distribution 3 fragment ions in the product ion spectra compared with the 0 min sample new peaks were observed in the total ion current tic chromatograms of pecdps samples at different reaction times fig s4 suggesting the formation of oxidation products two stage mass spectrometry analysis was adopted to detect the reaction products taking product p12 as an example the parent ion was observed at m z 258 87 and the extracted ion current xic chromatographic peak is shown in fig 5 a the intensity ratio of the isotope peaks at m z 258 8790 260 8761 and 262 8731 was 100 95 9 30 6 fig 5b suggesting that this compound contains three chlorine atoms the product ion spectrum shown in fig 5c was further analyzed to propose the structure the fragment ion at m z 194 9178 158 9410 and 122 9656 was assigned to the sequential loss of so2 hcl and hcl group from the parent ion m z 258 8799 a small fragment peak was also observed at m z 178 9230 corresponding to the detachment of an o atom from the fragment m z 194 9178 thus the product p12 is speculated to be 2 4 5 trichlorobenzenesulfonic acid other products are identified by a similar method and their mass information and product ion spectra are listed in table s1 and fig s5 respectively the evolution profiles of these intermediate products were established by recording the peak area from the extracted ion current eic chromatograms fig 6 shows the changes in the chromatographic peak area of the 12 intermediate products as a function of reaction time as seen the products p1 p3 and p5 reached the maximum in 30 min and then degraded quickly indicating that they are primary products the time required for achieving the maximum concentration of products p2 p4 and p6 was longer than p1 p3 and p5 so it is speculated that these three products are secondary products the products p10 p11 and p12 were observed in the whole reaction process and the change of the chromatographic peak area was relatively slow thus they are considered as late stage products the peaks of products p7 p8 and p9 appeared at 30 60 min suggesting that they are also intermediate products 3 3 elucidation of the ozonation pathways based on the identified products detailed above the major reaction pathways during ozonation of pecdps in the presence of anions no2 or so3 2 are proposed in fig 7 the first part part i summarizes the three degradation pathways of pecdps during common ozonation process first the s atom in pecdps was directly oxidized by ozone to form a sulfoxide type product p1 which can then undergo a similar oxidation mechanism to form a sulfone type product n1 however n1 was not detected in this work possibly because it was quickly attacked by hydroxyl radicals to form the hydroxylation product p2 n2 in the second pathway the substitution of cl atom by a hydroxyl group resulted in the formation of p3 which was transformed into the corresponding sulfoxide p4 and sulfone n2 via sequential oxidation in addition the hydroxylation of benzene ring can also occur under the attack of hydroxyl radicals leading to the formation of the hydroxylated compound p5 then p5 can be continuously oxidized by ozone to form the sulfoxide p6 and sulfone product n3 the second part part ii of reaction pathways occurs in the presence of anions no2 and so3 2 in the ozone system no2 and so3 2 can react with the oxidants to produce no2 so3 and so4 through a series of reactions as shown in eqs 5 6 8 12 muthukumar and selvakumar 2004 neta et al 1988 perez et al 2019 shi et al 2019 among the three additional radicals no2 can attack the ch bond of the primary product p5 to generate the corresponding nitroso type product p7 which was then continuously oxidized by ozone to generate the sulfone product n4 for so3 and so4 they will attack the ccl bond of pecdps to generate p8 and p9 respectively which were further oxidized into the sulfone products n5 and n6 finally the cs bridge bond of all the sulfone type products was broken by attack of hydroxyl radicals to give the corresponding mono ring products p10 p11 and p12 3 4 theoretical calculations to rationalize the radicals initiated reactions and confirm the structures of the corresponding product p3 p5 p7 p8 and p9 gibbs free energies and enthalpies of the related reactions were obtained by conducting dft calculations xiao et al 2020b fig 8 a c shows the gibbs free energies of the reactions for oh so3 and so4 attacking at different carbon positions of the ccl bond in pecdps the reaction of oh and pecdps commonly exists in the ozonation system regardless of the addition of anions as seen the reaction barriers δ rg for oh group replacing cl atom at different positions of pecdps c2 c4 c5 c11 and c12 are in the range of 22 15 29 55 kj mol the position corresponding to the lowest gibbs free energy barrier is c 12 and the hydroxyl substitution product p3 was thus assigned with the structure shown in fig 7 the δh and δg of this reaction is calculated to be 141 39 kj mol and 132 19 kj mol respectively table s2 suggesting that this reaction is an exothermic spontaneous reaction thus this process is favored both in kinetics and thermodynamics the substitution reaction of so3 with pecdps easily occurs at the c 11 site which has the lowest δ rg value of 11 64 kj mol as a result product p8 was detected by hplc ms analysis as for the reaction between so4 and pecdps calculation results show that the substitution of cl atom by so4h group tends to occur at c 11 site of pecdps to form p9 compared with other carbon sites the δ rg of reaction at c 11 site is the lowest 40 11 kj mol the corresponding δh and δg is 125 45 kj mol and 112 64 kj mol table s4 implying that the reaction could occur spontaneously thermodynamics with release of heat we can see from these discussions that among the three radicals oh so3 and so4 so3 requires the lowest activation energy for the replacement of cl which further explains that so3 can promote the degradation of pecdps fig 8 d shows that the reaction barrier for oh attacking different c sites of ch bond ranges from 8 45 to 21 04 kj mol based on the lowest δ rg value the hydroxylation of the benzene ring is most likely to occur at the c 10 site thus the hydroxylated pecdps p5 was generated as the corresponding product this reaction is exothermic and thermodynamically spontaneous as indicated by the δh of 41 89 kj mol and δg of 32 78 kj mol table s5 the observation of nitroso type product p7 was attributed to the reaction of no2 and the primary hydroxylation product p5 and thus this reaction was also interpreted by theoretical calculations as shown in fig 8 e the reaction barrier is in the range of 79 36 94 53 kj mol with the lowest activation energy occurring at the c 9 site of p5 thus p7 was proposed to have the structure shown in fig 7 among these five radical reactions the lowest energy barrier for the reaction p5 no2 p7 and pecdps so4 p9 is not optimistic which may explain the reason why the contents of the products p7 and p9 are low as shown in fig 6 4 conclusions in this work the ozone oxidation characteristics of 2 2 3 4 5 pentachlorodiphenyl sulfide pecdps were studied with the consideration of the influencing factors results showed that the degradation of pecdps can be well fitted with the pesudo first order kinetics model and the reaction was accelerated with increasing solution ph common ions can inhibit the oxidation performance of ozone but so3 2 and cu2 exerted a promoting effect through enhanced oh formation via the hydrolysis effect and the catalyzed decomposition of o3 respectively according to the products identified by hplc ms ms and dft calculations direct oxidation of the sulfur atom substitution of chlorine atom with oh group and hydroxylation of the benzene ring were mainly involved in the ozonation process of pecdps in the presence of no2 and so3 2 free radicals no2 so3 and so4 were generated from a series of reactions which would attack the parent compound or its primary product to form the corresponding radical substitution products thus changing the degradation efficiency and pathways

17547,in this work the ozonation properties of 2 2 3 4 5 pentachlorodiphenyl sulfide pecdps was systematically studied with special emphasis on the underlying mechanism for the effects of inorganic ions kinetic experiments show that common ions can significantly reduce the oxidative properties of ozone except for so3 2 and cu2 the inhibition effect of anions has been explained through the scavenging effect of free radicals and the generation of other free radicals with weaker oxidation potentials but no research has reported on the effect of free radicals generated by anions on the degradation pathway however so3 2 and cu2 exerted a promoting effect through enhanced formation of oh via the hydrolysis effect and the catalyzed decomposition of o3 respectively according to the intermediate products identified by high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry hplc ms ms analysis direct oxidation of s atom substitution of cl atom with oh group and hydroxylation of the benzene ring were commonly observed the addition of no2 and so3 2 produced new free radicals like no2 so3 and so4 which would attack the parent compound or its primary product thus influencing the degradation efficiency and pathways the radicals initiated reactions and the structures of the corresponding products were further rationalized by density functional theory dft

atom is replaced by sulfur ge et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 pcdpss contain 209 congeners and have a wide range of applications according to literature information pcdpss can be used as pharmaceutical ingredient to prevent and treat eosinophil related diseases naito et al 1995 as lubricant and flame retardant in the industry nakanishi and umemoto 2002 and as an effective acaricide in agriculture yang et al 2011 due to the widespread use pcdpss have been detected in dust from metal recycling plants sinkkonen et al 1994 and in water and sediment from the elbe river schwarzbauer et al 2000 zhang et al zhang et al 2014 reported that the concentration of pcdpss was 0 1 6 9 ng g 1 dry mass and 0 18 2 03 ng l 1 in surface sediments and surface water of the yangtze river respectively in addition previous studies have revealed the carcinogenic and toxicological effects of pcdpss on the human body or other organisms the research of kopponen et al kopponen et al 1994 showed that 3 3 4 4 tcdps can induce cancer in rat liver zhang et al zhang et al 2012 found that pcdpss could affect the superoxide dismutase sod activity and malondialdehyde mda level in mouse liver and the toxicity was dependent on the substitution number and position of chlorine atoms considering the potential toxic effects it is particularly important to adopt some effective treatment methods to remove pcdpss from the environment currently there are few studies on the treatment technologies of pcdpss chen et al chen et al 2018 studied the oxidation of pcdpss by ferrate vi and demonstrated that less toxic oxidation products ops were formed from the parent compound ge et al ge et al 2019 studied the photochemical transformation of 2 2 3 4 5 pcdps on the surface of silica gel sg under simulated solar radiation and found that reactive oxygen species oh 1o2 and o2 played a key role in the removal of this compound however information on the ozone o3 oxidation of pcdpss is still lacking ozonation is a relatively mature technology that has been widely used in wastewater treatment due to its highly effective performance in decolorization rekhate and shrivastava 2020 deodorization azuma 1980 and disinfection von gunten 2003b ozone owns a high oxidation potential 2 07 v at ph 7 and thus is used as a strong oxidant to effectively degrade many organic pollutants jothinathan and hu 2018 malik et al 2020 miao et al 2015 miklos et al 2018 qu et al 2015b song et al 2019 szpyrkowicz et al 2001 wei et al 2019 compared with uv irradiation ozone treatment has a higher rate in removing odorous organic compounds furthermore the by products generated during ozonation were less harmful than in chlorine oxidation process moreover ozonation causes no secondary pollution when permanganate was used for comparison miao et al 2015 therefore ozonation may represent a promising technology to degrade pcdpss boncz et al 2005 muthukumar and selvakumar 2004 perez et al 2019 tanaka and matsumura 2002 as for the co existing anions in natural waters researchers pay more attention to their influences on the oxidation rate or removal efficiency of different organic pollutants by ozone barndok et al 2012 hu et al 2020 tanaka and matsumura 2002 it is generally believed that inorganic anions can inhibit the oxidation efficiency of ozone miao et al 2015 saylor and kupferle 2019 wert et al 2009 but the actual effect modes of different concentrations of ions has not been completely clarified the inhibitory effect of inorganic anions is attributed to the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals with the generation of other less effective free radicals barndok et al 2012 it is assumed that these secondary free radicals could also react with organic compounds to produce some new intermediate products unfortunately there is currently no research illustrating the ozonation pathways of organic compounds in the presence of inorganic anions by contrast some studies have revealed the effect of bromide on the formation of disinfection by products dbp from organic pollutants xiang et al 2019 xiao et al 2014 in real water solid particulate matter is one of the essential components and an important sink of pollutant adsorption alebicjuretic et al 1990 silica gel as an open porous material with a large specific surface area high adsorption capacity and good chemical and thermal stability song et al 2010 younis et al 2020 can be used as a simulated solid carrier of pollutants to investigate their environmental behaviors bello et al 2019 da silva et al 2003 mao and thomas 1995 sotero and arce 2004 qu et al 2018 thus in this study sg was used as a support carrier and 2 2 3 4 5 pcdps pecdps was used as the representative organic pollutant for the systematical investigation of the reaction performance of ozone and organic matter adsorbed on the surface of particulate matter first kinetics experiments were conducted to explore the role of oxidizing species o3 oh and the effects of various factors including the solution ph sample dosage and common inorganic ions then the reaction intermediates and products of pecdps were determined by hplc ms analysis from which the degradation pathways were proposed moreover the dft calculations such as the activation energy of transition state ts the enthalpy and gibbs free energy of the reactions between free radicals and organic molecules were conducted to interpret the reaction mechanisms to our knowledge this is the first attempt to systematically evaluate the degradation of pcdpss in the ozone system this study can better reveal the oxidation process in the actual water and brings a new dimension to the ongoing research effort in the field of ozonation and the results will contribute toward better understanding of the effects of common anions in wastewater on oxidation of organic compounds on solid particulate and arouse researchers concern on the generation of dbp caused by common anions in ozone system 2

finally 1 ml of the extract was dried by anhydrous na2so4 and the concentration of pecdps was measured by gas chromatography gc moreover the degradation data was fitted by the pseudo first order kinetics model 1 ln c t c 0 kt where ct is the concentration of pecdps at a given time t c0 is the initial concentration and k is the observed rate constant 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 gc analysis

during calculation the solvent effect of water was considered using the polarizable continuum model pcm 3 results and discussions 3 1 kinetics 3 1 1 determination of the main reactive species the process of ozone oxidation generally involves direct oxidation and indirect oxidation masten and hoigne 1992 alvares et al 2001 chen et al 2008 hu et al 2016 direct oxidation mainly occurs under acidic conditions where ozone molecules directly attack the organic compound through the electrophilic reaction the reaction rate of the direct oxidation is slow and the selectivity of ozone is strong indirect oxidation refers to the hydroxyl radicals oh initiated reaction which mainly occurs under alkaline conditions oh is formed from the chain decomposition reaction of ozone by oh and has a strong ability to oxidize organic pollutants guittonneau et al 1992 kwan and voelker 2003 van craeynest et al 2003 malvestiti et al 2019 in order to determine the contribution of the direct oxidation of o3 and the indirect oxidation of oh to the degradation of pecdps tert butanol tba was chosen as a radical quencher to perform the experiment tba is generally considered as a strong oh inhibitor and the corresponding reaction rate constant was 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 much higher than that with ozone 3 0 10 3 m 1 s 1 huang et al 2011 it can be seen from fig 1 a that after the addition of different amounts of tba the degradation efficiency of pecdps in 30 min is reduced by 19 5 53 3 indicating that direct o3 oxidation plays a leading role in the ozonation process meanwhile indirect oh oxidation also participate in this process but with a smaller contribution the results were consistent with the study of ye et al 2020 and liu et al 2012 and the reaction rate constants k were shown in fig 1 b 3 1 2 effect of ph on pecdps degradation by ozone in the ozone oxidation system the ph value is an important parameter affecting the decomposition of organic compounds in this work pecdps degradation by ozone was investigated at five initial ph values 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 and 11 0 to examine the effect of solution ph it can be seen from fig 2 that the degradation rate of pecdps is obviously increased with the ph value increasing from 3 0 to 11 0 the reaction rate constant of pecdps at ph 11 0 was calculated as 0 186 min 1 nearly 2 35 times higher than that at ph 3 0 0 079 min 1 obviously the ozonation rate of pcdps is faster under alkaline conditions the results in fig s1 show that the reaction rate constant has a positive correlation with solution ph generally ozone can easily react with the hydroxyl ion to generate oh in the water staehelin and hoigne 1982 hu et al 2020 von gunten 2003a at alkaline conditions the abundant hydroxyl ions could catalyze the decomposition of ozone to form oh qu et al 2015a since oh with a high oxidation potential 2 80 v is more reactive towards organic pollutants than ozone 2 07 v miao et al 2015b staehelin and hoigne 1982 szpyrkowicz et al 2001 the degradation of pecdps was accelerated in alkaline solution 3 1 3 effect of sample dosage on pecdps degradation by ozone the initial concentration of pecdps is one of the factors influencing ozonation degradation of pecdps the effect of sample dosage on the degradation of pecdps was investigated by introducing various amounts of plsgs 0 05 0 10 and 0 20 g into the reaction solution the results showed that the removal efficiency of pecdps decreased markedly with the increasing dosage of plsgs fig 3 in addition the degradation data of pecdps 0 15 min at different dosage of plsgs can be well fitted by the pseudo first order model as seen the reaction rate constant of pecdps decreased from 0 126 min 1 to 0 063 min 1 as the sample dosage increased from 0 05 g to 0 20 g in short the reaction rate constant is negatively affected by the change of the dosage of plsgs when the sample dosage is increased the concentrations of the original contaminant and the generated degradation intermediates increase accordingly this means that the amount of ozone obtained per unit volume concentration of pollutants will be reduced gomes et al 2017 in addition some intermediate products can capture hydroxyl radicals therefore resulting in a decreased k value however in terms of absolute reaction rate it was found that with the dosage of pecdps increasing from 0 05 g to 0 2 g the degradation of pecdps by ozone increased from 0 0204 μg min 1 to 0 0709 μg min 1 in 60 min due to the increased concentration the pecdps molecules would have a higher probability of collision with dissolved o3 molecules per unit time thus resulting in a larger amount of degraded pecdps 3 1 4 effect of typical ions on ozone degradation of pecdps many inorganic ions are present in natural waters and wastewaters which can affect the degradation of target pollutants by ozone in this experiment since sodium nitrate has almost no effect on the ozone oxidation of the substrate fig s2 various sodium salts cl no2 so4 2 and so3 2 and nitrates fe3 mg2 ca2 and cu2 were used to study the effects of anions and cations respectively fig 4 shows the residual pecdps in the solutions containing two different concentrations of ions 0 5 mm and 5 mm as seen ozone oxidation is affected by various experimental conditions in the reaction system the role of inorganic ions is mainly divided into two aspects on the one hand ions promote the decomposition of ozone to oh thereby accelerating the degradation of the substrate via the enhanced indirect oxidation on the other hand the ions scavenge the oh in the system thereby slowing the degradation of the substrate via competition for free radicals these two opposite effects act together on the reaction system in a state of dynamic equilibrium the dominance of which is determined by many factors including ion concentration ozone dosage solution ph ion properties reaction temperature and substrate concentration zhao et al 2019 2 oh cl cl oh k 3

53 65 respectively in the 0 5 mm cl no2 and so4 2 groups when the concentration of these three anions was further increased to 5 mm pecdps was degraded by 29 19 45 62 and 43 73 in the corresponding experimental groups therefore no2 so4 2 and especially cl has a significant inhibitory effect on pecdps degradation due to the scavenging of oh by these anions perez et al 2019 saylor and kupferle 2019 yang et al 2017 consistent with this work saylor et al also found that cl can inhibit the ozonation of atrazine saylor and kupferle 2019 it can be seen from eqs 2 3 that cl can react with oh to form the less reactive cl 2 40 v xu et al 2016 or directly consume ozone ghanbari et al 2020 which greatly decreased the degradation rate of the substrate a previous study yang et al 2017 has shown that no2 concentration in the range of 0 20 μm can promote o3 degradation of atrazine however in this study no2 at concentrations of 0 5 or 5 mm inhibited the ozone degradation of pecdps which is similar to the findings of wert et al wert et al 2009 excess no2 leads to the consumption of o3 and oh eqs 4 6 hoigne et al 1985 neta et al 1988 wang and zhuan 2020 yang et al 2017 and the reaction is thus suppressed in addition to our results the inhibitory effect of so4 2 was also observed for the ozone oxidative degradation of phenazone miao et al 2015b and microcystin rr didi et al 2015 this is possibly because so4 2 can scavenge oh to form unreactive sulfato complexes didi et al 2015 by contrast so3 2 showed an obvious promotion effect on the reaction and the removal of pecdps in the experimental groups with 0 5 mm and 5 mm so3 2 reached 69 74 and 74 41 respectively similar to no2 the so3 2 also has a quenching effect on the oxidants o3 and oh eqs 7 8 shi et al 2019 according to literature information the redox potentials neta et al 1988 shih et al 2013 of oh no2 and so3 are 2 80 v 1 03 v and 0 63 v respectively since oh has a high oxidation potential it can not only oxidize the substrate but also oxidize the anions no2 and so3 2 to produce radicals no2 and so3 with lower oxidation potential the reaction with anions will consume hydroxyl radicals thereby decreasing the reaction rate in the ozone system however so3 can be further transformed into highly reactive so4 2 60 v through eqs 9 12 neta et al 1988 shi et al 2019 which may alleviate the adverse effects of so3 2 moreover the ph related indirect effect resulting from the hydrolysis of so3 2 eqs 13 14 shi et al 2019 may dominate during the reaction process as shown in fig s3 the ph of after reaction solution containing so3 2 increased by 1 0 1 4 unit compared with that without so3 2 the hydrolysis of so3 2 makes the o3 reaction solution alkaline which would promote the degradation of the substrate 15 oh cu2 cu oh 2 k 3 5 3 8 108 m 1s 1 16 o3 cu2 h2o cu oh 2 o2 oh 17 oh o3 ho2 o2 k 1 108 2 109 m 1s 1 18 ho2 cu oh 2 o2 cu2 h2o fig 4b shows that only cu2 promoted the ozone degradation of pecdps while the other cations inhibited the reaction compared with the removal of 60 51 in the blank group 35 24 56 16 58 66 and 74 49 of pecdps were degraded in the experimental group with the addition of 0 5 mm fe3 mg2 ca2 and cu2 respectively by contrast the corresponding degradation efficiency changed to 29 19 45 62 55 73 and 69 82 in the 5 mm experimental group according to the study of sui et al sui et al 2010 the presence of mg2 can significantly improve the degradation and mineralization efficiency of nitrobenzene by ozonation zhao et al zhao et al 2019 further concluded that mg2 and ca2 at concentrations of 10 0 10 3 mm has a promoting effect on the ozone degradation of nitrobenzene and the effect becomes not significant at 10 20 0 10 3 mm by contrast they show inhibitory effect at a higher concentration under the current experimental conditions the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 0 5 and 5 mm are much larger than 20 0 10 3 mm thus exerting an inhibitory effect for pecdps degradation the observed phenomenon that fe3 show obvious inhibition may be because fe3 is easily hydrolyzed in water to produce h making the solution acidic fig s3 this is unfavorable for the formation of oh therefore inhibiting the degradation of pecdps moreover the fe oh 3 colloid produced by fe3 hydrolysis may prevent the transfer of ozone and reduce the contact of oxidizing species with the substrate to reduce the reaction rate as shown in eqs 15 18 khuntia et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 cu2 can act as a scavenger to quench oh or as a catalyst to catalyze the decomposition of o3 to produce oh under the conditions of this experiment the catalytic effect of cu2 may dominate over the quenching effect which would thus promote the oxidative degradation of o3 similar result was obtained in the study of khuntia khuntia et al 2016 3 2 identification of ozonation intermediates and products in order to examine the effect of anions on degradation pathways we analyzed the degradation products in reaction solutions containing anions no2 or so3 2 by hplc ms ms a total of 12 intermediate products were identified by the careful analysis of the high resolution time of flight mass spectrum the chemical structure of the degradation product is assigned according to 1 mass charge ratio m z of the molecular ion peak obtained by high resolution mass spectrometry 2 chlorine isotope distribution 3 fragment ions in the product ion spectra compared with the 0 min sample new peaks were observed in the total ion current tic chromatograms of pecdps samples at different reaction times fig s4 suggesting the formation of oxidation products two stage mass spectrometry analysis was adopted to detect the reaction products taking product p12 as an example the parent ion was observed at m z 258 87 and the extracted ion current xic chromatographic peak is shown in fig 5 a the intensity ratio of the isotope peaks at m z 258 8790 260 8761 and 262 8731 was 100 95 9 30 6 fig 5b suggesting that this compound contains three chlorine atoms the product ion spectrum shown in fig 5c was further analyzed to propose the structure the fragment ion at m z 194 9178 158 9410 and 122 9656 was assigned to the sequential loss of so2 hcl and hcl group from the parent ion m z 258 8799 a small fragment peak was also observed at m z 178 9230 corresponding to the detachment of an o atom from the fragment m z 194 9178 thus the product p12 is speculated to be 2 4 5 trichlorobenzenesulfonic acid other products are identified by a similar method and their mass information and product ion spectra are listed in table s1 and fig s5 respectively the evolution profiles of these intermediate products were established by recording the peak area from the extracted ion current eic chromatograms fig 6 shows the changes in the chromatographic peak area of the 12 intermediate products as a function of reaction time as seen the products p1 p3 and p5 reached the maximum in 30 min and then degraded quickly indicating that they are primary products the time required for achieving the maximum concentration of products p2 p4 and p6 was longer than p1 p3 and p5 so it is speculated that these three products are secondary products the products p10 p11 and p12 were observed in the whole reaction process and the change of the chromatographic peak area was relatively slow thus they are considered as late stage products the peaks of products p7 p8 and p9 appeared at 30 60 min suggesting that they are also intermediate products 3 3 elucidation of the ozonation pathways based on the identified products detailed above the major reaction pathways during ozonation of pecdps in the presence of anions no2 or so3 2 are proposed in fig 7 the first part part i summarizes the three degradation pathways of pecdps during common ozonation process first the s atom in pecdps was directly oxidized by ozone to form a sulfoxide type product p1 which can then undergo a similar oxidation mechanism to form a sulfone type product n1 however n1 was not detected in this work possibly because it was quickly attacked by hydroxyl radicals to form the hydroxylation product p2 n2 in the second pathway the substitution of cl atom by a hydroxyl group resulted in the formation of p3 which was transformed into the corresponding sulfoxide p4 and sulfone n2 via sequential oxidation in addition the hydroxylation of benzene ring can also occur under the attack of hydroxyl radicals leading to the formation of the hydroxylated compound p5 then p5 can be continuously oxidized by ozone to form the sulfoxide p6 and sulfone product n3 the second part part ii of reaction pathways occurs in the presence of anions no2 and so3 2 in the ozone system no2 and so3 2 can react with the oxidants to produce no2 so3 and so4 through a series of reactions as shown in eqs 5 6 8 12 muthukumar and selvakumar 2004 neta et al 1988 perez et al 2019 shi et al 2019 among the three additional radicals no2 can attack the ch bond of the primary product p5 to generate the corresponding nitroso type product p7 which was then continuously oxidized by ozone to generate the sulfone product n4 for so3 and so4 they will attack the ccl bond of pecdps to generate p8 and p9 respectively which were further oxidized into the sulfone products n5 and n6 finally the cs bridge bond of all the sulfone type products was broken by attack of hydroxyl radicals to give the corresponding mono ring products p10 p11 and p12 3 4 theoretical calculations to rationalize the radicals initiated reactions and confirm the structures of the corresponding product p3 p5 p7 p8 and p9 gibbs free energies and enthalpies of the related reactions were obtained by conducting dft calculations xiao et al 2020b fig 8 a c shows the gibbs free energies of the reactions for oh so3 and so4 attacking at different carbon positions of the ccl bond in pecdps the reaction of oh and pecdps commonly exists in the ozonation system regardless of the addition of anions as seen the reaction barriers δ rg for oh group replacing cl atom at different positions of pecdps c2 c4 c5 c11 and c12 are in the range of 22 15 29 55 kj mol the position corresponding to the lowest gibbs free energy barrier is c 12 and the hydroxyl substitution product p3 was thus assigned with the structure shown in fig 7 the δh and δg of this reaction is calculated to be 141 39 kj mol and 132 19 kj mol respectively table s2 suggesting that this reaction is an exothermic spontaneous reaction thus this process is favored both in kinetics and thermodynamics the substitution reaction of so3 with pecdps easily occurs at the c 11 site which has the lowest δ rg value of 11 64 kj mol as a result product p8 was detected by hplc ms analysis as for the reaction between so4 and pecdps calculation results show that the substitution of cl atom by so4h group tends to occur at c 11 site of pecdps to form p9 compared with other carbon sites the δ rg of reaction at c 11 site is the lowest 40 11 kj mol the corresponding δh and δg is 125 45 kj mol and 112 64 kj mol table s4 implying that the reaction could occur spontaneously thermodynamics with release of heat we can see from these discussions that among the three radicals oh so3 and so4 so3 requires the lowest activation energy for the replacement of cl which further explains that so3 can promote the degradation of pecdps fig 8 d shows that the reaction barrier for oh attacking different c sites of ch bond ranges from 8 45 to 21 04 kj mol based on the lowest δ rg value the hydroxylation of the benzene ring is most likely to occur at the c 10 site thus the hydroxylated pecdps p5 was generated as the corresponding product this reaction is exothermic and thermodynamically spontaneous as indicated by the δh of 41 89 kj mol and δg of 32 78 kj mol table s5 the observation of nitroso type product p7 was attributed to the reaction of no2 and the primary hydroxylation product p5 and thus this reaction was also interpreted by theoretical calculations as shown in fig 8 e the reaction barrier is in the range of 79 36 94 53 kj mol with the lowest activation energy occurring at the c 9 site of p5 thus p7 was proposed to have the structure shown in fig 7 among these five radical reactions the lowest energy barrier for the reaction p5 no2 p7 and pecdps so4 p9 is not optimistic which may explain the reason why the contents of the products p7 and p9 are low as shown in fig 6 4 conclusions in this work the ozone oxidation characteristics of 2 2 3 4 5 pentachlorodiphenyl sulfide pecdps were studied with the consideration of the influencing factors results showed that the degradation of pecdps can be well fitted with the pesudo first order kinetics model and the reaction was accelerated with increasing solution ph common ions can inhibit the oxidation performance of ozone but so3 2 and cu2 exerted a promoting effect through enhanced oh formation via the hydrolysis effect and the catalyzed decomposition of o3 respectively according to the products identified by hplc ms ms and dft calculations direct oxidation of the sulfur atom substitution of chlorine atom with oh group and hydroxylation of the benzene ring were mainly involved in the ozonation process of pecdps in the presence of no2 and so3 2 free radicals no2 so3 and so4 were generated from a series of reactions which would attack the parent compound or its primary product to form the corresponding radical substitution products thus changing the degradation efficiency and pathways

17548,magnetite is known to exhibit high catalytic reactivity in fenton like reactions merely at low ph conditions here we report the association of cu2 ion can significantly enhance peroxydisulfate pds activation with magnetite under environmental aquatic conditions near neutral ph cu2 is able to synergistically activate pds with magnetite to generate radicals e g so4 at neutral or slightly alkaline ph and such synergistic activation of pds is promising to degrade various contaminants in groundwater in depth study reveals cu2 ion adsorbed on magnetite plays a crucial role in pds activation the adsorbed cu2 is labile to be reduced by the structural fe ii on magnetite to generate cu which is relatively stable in the presence of magnetite at neutral or alkaline ph but extremely unstable at acidic ph the generated cu on magnetite surface rather than cu2 contributes to pds activation in the reaction system and the recycling of cu cu2 sustains continuous activation of pds this study is among the first to report the synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 ion at neutral ph and unambiguously discern the role of cu in pds activation the new mechanistic knowledge provides a more accurate understanding of pds activation by natural minerals in environmental remediation keywords peroxydisulfate activation magnetite copper ion sulfate radical advanced oxidation cu cu2 1 introduction persulfates ps including peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms have recently become popular oxidants to degrade various organic contaminants in environmental remediation and water treatment kim et al 2018 liu et al 2016 compared to pms pds is more cost effective 0 74 kg for pds vs 2 2 kg for pms and relatively stable thus having greater practical potential in field applications zhang et al 2014 pds e0 1 96 v can be activated to generate sulfate radical so4 e0 2 5 3 1 v which can degrade a wider range of refractory organic contaminants than pds fang et al 2013c qian et al 2018 various strategies have been used to activate pds to generate so4 such as heating chen et al 2016 uv irradiation zhou et al 2018 transition metal ions anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 and certain organic substrates ahmad et al 2013 among them base and heat activations are most commonly used in field applications however they are not cost effective owing to the requirement of high base dosing or energy input zhang et al 2013 although uv irradiation is effective to activate pds use of uv light is impractical in situ chemical oxidation isco liu et al 2014 transition metal activated pds intensively consumes chemicals due to the scavenging of so4 by metal ions zhang et al 2015 while activation of pds with organic chemicals depends on the structure of substrates e g quinones and phenols ahmad et al 2013 fang et al 2013c compared to the strategies listed above activation with naturally occurring minerals is a more appealing alternative when pds is applied to remediate contaminated soils and groundwater ahmad et al 2010 indeed the decomposition rate of pds is noticeably enhanced in the presence of aquifer solids johnson et al 2008 sra et al 2010 when thirteen trace minerals were tested to evaluate their capacity in pds activation four minerals i e cobaltite ilmenite pyrite and siderite were found to significantly enhance pds activation teel et al

simulated groundwater conditions ph 8 0 liu et al 2014 magnetite fe3o4 is an important iron mineral and ubiquitously present in clays soils and aquifers fang et al 2013b the excellent structural stability and ease of magnetic separation render magnetite particularly feasible for heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of organic pollutants sabri et al 2012 sun and lemley 2011 for example magnetite is able to efficiently activate pds to generate radicals and thus effective for degradation of various organic contaminants e g oil hydrocarbons usman et al 2012 polychlorinated biphenyls fang et al 2013a ibuprofen sabri et al 2012 tetracyclines hou et al 2012 and sulfamonomethoxine yan et al 2011 however the above reactions significantly depend on the solution ph with high efficacy only occurring at strongly acidic condition yan et al 2011 hence magnetite seems to be impractical in environmental remediation which is commonly at neutral ph condition enhancement of magnetite reactivity at mild ph is essential for broadening its environmental application iron minerals always coexist with various metal ions in the natural environment magnetite associated with some metal ions was found to show high reactivity towards contaminant degradation gregory et al 2004 however it remains unclear whether magnetite exhibits higher reactivity towards pds activation after association with various metal ions in fact the metal substituted magnetite with the formula of mfe2o4 m co cu zn mn showed considerable catalytic activity in so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops liang et al 2012 ren et al 2015 for example cufe2o4 was effective for pms activation to destruct various organic contaminants such as di n butyl phthalate ren et al 2015 tetrabromobisphenol a ding et al 2013 iopromide zhang et al 2013 and atrazine guan et al 2013 but was ineffective for pds activation guan et al 2013 in contrast cuo fe3o4 composite fabricated using a hydrothermal method was an efficient activator for pds to generate cu iii and so4 lei et al 2015 we are thus motivated to investigate whether simple mixture of magnetite and metal ions without complicated and time consuming synthesis procedures could effectively activate pds various metal ions were tested for their impact on magnetite activated pds we discovered that magnetite associated with cu2 ion was effective for pds activation at mild ph conditions as will be shown in detail later the activation mechanism of pds by magnetite associated with cu2 ion was quite different from the conventional mechanism for cu ii substituted magnetite activated pds the new findings of this study have important implications for understanding pds activation by iron minerals in isco and broadening environmental application of magnetite 2 materials and

deoxygenated diw with 0 01 m hcl and 1 0 m nacl a high concentration of cl in the acidic cu solution retarded the oxidation rate of cu and thus enhanced its stability yuan et al 2012 2 2 real water

experiments were conducted in 100 ml clear glass serum bottles with teflon lined caps and aluminum foil cover to prevent light typically magnetite and cu2 were added into 100 ml solution containing 0 1 mm of anisole or other contaminants the solution ph was controlled at 7 0 with 10 mm of phosphate buffer then the above mixtures were mixed with magnetic stirring for 30 min to achieve adsorption desorption equilibrium afterwards contaminant degradation was initiated with the addition of pds the serum bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers during the reaction and the solution was purged by n2 gas for 30 min before the addition of pds and for one min after every sampling this condition was termed oxygen limited at predetermined time intervals 5 ml aliquots of reaction solution were collected and immediately separated from magnetite by a powerful magnet the clear supernatant was quenched with 1 0 m na2s2o3 then filtered through 0 22 μm membrane gvwp01300 millipore and finally stored in amber vials at 5 c before analysis to evaluate the activation of pds by magnetite alone only magnetite was added into the reactor containing pds and contaminants and the following operation was identical to that in the above reaction for the experiments investigating ph impact the solution ph was maintained at the designated values by 10 mm of phosphate buffer adjusted with hcl and naoh all the experiments were conducted in duplicate or more 2 5 analytical methods anisole and nitrobenzene were analyzed by an agilent 1100 high performance liquid chromatography hplc equipped with a diode array detector injection sample of 20 µl was separated on a zorbax rx c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm at the flow rate of 1 0 ml min isocratic elution was performed with 60 methanol and 40 water the detection wavelength was 270 and 220 nm for nitrobenzene and anisole respectively concentrations of cu2 and leaching of iron ions were determined using an agilent inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms agilent 7500 formation of cu was detected according to the bathocuproine method used in previous work chen et al 2015 briefly bathocuproine a strong ligand for cu complexation was added to react with cu to generate the orange colored cu bathocuporine complex this complex has a maximum absorption peak at 484 nm and was monitored on a beckman du520 uv vis spectrophotometer ethylenediamine 20 mm was added to mask the interference from cu2 to determine cu on magnetite the solution was first adjusted to ph 3 0 with hcl since adsorption of cu on magnetite was negligible at this ph the desorbed cu was further determined with the above bathocuproine method the electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra were determined using an emx 8 2 7 spectrometer bruker germany with the details presented in text s2 pds was determined by a spectrophotometric method proposed by liang et al 2008 briefly the aliquots of the filtered sample were added into the solution containing ki and nahco3 generating yellow color owing to the reaction between ki and pds such color could be measured on a beckman du520 spectrophotometer at λmax 352 nm to quantify the concentration of pds 3 results and discussion 3 1 activation of pds by magnetite anisole and nitrobenzene were tested to evaluate pds activation with magnetite at different phs they are commonly used as probes to distinguish the contributions of so4 and ho to contaminant degradation kho anisole 5 4 109 m 1 s 1 kso4 anisole 4 9 109 m 1s 1 kho nitrobenzene 3 9 109m 1 s 1 kso4 nitrobenzene 106m 1 s 1 furman et al 2011 as fig 1 shows the remarkable degradation of probes was observed at acidic phs 3 5 with the degradation of anisole faster than that of nitrobenzene at neutral ph 7 or alkaline phs 9 11 conditions however their degradation was significantly reduced and only slight degradation was observed after 48 h these results indicated that magnetite was effective for pds activation merely at acidic phs but not at neutral and alkaline conditions on the other hand both so4 and ho were suggested to be generated from pds activation by magnetite with so4 as the primary reactive radical at acidic phs indeed magnetite was frequently reported to exhibit high catalytic reactivity in fenton like reaction at low ph conditions in fact the surface structural fe ii in iron oxides was regarded as a potential activator for pds maithreepala and doong 2003 pds s2o8 2 could approach closely to the positively charged magnetite surface phpzc 5 4 at ph 3 0 more easily than to the negatively charged magnetite at neutral or alkaline phs thus pds activation with structural fe ii only occurred at acidic phs on the other hand considerable fe ions were dissolved from structural fe of magnetite at acidic phs while the dissolved fe ions were negligible at ph 7 0 and higher fig s2 the ph dependent leaching of fe ions resembled the trend of pds activation with magnetite at various phs it was thus implied that the leached fe ions were also important activators for pds hence both the structural and leached fe contributed to the rapid activation of pds by magnetite at acidic phs the above results suggested magnetite to be an ineffective activator for pds in environmental remediation where neutral ph is most common because activation of pds with magnetite was effective merely at low phs it is noted that various metal ions always naturally coexist with magnetite and magnetite exhibit higher reactivity after association with some metal ions gregory et al 2004 we thus evaluated whether metal ions could enhance pds activation by magnetite at environmental conditions various metal ions including cu2 ni2 co2 fe3 fe2 mg2 ca2 zn2 and mn2 were tested for their impact on magnetite activated pds results showed that except for cu2 the investigated metal ions had negligible impact on pds activation with magnetite at neutral ph fig 2 and fig s3 we were thus motivated to conduct an in depth study to elucidate the role of cu2 in the enhancement of pds activation with magnetite 3 2 synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 as shown in fig 2 while magnetite or cu2 alone exhibited negligible effect on pds activation at neutral ph the coupling of magnetite with cu2 was effective to activate pds specifically degradation of anisole was negligible after 22 h with pds activated by magnetite or cu2 alone however the degradation efficiency of anisole notably increased to 80 when pds was activated by the combination of magnetite and cu2 fig 2 in analogy significant decomposition of pds was only observed when both magnetite and cu2 were present but did not occur in the presence of magnetite or cu2 alone fig s4 these results indicated that cu2 and magnetite could synergistically activate pds at neutral ph on the other hand anisole underwent significantly faster degradation than nitrobenzene in pds magnetite cu2 system fig 2 suggesting so4 as the dominant radicals in the reaction system apparently the significant activation of pds was not induced by magnetite or aqueous cu2 but was likely attributed to the adsorbed cu2 on magnetite we further investigated the xps spectra of magnetite before and after addition of cu2 the fraction of fe ii on the surface of magnetite in pds magnetite solution was close to that of the pristine magnetite but was slightly decreased after addition of cu ii text s3 fig s5 it was thus implied that fe ii was likely to react with the adsorbed cu2 on magnetite which will be further discussed in the later section the impact of cu2 concentration was evaluated to understand the synergistic activation of pds the degradation of anisole gradually increased with cu2 concentration increased from 0 01 to 0 1 mm but slightly decreased when cu2 concentration further increased to 0 25 mm and above fig s6 this result indicated that 0 1 mm of cu2 was the most efficient for the synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 while further increase of cu2 concentration reduced the synergistic effect after addition of cu2 all cu2 was rapidly adsorbed on the surface of magnetite even at cu2 concentration of 0 5 mm fig s7 the generated radicals might be quenched by the adsorbed cu species when high concentration of cu2 was present thus reducing the contaminant degradation pds activation is always influenced by solution ph tsitonaki et al 2010 we thus explored the effect of ph on the synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 as shown in fig 3 the degradation of anisole was ph dependent and neutral ph was most favorable for its degradation the apparent degradation efficiency of anisole was calculated to be 78 2 59 90 55 and 58 at ph 3 5 7 9 and 11 respectively note that magnetite alone was effective to activate pds to degrade anisole at acidic phs fig 1 the contribution of pds activated by magnetite should be substracted from the overall degradation of anisole compared to the degradation of anisole in magnetite pds system addition of cu2 had negligible effect on the anisole degradation at ph 3 fig 3 at ph 7 0 however the degradation efficiency of anisole was remarkably increased by 72 after addition of cu2 when the solution ph was further increased to ph 9 and 11 the addition of cu2 could increase the degradation efficiency of anisole by 37 5 and 47 4 respectively hence the synergistic effect of cu2 and magnetite on pds activation was significant at neutral and alkaline conditions rather than at acidic phs this result was consistent with the previous report that higher ph was favorable for the activation of pds by cuo fe3o4 composite which was explained by low cu ii leaching from the catalyst and formation of surface hydroxyl groups potential active sites for electron transfer lei et al 2015 we thus investigated the adsorption of cu2 on magnetite at various phs as fig s8 shows the aqueous cu2 was completely adsorbed on magnetite at ph 7 0 and higher due to the electrostatic attraction between cu2 ions and the negatively charged magnetite ph pzc 5 4 at acidic conditions however the adsorption of cu2 was significantly reduced and could be neglected at ph 3 0 owing to its strong electrostatic repulsion with the positively charged magnetite it was thus suggested that ph dependency of synergistic activation of pds was likely originated from the adsorbed cu2 on magnetite at alkaline phs the precipitate of cu2 with phosphate ions or oh might reduce the availability of cu2 ions on the magnetite for pds activation 3 3 impact of groundwater matrices we then explored whether the above synergistic activation of pds was also applicable in real waters and tested the impact of groundwater matrix on anisole degradation by pds magnetite cu2 as shown in fig 4 significant degradation of anisole was observed in the groundwater with the reaction rate even slightly faster than that in diw the slight acceleration of anisole degradation might be attributed to pds activation by groundwater matrices indeed slight degradation of anisole could be still observed when pds was present in groundwater fig s9 the constituents in groundwater e g metal ions and or organic matter table s1 likely acted as potential activators for pds hence the groundwater matrix was compatible with the synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 we further evaluated the degradation of some common contaminants in groundwater e g tce cbz and dcf by pds magnetite cu2 tce has been frequently detected in groundwater and thus listed as a priority contaminant by the usepa yan et al 2016 control experiment showed slight degradation of tce when pds was activated by magnetite in groundwater fig s10 after addition of cu2 significant degradation of tce was observed fig 4 suggesting the effectiveness of the synergistic activation of pds by magnetite cu2 to remediate tce contaminated groundwater dcf and cbz are considered as emerging contaminants which have attracted increasing attention in recent years tran and gin 2017 they are persistent in the environment and thus detected in groundwater at high frequency sui et al 2015 as fig 4 shows both dcf and cbz were susceptible to significant degradation by pds activated by magnetite cu2 in groundwater therefore synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 was effective for degradation of various contaminants in groundwater indicating the effectiveness of pds magnetite cu2 in groundwater remediation 3 4 scavenging experiments and epr analyses epr analyses were conducted to investigate the radical generation in the pds magnetite cu2 solution as shown in fig s11 epr signals corresponding to dmpo oh and dmpo so4 were not observed in the spectrum of pds magnetite solution after addition of cu2 both dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts were clearly observed in the epr spectrum of pds magnetite cu2 solution this evidence indicated that so4 and ho were generated when pds was synergistically activated by magnetite and cu2 alcohols such as tba and etoh are frequently selected as radical quenchers to differentiate the contribution of radical species for contaminant degradation tba reacts with so4 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 much more slowly than with ho 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 while etoh reacts very rapidly with both so4 1 2 2 8 109 m 1s 1 and ho 1 6 7 7 107 m 1s 1 liang and su 2009 as shown in fig s12 the addition of alcohols inhibited the degradation of anisole and the inhibitory effect increased with the increasing alcohol dosages from 1 to 100 mm when the alcohol concentration was increased to 100 mm the degradation efficiency of anisole was inhibited by 58 and 24 in the presence of etoh and tba respectively this result further confirmed so4 as the primary radical in the synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 at neutral ph 3 5 interaction of cu2 with magnetite cuo was previously reported to be effective for pds activation zhang et al 2014 we thus investigated whether cuo was formed after addition of cu2 to magnetite at neutral ph xrd pattern was almost identical for magnetite before and after addition of cu2 fig s13 indicating that cuo was not generated after addition of cu2 to magnetite moreover addition of excess edta could completely inhibit the degradation of anisole in pds magnetite cu2 system fig s14 this result implied the adsorbed cu2 ion rather than cuo was responsible for the activation of pds the interaction between the adsorbed cu2 and magnetite was essential for the synergistic activation of pds compared to aqueous fe2 the adsorbed or lattice fe ii on the surface of iron oxide exhibited considerable reductive reactivity towards various contaminants fang et al 2013b such as carbon tetrachloride danielsen and hayes 2004 nitrobenzene gorski and scherer 2009 and hexavalent uranium scott et al 2005 because the inner sphere bonds between fe ii and the hydroxyl groups increased the electron density around fe ii center on the surface amonette et al 2000 the structural fe ii on magnetite was able to reduce the adsorbed cu2 to cu on the surface which was thermodynamically unfavorable in aqueous solution white and peterson 1996 moreover the reduction of cu2 to cu was found to play a significant role in the synergistic effect of cu2 on the reductive dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride by fe2 adsorbed on goethite maithreepala and doong 2003 we thus hypothesized that the synergistic effect of cu2 on pds activation by magnetite might be attributed to the redox reaction between cu2 and structural fe ii on magnetite to verify this hypothesis we determined the generation of cu in the reaction system determination of cu aqueous cu is quite unstable in the presence of oxygen and can be quickly oxidized to cu2 with a half life of less than one min in freshwater however the complexation of cu with organic ligands or chloride can significantly reduce its oxidation rate hence high concentration of cl was always added into cu solution to enhance its stability when cu stock solution was prepared to determine whether cu was generated at ph 7 0 100 mm of nacl was also added to the magnetite cu2 system the result showed that cu was indeed generated in magnetite cu2 nacl system because a strong absorbance at 484 nm was observed characteristic of cu bathocuporine complex fig 5 a the peak at 484 nm for cu complex disappeared without addition of high concentration of nacl thus the presence of cl was crucial for determining cu at neutral ph after addition of cu2 to the magnetite nacl system the generated cu slightly decreased as the reaction proceeded fig s15 we thus further investigated the stability of cu in the presence of magnetite under oxygen limited condition stability of cu because 1 0 m of cl was introduced to stabilize cu when the stock cu solution was prepared 100 mm of cl was already present in the cu magnetite solution and thus the additional spiking of cl was not needed at first we evaluated the impact of oxygen on the stability of cu in the presence of magnetite generally cu is unstable and rapidly disappeared after 3 min when the cu solution was exposed to ambient oxygen fig s16 indeed cu can be quickly oxidized to cu2 with a half life of less than 1 min in freshwater chen et al 2015 compared to cu in aqueous solution loss of cu was significantly reduced in the presence of magnetite and complete disappearance of cu was observed after 15 min fig s16 hence the presence of magnetite could significantly reduce the oxidation rate of cu by dissolved oxygen when the reactor was closed to the ambient air the oxidation rate of cu was significantly reduced and 70 of cu remained in the solution after 30 min the oxidation of cu was further slowed down if nitrogen gas was continually purged to the reactor during reaction with only 14 cu disappeared after 30 min afterwards we evaluated ph impact on the stability of cu in the presence of magnetite the results showed that cu was relatively stable in the magnetite solution at neutral or alkaline phs but was extremely unstable at acidic phs fig s17 at acidic condition cu was primarily present in aqueous solution owing to its electrostatic repulsion with the positively charged magnetite aqueous cu was extremely unstable at acidic ph without stabilization by magnetite on the other hand significant leaching of fe ions from magnetite occurred at acidic phs fig s2 the leached fe3 ions could oxidize cu to generate cu2 and thus induce the instability of cu indeed cu was stable in the leaching solution at ph 7 and 9 but was rapidly disappeared at ph 3 and gradually disappeared at ph 5 fig s18 hence the instability of cu at acidic phs might be also attributed to the reaction of cu with the leached fe ions from magnetite overall the interaction between magnetite and cu2 was essential for the synergistic activation of pds the structural fe ii of magnetite was able to reduce the adsorbed cu2 to generate cu and the stability of cu was significantly enhanced after adsorption on magnetite 3 6 proposed mechanism the activation process of pds with cu is complicated and depends on the existing state and property of cu generally aqueous cu2 ion was ineffective to activate pds while structural cu ii e g cuo exhibited a much higher reactivity towards pds activation liang et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 activation of pds with aqueous cu2 involved the electron transferred from cu2 to pds eq 1 with a high energy barrier to overcome in contrast the high reactivity of structural cu ii on the catalyst surface rendered pds activation more effective and proceeded via two alternative processes i e non radical process and free radical process lei et al 2015 in the non radical process the outer sphere interaction between cu ii and pds induced some slight rearrangement of pds electrons rendering it more reactive towards contaminants zhang et al 2014 the radical process involves the electron transferred from cu ii to pds with high efficiency eq 1 owing to the lower reduction potential of cu ii cu iii on the catalyst surface lei et al 2015 1 cu ii pds cu iii so4 2 cu ii pms cu i so5 3 cu i pms pds cu ii so4 cu ii activated pms another common ps oxidant is able to undergo via the cu i cu ii process that is one electron was transferred from pms to cu ii generating so5 and cu i eq 2 and cu i further activated pms to generate so4 eq 3 however pds activation with cu ii seems to unlikely proceed through cu i cu ii process owing to the limited reduction ability of pds in fact cu i is effective to activate pds for radical generation eq 3 which has been well documented before kolthoff and woods 1966 woods et al 1965 zhang et al 2018 indeed after addition of increasing pds concentration into cu solution the orange color of cu bathocuporine complex gradually decreased fig s19 with the peak at 484 nm characteristic of cu gradually decreased and finally disappeared fig s20 it is thus suggested the reaction between pds and cu in the solution if cu2 could be reduced to cu in cu2 pds system efficient activation of pds might still happen indeed the presence of reducing agent e g hydroxylamine significantly enhanced the pds activation with cu2 with cu generated from cu2 reduction rather than cu2 contributed to the efficient activation of pds zhou et al 2016 similarly in our reaction system the structural fe ii on magnetite was able to reduce the adsorbed cu2 to cu which was verified in the above section hence efficient activation of pds by magnetite cu2 was originated from the generated cu in the magnetite cu2 system cu2 was completely adsorbed on the surface of magnetite at neutral condition and then reduced to cu after addition of pds the generated cu was rapidly oxidized to cu2 fig 5b we further desorbed cu2 bound on the surface of magnetite by adjusting the solution to ph 3 with hcl since the adsorption of cu2 on magnetite could be neglected at strong acidic ph fig s8 the high desorption efficiency of cu2 from magnetite at ph 3 was verified in the control experiment fig s21 the concentration of the desorbed cu2 on magnetite after reaction was close to the initial cu2 concentration fig 5b this evidence suggested cu2 act as a catalytic role in the overall reaction the synergistic effect of cu2 on pds activation by magnetite was finally proposed in fig 6 cu2 was adsorbed on the surface of magnetite owing to the electrostatic attraction subsequently the adsorbed cu2 was reduced by structural fe ii in close proximity to generate cu which was an excellent activator for pds to generate cu2 and radicals such as so4 afterwards the radicals were effective to destruct contaminants on the surface of magnetite while the generated cu2 further participated in the reaction hence the synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 were resulted from the initial reduction of cu2 to cu by structural fe ii and the subsequent cu activated pds cu2 plays a catalyst role in the activation of pds and the recycling of cu cu2 sustained the continuous activation of pds this synergistic activation of pds is most effective at neutral condition which could significantly alleviate the structural destruction of magnetite and thus maintain its significant and long lasting reactivity moreover the metal ions i e cu2 and fe2 were almost completely adsorbed on the surface of magnetite at neutral condition avoiding the leaching problem which was always encountered in the cu ii substituted magnetite e g cufe2o4 activated pds process the radical process involving cu ii cu iii cycling was previously proposed for the activation of pds by cuo fe3o4 lei et al 2015 it might occur in some cases but not likely in our reaction systems the structural cu ii in cuo fe3o4 composite was proposed as the activator for pds without consideration of redox interaction between cu ii and magnetite hence the involvement of cu i was overlooked based on the assumption of the limited reduction ability of pds in that work on the other hand our reaction system was always excluded from the ambient air different from the experimental conditions in that work thus the generation of cu could be detected in the presence of high cl concentration in addition cu ii was structurally incorporated in cuo fe3o4 composite while cu2 and magnetite was just physically mixed together in our work different coexisting states of cu2 might induce different interaction between cu2 and structural fe ii and thus the pds activation 4 conclusion this study shows that the coexisted cu2 ion on the surface of magnetite significantly enhanced the activation of pds at neutral to alkaline environmental conditions such enhancement effect occurred at as low as 10 µm cu2 concentration and increased with increasing cu2 concentration the adsorbed cu2 was reduced by the structural fe ii of magnetite to generate cu the stability of which was enhanced on the surface of magnetite at neutral or alkaline phs the generated cu rather than cu2 was found to contribute to pds activation for radical generation this synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 was effective to

17548,magnetite is known to exhibit high catalytic reactivity in fenton like reactions merely at low ph conditions here we report the association of cu2 ion can significantly enhance peroxydisulfate pds activation with magnetite under environmental aquatic conditions near neutral ph cu2 is able to synergistically activate pds with magnetite to generate radicals e g so4 at neutral or slightly alkaline ph and such synergistic activation of pds is promising to degrade various contaminants in groundwater in depth study reveals cu2 ion adsorbed on magnetite plays a crucial role in pds activation the adsorbed cu2 is labile to be reduced by the structural fe ii on magnetite to generate cu which is relatively stable in the presence of magnetite at neutral or alkaline ph but extremely unstable at acidic ph the generated cu on magnetite surface rather than cu2 contributes to pds activation in the reaction system and the recycling of cu cu2 sustains continuous activation of pds this study is among the first to report the synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 ion at neutral ph and unambiguously discern the role of cu in pds activation the new mechanistic knowledge

cu2 1 introduction persulfates ps including peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms have recently become popular oxidants to degrade various organic contaminants in environmental remediation and water treatment kim et al 2018 liu et al 2016 compared to pms pds is more cost effective 0 74 kg for pds vs 2 2 kg for pms and relatively stable thus having greater practical potential in field applications zhang et al 2014 pds e0 1 96 v can be activated to generate sulfate radical so4 e0 2 5 3 1 v which can degrade a wider range of refractory organic contaminants than pds fang et al 2013c qian et al 2018 various strategies have been used to activate pds to generate so4 such as heating chen et al 2016 uv irradiation zhou et al 2018 transition metal ions anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 and certain organic substrates ahmad et al 2013 among them base and heat activations are most commonly used in field applications however they are not cost effective owing to the requirement of high base dosing or energy input zhang et al 2013 although uv irradiation is effective to activate pds use of uv light is impractical in situ chemical oxidation isco liu et al 2014 transition metal activated pds intensively consumes chemicals due to the scavenging of so4 by metal ions zhang et al 2015 while activation of pds with organic chemicals depends on the structure of substrates e g quinones and phenols ahmad et al 2013 fang et al 2013c compared to the strategies listed above activation with naturally occurring minerals is a more appealing alternative when pds is applied to remediate contaminated soils and groundwater ahmad et al 2010 indeed the decomposition rate of pds is noticeably enhanced in the presence of aquifer solids johnson et al 2008 sra et al 2010 when thirteen trace minerals were tested to evaluate their capacity in pds activation four minerals i e cobaltite ilmenite pyrite and siderite were found to significantly enhance pds activation teel et al

simulated groundwater conditions ph 8 0 liu et al 2014 magnetite fe3o4 is an important iron mineral and ubiquitously present in clays soils and aquifers fang et al 2013b the excellent structural stability and ease of magnetic separation render magnetite particularly feasible for heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of organic pollutants sabri et al 2012 sun and lemley 2011 for example magnetite is able to efficiently activate pds to generate radicals and thus effective for degradation of various organic contaminants e g oil hydrocarbons usman et al 2012 polychlorinated biphenyls fang et al 2013a ibuprofen sabri et al 2012 tetracyclines hou et al 2012 and sulfamonomethoxine yan et al 2011 however the above reactions significantly depend on the solution ph with high efficacy only occurring at strongly acidic condition yan et al 2011 hence magnetite seems to be impractical in environmental remediation which is commonly at neutral ph condition enhancement of magnetite reactivity at mild ph is essential for broadening its environmental application iron minerals always coexist with various metal ions in the natural environment magnetite associated with some metal ions was found to show high reactivity towards contaminant degradation gregory et al 2004 however it remains unclear whether magnetite exhibits higher reactivity towards pds activation after association with various metal ions in fact the metal substituted magnetite with the formula of mfe2o4 m co cu zn mn showed considerable catalytic activity in so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops liang et al 2012 ren et al 2015 for example cufe2o4 was effective for pms activation to destruct various organic contaminants such as di n butyl phthalate ren et al 2015 tetrabromobisphenol a ding et al 2013 iopromide zhang et al 2013 and atrazine guan et al 2013 but was ineffective for pds activation guan et al 2013 in contrast cuo fe3o4 composite fabricated using a hydrothermal method was an efficient activator for pds to generate cu iii and so4 lei et al 2015 we are thus motivated to investigate whether simple mixture of magnetite and metal ions without complicated and time consuming synthesis procedures could effectively activate pds various metal ions were tested for their impact on magnetite activated pds we discovered that magnetite associated with cu2 ion was effective for pds activation at mild ph conditions as will be shown in detail later the activation mechanism of pds by magnetite associated with cu2 ion was quite different from the conventional mechanism for cu ii substituted magnetite activated pds the new findings of this study have important implications for understanding pds activation by iron minerals in isco and broadening environmental application of magnetite 2 materials and

prepared by dissolving feso4 7h2o and fecl3 6h2o into deoxygenated diw respectively cuso4 was dissolved in diw at ph 3 0 adjusted by hcl cu stock solution was prepared by dissolving cucl in deoxygenated diw with 0 01 m hcl and 1 0 m nacl a high concentration of cl in the acidic cu solution retarded the oxidation rate of cu and thus enhanced its stability yuan et al 2012 2 2 real water

experiments were conducted in 100 ml clear glass serum bottles with teflon lined caps and aluminum foil cover to prevent light typically magnetite and cu2 were added into 100 ml solution containing 0 1 mm of anisole or other contaminants the solution ph was controlled at 7 0 with 10 mm of phosphate buffer then the above mixtures were mixed with magnetic stirring for 30 min to achieve adsorption desorption equilibrium afterwards contaminant degradation was initiated with the addition of pds the serum bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers during the reaction and the solution was purged by n2 gas for 30 min before the addition of pds and for one min after every sampling this condition was termed oxygen limited at predetermined time intervals 5 ml aliquots of reaction solution were collected and immediately separated from magnetite by a powerful magnet the clear supernatant was quenched with 1 0 m na2s2o3 then filtered through 0 22 μm membrane gvwp01300 millipore and finally stored in amber vials at 5 c before analysis to evaluate the activation of pds by magnetite alone only magnetite was added into the reactor containing pds and contaminants and the following operation was identical to that in the above reaction for the experiments investigating ph impact the solution ph was maintained at the designated values by 10 mm of phosphate buffer adjusted with hcl and naoh all the experiments were conducted in duplicate or more 2 5 analytical methods anisole and nitrobenzene were analyzed by an agilent 1100 high performance liquid chromatography hplc equipped with a diode array detector injection sample of 20 µl was separated on a zorbax rx c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm at the flow rate of 1 0 ml min isocratic elution was performed with 60 methanol and 40 water the detection wavelength was 270 and 220 nm for nitrobenzene and anisole respectively concentrations of cu2 and leaching of iron ions were determined using an agilent inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms agilent 7500 formation of cu was detected according to the bathocuproine method used in previous work chen et al 2015 briefly bathocuproine a strong ligand for cu complexation was added to react with cu to generate the orange colored cu bathocuporine complex this complex has a maximum absorption peak at 484 nm and was monitored on a beckman du520 uv vis spectrophotometer ethylenediamine 20 mm was added to mask the interference from cu2 to determine cu on magnetite the solution was first adjusted to ph 3 0 with hcl since adsorption of cu on magnetite was negligible at this ph the desorbed cu was further determined with the above bathocuproine method the electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra were determined using an emx 8 2 7 spectrometer bruker germany with the details presented in text s2 pds was determined by a spectrophotometric method proposed by liang et al 2008 briefly the aliquots of the filtered sample were added into the solution containing ki and nahco3 generating yellow color owing to the reaction between ki and pds such color could be measured on a beckman du520 spectrophotometer at λmax 352 nm to quantify the concentration of pds 3 results and discussion 3 1 activation of pds by magnetite anisole and nitrobenzene were tested to evaluate pds activation with magnetite at different phs they are commonly used as probes to distinguish the contributions of so4 and ho to contaminant degradation kho anisole 5 4 109 m 1 s 1 kso4 anisole 4 9 109 m 1s 1 kho nitrobenzene 3 9 109m 1 s 1 kso4 nitrobenzene 106m 1 s 1 furman et al 2011 as fig 1 shows the remarkable degradation of probes was observed at acidic phs 3 5 with the degradation of anisole faster than that of nitrobenzene at neutral ph 7 or alkaline phs 9 11 conditions however their degradation was significantly reduced and only slight degradation was observed after 48 h these results indicated that magnetite was effective for pds activation merely at acidic phs but not at neutral and alkaline conditions on the other hand both so4 and ho were suggested to be generated from pds activation by magnetite with so4 as the primary reactive radical at acidic phs indeed magnetite was frequently reported to exhibit high catalytic reactivity in fenton like reaction at low ph conditions in fact the surface structural fe ii in iron oxides was regarded as a potential activator for pds maithreepala and doong 2003 pds s2o8 2 could approach closely to the positively charged magnetite surface phpzc 5 4 at ph 3 0 more easily than to the negatively charged magnetite at neutral or alkaline phs thus pds activation with structural fe ii only occurred at acidic phs on the other hand considerable fe ions were dissolved from structural fe of magnetite at acidic phs while the dissolved fe ions were negligible at ph 7 0 and higher fig s2 the ph dependent leaching of fe ions resembled the trend of pds activation with magnetite at various phs it was thus implied that the leached fe ions were also important activators for pds hence both the structural and leached fe contributed to the rapid activation of pds by magnetite at acidic phs the above results suggested magnetite to be an ineffective activator for pds in environmental remediation where neutral ph is most common because activation of pds with magnetite was effective merely at low phs it is noted that various metal ions always naturally coexist with magnetite and magnetite exhibit higher reactivity after association with some metal ions gregory et al 2004 we thus evaluated whether metal ions could enhance pds activation by magnetite at environmental conditions various metal ions including cu2 ni2 co2 fe3 fe2 mg2 ca2 zn2 and mn2 were tested for their impact on magnetite activated pds results showed that except for cu2 the investigated metal ions had negligible impact on pds activation with magnetite at neutral ph fig 2 and fig s3 we were thus motivated to conduct an in depth study to elucidate the role of cu2 in the enhancement of pds activation with magnetite 3 2 synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 as shown in fig 2 while magnetite or cu2 alone exhibited negligible effect on pds activation at neutral ph the coupling of magnetite with cu2 was effective to activate pds specifically degradation of anisole was negligible after 22 h with pds activated by magnetite or cu2 alone however the degradation efficiency of anisole notably increased to 80 when pds was activated by the combination of magnetite and cu2 fig 2 in analogy significant decomposition of pds was only observed when both magnetite and cu2 were present but did not occur in the presence of magnetite or cu2 alone fig s4 these results indicated that cu2 and magnetite could synergistically activate pds at neutral ph on the other hand anisole underwent significantly faster degradation than nitrobenzene in pds magnetite cu2 system fig 2 suggesting so4 as the dominant radicals in the reaction system apparently the significant activation of pds was not induced by magnetite or aqueous cu2 but was likely attributed to the adsorbed cu2 on magnetite we further investigated the xps spectra of magnetite before and after addition of cu2 the fraction of fe ii on the surface of magnetite in pds magnetite solution was close to that of the pristine magnetite but was slightly decreased after addition of cu ii text s3 fig s5 it was thus implied that fe ii was likely to react with the adsorbed cu2 on magnetite which will be further discussed in the later section the impact of cu2 concentration was evaluated to understand the synergistic activation of pds the degradation of anisole gradually increased with cu2 concentration increased from 0 01 to 0 1 mm but slightly decreased when cu2 concentration further increased to 0 25 mm and above fig s6 this result indicated that 0 1 mm of cu2 was the most efficient for the synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 while further increase of cu2 concentration reduced the synergistic effect after addition of cu2 all cu2 was rapidly adsorbed on the surface of magnetite even at cu2 concentration of 0 5 mm fig s7 the generated radicals might be quenched by the adsorbed cu species when high concentration of cu2 was present thus reducing the contaminant degradation pds activation is always influenced by solution ph tsitonaki et al 2010 we thus explored the effect of ph on the synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 as shown in fig 3 the degradation of anisole was ph dependent and neutral ph was most favorable for its degradation the apparent degradation efficiency of anisole was calculated to be 78 2 59 90 55 and 58 at ph 3 5 7 9 and 11 respectively note that magnetite alone was effective to activate pds to degrade anisole at acidic phs fig 1 the contribution of pds activated by magnetite should be substracted from the overall degradation of anisole compared to the degradation of anisole in magnetite pds system addition of cu2 had negligible effect on the anisole degradation at ph 3 fig 3 at ph 7 0 however the degradation efficiency of anisole was remarkably increased by 72 after addition of cu2 when the solution ph was further increased to ph 9 and 11 the addition of cu2 could increase the degradation efficiency of anisole by 37 5 and 47 4 respectively hence the synergistic effect of cu2 and magnetite on pds activation was significant at neutral and alkaline conditions rather than at acidic phs this result was consistent with the previous report that higher ph was favorable for the activation of pds by cuo fe3o4 composite which was explained by low cu ii leaching from the catalyst and formation of surface hydroxyl groups potential active sites for electron transfer lei et al 2015 we thus investigated the adsorption of cu2 on magnetite at various phs as fig s8 shows the aqueous cu2 was completely adsorbed on magnetite at ph 7 0 and higher due to the electrostatic attraction between cu2 ions and the negatively charged magnetite ph pzc 5 4 at acidic conditions however the adsorption of cu2 was significantly reduced and could be neglected at ph 3 0 owing to its strong electrostatic repulsion with the positively charged magnetite it was thus suggested that ph dependency of synergistic activation of pds was likely originated from the adsorbed cu2 on magnetite at alkaline phs the precipitate of cu2 with phosphate ions or oh might reduce the availability of cu2 ions on the magnetite for pds activation 3 3 impact of groundwater matrices we then explored whether the above synergistic activation of pds was also applicable in real waters and tested the impact of groundwater matrix on anisole degradation by pds magnetite cu2 as shown in fig 4 significant degradation of anisole was observed in the groundwater with the reaction rate even slightly faster than that in diw the slight acceleration of anisole degradation might be attributed to pds activation by groundwater matrices indeed slight degradation of anisole could be still observed when pds was present in groundwater fig s9 the constituents in groundwater e g metal ions and or organic matter table s1 likely acted as potential activators for pds hence the groundwater matrix was compatible with the synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 we further evaluated the degradation of some common contaminants in groundwater e g tce cbz and dcf by pds magnetite cu2 tce has been frequently detected in groundwater and thus listed as a priority contaminant by the usepa yan et al 2016 control experiment showed slight degradation of tce when pds was activated by magnetite in groundwater fig s10 after addition of cu2 significant degradation of tce was observed fig 4 suggesting the effectiveness of the synergistic activation of pds by magnetite cu2 to remediate tce contaminated groundwater dcf and cbz are considered as emerging contaminants which have attracted increasing attention in recent years tran and gin 2017 they are persistent in the environment and thus detected in groundwater at high frequency sui et al 2015 as fig 4 shows both dcf and cbz were susceptible to significant degradation by pds activated by magnetite cu2 in groundwater therefore synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 was effective for degradation of various contaminants in groundwater indicating the effectiveness of pds magnetite cu2 in groundwater remediation 3 4 scavenging experiments and epr analyses epr analyses were conducted to investigate the radical generation in the pds magnetite cu2 solution as shown in fig s11 epr signals corresponding to dmpo oh and dmpo so4 were not observed in the spectrum of pds magnetite solution after addition of cu2 both dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts were clearly observed in the epr spectrum of pds magnetite cu2 solution this evidence indicated that so4 and ho were generated when pds was synergistically activated by magnetite and cu2 alcohols such as tba and etoh are frequently selected as radical quenchers to differentiate the contribution of radical species for contaminant degradation tba reacts with so4 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 much more slowly than with ho 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 while etoh reacts very rapidly with both so4 1 2 2 8 109 m 1s 1 and ho 1 6 7 7 107 m 1s 1 liang and su 2009 as shown in fig s12 the addition of alcohols inhibited the degradation of anisole and the inhibitory effect increased with the increasing alcohol dosages from 1 to 100 mm when the alcohol concentration was increased to 100 mm the degradation efficiency of anisole was inhibited by 58 and 24 in the presence of etoh and tba respectively this result further confirmed so4 as the primary radical in the synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 at neutral ph 3 5 interaction of cu2 with magnetite cuo was previously reported to be effective for pds activation zhang et al 2014 we thus investigated whether cuo was formed after addition of cu2 to magnetite at neutral ph xrd pattern was almost identical for magnetite before and after addition of cu2 fig s13 indicating that cuo was not generated after addition of cu2 to magnetite moreover addition of excess edta could completely inhibit the degradation of anisole in pds magnetite cu2 system fig s14 this result implied the adsorbed cu2 ion rather than cuo was responsible for the activation of pds the interaction between the adsorbed cu2 and magnetite was essential for the synergistic activation of pds compared to aqueous fe2 the adsorbed or lattice fe ii on the surface of iron oxide exhibited considerable reductive reactivity towards various contaminants fang et al 2013b such as carbon tetrachloride danielsen and hayes 2004 nitrobenzene gorski and scherer 2009 and hexavalent uranium scott et al 2005 because the inner sphere bonds between fe ii and the hydroxyl groups increased the electron density around fe ii center on the surface amonette et al 2000 the structural fe ii on magnetite was able to reduce the adsorbed cu2 to cu on the surface which was thermodynamically unfavorable in aqueous solution white and peterson 1996 moreover the reduction of cu2 to cu was found to play a significant role in the synergistic effect of cu2 on the reductive dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride by fe2 adsorbed on goethite maithreepala and doong 2003 we thus hypothesized that the synergistic effect of cu2 on pds activation by magnetite might be attributed to the redox reaction between cu2 and structural fe ii on magnetite to verify this hypothesis we determined the generation of cu in the reaction system determination of cu aqueous cu is quite unstable in the presence of oxygen and can be quickly oxidized to cu2 with a half life of less than one min in freshwater however the complexation of cu with organic ligands or chloride can significantly reduce its oxidation rate hence high concentration of cl was always added into cu solution to enhance its stability when cu stock solution was prepared to determine whether cu was generated at ph 7 0 100 mm of nacl was also added to the magnetite cu2 system the result showed that cu was indeed generated in magnetite cu2 nacl system because a strong absorbance at 484 nm was observed characteristic of cu bathocuporine complex fig 5 a the peak at 484 nm for cu complex disappeared without addition of high concentration of nacl thus the presence of cl was crucial for determining cu at neutral ph after addition of cu2 to the magnetite nacl system the generated cu slightly decreased as the reaction proceeded fig s15 we thus further investigated the stability of cu in the presence of magnetite under oxygen limited condition stability of cu because 1 0 m of cl was introduced to stabilize cu when the stock cu solution was prepared 100 mm of cl was already present in the cu magnetite solution and thus the additional spiking of cl was not needed at first we evaluated the impact of oxygen on the stability of cu in the presence of magnetite generally cu is unstable and rapidly disappeared after 3 min when the cu solution was exposed to ambient oxygen fig s16 indeed cu can be quickly oxidized to cu2 with a half life of less than 1 min in freshwater chen et al 2015 compared to cu in aqueous solution loss of cu was significantly reduced in the presence of magnetite and complete disappearance of cu was observed after 15 min fig s16 hence the presence of magnetite could significantly reduce the oxidation rate of cu by dissolved oxygen when the reactor was closed to the ambient air the oxidation rate of cu was significantly reduced and 70 of cu remained in the solution after 30 min the oxidation of cu was further slowed down if nitrogen gas was continually purged to the reactor during reaction with only 14 cu disappeared after 30 min afterwards we evaluated ph impact on the stability of cu in the presence of magnetite the results showed that cu was relatively stable in the magnetite solution at neutral or alkaline phs but was extremely unstable at acidic phs fig s17 at acidic condition cu was primarily present in aqueous solution owing to its electrostatic repulsion with the positively charged magnetite aqueous cu was extremely unstable at acidic ph without stabilization by magnetite on the other hand significant leaching of fe ions from magnetite occurred at acidic phs fig s2 the leached fe3 ions could oxidize cu to generate cu2 and thus induce the instability of cu indeed cu was stable in the leaching solution at ph 7 and 9 but was rapidly disappeared at ph 3 and gradually disappeared at ph 5 fig s18 hence the instability of cu at acidic phs might be also attributed to the reaction of cu with the leached fe ions from magnetite overall the interaction between magnetite and cu2 was essential for the synergistic activation of pds the structural fe ii of magnetite was able to reduce the adsorbed cu2 to generate cu and the stability of cu was significantly enhanced after adsorption on magnetite 3 6 proposed mechanism the activation process of pds with cu is complicated and depends on the existing state and property of cu generally aqueous cu2 ion was ineffective to activate pds while structural cu ii e g cuo exhibited a much higher reactivity towards pds activation liang et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 activation of pds with aqueous cu2 involved the electron transferred from cu2 to pds eq 1 with a high energy barrier to overcome in contrast the high reactivity of structural cu ii on the catalyst surface rendered pds activation more effective and proceeded via two alternative processes i e non radical process and free radical process lei et al 2015 in the non radical process the outer sphere interaction between cu ii and pds induced some slight rearrangement of pds electrons rendering it more reactive towards contaminants zhang et al 2014 the radical process involves the electron transferred from cu ii to pds with high efficiency eq 1 owing to the lower reduction potential of cu ii cu iii on the catalyst surface lei et al 2015 1 cu ii pds cu iii so4 2 cu ii pms cu i so5 3 cu i pms pds cu ii so4 cu ii activated pms another common ps oxidant is able to undergo via the cu i cu ii process that is one electron was transferred from pms to cu ii generating so5 and cu i eq 2 and cu i further activated pms to generate so4 eq 3 however pds activation with cu ii seems to unlikely proceed through cu i cu ii process owing to the limited reduction ability of pds in fact cu i is effective to activate pds for radical generation eq 3 which has been well documented before kolthoff and woods 1966 woods et al 1965 zhang et al 2018 indeed after addition of increasing pds concentration into cu solution the orange color of cu bathocuporine complex gradually decreased fig s19 with the peak at 484 nm characteristic of cu gradually decreased and finally disappeared fig s20 it is thus suggested the reaction between pds and cu in the solution if cu2 could be reduced to cu in cu2 pds system efficient activation of pds might still happen indeed the presence of reducing agent e g hydroxylamine significantly enhanced the pds activation with cu2 with cu generated from cu2 reduction rather than cu2 contributed to the efficient activation of pds zhou et al 2016 similarly in our reaction system the structural fe ii on magnetite was able to reduce the adsorbed cu2 to cu which was verified in the above section hence efficient activation of pds by magnetite cu2 was originated from the generated cu in the magnetite cu2 system cu2 was completely adsorbed on the surface of magnetite at neutral condition and then reduced to cu after addition of pds the generated cu was rapidly oxidized to cu2 fig 5b we further desorbed cu2 bound on the surface of magnetite by adjusting the solution to ph 3 with hcl since the adsorption of cu2 on magnetite could be neglected at strong acidic ph fig s8 the high desorption efficiency of cu2 from magnetite at ph 3 was verified in the control experiment fig s21 the concentration of the desorbed cu2 on magnetite after reaction was close to the initial cu2 concentration fig 5b this evidence suggested cu2 act as a catalytic role in the overall reaction the synergistic effect of cu2 on pds activation by magnetite was finally proposed in fig 6 cu2 was adsorbed on the surface of magnetite owing to the electrostatic attraction subsequently the adsorbed cu2 was reduced by structural fe ii in close proximity to generate cu which was an excellent activator for pds to generate cu2 and radicals such as so4 afterwards the radicals were effective to destruct contaminants on the surface of magnetite while the generated cu2 further participated in the reaction hence the synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 were resulted from the initial reduction of cu2 to cu by structural fe ii and the subsequent cu activated pds cu2 plays a catalyst role in the activation of pds and the recycling of cu cu2 sustained the continuous activation of pds this synergistic activation of pds is most effective at neutral condition which could significantly alleviate the structural destruction of magnetite and thus maintain its significant and long lasting reactivity moreover the metal ions i e cu2 and fe2 were almost completely adsorbed on the surface of magnetite at neutral condition avoiding the leaching problem which was always encountered in the cu ii substituted magnetite e g cufe2o4 activated pds process the radical process involving cu ii cu iii cycling was previously proposed for the activation of pds by cuo fe3o4 lei et al 2015 it might occur in some cases but not likely in our reaction systems the structural cu ii in cuo fe3o4 composite was proposed as the activator for pds without consideration of redox interaction between cu ii and magnetite hence the involvement of cu i was overlooked based on the assumption of the limited reduction ability of pds in that work on the other hand our reaction system was always excluded from the ambient air different from the experimental conditions in that work thus the generation of cu could be detected in the presence of high cl concentration in addition cu ii was structurally incorporated in cuo fe3o4 composite while cu2 and magnetite was just physically mixed together in our work different coexisting states of cu2 might induce different interaction between cu2 and structural fe ii and thus the pds activation 4 conclusion this study shows that the coexisted cu2 ion on the surface of magnetite significantly enhanced the activation of pds at neutral to alkaline environmental conditions such enhancement effect occurred at as low as 10 µm cu2 concentration and increased with increasing cu2 concentration the adsorbed cu2 was reduced by the structural fe ii of magnetite to generate cu the stability of which was enhanced on the surface of magnetite at neutral or alkaline phs the generated cu rather than cu2 was found to contribute to pds activation for radical generation this synergistic activation of pds by magnetite and cu2 was effective to degrade various contaminants in groundwater indicating its effectiveness in groundwater remediation the new findings have not only broaden the understanding of activation mechanisms of pds by magnetite in environmental remediation relevant conditions but also developed a possible approach for improving the efficacy of pds activation by minerals in isco declaration of competing interest the

17549,cadmium cd contaminated waterbodies are a worldwide concern for the environment impacting human health to address the need for efficient sustainable and cost effective remediation measures we developed innovative cd bioremediation agents by engineering escherichia coli to assemble poly 3 hydroxybutyric acid phb beads densely coated with cd binding peptides this was accomplished by translational fusion of cd binding peptides to the n or c terminus of a phb synthase that catalyzes phb synthesis and mediates assembly of cd2 or cd1 coated phb beads respectively cd1 beads showed greater cd adsorption with 441 nmol cd mg 1 bead mass when compared to cd2 beads 334 nmol cd mg 1 bead mass and plain beads 238 nmol cd mg 1 bead mass the cd beads were not ecotoxic and did attenuate cd spiked solutions toxicity overall the bioengineered beads provide a means to remediate cd contaminated sites can be cost effectively produced at large scale and offer a biodegradable and safe

european comission 2008 and urgently call for sustainable strategies towards its removal from contaminated waste waters bioremediation is an attractive approach for metal removal and or stabilization liu et al 2019 as it is effective for low metal concentrations economical and sustainable li and tao 2015 living organisms have been evaluated for cd biosorption including cyanobacteria zhou et al 2014 fungi huang et al 2015 and algae suresh kumar et al 2015 to improve cd selectivity and removal capacity genetically modified organisms gmos have been produced to display for example histidine

biosorbents originated from plants wastes li et al 2010 mudhoo et al 2012 nguyen et al 2013 vinod et al 2009 and microbially synthesized exopolymeric substances zamil et al 2008 cd adsorption onto these biosorbents is dependent on the negatively charged surfaces at specific ph khairy et al 2014 which could be engineered to improve cd adsorption capacity however the chemical functionalization would result in a complex synthesis process due to the additional quality control steps hence escalating the production timeline and cost therefore a novel strategy that enables cost effective biosorbent production with enhanced cd binding capacity is on demand especially when both performance and manufacturing processes namely speed and cost are the competitive drivers burakov et al 2018 bacteria are naturally capable of forming spherical polyhydroxyalkanoate pha beads as carbon storage inclusions rehm 2010 biodegradable poly 3 hydroxybutyric acid phb is the most commonly produced short chain length pha parlane et al 2017 phb inclusions are characterized by a hydrophobic phb core surrounded mostly by pha synthase phac that mediates self assembly of phb beads rehm 2010 fig 1 due to its covalent attachment to the phb core phac has been genetically engineered to anchor immobilize and display various functional peptides proteins at the phb beads surface enabling biomedical and industrial applications hooks et al 2014 parlane et al 2017 rehm 2010 towards environmental applications phb beads have been functionalized with either a chromate reductase for chromium remediation robins et al 2013 or an organophosphate hydrolase for organophosphorous pesticide degradation blatchford et al 2012 ogura and rehm 2019 generation of large peptide libraries linked with display technologies such as phage or whole cell display enabled the identification of peptides with unique metal binding properties jahns and rehm 2012 mejàre et al 1998 hence allowing the informed design of phb beads coated with respective peptides for metal sequestration including cd to the best of our knowledge the use of microbially produced phb beads that are functionalized with cd binding peptides for cd removal has not been reported yet this approach would facilitate simultaneous synthesis and functionalization of phb beads in one step in recombinant bacteria avoiding multiple production steps and thus removing limitations inherent to the traditional approaches moreover the use of bacteria means that the biomanufacturing processes occur at environmentally friendly conditions and that the numbers of the functionalized phb beads can be easily multiplied by controlling the bacterial growth hence facilitating scalable and sustainable bead production moreover the covalent links between the fusion peptides and the phb core would avoid leaching of the peptides from the beads during harsh adsorption conditions in this study we designed and produced phb beads displaying cd binding peptides in engineered e coli fig 1 and compared their production yields and performances e coli was selected as microbial cell factories for the production of phb beads displaying cd binding peptides due to its well documented genetic configuration hence promoting relatively easy genetic engineering moradali and rehm 2020 rehm 2010 as well as its ability to achieve high volumetric productivity through high cell density fermentation technology and scalable bioprocess unit operations which have long been established for commercial biopharmaceuticals yee and blanch 1992 the cd biosorption abilities of the beads were analyzed under different ph and initial cd concentrations the environmental safety of the produced beads was primarily assessed against a bioindicator bacterium overall we have demonstrated a cost effective method to produce functionalized and biodegradable beads in one step in e coli and that the beads function as an effective and harmless alternative for cd bioremediation

transformants were cultured at 37 c in lb medium containing ampicillin chloramphenicol and 1 w v ᴅ glucose at an od600 optical density at 600 nm of 0 6 0 8 the pha bead production was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β ᴅ thiogalactopyranoside into the cultures which were further incubated for 48 h at 25 c hay et al 2017 the cells were harvested washed and subjected to mechanical cell disruption cf1 cell disrupter constant systems ltd uk in a lysis buffer followed by purification and storage of the purified beads as described elsewhere hay et al 2017 rubio reyes et al 2016 2 4 beads characterization fusion proteins on the beads were separated in a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page rubio reyes et al 2016 the amount of cd binding peptides

followed procedures previously explained gonzález miró et al 2018 prior to sem analyses the beads were sputter coated with an ultrathin layer of platinum in an argon atmosphere to make them electronically conductive the phb content of beads was analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir perkin elmer ftir spectrometer equipped with a horizontal cell golden gate spectra data

detected in low and highly contaminated effluents or waterbodies neiva et al 2014 considering that metal speciation is affected by the ph of such aquatic systems the cd adsorption was evaluated at ph 3 5 7 and 9 the assays were conducted in triplicates per treatment for each bead type and after the exposure to metal solutions the beads were recovered by centrifugation cd concentrations in the initial solutions i e before contact with the beads and in the aqueous supernatant i e after contact with the beads were quantified by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes

evaluated against the bacterium a globiformis decomposers the toxicity of metal solutions before and after the cd binding assays was assessed against a globiformis although the a globiformis contact tests are usually applied to evaluate the effect of solid samples e g wastes in the bacteria dha iso 2016 it has been successfully used in our lab for testing aqueous samples unpublished data briefly the cd bound and cd unbound beads were resuspended in 600 µl of distilled water to achieve a bead density of 1 w v for the aqueous phase tests 600 µl of the supernatants obtained after centrifugation of the remediated solutions at the end of metal binding assays was considered at least three replicates were performed per treatment an exponentially growing a globiformis inoculum od600 0 4 was added to each test well 400 µl the kinetics of the dha assisted conversion of resazurin into the fluorescent resorufin compound was fluorimetrically followed for 1 h after adding 800 µl of the resazurin buffer a globiformis response was computed as the average percentage inhibition of dha marques et al 2018 2014 2 7 statistics a one way analysis of variance one way anova followed by the tukey multiple comparison test were performed to test significant differences of zeta potentials of all the beads for each ph tested a two way anova was carried out to evaluate the influence of the two factors i e cd concentration and bead type or no bead and their interactions on the adsorption and removal capacities of beads as well as on the response of a globiformis under different ph if no significant interaction was determined the influence of each factor was tested within each level of the other factor by the one way anova followed by the tukey test if a significant interaction was detected a similar approach was conducted except that the msresidual of the two way anova was considered for the calculation of the one way anova f and the q statistics for the tukey test quinn and keough 2002 statistics were performed using sigmaplot 11 0 and a significant result was considered whenever p 0 05 3 results 3 1 design and production of cd binding peptide coated phb beads hybrid genes were constructed as to encode two different cd binding peptides cd1 or cd2 fused to either c or n terminus of phac synthase respectively the cd binding peptide motifs had been selected based on their affinity selectivity and improved capacity to bind cd using phage display flynn et al 2003 or bacterial cell surface display systems eskandari et al 2013 mejàre et al 1998 the orientation and constraint of the peptides during biopanning studies informed on how to translational fuse the peptides to the phb synthase i e the phb anchoring domain in addition phac engineering aimed to facilitate high production yields of phb beads densely coated with peptides that retained structural flexibility to interact with cd in bulk solutions fig 1 a linker was used when fusing cd1 to the c terminus of phac to retain hydrophobic phb core formation combined with the enhanced display of cd1 peptides on the phb bead surface jahns and rehm 2009 therefore two plasmids ppoly c phac linker cd1 or ppoly c cd2 phac were constructed by inserting either cd1 or cd2 genes encoding for cd1 or cd2 peptides into the 3 or 5 end of phac respectively based on original screening of the peptides and their validation fig 2a e coli bl21 de3 harboring plasmid pmcs69 which encodes for phaa and phab proteins that sequentially catalyze the synthesis of phb precursors rubio reyes et al 2016 was transformed with each of the plasmids to mediate the synthesis of cd1 peptide coated cd1 and cd2 peptide coated cd2 phb beads respectively as a control e coli bl21 de3 harboring pmcs69 was also transformed with the plasmid ppoly c phac to produce nonfunctionalized phb beads nfb fig 2a the biomanufacturing processes revealed that production yields for nfb cd1 and cd2 beads were 7 1 8 1 and 2 0 respectively 3 2 characterization of the beads sds page analyses on the protein profiles of isolated nfb cd1 and cd2 beads indicated successful production of the respective proteins sds page of the purified nfb qualitatively showed the dominant band at 56 5 kda fig 2b which corresponds to the molecular weight of phac the fusion proteins phac linker cd1 or cd2 phac attached to cd1 or cd2 beads were also produced as indicated by the protein bands having higher molecular weight i e 59 2 or 58 8 kda figure 2b respectively than only phac the amount of cd binding peptides coating the beads was quantified to be 122 14 ng mg 1 cd1 beads and 18 19 ng mg 1 cd2 beads based on densitometry analyses fig 2c lc ms tryptic peptide fingerprinting of proteins excised from sds page gels confirmed the expected protein sequence of phac phac linker cd1 and cd2 phac table s1 tem images showed that all the beads were formed inside the recombinant e coli fig 3 upper panel indicating that the phac synthase in the fusion proteins remained fully functional mediating in vivo phb bead formation further tem fig 3 middle panel and scanning electron microscopy sem fig 3 bottom panel images showed the intact and mostly spherical morphology of the purified beads the hydrodynamic diameters of nfb cd1 and cd2 beads as determined by dls were 1708 101 1299 26 and 1146 74 nm fig 3 respectively with a dispersity ð 0 2 such variation on the size of different functionalized beads was previously observed gonzález miró et al 2018 rubio reyes et al 2016 but the associated causes remain unclear the ftir spectra of the three beads were compared with that of the commercial phb standard evidencing nearly identical spectra figure s1 thereby confirming that the beads were composed of phb the characteristic spectra of beads phb can be identified by the peaks at 1720 between 1050 and 1230 1270 and 1452 cm 1 which are assigned to c o and c o stretching of the ester group and c h asymmetrical deformations of the ch2 and ch3 groups respectively additionally the doublet between 2860 and 3000 cm 1 can be attributed to the stretching of c h bond the bands of minor relevance at around 2300 2400 cm 1 found in all spectra are likely associated with co2 in the atmosphere in general ftir spectra profiles of our beads are in good agreement with those of phb inclusions synthesized by cupriavidus necator oliveira et al 2007 considering that cd adsorption can occur through electrostatic attraction mudhoo et al 2012 we determined zeta potentials of the beads dispersed in either water or saline solution at different ph as a proxy to understand the magnitude of electrostatic interactions between metal binding active sites on the bead surfaces and cd in the bulk solution zeta potentials of the beads in saline solution were lower than those in water as the salts reduce the absolute zeta potentials fig 4 the beads were positively charged at ph 3 but when increasing the ph to about 5 beads zeta potentials decreased to their isoelectric points pi accordingly the pi of nfb cd1 and cd2 beads dispersed in water were estimated to be 4 88 5 03 and 4 70 fig 4a whereas in saline solution it shifted to 5 23 6 96 and 5 49 respectively fig 4b further increase in ph resulted in negative zeta potentials of the beads particularly at ph 9 the absolute zeta potential values obtained for nfb dispersed in saline solutions were in agreement with the values previously reported for phb beads that were designed for vaccine purposes gonzález miró et al 2018 3 3 use of engineered phb beads for cd bioremediation all phb beads were subjected to metal binding assays to assess cd biosorption capacity q and removal r at various phs and initial cd concentrations fig 5 at ph 5 q and r were either negative or zero data not shown suggesting that no beads sequestered cd at the ph close to the beads pi figs 2c and 5 nevertheless when the ph was set to 3 7 and 9 both q and r were progressively increased indicating that the beads were able to sequester cd at ph values distant from beads pi the cd removal r by cd1 and cd2 beads was in the range of 10 41 and 47 89 at ph 7 and 9 respectively reaching their highest r values at ph 9 fig 5 tables s2 s3 at which beads were negatively charged fig 4 maximum cd adsorption at ph 9 had also been observed by others copello et al 2008 li et al 2010 zahri et al 2017 since cd could precipitate at ph 9 as cd oh 2 and mislead the interpretation of biosorption mechanisms copello et al 2008 the initial cd concentration of 3 mm in a solution exposed to beads was corrected by subtracting the average amount of precipitated cd in a 3 mm cd solution not exposed to the beads in general increasing initial cd concentrations from 0 01 to 1 mm enhanced beads q fig 5 tables s2 s3 however when the initial cd concentration was increased from 1 to 3 mm at ph 7 both q and r of cd2 beads decreased under the same initial cd concentrations at ph 9 the q of cd1 beads was only slightly increased while r was decreased the decreasing trends of q and r extent at high cd concentrations suggested exhaustion of the available cd binding sites at cd1 and cd2 beads surface martins et al 2017 overall both cd1 and cd2 beads demonstrated significantly higher q and r for cd biosorption than nfbs providing evidence for successful display and functionality of the cd binding peptides cd1 and cd2 respectively in particular the cd2 peptide showed strong cd adsorption of 2 8 20 8 nmol cd ng 1 peptide compared to the cd1 peptide 0 2 3 8 nmol cd ng 1 peptide under adsorption promoting conditions i e at ph 9 for initial cd concentrations ranging from 0 01 to 3 mm notwithstanding the amount of cd1 peptide coating cd1 beads is higher 122 14 ng mg 1 bead mass compared to that of cd2 beads 18 19 ng mg 1 bead mass fig 2c which ultimately had enhanced the adsorption capacity and cd removal of cd1 beads equilibrium studies were conducted in order to assess the underlying adsorption mechanism s at ph 7 and 9 where q and r showed the highest levels fig 5 fig 6 depicts the non linear regression curves resulting from the fitting of three adsorption isotherms to the experimental data sips was the model better describing cd removal at both phs by all the beads nfb cd1 and cd2 achieving the highest correlation values r2 0 990 whereas langmuir r2 0 739 0 985 and freundlich r2 0 683 0 999 isotherms fitted only for specific beads at specific ph values furthermore the maximum adsorption capacity qmax retrieved by sips was quite similar to the average q determined for each bead variant exposed to solutions containing 3 mm cd either at ph 7 nfb 128 1 cd1 268 1 cd2 133 4 nmol cd mg 1 bead mass or ph 9 nfb 262 8 cd1 268 1 cd2 458 1 nmol cd mg 1 bead mass 3 4 are the bioengineered phb beads harmless and effective we evaluated the beads suitability towards potential environmental applications regarding their safety and efficiency for cd bioremediation this assessment was obtained by determining the effect of non exposed i e at 0 mm cd and cd exposed beads on the inhibition of dehydrogenase activity dha of the bacterium arthrobacter globiformis fig 7 tables s4 s5 a globiformis is a ubiquitous bacterium which synthesizes dehydrogenase an enzyme involved in many essential mechanisms sustaining bacterial survival e g respiration that is sensitive to metals iso 2016 marques et al 2018 2014 all the beads that were not exposed to cd were considered not toxic as they did not inhibit dha in contrast dha was significantly impaired by cd1 and cd2 beads with bound cd when compared to the outcome obtained for cd bound nfbs fig 7 tables s4 s5 this trend was particularly observed for cd1 and cd2 beads previously exposed to high cd concentrations at both ph 7 from 0 01 to 3 mm cd and ph 9 at 1 and 3 mm cd these findings consistently emphasize the remarkable ability of cd1 and cd2 beads for cd biosorption in contrast with nfbs that bound much less cd and hence were less hazardous an efficient bioremediation is achieved whenever the bioremediation agents are capable of sequestering cd to levels that reduce the ecotoxic potential of contaminated samples environments pandey et al 2009 the inhibitory effect of cd solutions after being remediated by the engineered beads at increasing ph was significantly decreased fig 8 table s6 for initial cd concentrations of 0 1 mm at ph 7 or 1 mm at ph 9 cd1 and cd2 beads could effectively remove cd since the corresponding remediated solutions were nontoxic for a globiformis considering that 30 dha inhibition is the threshold value below which no toxicity is detectable at higher initial cd concentrations both at ph 7 and 9 the beads remediated solutions remained toxic to a globiformis with over 30 of dha inhibition although nfb could apparently retain certain amounts of cd under ph 7 and 9 and consequently lower the toxicity of remediated cd solutions this was negligible as compared to the bioremediation efficiency of cd1 and cd2 beads fig 8 4 discussion the selection and expression of metal binding peptides are crucial steps in generating metal bioremediation agents these peptides should not only exhibit metal affinity but when bioengineering phb beads should also be amendable toward translational fusion to the phb synthase to enable overproduction of in vivo self assembled phb beads displaying the metal binding peptides hooks et al 2014 parlane et al 2017 besides high yield production protein engineering strategies also need to address the retention of metal peptide interactions for enhanced metal adsorption capacity eskandari et al 2013 here we bioengineered e coli as cell factories to assemble and produce novel phb beads densely coated with cd binding peptides this was achieved by selecting cd binding peptides and protein engineering approaches that retained functionality of phb bead forming enzyme phac while enabling overproduction of the peptides aligned with functional orientation for efficient cd binding figs 1 to 5 cd1 and cd2 beads showed q and r functions two times more enhanced than nfbs particularly at neutral to basic ph fig 5 tables s2 s3 moreover the cd2 beads were overall capable of cd sequestration at levels that rival those described for his rich poly peptides sousa et al 1998 cys rich peptides bae et al 2000 metallothioneins sousa et al 1998 or naturally occurring cd binding domains eskandari et al 2013 engineered for cell surface display in recombinant hosts towards cd bioremediation table s7 cd is present as a metallic cation cd2 in aqueous solution and its biosorption has been broadly associated with complexation or coordination mechanisms resulting from metal interaction with negatively charged sites on biomass or biomaterials mudhoo et al 2012 consequently ph may influence the adsorption of cd due to changes on the electronegativity and hence reactivity of binding sites as well as on metal speciation in solution phb inclusions are characterized by a phb core that is coated by several proteins at the shell rehm 2010 of which polarity hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and charge depend on both amino acids composition and ph lide 2005 therefore it was not surprising that nfb also showed a certain level of cd adsorption capacity and removal especially due to their negative charges at basic ph fig 5 however the functional peptides cd1 and cd2 displayed on cd1 and cd2 beads respectively improved cd adsorption capacity by providing additional binding sites for cd2 among the amino acids composing cd1 and cd2 binding peptides serine cysteine threonine asparagine glutamate and histidine residues have been widely associated with higher cd affinity blindauer 2011 he et al 2012 mejàre et al 1998 the engineered motifs present a high percentage of negatively charged amino acids 15 in cd1 beads i e aspartate and glutamate and or of polar amino acids 30 for cd1 and 57 for cd2 beads e g serine threonine cysteine tyrosine asparagine and glutamine under basic ph values i e above the respective amino acids pka these polar residues tend to present a negative net charge given by the ionization of carboxyl amino hydroxyl or sulfhydryl acidic functional groups khairy et al 2014 this is coherent with the enhanced negative zeta potentials of cd2 beads as compared to cd1 beads at ph 7 and 9 fig 4a which resulted in the higher amount of cd sequestered by cd2 peptides 0 088 20 8 nmol cd ng 1 peptide relatively to the cd1 peptides 0 009 3 8 nmol cd ng 1 peptide in turn the zeta potentials of phb beads at ph 5 attained the lowest values suggesting a nearly neutral surface net charge fig 4 in fact the pi of the polar amino acids composing cd1 and cd2 functional peptides is 5 lide 2005 thereby explaining the lack of cd adsorption and removal at ph 5 at acidic ph however the protonated carboxyl and amine groups provoke a reduction on metal removal due to electrostatic repulsive forces against the cationic cd2 zahri et al 2017 broadly sips was the model that better described cd adsorption by functionalized beads at ph 7 and 9 fig 6 sips is normally applied to characterize metal adsorption to heterogeneous surfaces zahri et al 2017 hence it is suggested that our beads have a heterogeneous distribution of the metal binding sites and that the interactions between cd2 and the functionalized beads were probably governed by a physisorption mechanism based on electrostatic attractions this result is in agreement with the highest q values achieved under ph 9 fig 5 at which beads showed pronouncedly negative zeta potentials fig 4 to build up a sustainable bioremediation loop two important requirements should be met first the bioremediation agents must not be hazardous per se if the end use involves their direct application into the environment we have reached this goal since all bead types did not inhibit a globiformis dha fig 7 tables s4 s5 phb inclusions can likely act as a carbon source fueling the energy metabolism that is mediated by dha in bacteria marques et al 2014 however cd exposed beads after remediation assays were particularly toxic inducing up to 60 dha inhibition at increasing cd concentrations and ph 7 fig 7 tables s4 s5 therefore a globiformis response proved that the functionalized beads had retained cd and as a consequence the toxicity of cd exposed beads demands cautious confinement of the bioremediation process for in situ applications the second requirement is that the selected techniques and agents should guarantee effective bioremediation which is usually assessed by a framework that combines chemical and ecotoxicological analyses the chemical counterpart confirmed the successful removal of cd loads fig 5 tables s2 s3 likewise the toxicity of remediated cd solutions was drastically reduced as indicated by the reduced inhibition of a globiformis dha notably at initial cd concentrations below 0 1 mm ph 7 and 1 mm ph 9 fig 8 the tested range of cd concentrations was based on the cd levels detected in aqueous samples from mine areas e g neiva et al 2014 as well as it had into consideration potential worst case scenarios of cd contamination hence at environmentally significant cd concentrations 0 01 mm cd1 and cd2 beads had also promoted cd removal 1 3 and 3 0 at ph 3 23 8 and 39 2 at ph 7 51 4 and 47 1 at ph9 respectively for cd1 and cd2 beads and toxicity reduction it is thereby strengthened the relevance and efficiency of the functionalized beads for potential environmental applications towards cd cleansing 5 conclusion we have accomplished the proof of concept in that new bio based phb materials were designed and manufactured by engineered e coli for effective cd bioremediation in particular the cd binding peptide fused to the c terminus of the phac protein i e cd1 beads retained phac phb bead forming function resulting in higher production yields and cd bioremediation performance than the cd binding peptide fused to the n terminus of the phac protein i e cd2 beads and only phac protein without the cd binding peptide i e nfb beads these innovative bioremediation agents offer additional valuable advantages since they can be synthesized and functionalized in one step in engineered bacteria through a cost effective process ready for scale up are biodegradable and completely out of the prohibiting regulations on the release of gmos moreover the beads can maintain their stability and functionality under acidic or alkaline ph which are constraining factors for successful bioremediation of metal contaminated matrices e g acid mine drainage effluents and alkaline treatment ponds of mine tailings carvalho 2017 therefore this is a groundbreaking innovation in the bioremediation arena chiefly because our platform can be further improved and or customized to target the future reclamation of other metal contaminants

17549,cadmium cd contaminated waterbodies are a worldwide concern for the environment impacting human health to address the need for efficient sustainable and cost effective remediation measures we developed innovative cd bioremediation agents by engineering escherichia coli to assemble poly 3 hydroxybutyric acid phb beads densely coated with cd binding peptides this was accomplished by translational fusion of cd binding peptides to the n or c terminus of a phb synthase that catalyzes phb synthesis and mediates assembly of cd2 or cd1 coated phb beads respectively cd1 beads showed greater cd adsorption with 441 nmol cd mg 1 bead mass when compared to cd2 beads 334 nmol cd mg 1 bead mass and plain beads 238 nmol cd mg 1 bead mass the cd beads were not ecotoxic and did attenuate cd spiked solutions toxicity overall the bioengineered beads provide a means to remediate cd contaminated sites can be cost effectively produced at large scale and offer a biodegradable and safe

systems and water supply quality schaider et al 2014 adversely impacting wildlife alho et al 2019 and human health carvalho 2017 water quality regulations have prioritized cd as a hazardous substance european comission 2008 and urgently call for sustainable strategies towards its removal from contaminated waste waters bioremediation is an attractive approach for metal removal and or stabilization liu et al 2019 as it is effective for low metal concentrations economical and sustainable li and tao 2015 living organisms have been evaluated for cd biosorption including cyanobacteria zhou et al 2014 fungi huang et al 2015 and algae suresh kumar et al 2015 to improve cd selectivity and removal capacity genetically modified organisms gmos have been produced to display for example histidine rich peptides xu and lee 1999 phytochelatins bae et al 2000 and metallothioneins blindauer 2011 sousa et al 1998 however living organisms used as a direct cd removal means pose limitations due to their 1 tolerance to metal toxicity 2 growth requirements and plasticity to cope with environmental fluctuations 3 limited biomass production 4 modulation of natural microbial assemblages through biostimulation bioaugmentation techniques marques 2016 and 5 non permitted release of gmos liu et al 2019 urgun demirtas et al 2006 alternative approaches for cd removal have been relying on natural biosorbents originated from plants wastes li et al 2010 mudhoo et al 2012 nguyen et al 2013 vinod et al 2009 and microbially synthesized exopolymeric substances zamil et al 2008 cd adsorption onto these biosorbents is dependent on the negatively charged surfaces at specific ph khairy et al 2014 which could be engineered to improve cd adsorption capacity however the chemical functionalization would result in a complex synthesis process due to the additional quality control steps hence escalating the production timeline and cost therefore a novel strategy that enables cost effective biosorbent production with enhanced cd binding capacity is on demand especially when both performance and manufacturing processes namely speed and cost are the competitive drivers burakov et al 2018 bacteria are naturally capable of forming spherical polyhydroxyalkanoate pha beads as carbon storage inclusions rehm 2010 biodegradable poly 3 hydroxybutyric acid phb is the most commonly produced short chain length pha parlane et al 2017 phb inclusions are characterized by a hydrophobic phb core surrounded mostly by pha synthase phac that mediates self assembly of phb beads rehm 2010 fig 1 due to its covalent attachment to the phb core phac has been genetically engineered to anchor immobilize and display various functional peptides proteins at the phb beads surface enabling biomedical and industrial applications hooks et al 2014 parlane et al 2017 rehm 2010 towards environmental applications phb beads have been functionalized with either a chromate reductase for chromium remediation robins et al 2013 or an organophosphate hydrolase for organophosphorous pesticide degradation blatchford et al 2012 ogura and rehm 2019 generation of large peptide libraries linked with display technologies such as phage or whole cell display enabled the identification of peptides with unique metal binding properties jahns and rehm 2012 mejàre et al 1998 hence allowing the informed design of phb beads coated with respective peptides for metal sequestration including cd to the best of our knowledge the use of microbially produced phb beads that are functionalized with cd binding peptides for cd removal has not been reported yet this approach would facilitate simultaneous synthesis and functionalization of phb beads in one step in recombinant bacteria avoiding multiple production steps and thus removing limitations inherent to the traditional approaches moreover the use of bacteria means that the biomanufacturing processes occur at environmentally friendly conditions and that the numbers of the functionalized phb beads can be easily multiplied by controlling the bacterial growth hence facilitating scalable and sustainable bead production moreover the covalent links between the fusion peptides and the phb core would avoid leaching of the peptides from the beads during harsh adsorption conditions in this study we designed and produced phb beads displaying cd binding peptides in engineered e coli fig 1 and compared their production yields and performances e coli was selected as microbial cell factories for the production of phb beads displaying cd binding peptides due to its well documented genetic configuration hence promoting relatively easy genetic engineering moradali and rehm 2020 rehm 2010 as well as its ability to achieve high volumetric productivity through high cell density fermentation technology and scalable bioprocess unit operations which have long been established for commercial biopharmaceuticals yee and blanch 1992 the cd biosorption abilities of the beads were analyzed under different ph and initial cd concentrations the environmental safety of the produced beads was primarily assessed against a bioindicator bacterium overall we have demonstrated a cost effective method to produce functionalized and biodegradable beads in one step in e coli and that the beads function as an effective and harmless alternative for cd bioremediation

transformants were cultured at 37 c in lb medium containing ampicillin chloramphenicol and 1 w v ᴅ glucose at an od600 optical density at 600 nm of 0 6 0 8 the pha bead production was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β ᴅ thiogalactopyranoside into the cultures which were further incubated for 48 h at 25 c hay et al 2017 the cells were harvested washed and subjected to mechanical cell

followed procedures previously explained gonzález miró et al 2018 prior to sem analyses the beads were sputter coated with an ultrathin layer of platinum in an argon atmosphere to make them electronically conductive the phb content of beads was analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir perkin elmer ftir spectrometer equipped with a horizontal cell golden gate spectra data

detected in low and highly contaminated effluents or waterbodies neiva et al 2014 considering that metal speciation is affected by the ph of such aquatic systems the cd adsorption was evaluated at ph 3 5 7 and 9 the assays were conducted in triplicates per treatment for each bead type and after the exposure to metal solutions the beads were recovered by centrifugation cd concentrations in the initial solutions i e before contact with the beads and in the aqueous supernatant i e after contact with the beads were quantified by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes

evaluated against the bacterium a globiformis decomposers the toxicity of metal solutions before and after the cd binding assays was assessed against a globiformis although the a globiformis contact tests are usually applied to evaluate the effect of solid samples e g wastes in the bacteria dha iso 2016 it has been successfully used in our lab for testing aqueous samples unpublished data briefly the cd bound and cd unbound beads were resuspended in 600 µl of distilled water to achieve a bead density of 1 w v for the aqueous phase tests 600 µl of the supernatants obtained after centrifugation of the remediated solutions at the end of metal binding assays was considered at least three replicates were performed per treatment an exponentially growing a globiformis inoculum od600 0 4 was added to each test well 400 µl the kinetics of the dha assisted conversion of resazurin into the fluorescent resorufin compound was fluorimetrically followed for 1 h after adding 800 µl of the resazurin buffer a globiformis response was computed as the average percentage inhibition of dha marques et al 2018 2014 2 7 statistics a one way analysis of variance one way anova followed by the tukey multiple comparison test were performed to test significant differences of zeta potentials of all the beads for each ph tested a two way anova was carried out to evaluate the influence of the two factors i e cd concentration and bead type or no bead and their interactions on the adsorption and removal capacities of beads as well as on the response of a globiformis under different ph if no significant interaction was determined the influence of each factor was tested within each level of the other factor by the one way anova followed by the tukey test if a significant interaction was detected a similar approach was conducted except that the msresidual of the two way anova was considered for the calculation of the one way anova f and the q statistics for the tukey test quinn and keough 2002 statistics were performed using sigmaplot 11 0 and a significant result was considered whenever p 0 05 3 results 3 1 design and production of cd binding peptide coated phb beads hybrid genes were constructed as to encode two different cd binding peptides cd1 or cd2 fused to either c or n terminus of phac synthase respectively the cd binding peptide motifs had been selected based on their affinity selectivity and improved capacity to bind cd using phage display flynn et al 2003 or bacterial cell surface display systems eskandari et al 2013 mejàre et al 1998 the orientation and constraint of the peptides during biopanning studies informed on how to translational fuse the peptides to the phb synthase i e the phb anchoring domain in addition phac engineering aimed to facilitate high production yields of phb beads densely coated with peptides that retained structural flexibility to interact with cd in bulk solutions fig 1 a linker was used when fusing cd1 to the c terminus of phac to retain hydrophobic phb core formation combined with the enhanced display of cd1 peptides on the phb bead surface jahns and rehm 2009 therefore two plasmids ppoly c phac linker cd1 or ppoly c cd2 phac were constructed by inserting either cd1 or cd2 genes encoding for cd1 or cd2 peptides into the 3 or 5 end of phac respectively based on original screening of the peptides and their validation fig 2a e coli bl21 de3 harboring plasmid pmcs69 which encodes for phaa and phab proteins that sequentially catalyze the synthesis of phb precursors rubio reyes et al 2016 was transformed with each of the plasmids to mediate the synthesis of cd1 peptide coated cd1 and cd2 peptide coated cd2 phb beads respectively as a control e coli bl21 de3 harboring pmcs69 was also transformed with the plasmid ppoly c phac to produce nonfunctionalized phb beads nfb fig 2a the biomanufacturing processes revealed that production yields for nfb cd1 and cd2 beads were 7 1 8 1 and 2 0 respectively 3 2 characterization of the beads sds page analyses on the protein profiles of isolated nfb cd1 and cd2 beads indicated successful production of the respective proteins sds page of the purified nfb qualitatively showed the dominant band at 56 5 kda fig 2b which corresponds to the molecular weight of phac the fusion proteins phac linker cd1 or cd2 phac attached to cd1 or cd2 beads were also produced as indicated by the protein bands having higher molecular weight i e 59 2 or 58 8 kda figure 2b respectively than only phac the amount of cd binding peptides coating the beads was quantified to be 122 14 ng mg 1 cd1 beads and 18 19 ng mg 1 cd2 beads based on densitometry analyses fig 2c lc ms tryptic peptide fingerprinting of proteins excised from sds page gels confirmed the expected protein sequence of phac phac linker cd1 and cd2 phac table s1 tem images showed that all the beads were formed inside the recombinant e coli fig 3 upper panel indicating that the phac synthase in the fusion proteins remained fully functional mediating in vivo phb bead formation further tem fig 3 middle panel and scanning electron microscopy sem fig 3 bottom panel images showed the intact and mostly spherical morphology of the purified beads the hydrodynamic diameters of nfb cd1 and cd2 beads as determined by dls were 1708 101 1299 26 and 1146 74 nm fig 3 respectively with a dispersity ð 0 2 such variation on the size of different functionalized beads was previously observed gonzález miró et al 2018 rubio reyes et al 2016 but the associated causes remain unclear the ftir spectra of the three beads were compared with that of the commercial phb standard evidencing nearly identical spectra figure s1 thereby confirming that the beads were composed of phb the characteristic spectra of beads phb can be identified by the peaks at 1720 between 1050 and 1230 1270 and 1452 cm 1 which are assigned to c o and c o stretching of the ester group and c h asymmetrical deformations of the ch2 and ch3 groups respectively additionally the doublet between 2860 and 3000 cm 1 can be attributed to the stretching of c h bond the bands of minor relevance at around 2300 2400 cm 1 found in all spectra are likely associated with co2 in the atmosphere in general ftir spectra profiles of our beads are in good agreement with those of phb inclusions synthesized by cupriavidus necator oliveira et al 2007 considering that cd adsorption can occur through electrostatic attraction mudhoo et al 2012 we determined zeta potentials of the beads dispersed in either water or saline solution at different ph as a proxy to understand the magnitude of electrostatic interactions between metal binding active sites on the bead surfaces and cd in the bulk solution zeta potentials of the beads in saline solution were lower than those in water as the salts reduce the absolute zeta potentials fig 4 the beads were positively charged at ph 3 but when increasing the ph to about 5 beads zeta potentials decreased to their isoelectric points pi accordingly the pi of nfb cd1 and cd2 beads dispersed in water were estimated to be 4 88 5 03 and 4 70 fig 4a whereas in saline solution it shifted to 5 23 6 96 and 5 49 respectively fig 4b further increase in ph resulted in negative zeta potentials of the beads particularly at ph 9 the absolute zeta potential values obtained for nfb dispersed in saline solutions were in agreement with the values previously reported for phb beads that were designed for vaccine purposes gonzález miró et al 2018 3 3 use of engineered phb beads for cd bioremediation all phb beads were subjected to metal binding assays to assess cd biosorption capacity q and removal r at various phs and initial cd concentrations fig 5 at ph 5 q and r were either negative or zero data not shown suggesting that no beads sequestered cd at the ph close to the beads pi figs 2c and 5 nevertheless when the ph was set to 3 7 and 9 both q and r were progressively increased indicating that the beads were able to sequester cd at ph values distant from beads pi the cd removal r by cd1 and cd2 beads was in the range of 10 41 and 47 89 at ph 7 and 9 respectively reaching their highest r values at ph 9 fig 5 tables s2 s3 at which beads were negatively charged fig 4 maximum cd adsorption at ph 9 had also been observed by others copello et al 2008 li et al 2010 zahri et al 2017 since cd could precipitate at ph 9 as cd oh 2 and mislead the interpretation of biosorption mechanisms copello et al 2008 the initial cd concentration of 3 mm in a solution exposed to beads was corrected by subtracting the average amount of precipitated cd in a 3 mm cd solution not exposed to the beads in general increasing initial cd concentrations from 0 01 to 1 mm enhanced beads q fig 5 tables s2 s3 however when the initial cd concentration was increased from 1 to 3 mm at ph 7 both q and r of cd2 beads decreased under the same initial cd concentrations at ph 9 the q of cd1 beads was only slightly increased while r was decreased the decreasing trends of q and r extent at high cd concentrations suggested exhaustion of the available cd binding sites at cd1 and cd2 beads surface martins et al 2017 overall both cd1 and cd2 beads demonstrated significantly higher q and r for cd biosorption than nfbs providing evidence for successful display and functionality of the cd binding peptides cd1 and cd2 respectively in particular the cd2 peptide showed strong cd adsorption of 2 8 20 8 nmol cd ng 1 peptide compared to the cd1 peptide 0 2 3 8 nmol cd ng 1 peptide under adsorption promoting conditions i e at ph 9 for initial cd concentrations ranging from 0 01 to 3 mm notwithstanding the amount of cd1 peptide coating cd1 beads is higher 122 14 ng mg 1 bead mass compared to that of cd2 beads 18 19 ng mg 1 bead mass fig 2c which ultimately had enhanced the adsorption capacity and cd removal of cd1 beads equilibrium studies were conducted in order to assess the underlying adsorption mechanism s at ph 7 and 9 where q and r showed the highest levels fig 5 fig 6 depicts the non linear regression curves resulting from the fitting of three adsorption isotherms to the experimental data sips was the model better describing cd removal at both phs by all the beads nfb cd1 and cd2 achieving the highest correlation values r2 0 990 whereas langmuir r2 0 739 0 985 and freundlich r2 0 683 0 999 isotherms fitted only for specific beads at specific ph values furthermore the maximum adsorption capacity qmax retrieved by sips was quite similar to the average q determined for each bead variant exposed to solutions containing 3 mm cd either at ph 7 nfb 128 1 cd1 268 1 cd2 133 4 nmol cd mg 1 bead mass or ph 9 nfb 262 8 cd1 268 1 cd2 458 1 nmol cd mg 1 bead mass 3 4 are the bioengineered phb beads harmless and effective we evaluated the beads suitability towards potential environmental applications regarding their safety and efficiency for cd bioremediation this assessment was obtained by determining the effect of non exposed i e at 0 mm cd and cd exposed beads on the inhibition of dehydrogenase activity dha of the bacterium arthrobacter globiformis fig 7 tables s4 s5 a globiformis is a ubiquitous bacterium which synthesizes dehydrogenase an enzyme involved in many essential mechanisms sustaining bacterial survival e g respiration that is sensitive to metals iso 2016 marques et al 2018 2014 all the beads that were not exposed to cd were considered not toxic as they did not inhibit dha in contrast dha was significantly impaired by cd1 and cd2 beads with bound cd when compared to the outcome obtained for cd bound nfbs fig 7 tables s4 s5 this trend was particularly observed for cd1 and cd2 beads previously exposed to high cd concentrations at both ph 7 from 0 01 to 3 mm cd and ph 9 at 1 and 3 mm cd these findings consistently emphasize the remarkable ability of cd1 and cd2 beads for cd biosorption in contrast with nfbs that bound much less cd and hence were less hazardous an efficient bioremediation is achieved whenever the bioremediation agents are capable of sequestering cd to levels that reduce the ecotoxic potential of contaminated samples environments pandey et al 2009 the inhibitory effect of cd solutions after being remediated by the engineered beads at increasing ph was significantly decreased fig 8 table s6 for initial cd concentrations of 0 1 mm at ph 7 or 1 mm at ph 9 cd1 and cd2 beads could effectively remove cd since the corresponding remediated solutions were nontoxic for a globiformis considering that 30 dha inhibition is the threshold value below which no toxicity is detectable at higher initial cd concentrations both at ph 7 and 9 the beads remediated solutions remained toxic to a globiformis with over 30 of dha inhibition although nfb could apparently retain certain amounts of cd under ph 7 and 9 and consequently lower the toxicity of remediated cd solutions this was negligible as compared to the bioremediation efficiency of cd1 and cd2 beads fig 8 4 discussion the selection and expression of metal binding peptides are crucial steps in generating metal bioremediation agents these peptides should not only exhibit metal affinity but when bioengineering phb beads should also be amendable toward translational fusion to the phb synthase to enable overproduction of in vivo self assembled phb beads displaying the metal binding peptides hooks et al 2014 parlane et al 2017 besides high yield production protein engineering strategies also need to address the retention of metal peptide interactions for enhanced metal adsorption capacity eskandari et al 2013 here we bioengineered e coli as cell factories to assemble and produce novel phb beads densely coated with cd binding peptides this was achieved by selecting cd binding peptides and protein engineering approaches that retained functionality of phb bead forming enzyme phac while enabling overproduction of the peptides aligned with functional orientation for efficient cd binding figs 1 to 5 cd1 and cd2 beads showed q and r functions two times more enhanced than nfbs particularly at neutral to basic ph fig 5 tables s2 s3 moreover the cd2 beads were overall capable of cd sequestration at levels that rival those described for his rich poly peptides sousa et al 1998 cys rich peptides bae et al 2000 metallothioneins sousa et al 1998 or naturally occurring cd binding domains eskandari et al 2013 engineered for cell surface display in recombinant hosts towards cd bioremediation table s7 cd is present as a metallic cation cd2 in aqueous solution and its biosorption has been broadly associated with complexation or coordination mechanisms resulting from metal interaction with negatively charged sites on biomass or biomaterials mudhoo et al 2012 consequently ph may influence the adsorption of cd due to changes on the electronegativity and hence reactivity of binding sites as well as on metal speciation in solution phb inclusions are characterized by a phb core that is coated by several proteins at the shell rehm 2010 of which polarity hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and charge depend on both amino acids composition and ph lide 2005 therefore it was not surprising that nfb also showed a certain level of cd adsorption capacity and removal especially due to their negative charges at basic ph fig 5 however the functional peptides cd1 and cd2 displayed on cd1 and cd2 beads respectively improved cd adsorption capacity by providing additional binding sites for cd2 among the amino acids composing cd1 and cd2 binding peptides serine cysteine threonine asparagine glutamate and histidine residues have been widely associated with higher cd affinity blindauer 2011 he et al 2012 mejàre et al 1998 the engineered motifs present a high percentage of negatively charged amino acids 15 in cd1 beads i e aspartate and glutamate and or of polar amino acids 30 for cd1 and 57 for cd2 beads e g serine threonine cysteine tyrosine asparagine and glutamine under basic ph values i e above the respective amino acids pka these polar residues tend to present a negative net charge given by the ionization of carboxyl amino hydroxyl or sulfhydryl acidic functional groups khairy et al 2014 this is coherent with the enhanced negative zeta potentials of cd2 beads as compared to cd1 beads at ph 7 and 9 fig 4a which resulted in the higher amount of cd sequestered by cd2 peptides 0 088 20 8 nmol cd ng 1 peptide relatively to the cd1 peptides 0 009 3 8 nmol cd ng 1 peptide in turn the zeta potentials of phb beads at ph 5 attained the lowest values suggesting a nearly neutral surface net charge fig 4 in fact the pi of the polar amino acids composing cd1 and cd2 functional peptides is 5 lide 2005 thereby explaining the lack of cd adsorption and removal at ph 5 at acidic ph however the protonated carboxyl and amine groups provoke a reduction on metal removal due to electrostatic repulsive forces against the cationic cd2 zahri et al 2017 broadly sips was the model that better described cd adsorption by functionalized beads at ph 7 and 9 fig 6 sips is normally applied to characterize metal adsorption to heterogeneous surfaces zahri et al 2017 hence it is suggested that our beads have a heterogeneous distribution of the metal binding sites and that the interactions between cd2 and the functionalized beads were probably governed by a physisorption mechanism based on electrostatic attractions this result is in agreement with the highest q values achieved under ph 9 fig 5 at which beads showed pronouncedly negative zeta potentials fig 4 to build up a sustainable bioremediation loop two important requirements should be met first the bioremediation agents must not be hazardous per se if the end use involves their direct application into the environment we have reached this goal since all bead types did not inhibit a globiformis dha fig 7 tables s4 s5 phb inclusions can likely act as a carbon source fueling the energy metabolism that is mediated by dha in bacteria marques et al 2014 however cd exposed beads after remediation assays were particularly toxic inducing up to 60 dha inhibition at increasing cd concentrations and ph 7 fig 7 tables s4 s5 therefore a globiformis response proved that the functionalized beads had retained cd and as a consequence the toxicity of cd exposed beads demands cautious confinement of the bioremediation process for in situ applications the second requirement is that the selected techniques and agents should guarantee effective bioremediation which is usually assessed by a framework that combines chemical and ecotoxicological analyses the chemical counterpart confirmed the successful removal of cd loads fig 5 tables s2 s3 likewise the toxicity of remediated cd solutions was drastically reduced as indicated by the reduced inhibition of a globiformis dha notably at initial cd concentrations below 0 1 mm ph 7 and 1 mm ph 9 fig 8 the tested range of cd concentrations was based on the cd levels detected in aqueous samples from mine areas e g neiva et al 2014 as well as it had into consideration potential worst case scenarios of cd contamination hence at environmentally significant cd concentrations 0 01 mm cd1 and cd2 beads had also promoted cd removal 1 3 and 3 0 at ph 3 23 8 and 39 2 at ph 7 51 4 and 47 1 at ph9 respectively for cd1 and cd2 beads and toxicity reduction it is thereby strengthened the relevance and efficiency of the functionalized beads for potential environmental applications towards cd cleansing 5 conclusion we have accomplished the proof of concept in that new bio based phb materials were designed and manufactured by engineered e coli for effective cd bioremediation in particular the cd binding peptide fused to the c terminus of the phac protein i e cd1 beads retained phac phb bead forming function resulting in higher production yields and cd bioremediation performance than the cd binding peptide fused to the n terminus of the phac protein i e cd2 beads and only phac protein without the cd binding peptide i e nfb beads these innovative bioremediation agents offer additional valuable advantages since they can be synthesized and functionalized in one step in engineered bacteria through a cost effective process ready for scale up are biodegradable and completely out of the prohibiting regulations on the release of gmos moreover the beads can maintain their stability and functionality under acidic or alkaline ph which are constraining factors for successful bioremediation of metal contaminated matrices e g acid mine drainage effluents and alkaline treatment ponds of mine tailings carvalho 2017 therefore this is a groundbreaking innovation in the bioremediation arena chiefly because our platform can be further improved and or customized to target the future reclamation of other metal contaminants
