19270,the effect of iron dosing in the sewer system on wastewater treatment processes was investigated using laboratory scale wastewater systems comprising sewers wastewater treatment reactors sludge thickeners and anaerobic sludge digesters two systems fed with real domestic wastewater were operated for over a year the experimental system received ferric chloride fecl3 dosing at 10 mgfe l 1 in the sewer reactor whereas the control system received none wastewater sludge and biogas were extensively sampled and analysed for relevant parameters the fecl3 dosed experimental system displayed a decreased sulfide concentration by 4 3 0 5 mgs l 1 in sewer effluent decreased phosphate concentration by 4 7 0 5 mgp l 1 in biological treatment reactor effluent and decreased hydrogen sulfide concentration in biogas 911 5 189 9 ppm to 130 0 5 9 ppm as compared with the control system the biological nitrogen removal performance of the treatment reactor and biogas production in the anaerobic digester were not affected by fecl3 dosing furthermore the dewaterability of the anaerobically digested sludge was enhanced by 17 7 1 0 these findings demonstrate that iron dosing to sewers can achieve multiple benefits including sulfide removal in sewers phosphorus removal during wastewater treatment and hydrogen sulfide h2s removal during biogas generation therefore an integrated approach should be taken when considering iron salts usage in an urban wastewater system keywords iron salt dosing integrated urban water system sewer system sequencing batch reactor anaerobic digestion dewaterability 1 introduction several processes in wastewater management use iron salts of which ferric chloride fecl3 is the most commonly used some of the common applications include sulfide control in sewers in sewer networks fecl3 is added to decrease corrosion caused by release of hydrogen sulfide h2s into the sewer atmosphere nielsen et al 2005 sulfide in anaerobic wastewater can be removed by precipitation as insoluble ferrous sulfide fes in this process ferric iron fe3 oxidises sulfide to sulfur fe3 is reduced to fe2 and finally sulfide and fe2 react to form fes hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 phosphorus removal from wastewater phosphorus can cause harmful algal blooms in surface waters therefore the amount of phosphorus in domestic and industrial wastewater discharged to receiving waters is strictly regulated in many places tchobanoglous et al 2014b in order to achieve nutrient discharge standards iron salts are often added to wastewater treatment plants wwtp to precipitate phosphates as insoluble ferric hydroxyl phosphate complexes rasmussen and nielsen 1996 control of h2s in biogas gas generated during anaerobic digestion mostly comprises methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 but also contains trace amounts of other gases such as h2s tchobanoglous et al 2014b the presence of h2s even at low levels is undesirable as it is odorous and corrosive charles et al 2006 one of the commonly used control strategies is to dose ferric salts to the digesters leading to the oxidation and precipitation of dissolved sulfide thus preventing it from entering the gaseous phase changes in wastewater composition caused by the addition of chemicals to sewer networks can have multiple impacts on wastewater treatment plant performance hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 gutierrez et al 2010 performed batch tests to investigate the potential effects of in sewer iron dosing on phosphate removal from wastewater sulfide and iron stock solutions were mixed with oxygen free sewage to produce fes precipitates the fes containing sewage was then mixed with waste activated sludge was in a reactor the mixed liquor was aerated for 6 h with a resultant decrease in the sewage phosphate concentration and an increase in sulfate concentration the study demonstrated at laboratory scale that ferric addition can remove phosphates in biological wastewater treatment it was suggested that the fes in the mixed liquor was oxidised to sulfate thereby releasing fe that was able to precipitate phosphates in the reactor as a continuation of the above study ge et al 2012 conducted laboratory scale studies using biochemical methane potential bmp as an indicator of the effects of ferric phosphate containing activated sludge on anaerobic digestion thickened activated sludge containing ferric phosphates was combined with raw was and primary sludge in digesters to simulate real sludge process streams the digesters were inoculated with methanogenic microorganisms and operated at 35 c for 20 days until biogas production stopped the concentrations of both the dissolved sulfide in the digested sludge and the h2s in the biogas were found to be significantly lower than without fe addition ge et al 2012 hypothesised that the ferric ions that were bound to the phosphate were released under anaerobic conditions allowing fe ions to precipitate with sulfide in the digester combined these studies reveal an excellent opportunity for integrated use of iron salts in an urban wastewater system showing that iron salts added to a sewer could improve both phosphorus removal from wastewater and h2s control in biogas at a wastewater treatment plant however because all these studies were done in batch tests it is necessary to verify the applicability to a continuous urban wastewater system in addition iron rich wastewater can potentially impact much more than the phosphate and sulfide related reactions in wastewater treatment and sludge digestion therefore the potential impact of iron on other biological processes and sludge properties requires further investigation this study aims to comprehensively investigate the downstream effects of iron salt dosing in sewers on sulfide control in sewers on phosphorus removal during wastewater treatment and on h2s control in anaerobic digester biogas production it also aims to determine if iron salts dosing in sewers will have any unintended effect on the normal operation of the wastewater treatment plant two continuous flow laboratory scale systems were used to simulate urban wastewater systems each comprised sewer reactors a sequencing batch reactor for biological removal of organic carbon and nitrogen a sludge thickener and an anaerobic digester one system served as a control and the other as the experimental system dosed with fecl3 the process units in both systems were monitored comprehensively to assess the effects of in sewer fecl3 dosing on the downstream wastewater and sludge treatment processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor system set up and operation to simulate urban wastewater systems two laboratory reactor systems were established one as the experimental system and the other as a control the schematic diagram of the experimental system is shown in fig 1 the control system was identical but without the fecl3 dosing unit the experimental system consisted of two completely sealed sewer reactors connected in series fig 1 sewer reactors a and b each reactor had a volume of 0 75 l and an internal diameter of 80 mm the reactors were made of acrylic polyvinyl chloride sheeting they were completely covered with aluminium foil to prevent exposure of the sewage and biofilm to light each reactor lid was equipped with a small container filled with the same wastewater as in the reactors to prevent air entry during wastewater displacement the sewer reactors received 10 l of raw sewage per day which was divided into four pumping events of 2 5 l every 6 h each pumping event lasted for 5 10 min at the beginning of each 6 h cycle the sewer reactors were kept anaerobic and mixed using magnetic stirrers mixdrive 1 eco at all times the sewer reactor effluent flowed to the buffer tanks for sampling before being pumped to the sequencing batch reactor sbr for treatment an sbr fig 1 was used to perform the biological cod and nitrogen removal the reactor was made from acrylic with a height of 700 mm and a diameter of 160 mm giving a total volume of 14 l the working volume of the sbr was 8 5 l the sbr had a cycle time of 6 h consisting of 2 h anoxic mixing 3 h aerobic mixing approximately 45 min settling and 4 min decanting wastewater 2 5 l was fed to the sbr from the buffer tank in the first 8 min of the anoxic phase the mixing in the anoxic and aerobic periods was provided with an overhead stirrer labco 20 l stirrer the sbr was operated with an srt solids retention time of 16 days with 0 125 l of activated sludge removed in the last 5 min of the aerobic phase of each cycle and pumped to the sludge thickener ph was measured online using an inpro 3250i probe with m400 transmitter and dissolved oxygen do was measured with an inpro 6860i probe connected to an m200 transmitter with data logged by a program logic controller plc do concentration in the reactor was maintained between 1 5 and 3 5 mgo2 l 1 with an on off switch valve controlled by the plc and air supplied from compressors through stone diffusers the sludge thickener a modified settling cone made of acrylic with a total volume of 3 l concentrated the sludge before it was fed to the anaerobic sludge digester the vessel was intermittently stirred with a custom made stirrer at 2 rpm to produce the thickened sludge the anaerobic sludge digester ad was a jacketed glass reactor with a total volume of 1 3 l 1 l working volume and 0 3 l headspace thickened sludge 50 ml was fed to the ad reactor once a day with the same volume of digested sludge discharged from the reactor simultaneously giving a hydraulic retention time of 20 days in the digester a water trap was connected between the gas outlet and a gas counter to prevent any negative pressure build up inside the reactor during sludge feeding and wasting the reactor was maintained at 37 c using a water bath the biogas produced was recorded using a tipping bucket gas meter and the exhaust gas was collected in gas bags gas analysis is described in the analytical methods section the digester was continuously mixed with a magnetic stirrer mixdrive 1 eco temperature and ph were monitored with an optical probe metler toledo and logged by the plc domestic sewage used in the study was collected weekly from a residential pumping station serviced via gravity sewers in st lucia queensland australia the wastewater was then stored at 4 c to minimize biological transformation during storage the sewage was warmed to 22 1 c before being pumped to the sewer reactors the key characteristics of the domestic sewage fed to the sewer reactors are summarised in table 1 2 2 experimental design and monitoring protocol the two reactor systems were continuously operated for more than 12 months the investigation consisted of two phases namely the baseline phase i and the experimental phase ii phases in phase i the fecl3 dosing unit was not operated the two systems were operated identically until they reached stable and comparable performance before phase ii commenced on day 242 in phase ii the fecl3 solution was dosed every 6 h during the last minute of sewage feeding to the sewer reactors reagent grade ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o sigma aldrich was used to prepare a stock solution of 11 gfecl3 6h2o l 1 zhang et al 2009 the stock solution was prepared once a week using deoxygenated water and stored in a feeding bottle that was constantly mixed with a magnetic stirrer for each pumping event 11 ml of the ferric stock solution was fed into the reactor to give a theoretical concentration of 10 mgfe l 1 of wastewater this dosing rate is within the range typically used by the industry ganigue et al 2011 based on the sulfide production rate measured in the baseline period this moderate dosing rate should be below what required for complete sulfide removal thus preventing excessive presence of residual ferric or ferrous ions in the sewer effluent this is important as free ferric or ferrous ions would contribute to phosphate removal in the sbr potentially masking the effect of fes in addition to online monitoring of ph do and biogas flow rate as described in the previous section an extensive offline sampling protocol was implemented to comprehensively assess the impact of fecl3 dosing on sulfur iron phosphorus and nitrogen conversions in sewer reactors sbrs and anaerobic sludge digesters the settleability of the sbr sludge and dewaterability of the anaerobically digested sludge was also tested as summarised in table 2 the objectives and frequency of measurements are also summarised in table 2 cycle studies were also performed on both sewer reactors and the sbrs to provide further details of biological and chemical reactions in these units the sewer cycle studies involved collecting liquid samples after sewage feeding at 0 30 60 120 240 and 360 min the sbr studies were done over a 6 h duration with grab samples taken directly after feeding and every hour subsequently the grab samples were filtered as described in analytical methods and analysed for sulfide phosphate and dissolved iron to observe their dynamics in the systems the ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the sbr samples were also measured 2 3 analytical methods grab samples for dissolved sulfur species so4 2 hs so3 2 and so3 2 were prepared by filtering wastewater samples 0 22 μm millipore millex gp immediately after sampling and preserved with a sulfide anti oxidant buffer saob solution the samples were analysed within four days after sampling using ion chromatography ic with a uv and conductivity detector dionex ics 2000 keller lehmann et al 2006 phosphate p po4 3 nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and ammonium nh4 were analysed using a flow injection analyser fia lachat quickchem 8000 lachat instrument milwaukee volatile fatty acids vfa were measured using a gc agilent fid with polar capillary column total and dissolved iron concentrations were measured using inductive column plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes perkin elmer optima 7300dv waltham ma usa total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss and sludge volume index svi were all measured using standard methods apha 2005 soluble and total cod were measured using cell tests merck range 25 1500 mgcod l 1 and 500 10000 mgcod l 1 methane content of the biogas produced in the anaerobic digesters was measured using a gas chromatograph gc 8ait shimadzu japan equipped with a porapak q column and thermal conductivity detector the dissolved methane formed in the sewer reactors was measured using the protocol described by guisasola et al 2008 filtered wastewater samples were injected into a 12 ml vacuumed exetainer vial after reaching equilibrium methane in the gas phase was measured using gas chromatography shimadzu gc 9a equipped with a flame ionization detector fid the concentration of methane in the wastewater was calculated using henry s law and converted to cod units hydrogen sulfide in biogas was measured by taking 50 ml gas from the anaerobic digester headspace from this sample 30 ml gas was used to flush the headspace of the 12 ml exetainer vials containing 2 ml oxygen free buffer ph 10 the remaining 20 ml was injected into the capped vial which was placed on a shaker for 24 h to dissolve the h2s in the liquid after equilibrium the total dissolved s in the liquid was measure using ic the concentration of h2s in the initial gas sample was calculated from the total s in liquid phase at ph 10 h2s in the gas space of the measurement vial was calculated to be negligible according to henry s law dewaterability analysis was done according to wei et al 2018 sludge samples from the anaerobic digesters were centrifuged at 1757 g for 10 min the liquid was discarded and settled solids were mixed with cationic polymer until coagulation occurred with the optimum amount of polymer determined by visual inspection the sample was then strained through belt fibre fabric and centrifuged at 1757 g for 10 min the sludge cakes were placed in pre weighed crucibles and dried for at least 6 h at 105 c followed by weighing and determination of percentage solids content 2 4 statistical analysis long term monitoring of the two systems at a given sampling point fig 1 yielded two different time series one for the experimental system and another for the control system for each water quality parameter in order to determine if there was a significant difference between these two time series the data for the experimental system was subtracted from the data for the control system which yielded a residual time series consisting of differences at all the sampling times the mean and the associated standard error of the residual time series were then calculated as the mean difference and the associated standard error between the two time series the two time series are regarded to be significantly different if the mean difference is significantly different from zero through hypothesis testing t test 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of fecl3 on sewer reactors fig 2 compares the dissolved sulfide concentration in the sewer reactor effluent in the experimental and control systems see fig 1 sampling point 2 towards the end of the baseline phase phase i day 130 240 the difference between the two systems was not statistically significant 0 5 0 3 mgs l 1 p 0 05 following the commencement of fecl3 dosing in phase ii the sulfide concentration in the experimental system was consistently lower than that in the control system clearly showing an effect of fecl3 dosing on sulfide level in sewers the average sulfide concentration in sewer effluent in the experimental system was 4 3 0 4 mgs l 1 as compared to 8 2 0 4 mgs l 1 in the control system fig 3 a the mean difference was determined to be 3 9 0 4 mgs l 1 see section 2 4 which is statistically significant p 0 05 this represents a relative decrease of 47 9 4 1 these results are consistent with previous studies which also showed that fecl3 addition to sewers could effectively decrease dissolved sulfide concentration in sewage nielsen et al 2005 firer et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 the theoretical molar ratio of ferric and sulfide was determined to be 1 33 within the typical range reported in literature 0 5 2 firer et al 2008 fig 3 shows a range of key water quality parameters in the experimental and control systems in phase ii the dynamic profiles of these parameters are presented in fig s1 the sewer effluent in the experimental system had a residual dissolved iron concentration of 1 0 0 3 mgfe l 1 in comparison with 0 1 0 0 mgfe l 1 in the control system fig 3b the mean difference was significant at 0 9 0 3 mgfe l 1 p 0 05 upon addition to the sewage ferric iron was likely reduced to soluble ferrous iron the low concentration of residual fe in the experimental sewer reactor effluent compared to the dosed concentration suggests that most of the fe participated in precipitation reactions with sulfide or other anions the mean difference in phosphate concentration between the two systems was also significant 0 8 0 3 mgp l 1 p 0 05 fig 3c this was likely due to some precipitation caused by ferric iron reacting with phosphate fig s1 similarly the mean difference in scod concentration 38 4 9 2 mgcod l 1 fig 3e was also significant p 0 05 ferric salts are a coagulant and likely removed some scod e g colloidal cod from the liquid phase binnie and kimber 2013 there was no significant difference in respective tcod dissolved methane concentrations and ph levels between the two systems interestingly the difference in sulfate concentration between the two systems 1 1 0 3 mgs l 1 fig 3g was small but statistically significant p 0 05 this implies that sulfate reduction was slightly higher in the experimental sewer reactors as compared to the control reactors this contradicted previous reports that iron salts addition inhibited sulfate reduction zhang et al 2009 however the reason was not investigated further given the focus of this work 3 2 flow on effects of sewer fecl3 dosing on sbr performance fig 4 shows the phosphate concentration profiles in the sbr effluents of the experimental and control systems respectively during the baseline period phase i the two profiles were very similar with a mean difference of 0 0 0 3 mgp l 1 p 0 05 in phase ii after an initial operational period of one month equivalent to two srts of the sbr the effluent phosphate concentration in the experimental sbr was consistently lower than that in the control sbr clearly showing an effect of in sewer iron salts dosing on p removal in the sbr the average phosphate concentration in the experimental reactor was 4 7 0 5 mgp l 1 in contrast to 8 1 0 5 mgp l 1 in the control reactor the mean difference between the two profiles 3 5 0 5 m p l 1 fig 5 a was statistically significant p 0 05 this represents a relative decrease of 41 2 6 3 between the p concentrations of the sbr effluents of the experimental and control systems the ratio of the amount of p precipitated to the amount of iron added was calculated as 0 63 mgp mgfe 1 the p fe molar ratio observed in this study was comparable to the molar ratio observed by gutierrez et al 2010 which was 0 44 mgp mgfe 1 other sbr water quality and sludge parameters are presented in figs 5 and s2 the average sulfate concentrations in the two sbr effluents were 19 5 1 1 and 20 1 1 2 mgs l 1 respectively for the control and experimental reactors the difference was statistically insignificant despite the dissolved sulfide concentration in the wastewater entering the experimental sbr being lower than that in the control sbr fig 3a this indicates that the fes which is formed in the sewer reactors and was not measured in the dissolved sulfide analysis was oxidised in the experimental sbr the iron in fes would have been regenerated in this oxidation process and subsequently precipitated with phosphate as iron phosphate hydroxide complexes gutierrez et al 2010 leading to a decreased phosphate concentration in the experimental system fig 5a fig 6 a presents the sulfate and phosphate profiles of the two sbrs in a typical cycle study in both reactors the parallel increase in sulfate concentration suggested a similar rate of oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds dissolved sulfide and fes the phosphate concentration decreased in both reactors and the rate of decrease in the experimental reactor was faster than that of the control the decrease in phosphate in the control sbr is likely due to bacterial growth the additional phosphate uptake in the experimental sbr was likely due to the precipitation of phosphate with iron as described previously fig s4 shows the xrd spectrum of the sludge in the experimental sbr in addition to fes other minerals such as vivianite and struvite were found in the sludge this may be due to the partial or incomplete oxidation to fes resulting in precipitation as other minerals the sludge in the experimental reactor showed an svi that is significantly lower than that of the control sbr sludge fig 5h p 0 05 the coagulative properties of ferric ions potentially facilitated an increase in particle size and sludge density resulting in faster settling of sludge the respective ammonium and nitrate concentrations in sbr effluent from both the control and experimental systems were similar fig 5e and f indicating that the in sewer iron dosing did not affect nitrogen removal in the experimental sbr both the reactors achieved complete ammonium removal the cycle study data in fig 6b shows that both the ammonium oxidation rate during the aerobic period and the nitrate reduction rate during the anoxic period were very similar this suggests that nitrifying and denitrifying activities were not affected by the in sewer dosing of fecl3 further soluble iron was barely detected in the sbr effluents figs 5c and 6a indicating that iron added to the experimental sewer was completely consumed this is further supported by high concentration of iron 228 8 22 0 mgfe l 1 measured in the sludge in the experimental sbr fig 5d 3 3 flow on effects of sewer fecl3 dosing on anaerobic digester performance fig 7 a compares the dissolved sulfide concentrations in the digested sludge of the experimental and control systems the performance of the two systems was similar from day 165 to day 242 where the difference in dissolved sulfide concentration 0 9 0 5 mgs l 1 was not significant p 0 05 in sewer iron dosing in the experimental system started on day 242 caused a progressive decrease in dissolved sulfide in the anaerobic digester reaching a stable concentration after day 273 after stabilisation the average sulfide concentration was 2 7 0 2 mgs l 1 in the experimental digester and 23 7 0 5 mgs l 1 in the control digester fig 8 a a sulfide concentration decrease of 88 5 1 0 occurred in the experimental digester it is likely that the iron present in the experimental sbr sludge was regenerated resulting in the precipitation of sulfide during anaerobic sludge digestion thereby preventing the sulfide from entering into the gas phase the average concentration of h2s in biogas produced in the experimental system was 130 0 5 9 ppm which was significantly lower p 0 05 than that in the control system 911 5 189 9 ppm demonstrating a relative decrease of 82 3 3 7 a lower concentration of h2s in the anaerobic digester would improve the biogas quality and result in cost savings by eliminating the need for h2s removal from biogas prior to its use for power production interestingly the soluble phosphate concentrations in the two digesters was very similar with a mean difference of only 11 2 7 5 mgp l 1 fig 8g the amount of phosphate released in the experimental digester was the same as that in the control digester despite better control of sulfide in the former the total iron concentration in the digester sludge was 777 3 69 0 mgfe l 1 in the experimental system and 78 4 5 0 mgfe l 1 in the control system fig 8d the difference in the average sulfide concentration between the two systems was 21 0 0 5 mgs l 1 the stoichiometric demand for iron to precipitate this amount of sulfide is 37 mgfe l 1 which is less than 5 of the total iron available in the digester sludge it is possible the release of this small amount of iron did not result in significantly more release of phosphate ammonium concentration in the control system was significantly lower p 0 05 at 568 3 17 0 mgn l 1 than in the experimental system at 585 2 20 2 mgn l 1 fig 8f however both are still well below 1700 1800 mg n l 1 the ammonium concentration range that could be inhibitory to anaerobic systems yenigün and demirel 2013 the ph of the systems was similar and the addition of iron in the system did not affect the ph the biogas production profiles presented in fig 7b show similar gas production in the two systems during both phases of operation there was a temporary two weeks decrease in biogas production in the experimental system after the introduction of iron salts although the profiles show a decreasing trend after the introduction of iron salt dosing the trend was similar for both the experimental and control systems suggesting no apparent negative effect of the iron dosing in this respect novak and park 2010 also reported that the direct addition of iron to anaerobic digestion systems had no detrimental effects on reactor biogas production the decreasing trend in the biogas production rate can be attributed to the characteristics of wastewater that entered the system the percentage of methane in the biogas was similar in the experimental system 66 7 0 9 and the control system 68 9 1 3 and within the reported range of 60 70 methane commonly observed in anaerobic digesters tchobanoglous et al 2014a the dewaterability of the digested sludge in the experimental system was compared with that of the control system fig 8h the percent solids obtained after dewatering for the experimental system sludge was 19 4 0 2 and for the control system sludge was 15 9 0 1 the in sewer addition of iron in the experimental system caused a relative increase of 17 7 1 0 in the dewaterability of the digested sludge the water in sludge comprises both bound water and free water however the bound water cannot be removed using mechanical techniques kopp and dichtl 2001 as a conventional coagulant ferric salt destabilizes organics and colloidal particles which then enhances aggregation of particles forming larger solid particles this may have contributed to the improved dewatering properties of the digested sludge this is also similar to the effect of adding conditioners to sludge during dewatering leading to a reduction in the bound water content carberry and prestowitz 1985 thus the use of iron salts also translates into cost savings for sludge disposal through improved dewaterability 3 4 implications sewer corrosion and odour is a multi billion dollar problem world wide pikaar et al 2014 several chemicals including oxygen nitrate alkali and iron salts have been used to control sewer corrosion and odour ganigue et al 2011 while all these chemicals have been chosen for various performance and economic considerations it has been argued that their impact on the downstream wastewater treatment plants should be considered in their selection and optimization sharma et al 2012 previous studies showed that the use of oxidants such as oxygen and nitrate in sewers consumes easily biodegradable organic carbon in sewage and is thus detrimental to downstream wastewater treatment gutierrez et al 2008 auguet et al 2016 our study for the first time comprehensively evaluated the impacts of iron dosing to sewers on the downstream wastewater and sludge treatment processes the current study shows that fecl3 dosing in sewers exerts no detrimental effect on the downstream processes it demonstrates that fecl3 dosing in sewers can deliver downstream benefits through enhanced phosphorus removal sludge settleability and sludge dewaterability and decreased h2s content in biogas while some of these benefits p removal from wastewater and h2s control in biogas were hypothesised in previous studies using batch tests gutierrez et al 2010 ge et al 2012 our study is the first demonstration in continuously operated laboratory systems simulating an urban wastewater system the positive impact of in sewer fecl3 dosing on sludge settleability and dewaterability has also been revealed for the first time these additional downstream benefits will increasingly make iron salts a popular choice for sewer corrosion and odour management this study provides a strong argument for integrated management of sewer networks and wastewater treatment plants odorants in wastewater are not limited to hydrogen sulfide but also include other compounds such as volatile organic sulfur compounds one limitation of this study is that we only considered h2s as an odorant the effects of iron salts addition in sewers on other odorants should be investigated in future studies indeed higgins 2010 reported that iron forms metal organic flocs in the sewage which limit the degradability of proteins in anaerobic digestion thus increasing the odour potential of biosolids further outcomes from this study should be further verified in actual wastewater systems fisher et al 2017 followed sulfur flows in full scale wastewater treatment plants and quantified sulfur outflows to air land and ocean sinks a similar approach is recommended to follow the sulfur phosphorus and iron flows in an entire urban wastewater system including both the sewer network and wastewater treatment such a study would allow mass balance of these elements identify their interactions and determine their fates 4 conclusions the effects of in sewer fecl3 dosing on downstream wastewater and sludge treatment processes were investigated using continuous laboratory scale urban wastewater systems the following conclusions are drawn from the study dosing of fecl3 in sewers can effectively decrease the dissolved sulfide concentration in sewers addition of ferric salts to sewers contributes to phosphorus removal from wastewater in the downstream wastewater treatment process but does not influence the key biological processes involved in wastewater treatment including the nitrogen cod and solids removal processes in sewer dosing of fecl3 reduces dissolved sulfide concentration in the downstream anaerobic sludge digesters and consequently decreases the h2s content in biogas however the dosing appears to have negligible effects on biogas production in sewer dosing of fecl3 enhances settleability of activated sludge in wastewater treatment and dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge sewer networks and wastewater treatment plants should be managed

19270,the effect of iron dosing in the sewer system on wastewater treatment processes was investigated using laboratory scale wastewater systems comprising sewers wastewater treatment reactors sludge thickeners and anaerobic sludge digesters two systems fed with real domestic wastewater were operated for over a year the experimental system received ferric chloride fecl3 dosing at 10 mgfe l 1 in the sewer reactor whereas the control system received none wastewater sludge and biogas were extensively sampled and analysed for relevant parameters the fecl3 dosed experimental system displayed a decreased sulfide concentration by 4 3 0 5 mgs l 1 in sewer effluent decreased phosphate concentration by 4 7 0 5 mgp l 1 in biological treatment reactor effluent and decreased hydrogen sulfide concentration in biogas 911 5 189 9 ppm to 130 0 5 9 ppm as compared with the control system the biological nitrogen removal performance of the treatment reactor and biogas production in the anaerobic digester were not affected by fecl3 dosing furthermore the dewaterability of the anaerobically digested sludge was enhanced by 17 7 1 0 these findings demonstrate that iron dosing to sewers can achieve multiple benefits including sulfide removal in sewers phosphorus removal during wastewater treatment and hydrogen sulfide h2s removal during biogas generation therefore an integrated approach should be taken when considering iron salts usage in an urban wastewater system keywords iron salt dosing integrated urban water system sewer system sequencing batch reactor anaerobic digestion dewaterability 1 introduction several processes in wastewater management use iron salts of which ferric chloride fecl3 is the most commonly used some of the common applications include sulfide control in sewers in sewer networks fecl3 is added to decrease corrosion caused by release of hydrogen sulfide h2s into the sewer atmosphere nielsen et al 2005 sulfide in anaerobic wastewater can be removed by precipitation as insoluble ferrous sulfide fes in this process ferric iron fe3 oxidises sulfide to sulfur fe3 is reduced to fe2 and finally sulfide and fe2 react to form fes hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 phosphorus removal from wastewater phosphorus can cause harmful algal blooms in surface waters therefore the amount of phosphorus in domestic and industrial wastewater discharged to receiving waters is strictly regulated in many places tchobanoglous et al 2014b in order to achieve nutrient discharge standards iron salts are often added to wastewater treatment plants wwtp to precipitate phosphates as insoluble ferric hydroxyl phosphate complexes rasmussen and nielsen 1996 control of h2s in biogas gas generated during anaerobic digestion mostly comprises methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 but also contains trace amounts of other gases such as h2s tchobanoglous et al 2014b the presence of h2s even at low levels is undesirable as it is odorous and corrosive charles et al 2006 one of the commonly used control strategies is to dose ferric salts to the digesters leading to the oxidation and precipitation of dissolved sulfide thus preventing it from entering the gaseous phase changes in wastewater composition caused by the addition of chemicals to sewer networks can have multiple impacts on wastewater treatment plant performance hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 gutierrez et al 2010 performed batch tests to investigate the potential effects of in sewer iron dosing on phosphate removal from wastewater sulfide and iron stock solutions were mixed with oxygen free sewage to produce fes precipitates the fes containing sewage was then mixed with waste activated sludge was in a reactor the mixed liquor was aerated for 6 h with a resultant decrease in the sewage phosphate concentration and an increase in sulfate concentration the study demonstrated at laboratory scale that ferric addition can remove phosphates in biological wastewater treatment it was suggested that the fes in the mixed liquor was oxidised to sulfate thereby releasing fe that was able to precipitate phosphates in the reactor as a continuation of the above study ge et al 2012 conducted laboratory scale studies using biochemical methane potential bmp as an indicator of the effects of ferric phosphate containing activated sludge on anaerobic digestion thickened activated sludge containing ferric phosphates was combined with raw was and primary sludge in digesters to simulate real sludge process streams the digesters were inoculated with methanogenic microorganisms and operated at 35 c for 20 days until biogas production stopped the concentrations of both the dissolved sulfide in the digested sludge and the h2s in the biogas were found to be significantly lower than without fe addition ge et al 2012 hypothesised that the ferric ions that were bound to the phosphate were released under anaerobic conditions allowing fe ions to precipitate with sulfide in the digester combined these studies reveal an excellent opportunity for integrated use of iron salts in an urban wastewater system showing that iron salts added to a sewer could improve both phosphorus removal from wastewater and h2s control in biogas at a wastewater treatment plant however because all these studies were done in batch tests it is necessary to verify the applicability to a continuous urban wastewater system in addition iron rich wastewater can potentially impact much more than the phosphate and sulfide related reactions in wastewater treatment and sludge digestion therefore the potential impact of iron on other biological processes and sludge properties requires further investigation this study aims to comprehensively investigate the downstream effects of iron salt dosing in sewers on sulfide control in sewers on phosphorus removal during wastewater treatment and on h2s control in anaerobic digester biogas production it also aims to determine if iron salts dosing in sewers will have any unintended effect on the normal operation of the wastewater treatment plant two continuous flow laboratory scale systems were used to simulate urban wastewater systems each comprised sewer reactors a sequencing batch reactor for biological removal of organic carbon and nitrogen a sludge thickener and an anaerobic digester one system served as a control and the other as the experimental system dosed with fecl3 the process units in both systems were monitored comprehensively to assess the effects of in sewer fecl3 dosing on the downstream wastewater and sludge treatment processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor system set up and operation to simulate urban wastewater systems two laboratory reactor systems were established one as the experimental system and the other as a control the schematic diagram of the experimental system is shown in fig 1 the control system was identical but without the fecl3 dosing unit the experimental system consisted of two completely sealed sewer reactors connected in series fig 1 sewer reactors a and b each reactor had a volume of 0 75 l and an internal diameter of 80 mm the reactors were made of acrylic polyvinyl chloride sheeting they were completely covered with aluminium foil to prevent exposure of the sewage and biofilm to light each reactor lid was equipped with a small container filled with the same wastewater as in the reactors to prevent air entry during wastewater displacement the sewer reactors received 10 l of raw sewage per day which was divided into four pumping events of 2 5 l every 6 h each pumping event lasted for 5 10 min at the beginning of each 6 h cycle the sewer reactors were kept anaerobic and mixed using magnetic stirrers mixdrive 1 eco at all times the sewer reactor effluent flowed to the buffer tanks for sampling before being pumped to the sequencing batch reactor sbr for treatment an sbr fig 1 was used to perform the biological cod and nitrogen removal the reactor was made from acrylic with a height of 700 mm and a diameter of 160 mm giving a total volume of 14 l the working volume of the sbr was 8 5 l the sbr had a cycle time of 6 h consisting of 2 h anoxic mixing 3 h aerobic mixing approximately 45 min settling and 4 min decanting wastewater 2 5 l was fed to the sbr from the buffer tank in the first 8 min of the anoxic phase the mixing in the anoxic and aerobic periods was provided with an overhead stirrer labco 20 l stirrer the sbr was operated with an srt solids retention time of 16 days with 0 125 l of activated sludge removed in the last 5 min of the aerobic phase of each cycle and pumped to the sludge thickener ph was measured online using an inpro 3250i probe with m400 transmitter and dissolved oxygen do was measured with an inpro 6860i probe connected to an m200 transmitter with data logged by a program logic controller plc do concentration in the reactor was maintained between 1 5 and 3 5 mgo2 l 1 with an on off switch valve controlled by the plc and air supplied from compressors through stone diffusers the sludge thickener a modified settling cone made of acrylic with a total volume of 3 l concentrated the sludge before it was fed to the anaerobic sludge digester the vessel was intermittently stirred with a custom made stirrer at 2 rpm to produce the thickened sludge the anaerobic sludge digester ad was a jacketed glass reactor with a total volume of 1 3 l 1 l working volume and 0 3 l headspace thickened sludge 50 ml was fed to the ad reactor once a day with the same volume of digested sludge discharged from the reactor simultaneously giving a hydraulic retention time of 20 days in the digester a water trap was connected between the gas outlet and a gas counter to prevent any negative pressure build up inside the reactor during sludge feeding and wasting the reactor was maintained at 37 c using a water bath the biogas produced was recorded using a tipping bucket gas meter and the exhaust gas was collected in gas bags gas analysis is described in the analytical methods section the digester was continuously mixed with a magnetic stirrer mixdrive 1 eco temperature and ph were monitored with an optical probe metler toledo and logged by the plc domestic sewage used in the study was collected weekly from a residential pumping station serviced via gravity sewers in st lucia queensland australia the wastewater was then stored at 4 c to minimize biological transformation during storage the sewage was warmed to 22 1 c before being pumped to the sewer reactors the key characteristics of the domestic sewage fed to the sewer reactors are summarised in table 1 2 2 experimental design and monitoring protocol the two reactor systems were continuously operated for more than 12 months the investigation consisted of two phases namely the baseline phase i and the experimental phase ii phases in phase i the fecl3 dosing unit was not operated the two systems were operated identically until they reached stable and comparable performance before phase ii commenced on day 242 in phase ii the fecl3 solution was dosed every 6 h during the last minute of sewage feeding to the sewer reactors reagent grade ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o sigma aldrich was used to prepare a stock solution of 11 gfecl3 6h2o l 1 zhang et al 2009 the stock solution was prepared once a week using deoxygenated water and stored in a feeding bottle that was constantly mixed with a magnetic stirrer for each pumping event 11 ml of the ferric stock solution was fed into the reactor to give a theoretical concentration of 10 mgfe l 1 of wastewater this dosing rate is within the range typically used by the industry ganigue et al 2011 based on the sulfide production rate measured in the baseline period this moderate dosing rate should be below what required for complete sulfide removal thus preventing excessive presence of residual ferric or ferrous ions in the sewer effluent this is important as free ferric or ferrous ions would contribute to phosphate removal in the sbr potentially masking the effect of fes in addition to online monitoring of ph do and biogas flow rate as described in the previous section an extensive offline sampling protocol was implemented to comprehensively assess the impact of fecl3 dosing on sulfur iron phosphorus and nitrogen conversions in sewer reactors sbrs and anaerobic sludge digesters the settleability of the sbr sludge and dewaterability of the anaerobically digested sludge was also tested as summarised in table 2 the objectives and frequency of measurements are also summarised in table 2 cycle studies were also performed on both sewer reactors and the sbrs to provide further details of biological and chemical reactions in these units the sewer cycle studies involved collecting liquid samples after sewage feeding at 0 30 60 120 240 and 360 min the sbr studies were done over a 6 h duration with grab samples taken directly after feeding and every hour subsequently the grab samples were filtered as described in analytical methods and analysed for sulfide phosphate and dissolved iron to observe their dynamics in the systems the ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the sbr samples were also measured 2 3 analytical methods grab samples for dissolved sulfur species so4 2 hs so3 2 and so3 2 were prepared by filtering wastewater samples 0 22 μm millipore millex gp immediately after sampling and preserved with a sulfide anti oxidant buffer saob solution the samples were analysed within four days after sampling using ion chromatography ic with a uv and conductivity detector dionex ics 2000 keller lehmann et al 2006 phosphate p po4 3 nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and ammonium nh4 were analysed using a flow injection analyser fia lachat quickchem 8000 lachat instrument milwaukee volatile fatty acids vfa were measured using a gc agilent fid with polar capillary column total and dissolved iron concentrations were measured using inductive column plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes perkin elmer optima 7300dv waltham ma usa total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss and sludge volume index svi were all measured using standard methods apha 2005 soluble and total cod were measured using cell tests merck range 25 1500 mgcod l 1 and 500 10000 mgcod l 1 methane content of the biogas produced in the anaerobic digesters was measured using a gas chromatograph gc 8ait shimadzu japan equipped with a porapak q column and thermal conductivity detector the dissolved methane formed in the sewer reactors was measured using the protocol described by guisasola et al 2008 filtered wastewater samples were injected into a 12 ml vacuumed exetainer vial after reaching equilibrium methane in the gas phase was measured using gas chromatography shimadzu gc 9a equipped with a flame ionization detector fid the concentration of methane in the wastewater was calculated using henry s law and converted to cod units hydrogen sulfide in biogas was measured by taking 50 ml gas from the anaerobic digester headspace from this sample 30 ml gas was used to flush the headspace of the 12 ml exetainer vials containing 2 ml oxygen free buffer ph 10 the remaining 20 ml was injected into the capped vial which was placed on a shaker for 24 h to dissolve the h2s in the liquid after equilibrium the total dissolved s in the liquid was measure using ic the concentration of h2s in the initial gas sample was calculated from the total s in liquid phase at ph 10 h2s in the gas space of the measurement vial was calculated to be negligible according to henry s law dewaterability analysis was done according to wei et al 2018 sludge samples from the anaerobic digesters were centrifuged at 1757 g for 10 min the liquid was discarded and settled solids were mixed with cationic polymer until coagulation occurred with the optimum amount of polymer determined by visual inspection the sample was then strained through belt fibre fabric and centrifuged at 1757 g for 10 min the sludge cakes were placed in pre weighed crucibles and dried for at least 6 h at 105 c followed by weighing and determination of percentage solids content 2 4 statistical analysis long term monitoring of the two systems at a given sampling point fig 1 yielded two different time series one for the experimental system and another for the control system for each water quality parameter in order to determine if there was a significant difference between these two time series the data for the experimental system was subtracted from the data for the control system which yielded a residual time series consisting of differences at all the sampling times the mean and the associated standard error of the residual time series were then calculated as the mean difference and the associated standard error between the two time series the two time series are regarded to be significantly different if the mean difference is significantly different from zero through hypothesis testing t test 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of fecl3 on sewer reactors fig 2 compares the dissolved sulfide concentration in the sewer reactor effluent in the experimental and control systems see fig 1 sampling point 2 towards the end of the baseline phase phase i day 130 240 the difference between the two systems was not statistically significant 0 5 0 3 mgs l 1 p 0 05 following the commencement of fecl3 dosing in phase ii the sulfide concentration in the experimental system was consistently lower than that in the control system clearly showing an effect of fecl3 dosing on sulfide level in sewers the average sulfide concentration in sewer effluent in the experimental system was 4 3 0 4 mgs l 1 as compared to 8 2 0 4 mgs l 1 in the control system fig 3 a the mean difference was determined to be 3 9 0 4 mgs l 1 see section 2 4 which is statistically significant p 0 05 this represents a relative decrease of 47 9 4 1 these results are consistent with previous studies which also showed that fecl3 addition to sewers could effectively decrease dissolved sulfide concentration in sewage nielsen et al 2005 firer et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 the theoretical molar ratio of ferric and sulfide was determined to be 1 33 within the typical range reported in literature 0 5 2 firer et al 2008 fig 3 shows a range of key water quality parameters in the experimental and control systems in phase ii the dynamic profiles of these parameters are presented in fig s1 the sewer effluent in the experimental system had a residual dissolved iron concentration of 1 0 0 3 mgfe l 1 in comparison with 0 1 0 0 mgfe l 1 in the control system fig 3b the mean difference was significant at 0 9 0 3 mgfe l 1 p 0 05 upon addition to the sewage ferric iron was likely reduced to soluble ferrous iron the low concentration of residual fe in the experimental sewer reactor effluent compared to the dosed concentration suggests that most of the fe participated in precipitation reactions with sulfide or other anions the mean difference in phosphate concentration between the two systems was also significant 0 8 0 3 mgp l 1 p 0 05 fig 3c this was likely due to some precipitation caused by ferric iron reacting with phosphate fig s1 similarly the mean difference in scod concentration 38 4 9 2 mgcod l 1 fig 3e was also significant p 0 05 ferric salts are a coagulant and likely removed some scod e g colloidal cod from the liquid phase binnie and kimber 2013 there was no significant difference in respective tcod dissolved methane concentrations and ph levels between the two systems interestingly the difference in sulfate concentration between the two systems 1 1 0 3 mgs l 1 fig 3g was small but statistically significant p 0 05 this implies that sulfate reduction was slightly higher in the experimental sewer reactors as compared to the control reactors this contradicted previous reports that iron salts addition inhibited sulfate reduction zhang et al 2009 however the reason was not investigated further given the focus of this work 3 2 flow on effects of sewer fecl3 dosing on sbr performance fig 4 shows the phosphate concentration profiles in the sbr effluents of the experimental and control systems respectively during the baseline period phase i the two profiles were very similar with a mean difference of 0 0 0 3 mgp l 1 p 0 05 in phase ii after an initial operational period of one month equivalent to two srts of the sbr the effluent phosphate concentration in the experimental sbr was consistently lower than that in the control sbr clearly showing an effect of in sewer iron salts dosing on p removal in the sbr the average phosphate concentration in the experimental reactor was 4 7 0 5 mgp l 1 in contrast to 8 1 0 5 mgp l 1 in the control reactor the mean difference between the two profiles 3 5 0 5 m p l 1 fig 5 a was statistically significant p 0 05 this represents a relative decrease of 41 2 6 3 between the p concentrations of the sbr effluents of the experimental and control systems the ratio of the amount of p precipitated to the amount of iron added was calculated as 0 63 mgp mgfe 1 the p fe molar ratio observed in this study was comparable to the molar ratio observed by gutierrez et al 2010 which was 0 44 mgp mgfe 1 other sbr water quality and sludge parameters are presented in figs 5 and s2 the average sulfate concentrations in the two sbr effluents were 19 5 1 1 and 20 1 1 2 mgs l 1 respectively for the control and experimental reactors the difference was statistically insignificant despite the dissolved sulfide concentration in the wastewater entering the experimental sbr being lower than that in the control sbr fig 3a this indicates that the fes which is formed in the sewer reactors and was not measured in the dissolved sulfide analysis was oxidised in the experimental sbr the iron in fes would have been regenerated in this oxidation process and subsequently precipitated with phosphate as iron phosphate hydroxide complexes gutierrez et al 2010 leading to a decreased phosphate concentration in the experimental system fig 5a fig 6 a presents the sulfate and phosphate profiles of the two sbrs in a typical cycle study in both reactors the parallel increase in sulfate concentration suggested a similar rate of oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds dissolved sulfide and fes the phosphate concentration decreased in both reactors and the rate of decrease in the experimental reactor was faster than that of the control the decrease in phosphate in the control sbr is likely due to bacterial growth the additional phosphate uptake in the experimental sbr was likely due to the precipitation of phosphate with iron as described previously fig s4 shows the xrd spectrum of the sludge in the experimental sbr in addition to fes other minerals such as vivianite and struvite were found in the sludge this may be due to the partial or incomplete oxidation to fes resulting in precipitation as other minerals the sludge in the experimental reactor showed an svi that is significantly lower than that of the control sbr sludge fig 5h p 0 05 the coagulative properties of ferric ions potentially facilitated an increase in particle size and sludge density resulting in faster settling of sludge the respective ammonium and nitrate concentrations in sbr effluent from both the control and experimental systems were similar fig 5e and f indicating that the in sewer iron dosing did not affect nitrogen removal in the experimental sbr both the reactors achieved complete ammonium removal the cycle study data in fig 6b shows that both the ammonium oxidation rate during the aerobic period and the nitrate reduction rate during the anoxic period were very similar this suggests that nitrifying and denitrifying activities were not affected by the in sewer dosing of fecl3 further soluble iron was barely detected in the sbr effluents figs 5c and 6a indicating that iron added to the experimental sewer was completely consumed this is further supported by high concentration of iron 228 8 22 0 mgfe l 1 measured in the sludge in the experimental sbr fig 5d 3 3 flow on effects of sewer fecl3 dosing on anaerobic digester performance fig 7 a compares the dissolved sulfide concentrations in the digested sludge of the experimental and control systems the performance of the two systems was similar from day 165 to day 242 where the difference in dissolved sulfide concentration 0 9 0 5 mgs l 1 was not significant p 0 05 in sewer iron dosing in the experimental system started on day 242 caused a progressive decrease in dissolved sulfide in the anaerobic digester reaching a stable concentration after day 273 after stabilisation the average sulfide concentration was 2 7 0 2 mgs l 1 in the experimental digester and 23 7 0 5 mgs l 1 in the control digester fig 8 a a sulfide concentration decrease of 88 5 1 0 occurred in the experimental digester it is likely that the iron present in the experimental sbr sludge was regenerated resulting in the precipitation of sulfide during anaerobic sludge digestion thereby preventing the sulfide from entering into the gas phase the average concentration of h2s in biogas produced in the experimental system was 130 0 5 9 ppm which was significantly lower p 0 05 than that in the control system 911 5 189 9 ppm demonstrating a relative decrease of 82 3 3 7 a lower concentration of h2s in the anaerobic digester would improve the biogas quality and result in cost savings by eliminating the need for h2s removal from biogas prior to its use for power production interestingly the soluble phosphate concentrations in the two digesters was very similar with a mean difference of only 11 2 7 5 mgp l 1 fig 8g the amount of phosphate released in the experimental digester was the same as that in the control digester despite better control of sulfide in the former the total iron concentration in the digester sludge was 777 3 69 0 mgfe l 1 in the experimental system and 78 4 5 0 mgfe l 1 in the control system fig 8d the difference in the average sulfide concentration between the two systems was 21 0 0 5 mgs l 1 the stoichiometric demand for iron to precipitate this amount of sulfide is 37 mgfe l 1 which is less than 5 of the total iron available in the digester sludge it is possible the release of this small amount of iron did not result in significantly more release of phosphate ammonium concentration in the control system was significantly lower p 0 05 at 568 3 17 0 mgn l 1 than in the experimental system at 585 2 20 2 mgn l 1 fig 8f however both are still well below 1700 1800 mg n l 1 the ammonium concentration range that could be inhibitory to anaerobic systems yenigün and demirel 2013 the ph of the systems was similar and the addition of iron in the system did not affect the ph the biogas production profiles presented in fig 7b show similar gas production in the two systems during both phases of operation there was a temporary two weeks decrease in biogas production in the experimental system after the introduction of iron salts although the profiles show a decreasing trend after the introduction of iron salt dosing the trend was similar for both the experimental and control systems suggesting no apparent negative effect of the iron dosing in this respect novak and park 2010 also reported that the direct addition of iron to anaerobic digestion systems had no detrimental effects on reactor biogas production the decreasing trend in the biogas production rate can be attributed to the characteristics of wastewater that entered the system the percentage of methane in the biogas was similar in the experimental system 66 7 0 9 and the control system 68 9 1 3 and within the reported range of 60 70 methane commonly observed in anaerobic digesters tchobanoglous et al 2014a the dewaterability of the digested sludge in the experimental system was compared with that of the control system fig 8h the percent solids obtained after dewatering for the experimental system sludge was 19 4 0 2 and for the control system sludge was 15 9 0 1 the in sewer addition of iron in the experimental system caused a relative increase of 17 7 1 0 in the dewaterability of the digested sludge the water in sludge comprises both bound water and free water however the bound water cannot be removed using mechanical techniques kopp and dichtl 2001 as a conventional coagulant ferric salt destabilizes organics and colloidal particles which then enhances aggregation of particles forming larger solid particles this may have contributed to the improved dewatering properties of the digested sludge this is also similar to the effect of adding conditioners to sludge during dewatering leading to a reduction in the bound water content carberry and prestowitz 1985 thus the use of iron salts also translates into cost savings for sludge disposal through improved dewaterability 3 4 implications sewer corrosion and odour is a multi billion dollar problem world wide pikaar et al 2014 several chemicals including oxygen nitrate alkali and iron salts have been used to control sewer corrosion and odour ganigue et al 2011 while all these chemicals have been chosen for various performance and economic considerations it has been argued that their impact on the downstream wastewater treatment plants should be considered in their selection and optimization sharma et al 2012 previous studies showed that the use of oxidants such as oxygen and nitrate in sewers consumes easily biodegradable organic carbon in sewage and is thus detrimental to downstream wastewater treatment gutierrez et al 2008 auguet et al 2016 our study for the first time comprehensively evaluated the impacts of iron dosing to sewers on the downstream wastewater and sludge treatment processes the current study shows that fecl3 dosing in sewers exerts no detrimental effect on the downstream processes it demonstrates that fecl3 dosing in sewers can deliver downstream benefits through enhanced phosphorus removal sludge settleability and sludge dewaterability and decreased h2s content in biogas while some of these benefits p removal from wastewater and h2s control in biogas were hypothesised in previous studies using batch tests gutierrez et al 2010 ge et al 2012 our study is the first demonstration in continuously operated laboratory systems simulating an urban wastewater system the positive impact of in sewer fecl3 dosing on sludge settleability and dewaterability has also been revealed for the first time these additional downstream benefits will increasingly make iron salts a popular choice for sewer corrosion and odour management this study provides a strong argument for integrated management of sewer networks and wastewater treatment plants odorants in wastewater are not limited to hydrogen sulfide but also include other compounds such as volatile organic sulfur compounds one limitation of this study is that we only considered h2s as an odorant the effects of iron salts addition in sewers on other odorants should be investigated in future studies indeed higgins 2010 reported that iron forms metal organic flocs in the sewage which limit the degradability of proteins in anaerobic digestion thus increasing the odour potential of biosolids further outcomes from this study should be further verified in actual wastewater systems fisher et al 2017 followed sulfur flows in full scale wastewater treatment plants and quantified sulfur outflows to air land and ocean sinks a similar approach is recommended to follow the sulfur phosphorus and iron flows in an entire urban wastewater system including both the sewer network and wastewater treatment such a study would allow mass balance of these elements identify their interactions and determine their fates 4 conclusions the effects of in sewer fecl3 dosing on downstream wastewater and sludge treatment processes were investigated using continuous laboratory scale urban wastewater systems the following conclusions are drawn from the study dosing of fecl3 in sewers can effectively decrease the dissolved sulfide concentration in sewers addition of ferric salts to sewers contributes to phosphorus removal from wastewater in the downstream wastewater treatment process but does not influence the key biological processes involved in wastewater treatment including the nitrogen cod and solids removal processes in sewer dosing of fecl3 reduces dissolved sulfide concentration in the downstream anaerobic sludge digesters and consequently decreases the h2s content in biogas however the dosing appears to have negligible effects on biogas production in sewer dosing of fecl3 enhances settleability of activated sludge in wastewater treatment and dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge sewer networks and wastewater treatment plants should be managed

19271,during biological wastewater treatment substrates undergo simultaneous diffusion and reactions inside microbial aggregates creating microscale spatial substrate gradients and limiting the macroscale reaction rates for flocculent and anaerobic granular sludge this rate limiting effect of diffusion is often lumped in model parameters like the half saturation coefficients of monod kinetics in activated sludge models asm yet an explicit description of the reaction diffusion process with biofilm models is more common for aerobic granular sludge this work investigates whether apparent half saturation coefficients could have applications for aerobic granular sludge as well and examines the implications of this simplification to this end the macroscopic reaction rates predicted with a one dimensional biofilm 1d model were fitted with monod kinetics the results showed that the macroscale rates could indeed be described using apparent kinetics at the very least over a time scale where the microbial population distribution stays fixed however the coefficients were sensitive to changes in the microbial population distribution which can be affected by long term changes in operating conditions also the activity of organisms that compete for the same substrates affect the parameter value be that as it may apparent kinetics also depend on the operating conditions for flocculent and anaerobic granular sludge but they have still been used successfully for design and optimization therefore the last section of this work illustrates that they may also have applications for aerobic granular sludge a simple model for ammonium removal using apparent half saturation coefficients for oxygen and ammonium is applied to a full scale reactor taking advantage of the batch wise operation and on line monitoring data for regular recalibration graphical abstract image 1 keywords half saturation coefficient monod diffusion granular sludge biofilm modelling asm 1 introduction wastewater treatment with aerobic granular sludge has several advantages compared to conventional activated sludge the high settling velocity of granules enables efficient sludge separation inside the reactor itself reducing the plant footprint by 75 de bruin et al 2004 the removal of organic material often expresses as chemical oxygen demand or cod nitrogen n and phosphorus p can be achieved in the same tank because of the batch wise reactor operation and different redox zones inside granules the integration of cod n and p removal together with sludge separation in a single tank avoids the need for recycle and return pumps which decreases energy demands pronk et al 2015 the distinct chemical composition of the extracellular polymers forming the granules opens up possibilities for the recovery of biopolymers lin et al 2015 over the last two decades the yearly number of publications on aerobic granular sludge have increased by 19 per year on average fig s1 while full scale reactors have become available on the market given the increasing interest in aerobic granular sludge technology the need for reliable and user friendly mathematical models is growing so far modelling efforts have mainly focussed on lab scale systems the most popular approach is to explicitly describe diffusion of substrates inside granules with 1d beun et al 2001 su and yu 2006 winkler et al 2015 or 2d biofilm models xavier et al 2007 the reaction rate at every point in a granule is then typically calculated with monod kinetics eq 1 1 μ μ max s lim k s lim where µ is the specific growth rate d 1 µmax the maximal specific growth rate d 1 slim the limiting substrate concentration g m 3 and k the intrinsic half saturation coefficient g m 3 such biofilm models can predict spatial gradients of solutes and microbial populations inside granules and are thus useful to gain insight in the microscale behaviour yet their complexity can hinder their adoption and effective use by the industry for reactor design and optimization one important barrier is the search for reliable parameter values in literature strongly different values for microscale parameters can be found as illustrated in fig 1 for the oxygen diffusion coefficient inside biofilms a second option is to measure parameter values but easily measurable parameters such as the number density and size of granules depend on the operating conditions de kreuk et al 2005 and their changes are still challenging to predict baeten et al unpublished results finally calibration can be performed but a rational selection of a limited number of parameters to adjust is difficult with so many parameters to choose from a guideline for calibration of biofilm models has only recently been published and thus the practical applicability is still to be confirmed rittmann et al 2018 especially for granular sludge with its own particularities to develop practically applicable models the guideline formulated by wanner et al 2006 should be used a model should be as simple as possible and only as complex as needed this paraphrase of occam s razor also lay at the basis of the widely applied activated sludge models asm the primary goal of these models was to predict the macroscale behaviour of wastewater treatment plants more specifically the effluent quality oxygen requirements and sludge production henze et al 2000 these goals were deemed achievable without explicit consideration of microscale processes like diffusion even though it was known that substrate gradients can exist and affect removal rates benefield and molz 1983 hamdi 1995 matson and characklis 1976 in asm the rate limiting effect of diffusion is simply accounted for by using apparent half saturation coefficients kapp in monod kinetics these have higher values than the intrinsic coefficients k eq 1 which are the substrate concentrations at which half of the maximal growth rate is achieved in well mixed reactors with perfectly suspended cells arnaldos et al 2015 apparent half saturation coefficients increase with the floc size pérez et al 2005 because the floc size depends on the degree of mixing in a reactor the parameter values can change up to a factor 3 or more when the aeration intensity changes chu et al 2003 the size of micro colonies inside flocs also influences apparent half saturation coefficients picioreanu et al 2016 the micro colony size depends on the solid retention time among others so this is another reason to recognize apparent half saturation coefficients as system specific and variable over time for example values between 0 074 and 3 g o2 m 3 have been found for the apparent half saturation coefficient for oxygen of ammonium oxidizing organisms in flocculent sludge vannecke and volcke 2015 nevertheless all commercial modelling software such as biowin sumo and west apply them for modelling flocculent sludge processes the successful application of activated sludge models brdjanovic et al 2015 demonstrates that models for design and optimization do not need a full description of all microscale processes models with apparent half saturation coefficients instead of reaction diffusion kinetics have not only been used for flocculent sludge but also for aerobic lübken et al 2005 zhou et al 2013 anammox jones et al 2007 and particularly often for anaerobic granular sludge reactors chen et al 2015 fuentes et al 2011 kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 lohani et al 2016 it is not immediately clear why apparent kinetics are less popular for aerobic granular sludge than for flocculent and anaerobic granular sludge which indicates that the implications of this approach are not yet completely understood baeten et al unpublished results therefore this work investigates the implications and applicability of apparent kinetics for modelling aerobic granular sludge through the following three research questions 1 can apparent half saturation coefficients lump the reaction diffusion process inside granules it is important to verify whether monod kinetics are able to capture the effect of short term minutes to hours changes in limiting substrate concentrations on macroscale removal rates as they can for flocs simulation results of a 1d biofilm model were used as a reference 2 which factors influence apparent half saturation coefficients reactions that compete for the same substrates e g ammonium and nitrite oxidation compete for oxygen could alter intra granule substrate gradients and thus influence apparent half saturation coefficients picioreanu et al 2016 long term days to weeks changes in operating conditions could induce changing microbial population distributions on its turn also affecting the coefficients a 1d biofilm model was used as a reference for this question as well 3 could apparent half saturation coefficients be applicable in practice possible applications are illustrated by confronting a simple model for ammonium removal based on apparent half saturation constants with on line measurements from a full scale aerobic granular sludge reactor 2 methodology 2 1 can apparent half saturation coefficients lump reaction and diffusion inside granules 2 1 1 reference operating conditions and 1d biofilm model the operating conditions of the laboratory aerobic granular sludge reactor described by de kreuk et al 2007 were used as a reference scenario for the simulations the sequencing batch reactor with a total volume of 3 l was operated in cycles of 3 h divided in 60 min unaerated feeding 112 min aeration 3 min settling and 5 min effluent discharge with a volume exchange ratio of 50 during the aeration phase the dissolved oxygen concentration was controlled at 2 g o2 m 3 and the ph at 7 about 600 000 granules with an average diameter of 0 55 mm were present the influent contained acetate ammonium and phosphate in concentrations of 396 g cod m 3 50 g n m 3 and 20 g p m 3 a model of this reactor was set up in aquasim reichert 1994 this software comprises a dynamic 1d biofilm model which calculates the microbial population distribution over the granule depth resulting from competition for space and substrates wanner and gujer 1986 the biological reactions were described with asm2d henze et al 2000 as corrected by hauduc et al 2010 and extended with two step nitrification and temperature corrections as such a basic representation of the metabolism of ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho phosphate accumulating organisms pao ammonium oxidizing organisms aoo and nitrite oxidizing organisms noo was obtained to describe the cod n and p removal mass transfer resistance from the bulk liquid to the granule surface was neglected to model the intragranule transport a compound specific and temperature dependent estimation of the effective diffusion coefficient inside a biofilm matrix was used stewart 2003 in aquasim the granule depth was divided into 20 grid points the total reactor volume was split up into a biofilm and a mixed compartment coupled with a diffusive link exchange coefficient 1000 m3 h 1 to let the liquid phases behave as one perfectly mixed fluctuating water volume without numerical errors baeten et al 2017 transformation processes in the mixed compartment were inactivated and the biofilm compartment was chosen small 0 45 l so that it contained only 0 03 l of bulk liquid 1 of the total reactor volume this makes the contribution of suspended biomass to macroscale reaction rates negligible facilitating the interpretation of the results more details on the model are provided in the supplementary material the stoichiometric matrix table s2 composition matrix table s3 process rate equations table s4 parameter values table s5 6 and 7 and model validation results 2 1 2 calculation of apparent half saturation coefficients apparent half saturation coefficients of the growth reactions of all microbial groups in the 1d biofilm were determined for all their limiting soluble substrates table 1 using the method schematized in fig 2 in summary the method comprises an initial prediction of the microbial population distribution and then a fixation of this distribution to study the response of these granules to changing substrate concentrations analogous to the method of picioreanu et al 2016 the model in aquasim was first run with the reference operating conditions for 750 days to ensure a steady state microbial population distribution step 1 next the stoichiometric coefficients of all biomass variables were set to zero to obtain a fixed population distribution during the determination of the apparent half saturation coefficient independent from the duration of the simulations this was done because changes in the distribution are also not expected during short term changes of substrate concentrations as occur during one reactor cycle all reactions except for one growth reaction from table 1 were subsequently deactivated to avoid competition for the limiting substrate this is analogous to experimental assessments of half saturation coefficients where the activity of competing organisms is minimized by depriving them of substrates or adding deactivating agents manser et al 2005 after these preparations the granules were subjected to a step wise decreasing concentration of one substrate while all other substrates for the active growth reaction were kept available in excess 1000 g m 3 step 2 the simulation results were exported to excel to calculate the amount of biomass of the microbial group of interest by integration of the local concentration over the granule depth eq 2 2 m x t o t i v g r a n u l e x i d v 0 r x i d 4 3 π r 3 where mxtot i is the total biomass of the microbial group of interest in a granule g cod xi the local biomass concentration at a distance r from the granule core g cod m 3 vgranule the volume of the granule r the granule radius m and r the distance from the granule core m then the total growth rate macroscale of this group was calculated for every applied limiting substrate concentration by numerical integration of the local rates over the granule depth microscale and successive division by the amount of biomass eq 3 3 μ t o t j v g r a n u l e ρ j d v m x t o t i 0 r ρ j d 4 3 π r 3 m x t o t i where ρj is the local rate of the growth reaction of interest at a distance r from the granule core g cod m 3 d 1 as calculated by aquasim as the local specific growth rate times the local biomass concentration and µtot i is the total specific growth rate in a granule d 1 after every step change of the substrate concentration a new steady state total growth rate was reached as soon as the substrate gradients stabilized monod kinetics eq 4 were finally fitted to this steady state total specific growth rate as a function of the limiting substrate concentration in the bulk liquid with the solver in excel by adjusting kapp to

slim the limiting substrate concentration in the bulk liquid g m 3 and kapp the apparent half saturation coefficient g m 3 to find the other apparent half saturation coefficients table 1 only step 2 and 3 were repeated for the other reactions and limiting substrates to determine the apparent half saturation coefficients of pao an excess of the storage compound pha had to be introduced to minimize limitations by this intracellular limiting substrate during step 2 to this end the precursor vfa was fed with a high concentration 10 000 g cod m 3 to the granules for more than 2 h before changing the concentration of the limiting soluble substrate of interest as such there was time for pha to accumulate 2 2 which factors influence half saturation coefficients the factors that influence half saturation coefficients were studied by means of an example more specifically the effect of oxygen on the growth of ammonium oxidizing organisms aoo characterised by ko2 aoo app 2 2 1 influence of competition the effect of oxygen on the macroscale aoo growth rate was again determined according to fig 2 but this time the aerobic growth reactions of other microbial groups were kept active one by one during step 2 reactions number 5 16 and 24 in the supplementary material the required substrates for the other growth reactions were provided in excess to get an idea of the maximum possible interference for example the effect of simultaneous aerobic oho growth was assessed by keeping the reaction active in the model and providing vfa nhx and po4 at a concentration of 1000 g m 3 2 2 2 influence of long term changes in operating conditions again ko2 aoo app was determined with the method shown in fig 2 but this time after reaching the steady state microbial population distribution for other operating conditions in step 1 the influent vfa nhx and po4 concentrations temperature o2 set point and the granule radius were varied individually to 30 20 10 and 10 20 and 30 of their reference value for every new steady state thus obtained ko2 aoo app was determined the observed changes of ko2 aoo app were related to two measures that characterize the microbial population distribution the first one is the total aoo biomass present in the granule mxtot aoo calculated with eq 2 the second indicator was the average depth of the aoo population calculated by numerical integration in excel eq 5 5 average population depth r 0 r r x aoo 4 3 πr 3 dr mx tot aoo 2 3 are apparent half saturation coefficients practically applicable on line monitoring data from a 9600 m3 aerobic granular sludge reactor treating 14 300 m3 d 1 of sewage in garmerwolde the netherlands were used every reactor cycle starts with a feeding phase of 1 1 5 h during which influent is fed from the bottom to create a plug flow which enables simultaneous effluent discharge from the top afterwards aeration is provided during a reaction phase of 1 5 h finally a short settling phase allows the granules to stay in the reactor before the cycle is repeated details on the plant operation and performance can be found in pronk et al 2015 dissolved oxygen was measured in situ and ammonium ex situ 5 10 min interval hach lange filtrax amtax data from august 2017 were extracted from the database as average values per minute signals from the ammonium sensor during automatic cleaning and calibration of the device were filtered out a model for ammonium removal with monod kinetics was applied to the data from the aeration phases the model describes the removal rate as a function of the ammonium concentration snhx g n m 3 and dissolved oxygen concentration so2 g o2 m 3 eq 6 using a maximal ammonium removal rate rmax g n m 3 d 1 and apparent half saturation coefficients knhx app g n m

the differential equation and for calibration lsqnonlin was used in combination with multistart to find the global minimum of the sse 3 results and discussion 3 1 can apparent half saturation coefficients lump reaction and diffusion inside granules 3 1 1 effect of the substrate concentration the dependency of aerobic growth rates on the bulk oxygen concentration is displayed in fig 4 for the steady state microbial population distribution under the reference conditions figure s4 an increasing bulk oxygen concentration resulted in an initial steep increase of the growth rate followed by a slower increase towards the maximal specific growth rate this saturation behaviour could be described reasonably well with monod kinetics upon calibration of the apparent half saturation coefficient the fit for noo is almost perfect for oho monod kinetics seem the least appropriate but still the qualitative behaviour is the same this could be sufficiently accurate given the comparison is now made with another model a 1d biofilm with its own uncertainty in practice oho also only play a secondary role for the total cod removal and oxygen consumption in an aerobic granular sludge reactor given the high abundancy of pao pronk et al 2015 overall monod kinetics with apparent half saturation coefficients seem suitable approximations apparent half saturation coefficients have been used before to model granular sludge reactors for example zhou et al 2013 and lübken et al 2005 used asm3 without explicit consideration of diffusion since stable granules were already formed in the modelled reactors and no significant unidirectional changes in the influent composition or reactor temperature occurred during the studied time frame a steady microbial population distribution was probably present throughout their experiments this corresponds with our results that for a fixed microbial population distribution constant apparent half saturation coefficients could indeed be used to incorporate diffusion resistances the dependencies of the total specific growth rates on the other limiting substrates were also calculated and fitted with monod kinetics for the reference conditions figure s5 the ratio of the estimated apparent over the used intrinsic half saturation coefficient varies between 1 and 6 fig 5 this wide range can be explained by different substrate diffusivities microbial population distributions and intrinsic kinetics pérez et al 2005 for example for oho the same intrinsic kinetics were used for fermentable substrate f and vfa kvfa oho kf oho 4 g cod m 3 table s6 but the effective diffusion coefficient of fermentable substrate is lower df e20 1 6 10 5 m2 d 1 dvfa e20 2 6 10 5 m2 d 1 table s7 leading to more diffusion resistance and thus a higher apparent half saturation coefficient the same intrinsic half saturation coefficient for o2 was used for oho and pao in the 1d biofilm model ko2 pao ko2 oho 0 20 g o2 m 3 yet the apparent coefficients are different because the intragranule distribution and maximal growth rate of these microbial groups is different fig 4s finally a similar effective diffusion coefficients of o2 and nhx was used do2 e 1 37 10 4 m2 d 1 and dnhx e 1 45 10 4 m2 d 1 but the ratio of the apparent to the intrinsic half saturation coefficient of oho differs strongly for these substrates because of the different intrinsic half saturation coefficient ko2 oho 0 2 g o2 m 3 and knhx oho 0 05 arnaldos et al 2015 hypothesized that half saturation coefficients of organic molecules are more strongly affected by diffusion than inorganic molecules the results from this study show that many more factors influence the ratio of the apparent to the intrinsic half saturation coefficient apart from the diffusion coefficient such as the maximal growth rate microbial population distribution and the intrinsic half saturation coefficient the wide range of values for the kapp k ratio also indicates that a reduction of the maximal specific growth rates of all microbial groups with the same factor as applied by pons et al 2008 is an inadvisable method to account for the effect of diffusion fig 5 3 1 2 time delay when the concentration of a limiting substrate changes in the bulk liquid the rates inside granules do not immediately reach a new steady state since the formation of new substrate gradients through simultaneous diffusion and reaction takes time consequently also the total specific growth rates inside granules respond with a delay to changes in the bulk liquid for example when the 1d biofilm model was used to predict the apparent half saturation coefficients of oho for fermentable substrates an excess of this substrate was first added step 2 in fig 2 leading to a fast increase in the bulk liquid concentration from 0 to 400 g cod m 3 fig 6 upon this fast change in the concentration it took 19 s to reach 95 of the steady state growth rate for all other limiting substrates and microbial groups the rate reached 95 of the steady state value even faster the response times are thus in the order of seconds while a reactor cycle typically takes several hours on top of that sudden big changes in substrate concentrations rarely occur in full scale systems even though monod kinetics with apparent half saturation coefficients do not predict the time delay these results indicate that it can be neglected when the macroscale reactor behaviour is of interest previous work on apparent half saturation coefficients did not acknowledge that their use neglects the formation time of substrate gradients arnaldos et al 2015 but a general time scale analysis had already shown that diffusion in biofilms is faster than reactions picioreanu et al 2000 this work confirms that the time delay can be neglected for aerobic granules in particular 3 2 which factors influence half saturation coefficients 3 2 1 influence of competition the response of the aoo growth rate to the bulk oxygen concentration is less steep when other aerobic reactions are active simultaneously fig 7 a this effect is most prominent with aerobic oho growth but hardly noticeable with noo growth respectively increasing the apparent half saturation coefficient by 204 and 4 compared to the scenario without competition the decrease in the aoo growth rate can be explained by the additional oxygen consumption by the competing organisms leading to lower intragranule oxygen concentrations fig 7b when oho are active the oxygen concentrations drops below the intrinsic half saturation coefficient of aoo at locations where aoo biomass is most abundant causing a significant reduction of their total growth rate on the other hand noo consume oxygen slower and thus the o2 concentration does not approach the half saturation coefficient at these locations in summary the faster the consumption of a limiting substrate by competing organisms oxygen in this example the lower the intra granule profile of this substrate microscale fig 7b and thus the higher the apparent half saturation coefficient for this substrate becomes macroscale fig 7a interactions are reciprocal meaning that aoo will also alter the oho pao and noo activity through their oxygen consumption the effect of competition on apparent half saturation coefficients is often overlooked arnaldos et al 2015 experiments to determine apparent half saturation coefficients of flocculent sludge typically minimize competition e g by withholding essential substrates for competing microorganisms or adding specific inhibitors manser et al 2005 also reaction diffusion models that consider different reactions one by one as applied by shaw et al 2015 cannot predict this effect however using a 3d biofilm model of a floc including simultaneous oho aoo and noo activity picioreanu et al 2016 demonstrated the effect of oho growth on the apparent half saturation coefficient of nitrifying organisms in this work a similar effect was observed of oho pao and noo on the aoo kinetics in aerobic granules in an aerobic granular sludge reactor the concentration of most organic intracellular substrates will decrease during the aeration phase of a cycle therefore the degree of competition from pao and oho and thus the apparent half saturation coefficient of aoo will decrease over time even within one cycle over a longer time scale the influent composition can change and thus the average apparent kinetics can also vary between different cycles due to competition in contrast to asm there are no organisms that compete for the same substrates in the anaerobic digestion model 1 batstone et al 2002 this could lead to more stable apparent kinetics in anaerobic granular sludge systems and might justify that they are more often used for such systems but this still requires further study 3 2 2 influence of long term changes in operating conditions the response of the aoo growth rate to the bulk oxygen concentration becomes less steep for a decreasing influent ammonium concentration which corresponds with an increasing apparent half saturation coefficient fig 8 a this is caused by the aoo population shift to the inside of the granules when the influent ammonium concentration decreases fig 8b this shift can be rationalized by the decreased aoo growth when less ammonium is present leading to less aoo biomass at steady state and thus less oxygen consumption the increased oxygen penetration depth allows the population to survive deeper inside the granule the increased diffusion distance of oxygen towards the aoo is the driver for the increased apparent half saturation coefficient overall the modification of the population distribution microscale fig 8b is visually more distinct than the effect on the total specific growth rate macroscale fig 8a which illustrates that microscale processes are not always that important for the macroscale reactor performance besides the effect of long term changes in microbial population distributions caused by changes in the influent nhx concentration fig 9 a the effects resulting from changes of the granule radius b reactor temperature c o2 set point d influent vfa e and influent po4 f were investigated as well figure s6 when the granule radius increases fig 9b the apparent half saturation coefficient increases this trend had already been demonstrated with static biofilm models which assume a predefined microbial population distribution manser et al 2005 pérez et al 2005 picioreanu et al 2016 but this work confirms the relationship when microbial dynamics are included a higher long term reactor temperature causes a lower apparent half saturation coefficient fig 9c this effect is solely due to the changing aoo population distribution as a result of changing temperature because the coefficient itself was always determined at 20 c during step 2 in fig 2 when the coefficient is determined at the same temperature at which the new steady state was achieved the decrease as a function of temperature is less steep grey line this is because the short term and long term effect of temperature are opposite a short term temperature increase during which the aoo population does not change increases the oxygen consumption rate leading to lower intragranule oxygen concentrations and thus a higher apparent half saturation coefficient figure s7 in accordance with picioreanu et al 2016 moreover an increasing oxygen set point fig 9d initially decreases the apparent half saturation coefficient and then increases the value an increasing influent vfa concentration fig 9e causes a small initial decrease followed by a steep increase while an increasing influent phosphate concentration fig 9f decreases the coefficient first and then has a negligible effect no prior research was found to compare these trends to since no dynamic biofilm model has been used to study half saturation coefficients before to better understand the changes in the half saturation coefficient for different long term operating conditions the microbial population distribution was characterised for every steady state by two simple measures the average aoo population depth eq 5 and total aoo biomass per granule eq 2 a plot of the average population depth versus the value of the coefficient shows a clear positive correlation figure s8a r2 0 74 this confirms the intuitive idea that an apparent half saturation coefficient is a measure for the diffusion resistance however there is also a positive correlation between the total amount of biomass per granule and the half saturation coefficient figure s8b r2 0 85 this can be explained by the faster oxygen consumption and thus lower intragranule oxygen concentrations when more biomass is present this correlation was already found with a static biofilm model assuming a homogeneous microbial population distribution pérez et al 2005 during the simulations for this work the average depth and size of the population changed simultaneously but fig 10 shows that a multiplication of both measures suffices to explain most of the variation r2 0 96 3 2 3 implications for modelling with constant apparent half saturation coefficients among all steady state simulations ko2 aoo app varied between 0 42 and 3 04 g o2 m 3 fig 10 consequently apparent kinetics are expected to differ between plants and even for the same plant simulations of long term changes in operating conditions made with constant values should be interpreted with care and even on a shorter term the results indicate that apparent kinetics are not constant because the degree of competition can fluctuate over time e g when there is a sudden increase in influent organics the competition for aoo by pao and oho will increase however this does not mean that apparent kinetics are never useful first of all the 1d biofilm model always predicted a smooth saturation curve with increasing substrate concentrations whatever the microbial population distribution or degree of competition therefore the qualitative behaviour could still be simulated if an appropriate new set of default apparent asm2d parameters or similar bioconversion model is found based on the average behaviour of several full scale plants apparent kinetics have also been successfully used for flocculent sludge even though they depend on the operating conditions as well as discussed in the introduction furthermore also current 1d or 2d biofilm models for aerobic granular sludge reactors have lot of uncertainties for long term changing conditions for example it is still challenging to accurately predict changes in granule size distribution or microscale parameters like the effective diffusion coefficient therefore it is also not guaranteed that these biofilm models provide reliable quantitative predictions on long term finally the batch wise operation of aerobic granular sludge reactors allows on line extraction of apparent kinetics from typical monitoring data which might enable quantitative predictions after all as illustrated in the last section of this work 3 3 are apparent half saturation coefficients practically applicable the ammonium removal during the aeration phases of 100 consecutive full scale reactor cycles 24 days was simulated using a model with apparent half saturation coefficients eq 6 fed every cycle with parameter values that were estimated based on the ten preceding cycles fig 11 the mean absolute error indicates that the predictive accuracy of the model stays quite low and stable the average parameter values were rmax 549 g n m 3 d 1 knhx app 1 1 g n m 3 and ko2 app 4 0 g o2 m 3 but they showed some fluctuations especially from cycle 80 onwards these fluctuations are partly due the limited identifiability when half saturation coefficients and maximal rates are calibrated simultaneously chouakri et al 1994 but also actual changes in apparent kinetics could have occurred apparent kinetics could have changed due previously discussed reasons such as changes in the microbial population distribution or average influent organics concentration which can alter the degree of competition also changes of the intrinsic ammonium half saturationcoefficient could have occurred e g due to a decrease in the reactor ph wiesmann 1994 carstensen et al 1995 calibrated exactly the same model for a flocculent sludge plant and found apparent half saturation coefficients that were lower than the ones found in this work especially for ko2 app knhx app 0 76 g n m 3 and ko2 app 0 71 g o2 m 3 this is in line with the expected higher diffusion resistance in granular sludge systems including the bigger impact on the oxygen related parameter fig 5 even though this model with apparent kinetics neglects many phenomena it can be useful first of all the fact that the ammonium removal could be quite accurately predicted with the model provides an important insight the ammonium removal rate at any given time is mostly determined by the oxygen and ammonium concentration this fundamental insight can be less evident from biofilm models with dozens of parameters secondly the model gives insight in the rate limiting factors the estimated maximal ammonium removal rates rmax were all higher than the fastest observed removal rate dsnhx dt of 170 g n d 1 m 3 in this reactor pronk et al 2015 this indicates that the rate is limited by a too low oxygen and or ammonium concentration in the reactor the model can be used to find the most limiting factor at any time by plotting the monod term of oxygen and ammonium during a cycle as such this plant was found to be often most limited by oxygen figure s9 so an increased aeration capacity could further increase the ammonium removal rate should ammonium be most limiting this could be remediated by increasing the batch size to obtain higher ammonium concentrations in the reactor during the aeration phase however the batch size cannot be too high as well since filling and discharge occur simultaneously and the discharged liquid should not be polluted with fresh influent another possible application of the model is on line control the oxygen set point could be adjusted using model predictions to obtain the required ammonium concentration within a predefined time frame conversely if the aeration strategy is fixed the model could be used to predict how long it will take to reach a certain ammonium concentration 4 conclusions since apparent kinetics that lump diffusional resistances are popular for flocculent and anaerobic granular sludge this work assessed the implications of using an analogous approach for aerobic granular sludge for a fixed microbial population distribution macroscale reaction rates in aerobic granular sludge reactors could be approximated with monod kinetics using apparent half saturation coefficients all estimated apparent half saturation coefficients were bigger than their respective intrinsic values but their exact ratio varies strongly between microbial groups and limiting substrates apparent half saturation coefficients were influenced by the activity of reactions that compete for the same substrates and by long term changes in the influent composition granule size oxygen set point and temperature the changes of the apparent half saturation coefficients caused by different long term operating conditions could be largely explained by the product of the changing average population depth and size a single equation

19271,during biological wastewater treatment substrates undergo simultaneous diffusion and reactions inside microbial aggregates creating microscale spatial substrate gradients and limiting the macroscale reaction rates for flocculent and anaerobic granular sludge this rate limiting effect of diffusion is often lumped in model parameters like the half saturation coefficients of monod kinetics in activated sludge models asm yet an explicit description of the reaction diffusion process with biofilm models is more common for aerobic granular sludge this work investigates whether apparent half saturation coefficients could have applications for aerobic granular sludge as well and examines the implications of this simplification to this end the macroscopic reaction rates predicted with a one dimensional biofilm 1d model were fitted with monod kinetics the results showed that the macroscale rates could indeed be described using apparent kinetics at the very least over a time scale where the microbial population distribution stays fixed however the coefficients were sensitive to changes in the microbial population distribution which can be affected by long term changes in operating conditions also the activity of organisms that compete for the same substrates affect the parameter value be that as it may apparent kinetics also depend on the operating conditions for flocculent and anaerobic granular sludge but they have still been used successfully for design and optimization therefore the last section of this work illustrates that they may also have applications for aerobic granular sludge a simple model for ammonium removal using apparent half saturation coefficients for oxygen and ammonium is applied to a full scale reactor taking advantage of the batch wise operation and on line monitoring data for regular recalibration graphical abstract image 1 keywords half saturation coefficient monod diffusion granular sludge biofilm modelling asm 1 introduction wastewater treatment with aerobic granular sludge has several advantages compared to conventional activated sludge the high settling velocity of granules enables efficient sludge separation inside the reactor itself reducing the plant footprint by 75 de bruin et al 2004 the removal of organic material often expresses as chemical oxygen demand or cod nitrogen n and phosphorus p can be achieved in the same tank because of the batch wise reactor operation and different redox zones inside granules the integration of cod n and p removal together with sludge separation in a single tank avoids the need for recycle and return pumps which decreases energy demands pronk et al 2015 the distinct chemical composition of the extracellular polymers forming the granules opens up possibilities for the recovery of biopolymers lin et al 2015 over the last two decades the yearly number of publications on aerobic granular sludge have increased by 19 per year on average fig s1 while full scale reactors have become available on the market given the increasing interest in aerobic granular sludge technology the need for reliable and user friendly mathematical models is growing so far modelling efforts have mainly focussed on lab scale systems the most popular approach is to explicitly describe diffusion of substrates inside granules with 1d beun et al 2001 su and yu 2006 winkler et al 2015 or 2d biofilm models xavier et al 2007 the reaction rate at every point in a granule is then typically calculated with monod kinetics eq 1 1 μ μ max s lim k s lim where µ is the specific growth rate d 1 µmax the maximal specific growth rate d 1 slim the limiting substrate concentration g m 3 and k the intrinsic half saturation coefficient g m 3 such biofilm models can predict spatial gradients of solutes and microbial populations inside granules and are thus useful to gain insight in the microscale behaviour yet their complexity can hinder their adoption and effective use by the industry for reactor design and optimization one important barrier is the search for reliable parameter values in literature strongly different values for microscale parameters can be found as illustrated in fig 1 for the oxygen diffusion coefficient inside biofilms a second option is to measure parameter values but easily measurable parameters such as the number density and size of granules depend on the operating conditions de kreuk et al 2005 and their changes are still challenging to predict baeten et al unpublished results finally calibration can be performed but a rational selection of a limited number of parameters to adjust is difficult with so many parameters to choose from a guideline for calibration of biofilm models has only recently been published and thus the practical applicability is still to be confirmed rittmann et al 2018 especially for granular sludge with its own particularities to develop practically applicable models the guideline formulated by wanner et al 2006 should be used a model should be as simple as possible and only as complex as needed this paraphrase of occam s razor also lay at the basis of the widely applied activated sludge models asm the primary goal of these models was to predict the macroscale behaviour of wastewater treatment plants more specifically the effluent quality oxygen requirements and sludge production henze et al 2000 these goals were deemed achievable without explicit consideration of microscale processes like diffusion even though it was known that substrate gradients can exist and affect removal rates benefield and molz 1983 hamdi 1995 matson and characklis 1976 in asm the rate limiting effect of diffusion is simply accounted for by using apparent half saturation coefficients kapp in monod kinetics these have higher values than the intrinsic coefficients k eq 1 which are the substrate concentrations at which half of the maximal growth rate is achieved in well mixed reactors with perfectly suspended cells arnaldos et al 2015 apparent half saturation coefficients increase with the floc size pérez et al 2005 because the floc size depends on the degree of mixing in a reactor the parameter values can change up to a factor 3 or more when the aeration intensity changes chu et al 2003 the size of micro colonies inside flocs also influences apparent half saturation coefficients picioreanu et al 2016 the micro colony size depends on the solid retention time among others so this is another reason to recognize apparent half saturation coefficients as system specific and variable over time for example values between 0 074 and 3 g o2 m 3 have been found for the apparent half saturation coefficient for oxygen of ammonium oxidizing organisms in flocculent sludge vannecke and volcke 2015 nevertheless all commercial modelling software such as biowin sumo and west apply them for modelling flocculent sludge processes the successful application of activated sludge models brdjanovic et al 2015 demonstrates that models for design and optimization do not need a full description of all microscale processes models with apparent half saturation coefficients instead of reaction diffusion kinetics have not only been used for flocculent sludge but also for aerobic lübken et al 2005 zhou et al 2013 anammox jones et al 2007 and particularly often for anaerobic granular sludge reactors chen et al 2015 fuentes et al 2011 kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 lohani et al 2016 it is not immediately clear why apparent kinetics are less popular for aerobic granular sludge than for flocculent and anaerobic granular sludge which indicates that the implications of this approach are not yet completely understood baeten et al unpublished results therefore this work investigates the implications and applicability of apparent kinetics for modelling aerobic granular sludge through the following three research questions 1 can apparent half saturation coefficients lump the reaction diffusion process inside granules it is important to verify whether monod kinetics are able to capture the effect of short term minutes to hours changes in limiting substrate concentrations on macroscale removal rates as they can for flocs simulation results of a 1d biofilm model were used as a reference 2 which factors influence apparent half saturation coefficients reactions that compete for the same substrates e g ammonium and nitrite oxidation compete for oxygen could alter intra granule substrate gradients and thus influence apparent half saturation coefficients picioreanu et al 2016 long term days to weeks changes in operating conditions could induce changing microbial population distributions on its turn also affecting the coefficients a 1d biofilm model was used as a reference for this question as well 3 could apparent half saturation coefficients be applicable in practice possible applications are illustrated by confronting a simple model for ammonium removal based on apparent half saturation constants with on line measurements from a full scale aerobic granular sludge reactor 2 methodology 2 1 can apparent half saturation coefficients lump reaction and diffusion inside granules 2 1 1 reference operating conditions and 1d biofilm model the operating conditions of the laboratory aerobic granular sludge reactor described by de kreuk et al 2007 were used as a reference scenario for the simulations the sequencing batch reactor with a total volume of 3 l was operated in cycles of 3 h divided in 60 min unaerated feeding 112 min aeration 3 min settling and 5 min effluent discharge with a volume exchange ratio of 50 during the aeration phase the dissolved oxygen concentration was controlled at 2 g o2 m 3 and the ph at 7 about 600 000 granules with an average diameter of 0 55 mm were present the influent contained acetate ammonium and phosphate in concentrations of 396 g cod m 3 50 g n m 3 and 20 g p m 3 a model of this reactor was set up in aquasim reichert 1994 this software comprises a dynamic 1d biofilm model which calculates the microbial population distribution over the granule depth resulting from competition for space and substrates wanner and gujer 1986 the biological reactions were described with asm2d henze et al 2000 as corrected by hauduc et al 2010 and extended with two step nitrification and temperature corrections as such a basic representation of the metabolism of ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho phosphate accumulating organisms pao ammonium oxidizing organisms aoo and nitrite oxidizing organisms noo was obtained to describe the cod n and p removal mass transfer resistance from the bulk liquid to the granule surface was neglected to model the intragranule transport a compound specific and temperature dependent estimation of the effective diffusion coefficient inside a biofilm matrix was used stewart 2003 in aquasim the granule depth was divided into 20 grid points the total reactor volume was split up into a biofilm and a mixed compartment coupled with a diffusive link exchange coefficient 1000 m3 h 1 to let the liquid phases behave as one perfectly mixed fluctuating water volume without numerical errors baeten et al 2017 transformation processes in the mixed compartment were inactivated and the biofilm compartment was chosen small 0 45 l so that it contained only 0 03 l of bulk liquid 1 of the total reactor volume this makes the contribution of suspended biomass to macroscale reaction rates negligible facilitating the interpretation of the results more details on the model are provided in the supplementary material the stoichiometric matrix table s2 composition matrix table s3 process rate equations table s4 parameter values table s5 6 and 7 and model validation results 2 1 2 calculation of apparent half saturation coefficients apparent half saturation coefficients of the growth reactions of all microbial groups in the 1d biofilm were determined for all their limiting soluble substrates table 1 using the method schematized in fig 2 in summary the method comprises an initial prediction of the microbial population distribution and then a fixation of this distribution to study the response of these granules to changing substrate concentrations analogous to the method of picioreanu et al 2016 the model in aquasim was first run with the reference operating conditions for 750 days to ensure a steady state microbial population distribution step 1 next the stoichiometric coefficients of all biomass variables were set to zero to obtain a fixed population distribution during the determination of the apparent half saturation coefficient independent from the duration of the simulations this was done because changes in the distribution are also not expected during short term changes of substrate concentrations as occur during one reactor cycle all reactions except for one growth reaction from table 1 were subsequently deactivated to avoid competition for the limiting substrate this is analogous to experimental assessments of half saturation coefficients where the activity of competing organisms is minimized by depriving them of substrates or adding deactivating agents manser et al 2005 after these preparations the granules were subjected to a step wise decreasing concentration of one substrate while all other substrates for the active growth reaction were kept available in excess 1000 g m 3 step 2 the simulation results were exported to excel to calculate the amount of biomass of the microbial group of interest by integration of the local concentration over the granule depth eq 2 2 m x t o t i v g r a n u l e x i d v 0 r x i d 4 3 π r 3 where mxtot i is the total biomass of the microbial group of interest in a granule g cod xi the local biomass concentration at a distance r from the granule core g cod m 3 vgranule the volume of the granule r the granule radius m and r the distance from the granule core m then the total growth rate macroscale of this group was calculated for every applied limiting substrate concentration by numerical integration of the local rates over the granule depth microscale and successive division by the amount of biomass eq 3 3 μ t o t j v g r a n u l e ρ j d v m x t o t i 0 r ρ j d 4 3 π r 3 m x t o t i where ρj is the local rate of the growth reaction of interest at a distance r from the granule core g cod m 3 d 1 as calculated by aquasim as the local specific growth rate times the local biomass concentration and µtot i is the total specific growth rate in a granule d 1 after every step change of the substrate concentration a new steady state total growth rate was reached as soon as the substrate gradients stabilized monod kinetics eq 4 were finally fitted to this steady state total specific growth rate as a function of the limiting substrate concentration in the bulk liquid with the solver in excel by adjusting kapp to

slim the limiting substrate concentration in the bulk liquid g m 3 and kapp the apparent half saturation coefficient g m 3 to find the other apparent half saturation coefficients table 1 only step 2 and 3 were repeated for the other reactions and limiting substrates to determine the apparent half saturation coefficients of pao an excess of the storage compound pha had to be introduced to minimize limitations by this intracellular limiting substrate during step 2 to this end the precursor vfa was fed with a high concentration 10 000 g cod m 3 to the granules for more than 2 h before changing the concentration of the limiting soluble substrate of interest as such there was time for pha to accumulate 2 2 which factors influence half saturation coefficients the factors that influence half saturation coefficients were studied by means of an example more specifically the effect of oxygen on the growth of ammonium oxidizing organisms aoo characterised by ko2 aoo app 2 2 1 influence of competition the effect of oxygen on the macroscale aoo growth rate was again determined according to fig 2 but this time the aerobic growth reactions of other microbial groups were kept active one by one during step 2 reactions number 5 16 and 24 in the supplementary material the required substrates for the other growth reactions were provided in excess to get an idea of the maximum possible interference for example the effect of simultaneous aerobic oho growth was assessed by keeping the reaction active in the model and providing vfa nhx and po4 at a concentration of 1000 g m 3 2 2 2 influence of long term changes in operating conditions again ko2 aoo app was determined with the method shown in fig 2 but this time after reaching the steady state microbial population distribution for other operating conditions in step 1 the influent vfa nhx and po4 concentrations temperature o2 set point and the granule radius were varied individually to 30 20 10 and 10 20 and 30 of their reference value for every new steady state thus obtained ko2 aoo app was determined the observed changes of ko2 aoo app were related to two measures that characterize the microbial population distribution the first one is the total aoo biomass present in the granule mxtot aoo calculated with eq 2 the second indicator was the average depth of the aoo population calculated by numerical integration in excel eq 5 5 average population depth r 0 r r x aoo 4 3 πr 3 dr mx tot aoo 2 3 are apparent half saturation coefficients practically applicable on line monitoring data from a 9600 m3 aerobic granular sludge reactor treating 14 300 m3 d 1 of sewage in garmerwolde the netherlands were used every reactor cycle starts with a feeding phase of 1 1 5 h during which influent is fed from the bottom to create a plug flow which enables simultaneous effluent discharge from the top afterwards aeration is provided during a reaction phase of 1 5 h finally a short settling phase allows the granules to stay in the reactor before the cycle is repeated details on the plant operation and performance can be found in pronk et al 2015 dissolved oxygen was measured in situ and ammonium ex situ 5 10 min interval hach lange filtrax amtax data from august 2017 were extracted from the database as average values per minute signals from the ammonium sensor during automatic cleaning and calibration of the device were filtered out a model for ammonium removal with monod kinetics was applied to the data from the aeration phases the model describes the removal rate as a function of the ammonium concentration snhx g n m 3 and dissolved oxygen concentration so2 g o2 m 3 eq 6 using a maximal ammonium removal rate rmax g n m 3 d 1 and apparent half saturation coefficients knhx app g n m

the differential equation and for calibration lsqnonlin was used in combination with multistart to find the global minimum of the sse 3 results and discussion 3 1 can apparent half saturation coefficients lump reaction and diffusion inside granules 3 1 1 effect of the substrate concentration the dependency of aerobic growth rates on the bulk oxygen concentration is displayed in fig 4 for the steady state microbial population distribution under the reference conditions figure s4 an increasing bulk oxygen concentration resulted in an initial steep increase of the growth rate followed by a slower increase towards the maximal specific growth rate this saturation behaviour could be described reasonably well with monod kinetics upon calibration of the apparent half saturation coefficient the fit for noo is almost perfect for oho monod kinetics seem the least appropriate but still the qualitative behaviour is the same this could be sufficiently accurate given the comparison is now made with another model a 1d biofilm with its own uncertainty in practice oho also only play a secondary role for the total cod removal and oxygen consumption in an aerobic granular sludge reactor given the high abundancy of pao pronk et al 2015 overall monod kinetics with apparent half saturation coefficients seem suitable approximations apparent half saturation coefficients have been used before to model granular sludge reactors for example zhou et al 2013 and lübken et al 2005 used asm3 without explicit consideration of diffusion since stable granules were already formed in the modelled reactors and no significant unidirectional changes in the influent composition or reactor temperature occurred during the studied time frame a steady microbial population distribution was probably present throughout their experiments this corresponds with our results that for a fixed microbial population distribution constant apparent half saturation coefficients could indeed be used to incorporate diffusion resistances the dependencies of the total specific growth rates on the other limiting substrates were also calculated and fitted with monod kinetics for the reference conditions figure s5 the ratio of the estimated apparent over the used intrinsic half saturation coefficient varies between 1 and 6 fig 5 this wide range can be explained by different substrate diffusivities microbial population distributions and intrinsic kinetics pérez et al 2005 for example for oho the same intrinsic kinetics were used for fermentable substrate f and vfa kvfa oho kf oho 4 g cod m 3 table s6 but the effective diffusion coefficient of fermentable substrate is lower df e20 1 6 10 5 m2 d 1 dvfa e20 2 6 10 5 m2 d 1 table s7 leading to more diffusion resistance and thus a higher apparent half saturation coefficient the same intrinsic half saturation coefficient for o2 was used for oho and pao in the 1d biofilm model ko2 pao ko2 oho 0 20 g o2 m 3 yet the apparent coefficients are different because the intragranule distribution and maximal growth rate of these microbial groups is different fig 4s finally a similar effective diffusion coefficients of o2 and nhx was used do2 e 1 37 10 4 m2 d 1 and dnhx e 1 45 10 4 m2 d 1 but the ratio of the apparent to the intrinsic half saturation coefficient of oho differs strongly for these substrates because of the different intrinsic half saturation coefficient ko2 oho 0 2 g o2 m 3 and knhx oho 0 05 arnaldos et al 2015 hypothesized that half saturation coefficients of organic molecules are more strongly affected by diffusion than inorganic molecules the results from this study show that many more factors influence the ratio of the apparent to the intrinsic half saturation coefficient apart from the diffusion coefficient such as the maximal growth rate microbial population distribution and the intrinsic half saturation coefficient the wide range of values for the kapp k ratio also indicates that a reduction of the maximal specific growth rates of all microbial groups with the same factor as applied by pons et al 2008 is an inadvisable method to account for the effect of diffusion fig 5 3 1 2 time delay when the concentration of a limiting substrate changes in the bulk liquid the rates inside granules do not immediately reach a new steady state since the formation of new substrate gradients through simultaneous diffusion and reaction takes time consequently also the total specific growth rates inside granules respond with a delay to changes in the bulk liquid for example when the 1d biofilm model was used to predict the apparent half saturation coefficients of oho for fermentable substrates an excess of this substrate was first added step 2 in fig 2 leading to a fast increase in the bulk liquid concentration from 0 to 400 g cod m 3 fig 6 upon this fast change in the concentration it took 19 s to reach 95 of the steady state growth rate for all other limiting substrates and microbial groups the rate reached 95 of the steady state value even faster the response times are thus in the order of seconds while a reactor cycle typically takes several hours on top of that sudden big changes in substrate concentrations rarely occur in full scale systems even though monod kinetics with apparent half saturation coefficients do not predict the time delay these results indicate that it can be neglected when the macroscale reactor behaviour is of interest previous work on apparent half saturation coefficients did not acknowledge that their use neglects the formation time of substrate gradients arnaldos et al 2015 but a general time scale analysis had already shown that diffusion in biofilms is faster than reactions picioreanu et al 2000 this work confirms that the time delay can be neglected for aerobic granules in particular 3 2 which factors influence half saturation coefficients 3 2 1 influence of competition the response of the aoo growth rate to the bulk oxygen concentration is less steep when other aerobic reactions are active simultaneously fig 7 a this effect is most prominent with aerobic oho growth but hardly noticeable with noo growth respectively increasing the apparent half saturation coefficient by 204 and 4 compared to the scenario without competition the decrease in the aoo growth rate can be explained by the additional oxygen consumption by the competing organisms leading to lower intragranule oxygen concentrations fig 7b when oho are active the oxygen concentrations drops below the intrinsic half saturation coefficient of aoo at locations where aoo biomass is most abundant causing a significant reduction of their total growth rate on the other hand noo consume oxygen slower and thus the o2 concentration does not approach the half saturation coefficient at these locations in summary the faster the consumption of a limiting substrate by competing organisms oxygen in this example the lower the intra granule profile of this substrate microscale fig 7b and thus the higher the apparent half saturation coefficient for this substrate becomes macroscale fig 7a interactions are reciprocal meaning that aoo will also alter the oho pao and noo activity through their oxygen consumption the effect of competition on apparent half saturation coefficients is often overlooked arnaldos et al 2015 experiments to determine apparent half saturation coefficients of flocculent sludge typically minimize competition e g by withholding essential substrates for competing microorganisms or adding specific inhibitors manser et al 2005 also reaction diffusion models that consider different reactions one by one as applied by shaw et al 2015 cannot predict this effect however using a 3d biofilm model of a floc including simultaneous oho aoo and noo activity picioreanu et al 2016 demonstrated the effect of oho growth on the apparent half saturation coefficient of nitrifying organisms in this work a similar effect was observed of oho pao and noo on the aoo kinetics in aerobic granules in an aerobic granular sludge reactor the concentration of most organic intracellular substrates will decrease during the aeration phase of a cycle therefore the degree of competition from pao and oho and thus the apparent half saturation coefficient of aoo will decrease over time even within one cycle over a longer time scale the influent composition can change and thus the average apparent kinetics can also vary between different cycles due to competition in contrast to asm there are no organisms that compete for the same substrates in the anaerobic digestion model 1 batstone et al 2002 this could lead to more stable apparent kinetics in anaerobic granular sludge systems and might justify that they are more often used for such systems but this still requires further study 3 2 2 influence of long term changes in operating conditions the response of the aoo growth rate to the bulk oxygen concentration becomes less steep for a decreasing influent ammonium concentration which corresponds with an increasing apparent half saturation coefficient fig 8 a this is caused by the aoo population shift to the inside of the granules when the influent ammonium concentration decreases fig 8b this shift can be rationalized by the decreased aoo growth when less ammonium is present leading to less aoo biomass at steady state and thus less oxygen consumption the increased oxygen penetration depth allows the population to survive deeper inside the granule the increased diffusion distance of oxygen towards the aoo is the driver for the increased apparent half saturation coefficient overall the modification of the population distribution microscale fig 8b is visually more distinct than the effect on the total specific growth rate macroscale fig 8a which illustrates that microscale processes are not always that important for the macroscale reactor performance besides the effect of long term changes in microbial population distributions caused by changes in the influent nhx concentration fig 9 a the effects resulting from changes of the granule radius b reactor temperature c o2 set point d influent vfa e and influent po4 f were investigated as well figure s6 when the granule radius increases fig 9b the apparent half saturation coefficient increases this trend had already been demonstrated with static biofilm models which assume a predefined microbial population distribution manser et al 2005 pérez et al 2005 picioreanu et al 2016 but this work confirms the relationship when microbial dynamics are included a higher long term reactor temperature causes a lower apparent half saturation coefficient fig 9c this effect is solely due to the changing aoo population distribution as a result of changing temperature because the coefficient itself was always determined at 20 c during step 2 in fig 2 when the coefficient is determined at the same temperature at which the new steady state was achieved the decrease as a function of temperature is less steep grey line this is because the short term and long term effect of temperature are opposite a short term temperature increase during which the aoo population does not change increases the oxygen consumption rate leading to lower intragranule oxygen concentrations and thus a higher apparent half saturation coefficient figure s7 in accordance with picioreanu et al 2016 moreover an increasing oxygen set point fig 9d initially decreases the apparent half saturation coefficient and then increases the value an increasing influent vfa concentration fig 9e causes a small initial decrease followed by a steep increase while an increasing influent phosphate concentration fig 9f decreases the coefficient first and then has a negligible effect no prior research was found to compare these trends to since no dynamic biofilm model has been used to study half saturation coefficients before to better understand the changes in the half saturation coefficient for different long term operating conditions the microbial population distribution was characterised for every steady state by two simple measures the average aoo population depth eq 5 and total aoo biomass per granule eq 2 a plot of the average population depth versus the value of the coefficient shows a clear positive correlation figure s8a r2 0 74 this confirms the intuitive idea that an apparent half saturation coefficient is a measure for the diffusion resistance however there is also a positive correlation between the total amount of biomass per granule and the half saturation coefficient figure s8b r2 0 85 this can be explained by the faster oxygen consumption and thus lower intragranule oxygen concentrations when more biomass is present this correlation was already found with a static biofilm model assuming a homogeneous microbial population distribution pérez et al 2005 during the simulations for this work the average depth and size of the population changed simultaneously but fig 10 shows that a multiplication of both measures suffices to explain most of the variation r2 0 96 3 2 3 implications for modelling with constant apparent half saturation coefficients among all steady state simulations ko2 aoo app varied between 0 42 and 3 04 g o2 m 3 fig 10 consequently apparent kinetics are expected to differ between plants and even for the same plant simulations of long term changes in operating conditions made with constant values should be interpreted with care and even on a shorter term the results indicate that apparent kinetics are not constant because the degree of competition can fluctuate over time e g when there is a sudden increase in influent organics the competition for aoo by pao and oho will increase however this does not mean that apparent kinetics are never useful first of all the 1d biofilm model always predicted a smooth saturation curve with increasing substrate concentrations whatever the microbial population distribution or degree of competition therefore the qualitative behaviour could still be simulated if an appropriate new set of default apparent asm2d parameters or similar bioconversion model is found based on the average behaviour of several full scale plants apparent kinetics have also been successfully used for flocculent sludge even though they depend on the operating conditions as well as discussed in the introduction furthermore also current 1d or 2d biofilm models for aerobic granular sludge reactors have lot of uncertainties for long term changing conditions for example it is still challenging to accurately predict changes in granule size distribution or microscale parameters like the effective diffusion coefficient therefore it is also not guaranteed that these biofilm models provide reliable quantitative predictions on long term finally the batch wise operation of aerobic granular sludge reactors allows on line extraction of apparent kinetics from typical monitoring data which might enable quantitative predictions after all as illustrated in the last section of this work 3 3 are apparent half saturation coefficients practically applicable the ammonium removal during the aeration phases of 100 consecutive full scale reactor cycles 24 days was simulated using a model with apparent half saturation coefficients eq 6 fed every cycle with parameter values that were estimated based on the ten preceding cycles fig 11 the mean absolute error indicates that the predictive accuracy of the model stays quite low and stable the average parameter values were rmax 549 g n m 3 d 1 knhx app 1 1 g n m 3 and ko2 app 4 0 g o2 m 3 but they showed some fluctuations especially from cycle 80 onwards these fluctuations are partly due the limited identifiability when half saturation coefficients and maximal rates are calibrated simultaneously chouakri et al 1994 but also actual changes in apparent kinetics could have occurred apparent kinetics could have changed due previously discussed reasons such as changes in the microbial population distribution or average influent organics concentration which can alter the degree of competition also changes of the intrinsic ammonium half saturationcoefficient could have occurred e g due to a decrease in the reactor ph wiesmann 1994 carstensen et al 1995 calibrated exactly the same model for a flocculent sludge plant and found apparent half saturation coefficients that were lower than the ones found in this work especially for ko2 app knhx app 0 76 g n m 3 and ko2 app 0 71 g o2 m 3 this is in line with the expected higher diffusion resistance in granular sludge systems including the bigger impact on the oxygen related parameter fig 5 even though this model with apparent kinetics neglects many phenomena it can be useful first of all the fact that the ammonium removal could be quite accurately predicted with the model provides an important insight the ammonium removal rate at any given time is mostly determined by the oxygen and ammonium concentration this fundamental insight can be less evident from biofilm models with dozens of parameters secondly the model gives insight in the rate limiting factors the estimated maximal ammonium removal rates rmax were all higher than the fastest observed removal rate dsnhx dt of 170 g n d 1 m 3 in this reactor pronk et al 2015 this indicates that the rate is limited by a too low oxygen and or ammonium concentration in the reactor the model can be used to find the most limiting factor at any time by plotting the monod term of oxygen and ammonium during a cycle as such this plant was found to be often most limited by oxygen figure s9 so an increased aeration capacity could further increase the ammonium removal rate should ammonium be most limiting this could be remediated by increasing the batch size to obtain higher ammonium concentrations in the reactor during the aeration phase however the batch size cannot be too high as well since filling and discharge occur simultaneously and the discharged liquid should not be polluted with fresh influent another possible application of the model is on line control the oxygen set point could be adjusted using model predictions to obtain the required ammonium concentration within a predefined time frame conversely if the aeration strategy is fixed the model could be used to predict how long it will take to reach a certain ammonium concentration 4 conclusions since apparent kinetics that lump diffusional resistances are popular for flocculent and anaerobic granular sludge this work assessed the implications of using an analogous approach for aerobic granular sludge for a fixed microbial population distribution macroscale reaction rates in aerobic granular sludge reactors could be approximated with monod kinetics using apparent half saturation coefficients all estimated apparent half saturation coefficients were bigger than their respective intrinsic values but their exact ratio varies strongly between microbial groups and limiting substrates apparent half saturation coefficients were influenced by the activity of reactions that compete for the same substrates and by long term changes in the influent composition granule size oxygen set point and temperature the changes of the apparent half saturation coefficients caused by different long term operating conditions could be largely explained by the product of the changing average population depth and size a single equation model describing ammonium removal based on apparent kinetics could be calibrated using typical monitoring data from a full scale plant and offers perspectives for process control and identifying the

19272,the origin and composition of dissolved organic matter dom in porewater of lake sediments is intricate and decisive for fate of pollutants including mercury hg while there are many reports on the relationship between dissolved organic carbon concentration doc and mercury hg concentrations in aquatic systems there are few in which dom compositional properties that may better explain the fate of hg have been the focus in this study porewaters from sediments of three lakes caihai lake ch hongfeng lake hf and wujiangdu lake wjd all located in southwest china were selected to test the

autochthonous and allochthonous dom mixing model was used to unveil the origin of dom in porewaters of the three lakes our results show a higher input of terrestrial dom in the pristine lake ch as compared to lakes hf and wjd lakes which were both influenced by urban environments and enriched in autochthonous dom while the relationships between the concentrations of doc and the different chemical forms of hg forms were quite inconsistent we found important links between specific dom components and the fate of hg in the three lakes in particular our results suggest that allochthonous terrestrial dom inhibits hg ii availability for hg methylating micro organisms in contrast autochthonous dom seems to have been stimulated mehg formation likely by enhancing the activity of microbial communities indeed dom biodegradation experiments revealed that differences in the microbial activity could explain the variation in the concentration of mehg while relationships between concentrations of doc and hg vary among different sites and provide little information about hg cycling we conclude that the transport and transformation of hg e g the methylation process are more

2011 2012 jonsson et al 2012 2014 zhang et al 2012 2014 the hg mobilization speciation and methylation have been widely studied across various environments skyllberg 2008 2012 graham et al 2012 2013 of all the biogeochemical variables affecting hg transformations dom is one of the most important factors aiken et al 2011a ravichandran 2004 gerbig et al 2012 bravo et al 2017 herrero ortega et al 2017 there are many reports on the interactions and correlations between dom and hg and comprehensive reviews are available elsewhere ravichandran 2004 aiken et al 2011a b skyllberg 2012 gerbig et al

is attributed to the disintegration or dissolution of hgs minerals waples et al 2005 resulting in enhanced hg ii bioavailability to methylating bacteria gerbig et al 2011 graham et al 2012 2013 in contrast chemisorption to dom functional groups may limit hg ii bioavailability for methylating microorganisms when the molecular size of dom is too large to cross the bacterial cell membranes hammerschmidt and fitzgerald 2004 hammerschmidt et al 2008 recent studies schartup et al 2013 chiasson gould et al 2014 bravo et al 2017 herrero ortega et al 2017 lescord et al 2018 noh et al 2018 demonstrate that differences in the composition of dom may largely explain the variability in hg methylation indeed it is known that specific dom components regulate speciation and dynamics of hg through numerous mechanisms including chemical complex formation ravichandran 2004 skyllberg 2008 2012 redox processes gu et al 2010 and microbial activity bravo et al 2017 thus all the mentioned studies underscore the complexity of the interactions between hg and dom and more importantly highlight the potential to perform comprehensive studies to identify the hg risk especially the mehg net production in the environment using dom composition despite the recently highlighted importance of dom composition and quantity environmental biogeochemical studies of hg still poorly or incompletely take dom characterization into account especially outside the boreal zone here we use the variability in dom characteristics to improve our understanding about how concentrations of dom and hg may be related or not related at different study sites in subtropical china we hypothesize that beyond doc concentration dom composition characteristic of terrigenous and aquatic sources are important drivers behind hg concentration levels and the transformation of hg to mehg in different types of lakes located at southern latitudes based on the structure reactivity concept of dom biogeochemistry senesi et al 2009 aiken et al 2011a b we 1 characterized the properties of porewater dom in three lakes of southwest china and 2 tracked dom sources to elucidate their influence on hg concentration levels and transformation to mehg in lake porewaters our results demonstrate optical characterization of dom as a useful tool to improve our understanding of the causality behind dom hg relationships established by field observations of three different lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites on the southwestern china plateau there are more than 30 lakes with a water depth of 10 50 m three of these lakes caohai lake ch hongfeng lake hf and wujiangdu lake wjd were selected for this study fig 1 caohai lake ch 26 50 50 n 104 14 27 e is in southwestern weining county of the guizhou province it is a pristine shallow lake located in the caohai state nature reserve the catchment of ch includes evergreen broad leaf forests with riparian soils exporting terrestrial dom into ch especially during high precipitation periods between may and october qian et al 2008 established in the 1960s hongfeng lake hf 26 33 05 n 106 25 25 e is in the suburbs of guiyang city guizhou province china it is one of the main municipal drinking water reservoirs it is a lake with seasonally anoxic bottom waters having an average water depth of 10 5 m wujiangdu reservoir wjd 27 19 11 n 106 45 40 e is situated on the wujiang river which is a branch of yangtze river guizhou province this reservoir was formed in 1979 both hf and wjd are impacted by anthropogenic activities e g urban development cage aquaculture in contrast to ch which is a natural lake additionally unlike wjd hf lake is influenced by terrestrial dom inputs from adjacent dryland runoff to a certain degree more details are in supporting information table s1 2 2 sample collection dom and hg analysis in july 2014 sediment cores were collected in the middle of the three lakes fig 1 using a sediment gravity corer nine cores were sampled at 0 9 cm depth at ch and wjd and seven cores at hf water quality parameters were measured in situ with a portable multi parameter water quality probe sediment cores were processed within a few hours at the sampling site in oxygen free glove bags filled with nitrogen gas in the laboratory following centrifugation 2000 g for 30 min the pore water was filtered using 0 45 μm millipore pvdf filters in the glove bag and the supernatant was divided for analysis of pore water hg and dom in an anoxic atmosphere samples for dissolved hg measurements were acidified by adding 0 5 v v ultrapure hcl all the liquid samples were preserved at 0 4 c prior to analysis and the solid sediment was stored in a freezer prior to hg analysis the dom concentration was measured using a toc analyzer ge sievers innovox usa represented as dissolved organic carbon doc in mg l 1 the hydrophobic carbon fraction of dom hdoc was separated from hydrophilic fractions by an xad 8 resin supporting information 2 and is expressed as doc in mg l 1 additionally we measured total nitrogen tn nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 to calculate the total dissolved organic nitrogen don by subtracting no3 and nh4 from tn in the dom sample the n c molar ratio was calculated by don doc tn analysis was conducted by the potassium persulfate oxidation uv colorimetric method nitrate and ammonium were measured by ion selective electrodes bante instrument shanghai china uv vis and fluorescence measurements were conducted in a 10 mm quartz cuvette using aqualog horiba japan absorption fluorescence spectroscopy equipped with a 150 w ozone free xenon lamp at constant 20 c temperature milli q water was used as blank to be subtracted from sample eems to remove the interferences of water raman peaks using the parallel absorbance measurement from the same sample and blank yang and hur 2014 eems were corrected for inner filter effect by aqualog eems data processing software automatically which also adjusted the instrument specific excitation and emission effects these corrections were also manually double checked in originpro 2015 the uv vis scan ranged from 230 to 800 nm with 1 nm interval the naperian absorption coefficient was calculated as a λ 2 303 a l where a λ is the dom absorption coefficients at wavelength λ nm a is the absorbance and l is the cuvette path length m coble 2007 helms et al 2008 the absorption coefficient at 355 nm a 355 was chosen to represent the quantity of chromophoric dom cdom rochelle newall and fisher 2002 zhang et al 2005 because of the porewater dom samples is highly concentrated in doc the diluted doc 10 mg l 1 samples were used for all spectra including absorption and fluorescence to avoid inner filtration effects the original cdom i e a 355 m 1 reported in this study was calculated by the measured values multiplied by the dilution factor additionally eems fluorescence spectra were collected the emission spectral range was 250 620 nm in 3 18 nm steps and the excitation spectral range was 230 450 nm in steps of 5 nm the scan integration time was 3s porewater concentrations of dissolved hg and mehg were determined at the institute of geochemistry of cas guiyang two dissolved hg species including total hg dthg and mehg dmehg in 0 45 μm filtered water samples were measured in this study in this paper dthg and dmehg represent the dissolved species of hg unless otherwise specified they were determined based on the strict procedure of pre cleaning purging trapping and cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectroscopy cvafs concentrations of thg in porewater were measured using dual stage gold amalgamation and cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry cvafs tekran model 2500 canada following sample pre oxidation by 0 5 v v brcl reduction by 0 2 v v nh2oh hcl and sncl2 and pre concentration of hg0 onto a gold trap with an aspirator mehg was measured using gc cvafs model iii brooksrand usa after distillation and ethylation following epa method 1630 to help explain dissolved hg in porewater total hg and total mehg in sediment were also measured by thermal combustion method ama 254 leco usa and hno3 leaching ch2cl2 extraction ethylation gc cvafs detection tekran model 2500 canada respectively for qa qc methods were conducted with field blanks method blanks matrix spikes duplicate samples and statistical analysis of the resulting analytical data for water samples the detection limits obtained from the method blanks blank 3 standard deviations for thg and mehg were 0 09 and 0 03 ng l 1 respectively additionally recovery was controlled with matrix spikes because the mehg measurements required an extraction procedure the mehg spike recovery was in the range of 85 4 98 2 the detailed descriptions of sample collection preparation and measurement are referred to in yan et al 2013 and zhao et al 2017 2 3 dom spectral parameters specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 associated with dom aromaticity and humification was calculated as a254 normalized for doc concentration and corrected for fe weishaar et al 2003 in both the wavelength ranges of 275 295 nm and 350 400 nm the spectral slope of dom absorption curve was fitted by nonlinear regression by the function a λ a λr exp s λ λr where λr is a reference wavelength however s 275 295 and s 350 400 showed little compositional variations in our dom samples importantly previous studies demonstrated s r to be a more appropriate characteristic of dom in samples sets with a large variability in chemical properties helms et al 2008 spencer et al 2012 thus we calculated the spectral slope ratio by s r s 275 295 s 350 400 helms et al 2008 additionally parallel factor analysis parafac was not included in this study because the limited number of samples originating from quite diverse sources instead a classic peak pick method was used to identify the fluorescent peaks coble 1996 2007 coble et al 2014 we identified four fluorescent components including 1 two humic like components represented by a ex em 250 260nm 380 480 nm c ex em 330 350nm 420 480 nm and 2 two protein like component tryptophan like t ex em 270 280nm 320 350 nm and tyrosine like peak b ex em 270 280nm 300 320 nm for distinguishing dom sources fluorescence index fi was calculated as the ratio of the fluorescence intensities at the emission wavelength of 450 and 500 nm excitation wavelength was kept at 370 nm mcknight et al 2001 huguet et al 2009 additionally as an indicator for reflecting the recent microbial production of dom i e autochthonous inputs bix also called freshness index was calculated using the ratio of emission intensity at 380 nm divided by the emission intensity of the maximum value in the range of 420 435 nm at the excitation of 310 nm wilson and xenopoulos 2009 fellman et al 2010 2 4 two end member mixing model of dom we used the nitrogen carbon n c molar ratio to estimate the fractions of allochthonous and autochthonous contributions to dom perdue and koprivnjak 2007 based on two member mixing we used equation 1 to calculate the contribution of the two fractions 1 n c f a u t o n c a u t o f a l l o n c a l l o where f auto and f allo represent organic matter from autochthonous and allochthonous origins respectively the ratios n c auto and n c allo are typical values of the two end member gathered from the

population of microbial communities in the sediment was used in the method following the literature peretyazhko and sposito 2006 kappler et al 2004 no further microbial identifications were done sediments were weighed and mixed with di water to form aqueous sediment suspensions 15 mg l 1 with 10 mm sodium acetate added as an electron donor suspensions were horizontally oscillated 200 rpm at 25 c in the anoxic glovebox for 72 h after which they were filtered through 0 22 μm millipore filters to retain the microorganisms filters were rinsed with a 50 ml bicarbonate buffer ph 7 0 and collected after that sterile filtered 0 22 μm millipore filters ihss standard dom samples ihss 1r105f nordic reservoir fulvic acid sample 30 mg l 1 were inoculated with the indigenous microbial community solution in 100 ml blue cap bottles with 25 ml headspace with n2 99 99 during the 16 day batch incubations the dom samples were collected at time intervals of 3 6 10 and 16 days respectively for doc measurement 2 6 statistical analyses all results were reported as mean values of at minimum duplicates and statistical analyses were done in originpro 2015 and spss 24 all data were tested for normality by the lilliefors test supporting information 3 pearson correlation r and spearman s rank correlation r s were conducted on normally or non normally distributed data respectively additionally analysis of variance anova and kruskal wallis test were conducted to test the differences for normal or non normal distributed data set respectively by spss statistics 24 statistical significances were defined at p 0 05 and p 0 01 indicating significant and highly significant differences respectively the actual p values are given in the text with three decimals 3 results and discussion 3 1 doc and cdom the porewater doc concentration ranged from 30 3 to 90 4 mg l 1 supporting information 4 table s3 by the one way anova the difference in doc concentration between ch and the other two lakes was significant p 0 031 but no significant difference was observed between hf and wjd the lowest doc concentration was observed in ch fig 2 a the cdom doc ratio was calculated to estimate the relative contribution of cdom to the bulk doc in the three lakes the average cdom doc l mg c 1 m 1 was 0 34 ch 0 27 hf and 0 30 wjd fig 2 a respectively showing the relative contribution of cdom was greater in ch the cdom has been used as a proxy to predict the doc by linear regression spencer et al 2012 asmala et al 2012 jiang et al 2017a the linear regressions between cdom and doc is improved when the light absorption components of dom are more predominant fig 2 b the weaker relationship between cdom and doc in hf and wjd may indicate a higher contribution from non chromophoric dom in this lake which is known to have a larger urban human influence 3 2 uv vis absorption spectral characteristic the average suva254 in the ch lake 3 9 l mg c 1 m 1 was significantly higher than in other two lakes average 2 8 for hf 3 2 for wjd p 0 035 indicating the highest aromaticity of dom was in ch hydrophobic carbon covaried with suva254 fig 3 a when normalized to doc the percentage of hdoc and hdoc doc was highest in lake ch fig 3 b having approximately 50 of doc in the form of hydrophobic carbon although doc concentrations were higher in hf and wjd the contributions of non aromatic i e low hydrophobic moieties e g sugar and protein were important as indicated by the lower hdoc the spectral slope ratio s r s 275 295 s 350 400 helms et al 2008 ranged from 0 79 to 1 89 fig 3 c was higher than the values reported for a bog and fen tfaily et al 2013 but similar to marshes clark et al 2014 streams rivers he et al 2016 and coastal sediments dang et al 2014 with anthropogenic influences the s r seems to correlate negatively with dom molecular weight fichot and benner 2012 fichot et al 2013 in this study the lowest s r values range of 0 79 1 18 were observed in ch in ch s r also showed a significant negative correlation with suva254 fig 3 c indicating that aromatic components contribute to the dom molecular weight in this pristine natural lake higher s r values and lower suva254 in hf and wjd lakes as compared to ch indicate an enrichment in low molecular weight compounds e g some proteins or polysaccharide and less aromaticity this may suggest an important contribution from microbial algal sources to the dom signature in the sediments at hf and wjd which was validated by further fluorescence spectral analysis and the biodegradation assay reported below additionally the significantly inverse correlation between doc and suva254 r 0 89 p 0 001 was only observed in wjd further supporting this explanation and indicating the importance of the autochthonous contribution for doc increases kothawala et al 2014 jiang et al 2018a b 3 3 fluorescence spectral characteristic examples of the dom eems spectra of the collected porewater are shown in fig 4 protein like components peak b and t are readily linked to dom lability fellman et al 2009 anthropogenic interferences baker 2001 2002 and microbial activities fasching et al 2014 after normalization by doc to remove the concentration dependence the lower peak b doc and peak t doc in ch suggest relatively less microbial material contribution to the dom composition recently some researchers proposed using peak t alone to assess the water quality because of its significant correlation with microbial activities e g microbial number baker et al 2015 sorensen et al 2018a b nowicki et al 2019 a higher protein peak signatures especially the peak t observed in samples of hf and wjd may therefore may indicate a larger contribution from microbial derived dom driven by greater microbial activities than suggested by the optical signature in the porewater of ch both hf and wjd lakes were formed artificially to establish hydroelectric power generation and have a different degree of eutrophication caused by the accumulation of nutrients shang et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 which induce the proliferation of algae and phytoplankton shang et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 that also could heavily influence the abundance of protein like components in the dom zhou et al 2015 2017 local long term cage aquaculture activities are also key factors for the high protein like signatures caused by the high primary production at the two sites he et al 2010 feng et al 2012 thus dom optical signatures of hf and wjd indicate important contributions from anthropogenic effluences active microbial metabolism and algae phytoplankton blooms 3 4 fluorescence indices and two end member mixing model of dom fluorescence indices e g fi bix and r t c are useful tools to characterize dom there are several studies in which these indices has been used and interpreted in pristine and anthropogenically impacted surface waters mcknight et al 2001 baker 2001 2002 huguet et al 2009 kothawala et al 2012 gabor et al 2014 furthermore they are extensively used to characterize dom from other sources such as organic aerosols fu et al 2015 fogwater birdwell and valsaraj 2010 cave and spring water birdwell and engel 2010 and sediment porewater burdige et al 2004 he et al 2016 guillemette et al 2017 autochthonous i e microbial algae and allochthonous i e terrestrial sources can be identified by a fi higher than 1 9 or lower than 1 4 respectively mcknight et al 2001 huguet et al 2009 accordingly while ch had fi values lower than 1 4 suggesting a predominant allochthonous source fi values for hf and wjd indicated a combination of autochthonous and allochthonous sources with wjd more influenced by autochthonous i e microbial algal anthropogenic effluent sources than by allochthonous i e terrestrial sources fig 5 a the bix at hf and wjd was both exceeding 0 8 and in particular wjd had significantly higher values than ch and hf this is good agreement with the results at fi confirming the contribution of biologically derived autochthonous dom in lake wjd fig 5 a two intensity ratios of fluorescent peaks r a c and r t c were calculated fig 5 b the r a c peak is used to reflect the relative proportion of the two humic like components in dom and to distinguish relatively less processed humic material from the more processed pool one rationale for this is the observed increase in the r a c ratio due to a preferential loss of peak c in relation to peak a in photo or bio degradation processes kothawala et al 2012 lower average r a c value in ch 2 76 as compared to 3 37 in hf and 6 47 in wjd indicates a possible enrichment of non processed humic substances in ch as an important indicator of water quality r t c is also used to track influences of wastewater and anthropogenic interferences baker 2001 2002 galapate et al 1998 this empirically r t c higher than approximately 2 0 indicates significant influence of anthropogenic effluences baker 2001 2002 old et al 2012 carstea et al 2016 in hf and wjd most dom samples showed r t c higher than 2 0 also r t c was significantly higher in hf and wjd than in ch p 0 016 but without significant difference between them p 0 21 this higher microbial activity indicated by r t c in hf and wjd also agrees with the peak t observed as abovementioned as shown in fig 6 the contributions from allochthonous dom sources as calculated by the two member mixing model were largest in lake ch porewater and lowest in wjd based on previous studies of typical algae bacterial and terrestrial humic om sources we used typical n c molar ratios values of 0 1 and 0 02 for autochthonous and allochthonous dom respectively perdue and koprivnjak 2007 the mixture of allochthonous and autochthonous sources of dom showed a great consistency among the 7 9 sediment samples within each lake fig 6 the trend among the three lakes was that the ch lake had the highest terrestrial source contribution 66 83 followed by hf 40 75 and the wjd lake had the smallest contribution from terrestrial humic sources 11 45 this trend is well in agreement with the reported suva254 and fi values and relationships of each of those with dom in the three lakes figs 3 and 5 thus these mixing model results in further agreement with the spectral results that the different characteristics of dom are heavily dependent on the sources and anthropogenic activity in conclusion our results show strong signs that dom in the sediment porewaters of all three lakes is a mixture of allochthonous and autochthonous sources porewater in ch lake sediment is clearly controlled by terrestrial inputs showing a distinctly higher humic character as compared to the other two lakes in contrast samples from hf and wjd were more inclined to be influenced by autochthonous algal bacterial organic matter production 3 5 concentrations of mercury in porewater and sediment concentrations of dthg and dmehg ranged over more than one order of magnitude 1 8 17 3 and 0 002 9 4 ng l 1 respectively lake hf and wjd showed higher concentrations of dthg p 0 026 than ch lake mean 3 1 ng l 1 but the highest dmehg concentration was found in wjd mean 2 1 ng l 1 fig 7 a a significant relationship between dmehg and dthg fig 7 a p 0 013 was only observed in lake wjd to resolve the underlying processes behind relationships between total hg and mehg concentrations in sediment and porewater we need to consider several factors and processes skyllberg 2008 drott et al 2008 jonsson et al 2012 2014 the porewater hg concentration is controlled by two factors 1 inorganic hg storage and 2 the partition of hg between aqueous and solid phases the concentration of mehg in porewater is similarly dependent on the total concentration of mehg in the sediment and its partitioning into the aqueous phase but is also affected by the rate of mehg net formation by methylating bacteria and subsequent demethylation the bacteria in turn require electron donors labile om electron acceptors e g h2 sulfate fe iii and inorganic hg which serves as a substrate for the mehg formations based on this thinking the ratio of mehg thg mehg in sediment skyllberg 2008 drott et al 2008 has been shown to be a relevant proxy for the net hg methylation efficiency at a specific site like the analysis of porewaters wjd showed the highest mehg and absolute mehg concentration in sediments fig 7 b and fig s1 indicating the greatest methylation potential of the three lakes the average distribution partition coefficient kd l kg 1 calculated as kd cs cw where cs mg kg 1 and cw mg l 1 are the concentrations in the solid and aqueous phases respectively did not show any significant differences among the three lake sediments fig 7 b b thus the partition of thg commonly caused by differences in solid phase composition of hg or in concentrations of high affinity ligands thiols and inorganic sulfides did not differ among the three lakes the concentration of mehg both in sediment and porewater differed substantially among the three lakes figs s1 a being most concentrated in wjd lake sediments and least concentrated in ch 3 6 environmental implication of porewater dom properties associations with hg a strong positive correlation between hg and doc concentration is often reported in studies of boreal and temperate forest streams suggesting that hg fate in aquatic systems is linked with dom mierle and ingram 1991 driscoll et al 1995 hurley et al 1998 dittman et al 2009 bergamaschi et al 2012 in this study supporting information 6 fig s2 only ch lake showed a significant positive correlation between doc and dthg p 0 033 the fact that dthg was positively correlated also with suva254 fig 8 a bix figs s3 a and fi figs s3 b supporting information 7 fig s3 indicates that dom was enriched in terrestrial dom and points at terrestrial inputs being the major source of hg in lake ch terrestrial inputs has been highlighted as important sources of thg for streams eklöf et al 2012 bravo et al 2018 in comparison to the other two lakes the lack of correlation between dthg and protein parameters e g peak t and r t c is consistent with ch being a natural pristine lake highly influenced by terrestrial soil runoff the negative relationship between dthg and s r figs s3 c further supports the notion that dthg variability is heavily dependent on dom molecular mass distribution yet significant correlations between dmehg and bix fig 8 b and fi figs s3 d suggest that mehg levels in porewater were associated with microbial activities in lake ch this is supported by the negative relationship found between of dissolved dmehg and s r figs s3 e which indicates high dmehg concentrations linked to the presence of low molecular mass dom microbial dom processing could result in high optical signatures of low molecular mass protein like components helms et al 2008 and enhance hg ii methylation bravo et al 2017 noh et al 2018 herrero ortega et al 2017 lake hf presented a contrasting dom signature compared to ch for example dthg and dmehg did not show any significant correlation with neither doc nor cdom fig s2 in this lake autochthonous dom seemed to be a predominant factor responsible for hg variability in porewater as indicated by the significant negative correlation of dthg p 0 003 and dmehg p 0 030 with fi fig 8 c and d additionally the correlation between dmehg and bix supporting information 8 fig s4 a and between mehg and protein like peak t figs s4 b reveals a link between microbial activities and mehg concentration yet dmehg was negatively correlated to r t c figs s4 c in hf possibly indicative of an inhibitory effect on mehg net production caused by a change from more humic like to protein like components yet as aforementioned protein like components in porewater dom in lake hf may not originate only from autochthonous production but also from anthropogenic effluents fig 5 b thus this negative correlation may be the effect of the dilution of protein like characteristics by elevated anthropogenic wastewater inputs instead of merely a consequence of microbial algae production a similar dilution effect may also explain the negative correlation between dthg and fi fig 8 c and between dmehg and fi fig 8 d other possible reason may be that the hg associated with autochthonous dom could deposit in sediments of relative stagnant water bodies such as lake hf this explanation is also supported by the large kd value fig 7 b indicating that solid phase partitioning was an important factor behind the relationship between hg and dom in lake hf porewater in wjd dthg was inversely correlated with doc supporting information 9 figs s5 a and bix figs s5 b suggesting that high doc concentrations with microbial algae signatures could be associated with a decrease in dthg these relations could be explained by two processes 1 biodilution pickhardt et al 2002 and or 2 abiotic reduction of hg ii by dom the first process is enhanced by bacterial uptake and or adsorption of hg onto biomass surfaces during high algal and bacterial production which results in high doc concentrations and bix values the latter process abiotic reduction of hg ii by natural organic matter is ubiquitous in aquatic systems gu et al 2010 jiang et al 2015 and highly enhanced by solar radiation zheng and hintelmann 2009 however this process is not likely to account for data observed in wjd due to the structure specific reduction process of hg ii complexed by weakly bonding ro n e g carboxyl and amino groups and the much stronger bonding rsh e g thiol group in dom with time dependent structural rearrangement jiang et al 2015 estimating the concentration of rsh to be equal to 0 15 doc mass skyllberg 2008 or 0 5 μm of rsh at 10 mg l 1 doc the highest rsh concentrations at the wjd site would be slightly greater than 1 3 μm which indicates the rsh groups are not saturated by hg ii the hg ii rsh ratio is much less than the optimum molar ratios approximately 0 2 10 3 of dark hg ii abiotic reduction gu et al 2010 jiang et al 2015 thus dark reduction processes can likely be discarded as being of major importance although mehg microbial degradation could be a contributor to the inverse correlation between mehg and microbial optical parameters e g bix figs s5 c the relatively small log kd fig 7 may suggest that the negative relationship is more likely induced by bio adsorption or accumulation resulting from the vigorous autochthonous activity machado et al 2016 in wjd the concentration of dthg was positively correlated with both suva254 fig 8 e and peak t figs s5 d suggesting that the dthg variability was significantly related with dom at wjd dmehg followed a similar pattern and was positively correlated with suva254 figs s5 e but also with peak t fig 8 f and r t c figs s5 f the correlation of dmehg with suva254 figs s5 e might denote on one hand an import of mehg from the catchment to the lake herrero ortega et al 2017 and on the other hand the fact that specific terrestrial compounds might have also contributed to an enhanced mehg production previous works gerbig et al 2011 graham 2013 zhang et al 2012 2014 have demonstrated that highly aromatic dom can stabilize the aggregation of hgs nano particles which in turn could be utilized by methylating bacteria also higher aromaticity of dom could enhance dmehg released from the solid phase lowering kd as observed in fig 7 d high mehg levels could be also explained by a higher mehg production in wjd meng et al 2010 2016 additionally the possibility of dmehg transported by dom from allochthonous sources could be negligible because the sampling sites in this lake were far from the adjacent lands and the land use is mostly dryland often in an oxic condition the resulting relations between dmehg and dom is more likely explained by the within lake i e internal process rather than runoff transportation i e external this explanation is also supported by the lack of positive correlation between dmehg and dom concentrations in this study fig s2 c and s2 d therefore the influences of dom on hg in wjd were more complicated than in ch and hf lake with the mixture of both allochthonous and autochthonous dom sources causing possible offsetting effects on solubility and net formation of mehg 3 7 composition and bioavailability of dom interplays with hg speciation the relationships between different dom properties and hg overall suggested that mehg net formation in the lake sediments i e hf and wjd of this study especially in wjd is mainly driven by the activity of methylating microbes fig 8 f fig s4 a b and fig s5 f while other studies have reached similar conclusions kim et al 2011 mazrui et al 2016 to our knowledge only one study has measured and thus linked the bacterial activity to hg methylation processes in sediments bravo et al 2017 bioavailability of dom is dependent on dom composition the microbial community and abundance yang et al 2017 thus to confirm the role of the microbial activity as indicated by dom optical signatures and hg methylation in sediments we conducted a biodegradation incubation test for 16 days to fit the kinetic process of biodegradation fig 9 we assumed that the biodegradability of dom in the collected sediment porewaters was decided by two distinct pools with different biodegradation rates represented by labile and recalcitrant dom fractions the degradation was described by the following first order kinetic model kalbitz et al 2003 wickland et al 2007 4 biodegraded dom of the original doc f a 1 e k1 t f b 1 e k2 t where t is time day f a is the percentage of labile dom f b is the percentage of recalcitrant dom and k 1 and k 2 are the biodegradation rate constants for the two fractions of dom respectively the sum of f a and f b is constrained to 1 0 we determined the half life ln2 k i and average residence time 1 k i of the two pools as reported in table 1 theoretically for a given microbial community labile f a and recalcitrant f b fractions of a dom sample from a given site should be the constant the different f values for different sampling sites table 1 may suggest that the microbial communities and their abilities to degrade dom are totally different in the three studied reservoirs for a given dom sample i e the same sample the microbial capacity to utilize dom was greatest in wjd with wjd hf ch table 1 the fastest biodegradation rate was likewise in wjd while ch samples were slowest fig 10 the highest microbial degradation capacity found in wjd is further evidenced by the microbial dom optical signatures as differences of microbial degradation capacities are generally attributed to the differences of microbial activities including either microbial composition diversity or abundance reimers et al 2013 a higher net hg methylation observed in wjd could be attributed to enhanced microbial activity compared to ch and hf 3 8 limits and significances finally the limitations of this study need to be emphasized as a field investigation based on a limited number of samples we hesitate to establish a general model for describing the variations of dissolved hg species influenced by the dom dynamics in lakes the hg cycling in aquatic systems is such a complex process controlled by many biogeochemical factors in addition to dom we also recognize that lab scale experiments designed to study mechanisms proposed here as well as and larger scale spatial temporal field investigations are needed in order to develop such more generalized models it also should be noted that dom optical characterization can be influenced by concentration effects such as inner filter effects gabor et al 2014 thus optical indices should be used with caution and similarly diluted dom samples are recommended to be used when comparisons are made between waters of different regions with that stated this study has demonstrated the importance of spectroscopic characteristics of dom and we recommend these optical measurements be routinely incorporated into future environmental studies when assessing water quality and or predicting potential risks of pollutants associated with dom obviously not all spectral parameters are informative in relation to the hg cycle this can in part be explained by the structural complexity of dom resulting in a non consistent pattern for some optical parameters kothawala et al 2014 hansen et al 2016 jiang et al 2017a b lescord et al 2018 because of this and the inherent heterogeneity of dom a combination of multiple methods e g uv vis absorption plus fluorescence is recommended for adequately assessing the role of dom in the cycle of contaminants leenheer and croué 2003 aiken et al 2011a b jiang et al 2017b lescord et al 2018 4 conclusion based on the spectral analysis of dom a mixing model consisting of two end members of terrestrial and aquatic origins showed that porewater dom characteristics in three chinese lakes varied from predominantly a terrestrial origin in the pristine lake ch to more algal and microbial derived dom in the hf and wjd lakes our results highlight that while the relationships between doc and hg were inconsistent among lakes dom optical properties were useful in elucidating the sources of dom and hg furthermore the often reported correlations between doc and hg is concluded to be more likely observed in natural rather than anthropogenically influenced lakes in the pristine ch lake allochthonous dom was more likely to bind hg ii but it was less able to provide energy for hg methylating microorganisms labile dom from either autochthonous biological production or anthropogenic sources seemed to drive microbial activity and resulted in high mehg concentrations in the two most urban impacted reservoirs wjd and hf three important highlights can be derived from this study 1 microbial activity reflected from fluorescence and absorption spectra of porewater dom could help explain in part the variation in mehg concentration in sediments and porewaters 2 characterization of dom composition could help explain the fate of hg in environmental systems 3 depending on the dom composition an increased dom concentration might either result in high mehg levels transfer and partition when dom has a strong autochthonous signature or low mehg levels when having terrestrial and recalcitrant signatures our results showed that beyond doc concentrations dom properties helped to explain hg cycling in the lake sediments and analyses of dom composition should be considered in studies of hg cycling in aquatic systems acknowledgments this work is financially supported by national natural science

19272,the origin and composition of dissolved organic matter dom in porewater of lake sediments is intricate and decisive for fate of pollutants including mercury hg while there are many reports on the relationship between dissolved organic carbon concentration doc and mercury hg concentrations in aquatic systems there are few in which dom compositional properties that may better explain the fate of hg have been the focus in this study porewaters from sediments of three lakes caihai lake ch hongfeng lake hf and wujiangdu lake wjd all located in southwest china were selected to test the hypothesis that dom optical properties control the fate of hg in aquatic ecosystems porewater dom was extracted and characterized by uv vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy a two end member autochthonous and allochthonous dom mixing model was used to unveil the origin of dom in porewaters of the three lakes our results show a higher input of terrestrial dom in the pristine lake ch as compared to lakes hf and wjd lakes which were both influenced by urban environments and enriched in autochthonous dom while the relationships between the concentrations of doc and the different chemical forms of hg forms were quite inconsistent we found important links between specific dom components and the fate of hg in the three lakes in particular our results suggest that allochthonous terrestrial dom inhibits hg ii availability for hg methylating micro organisms in contrast autochthonous dom seems to have been stimulated mehg formation likely by enhancing the activity of microbial communities indeed dom biodegradation experiments revealed that differences in the microbial activity could explain the variation in the concentration of mehg while relationships between concentrations of doc and hg vary among different sites and provide little information about hg cycling we conclude that the transport and transformation of hg e g the methylation process are more strongly linked to dom chemical composition and reactivity graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved organic matter mercury methylmercury lake porewater sediment characterization abbreviations bix

contaminants such as mercury herrero ortega et al 2017 kim et al 2017 lescord et al 2018 mercury hg contamination is a global environmental issue stemming from the severe damage it may cause humans and ecosystem health its methylated chemical form methylmercury mehg is of special concern because it accumulates in aquatic food webs through biomagnification processes lavoie et al 2013 lehnherr

governed by the activity of the microbial community bravo et al 2017 as well as the availability of hg ii to methylating microorganisms which in turn is dependent on the hg ii speciation gerbig et al 2011 2012 jonsson et al 2012 2014 zhang et al 2012 2014 the hg mobilization speciation and methylation have been widely studied across various environments skyllberg 2008 2012 graham et al 2012 2013 of all the biogeochemical variables affecting hg transformations dom is one of the most important factors aiken et al 2011a ravichandran 2004 gerbig et al 2012 bravo et al 2017 herrero ortega et al 2017 there are many reports on the interactions and correlations between dom and hg and comprehensive reviews are available elsewhere ravichandran 2004 aiken et al 2011a b skyllberg 2012 gerbig et al 2012 hsu kim et al 2013 in field investigations correlations between concentrations of doc and hg have been established to indicate the role of dom mierle and ingram 1991 driscoll et al 1995 hurley et al 1998 dittman et al 2009 bergamaschi et al 2012 however across aquatic systems influenced by diverse biogeochemical processes and sources of dom the correlation between concentrations of hg and doc is not always consistent lab scale experiments have revealed a dual effect of dom on mehg net production by i acting as a stimulatory electron donor and by ii modulating the chemical speciation of hg ii dom also serve as a substrate for microorganisms and stimulate hg methylation hsu kim et al 2013 schartup et al 2013 gerbig et al 2012 kim et al 2011 indeed most groups of microbes containing phyla of hg methylators are key anaerobic decomposers of organic materials gilmour et al 2013 reddy and delaune 2008 logue et al 2016 under sulfidic conditions a stimulatory effect of dom on mehg production is attributed to the disintegration or dissolution of hgs minerals waples et al 2005 resulting in enhanced hg ii bioavailability to methylating bacteria gerbig et al 2011 graham et al 2012 2013 in contrast chemisorption to dom functional groups may limit hg ii bioavailability for methylating microorganisms when the molecular size of dom is too large to cross the bacterial cell membranes hammerschmidt and fitzgerald 2004 hammerschmidt et al 2008 recent studies schartup et al 2013 chiasson gould et al 2014 bravo et al 2017 herrero ortega et al 2017 lescord et al 2018 noh et al 2018 demonstrate that differences in the composition of dom may largely explain the variability in hg methylation indeed it is known that specific dom components regulate speciation and dynamics of hg through numerous mechanisms including chemical complex formation ravichandran 2004 skyllberg 2008 2012 redox processes gu et al 2010 and microbial activity bravo et al 2017 thus all the mentioned studies underscore the complexity of the interactions between hg and dom and more importantly highlight the potential to perform comprehensive studies to identify the hg risk especially the mehg net production in the environment using dom composition despite the recently highlighted importance of dom composition and quantity environmental biogeochemical studies of hg still poorly or incompletely take dom characterization into account especially outside the boreal zone here we use the variability in dom characteristics to improve our understanding about how concentrations of dom and hg may be related or not related at different study sites in subtropical china we hypothesize that beyond doc concentration dom composition characteristic of terrigenous and aquatic sources are important drivers behind hg concentration levels and the transformation of hg to mehg in different types of lakes located at southern latitudes based on the structure reactivity concept of dom biogeochemistry senesi et al 2009 aiken et al 2011a b we 1 characterized the properties of porewater dom in three lakes of southwest china and 2 tracked dom sources to elucidate their influence on hg concentration levels and transformation to mehg in lake porewaters our results demonstrate optical characterization of dom as a useful tool to improve our understanding of the causality behind dom hg relationships established by field observations of three different lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites on the southwestern china plateau there are more than 30 lakes with a water depth of 10 50 m three of these lakes caohai lake ch hongfeng lake hf and wujiangdu lake wjd were selected for this study fig 1 caohai lake ch 26 50 50 n 104 14 27 e is in southwestern weining county of the guizhou province it is a pristine shallow lake located in the caohai state nature reserve the catchment of ch includes evergreen broad leaf forests with riparian soils exporting terrestrial dom into ch especially during high precipitation periods between may and october qian et al 2008 established in the 1960s hongfeng lake hf 26 33 05 n 106 25 25 e is in the suburbs of guiyang city guizhou province china it is one of the main municipal drinking water reservoirs it is a lake with seasonally anoxic bottom waters having an average water depth of 10 5 m wujiangdu reservoir wjd 27 19 11 n 106 45 40 e is situated on the wujiang river which is a branch of yangtze river guizhou province this reservoir was formed in 1979 both hf and wjd are impacted by anthropogenic activities e g urban development cage aquaculture in contrast to ch which is a natural lake additionally unlike wjd hf lake is influenced by terrestrial dom inputs from adjacent dryland runoff to a certain degree more details are in supporting information table s1 2 2 sample collection dom and hg analysis in july 2014 sediment cores were collected in the middle of the three lakes fig 1 using a sediment gravity corer nine cores were sampled at 0 9 cm depth at ch and wjd and seven cores at hf water quality parameters were measured in situ with a portable multi parameter water quality probe sediment cores were processed within a few hours at the sampling site in oxygen free glove bags filled with nitrogen gas in the laboratory following centrifugation 2000 g for 30 min the pore water was filtered using 0 45 μm millipore pvdf filters in the glove bag and the supernatant was divided for analysis of pore water hg and dom in an anoxic atmosphere samples for dissolved hg measurements were acidified by adding 0 5 v v ultrapure hcl all the liquid samples were preserved at 0 4 c prior to analysis and the solid sediment was stored in a freezer prior to hg analysis the dom concentration was measured using a toc analyzer ge sievers innovox usa represented as dissolved organic carbon doc in mg l 1 the hydrophobic carbon fraction of dom hdoc was separated from hydrophilic fractions by an xad 8 resin supporting information 2 and is expressed as doc in mg l 1 additionally we measured total nitrogen tn nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 to calculate the total dissolved organic nitrogen don by subtracting no3 and nh4 from tn in the dom sample the n c molar ratio was calculated by don doc tn analysis was conducted by the potassium persulfate oxidation uv colorimetric method nitrate and ammonium were measured by ion selective electrodes bante instrument shanghai china uv vis and fluorescence measurements were conducted in a 10 mm quartz cuvette using aqualog horiba japan absorption fluorescence spectroscopy equipped with a 150 w ozone free xenon lamp at constant 20 c temperature milli q water was used as blank to be subtracted from sample eems to remove the interferences of water raman peaks using the parallel absorbance measurement from the same sample and blank yang and hur 2014 eems were corrected for inner filter effect by aqualog eems data processing software automatically which also adjusted the instrument specific excitation and emission effects these corrections were also manually double checked in originpro 2015 the uv vis scan ranged from 230 to 800 nm with 1 nm interval the naperian absorption coefficient was calculated as a λ 2 303 a l where a λ is the dom absorption coefficients at wavelength λ nm a is the absorbance and l is the cuvette path length m coble 2007 helms et al 2008 the absorption coefficient at 355 nm a 355 was chosen to represent the quantity of chromophoric dom cdom rochelle newall and fisher 2002 zhang et al 2005 because of the porewater dom samples is highly concentrated in doc the diluted doc 10 mg l 1 samples were used for all spectra including absorption and fluorescence to avoid inner filtration effects the original cdom i e a 355 m 1 reported in this study was calculated by the measured values multiplied by the dilution factor additionally eems fluorescence spectra were collected the emission spectral range was 250 620 nm in 3 18 nm steps and the excitation spectral range was 230 450 nm in steps of 5 nm the scan integration time was 3s porewater concentrations of dissolved hg and mehg were determined at the institute of geochemistry of cas guiyang two dissolved hg species including total hg dthg and mehg dmehg in 0 45 μm filtered water samples were measured in this study in this paper dthg and dmehg represent the dissolved species of hg unless otherwise specified they were determined based on the strict procedure of pre cleaning purging trapping and cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectroscopy cvafs concentrations of thg in porewater were measured using dual stage gold amalgamation and cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry cvafs tekran model 2500 canada following sample pre oxidation by 0 5 v v brcl reduction by 0 2 v v nh2oh hcl and sncl2 and pre concentration of hg0 onto a gold trap with an aspirator mehg was measured using gc cvafs model iii brooksrand usa after distillation and ethylation following epa method 1630 to help explain dissolved hg in porewater total hg and total mehg in sediment were also measured by thermal combustion method ama 254 leco usa and hno3 leaching ch2cl2 extraction ethylation gc cvafs detection tekran model 2500 canada respectively for qa qc methods were conducted with field blanks method blanks matrix spikes duplicate samples and statistical analysis of the resulting analytical data for water samples the detection limits obtained from the method blanks blank 3 standard deviations for thg and mehg were 0 09 and 0 03 ng l 1 respectively additionally recovery was controlled with matrix spikes because the mehg measurements required an extraction procedure the mehg spike recovery was in the range of 85 4 98 2 the detailed descriptions of sample collection preparation and measurement are referred to in yan et al 2013 and zhao et al 2017 2 3 dom spectral parameters specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 associated with dom aromaticity and humification was calculated as a254 normalized for doc concentration and corrected for fe weishaar et al 2003 in both the wavelength ranges of 275 295 nm and 350 400 nm the spectral slope of dom absorption curve was fitted by nonlinear regression by the function a λ a λr exp s λ λr where λr is a reference wavelength however s 275 295 and s 350 400 showed little compositional variations in our dom samples importantly previous studies demonstrated s r to be a more appropriate characteristic of dom in samples sets with a large variability in chemical properties helms et al 2008 spencer et al 2012 thus we calculated the spectral slope ratio by s r s 275 295 s 350 400 helms et al 2008 additionally parallel factor analysis parafac was not included in this study because the limited number of samples originating from quite diverse sources instead a classic peak pick method was used to identify the fluorescent peaks coble 1996 2007 coble et al 2014 we identified four fluorescent components including 1 two humic like components represented by a ex em 250 260nm 380 480 nm c ex em 330 350nm 420 480 nm and 2 two protein like component tryptophan like t ex em 270 280nm 320 350 nm and tyrosine like peak b ex em 270 280nm 300 320 nm for distinguishing dom sources fluorescence index fi was calculated as the ratio of the fluorescence intensities at the emission wavelength of 450 and 500 nm excitation wavelength was kept at 370 nm mcknight et al 2001 huguet et al 2009 additionally as an indicator for reflecting the recent microbial production of dom i e autochthonous inputs bix also called freshness index was calculated using the ratio of emission intensity at 380 nm divided by the emission intensity of the maximum value in the range of 420 435 nm at the excitation of 310 nm wilson and xenopoulos 2009 fellman et al 2010 2 4 two end member mixing model of dom we used the nitrogen carbon n c molar ratio to estimate the fractions of allochthonous and autochthonous contributions to dom perdue and koprivnjak 2007 based on two member mixing we used equation 1 to calculate the contribution of the two fractions 1 n c f a u t o n c a u t o f a l l o n c a l l o where f auto and f allo represent organic matter from autochthonous and allochthonous origins respectively the ratios n c auto and n c allo are typical values of the two end member gathered from the

population of microbial communities in the sediment was used in the method following the literature peretyazhko and sposito 2006 kappler et al 2004 no further microbial identifications were done sediments were weighed and mixed with di water to form aqueous sediment suspensions 15 mg l 1 with 10 mm sodium acetate added as an electron donor suspensions were horizontally oscillated 200 rpm at 25 c in the anoxic glovebox for 72 h after which they were filtered through 0 22 μm millipore filters to retain the microorganisms filters were rinsed with a 50 ml bicarbonate buffer ph 7 0 and collected after that sterile filtered 0 22 μm millipore filters ihss standard dom samples ihss 1r105f nordic reservoir fulvic acid sample 30 mg l 1 were inoculated with the indigenous microbial community solution in 100 ml blue cap bottles with 25 ml headspace with n2 99 99 during the 16 day batch incubations the dom samples were collected at time intervals of 3 6 10 and 16 days respectively for doc measurement 2 6 statistical analyses all results were reported as mean values of at minimum duplicates and statistical analyses were done in originpro 2015 and spss 24 all data were tested for normality by the lilliefors test supporting information 3 pearson correlation r and spearman s rank correlation r s were conducted on normally or non normally distributed data respectively additionally analysis of variance anova and kruskal wallis test were conducted to test the differences for normal or non normal distributed data set respectively by spss statistics 24 statistical significances were defined at p 0 05 and p 0 01 indicating significant and highly significant differences respectively the actual p values are given in the text with three decimals 3 results and discussion 3 1 doc and cdom the porewater doc concentration ranged from 30 3 to 90 4 mg l 1 supporting information 4 table s3 by the one way anova the difference in doc concentration between ch and the other two lakes was significant p 0 031 but no significant difference was observed between hf and wjd the lowest doc concentration was observed in ch fig 2 a the cdom doc ratio was calculated to estimate the relative contribution of cdom to the bulk doc in the three lakes the average cdom doc l mg c 1 m 1 was 0 34 ch 0 27 hf and 0 30 wjd fig 2 a respectively showing the relative contribution of cdom was greater in ch the cdom has been used as a proxy to predict the doc by linear regression spencer et al 2012 asmala et al 2012 jiang et al 2017a the linear regressions between cdom and doc is improved when the light absorption components of dom are more predominant fig 2 b the weaker relationship between cdom and doc in hf and wjd may indicate a higher contribution from non chromophoric dom in this lake which is known to have a larger urban human influence 3 2 uv vis absorption spectral characteristic the average suva254 in the ch lake 3 9 l mg c 1 m 1 was significantly higher than in other two lakes average 2 8 for hf 3 2 for wjd p 0 035 indicating the highest aromaticity of dom was in ch hydrophobic carbon covaried with suva254 fig 3 a when normalized to doc the percentage of hdoc and hdoc doc was highest in lake ch fig 3 b having approximately 50 of doc in the form of hydrophobic carbon although doc concentrations were higher in hf and wjd the contributions of non aromatic i e low hydrophobic moieties e g sugar and protein were important as indicated by the lower hdoc the spectral slope ratio s r s 275 295 s 350 400 helms et al 2008 ranged from 0 79 to 1 89 fig 3 c was higher than the values reported for a bog and fen tfaily et al 2013 but similar to marshes clark et al 2014 streams rivers he et al 2016 and coastal sediments dang et al 2014 with anthropogenic influences the s r seems to correlate negatively with dom molecular weight fichot and benner 2012 fichot et al 2013 in this study the lowest s r values range of 0 79 1 18 were observed in ch in ch s r also showed a significant negative correlation with suva254 fig 3 c indicating that aromatic components contribute to the dom molecular weight in this pristine natural lake higher s r values and lower suva254 in hf and wjd lakes as compared to ch indicate an enrichment in low molecular weight compounds e g some proteins or polysaccharide and less aromaticity this may suggest an important contribution from microbial algal sources to the dom signature in the sediments at hf and wjd which was validated by further fluorescence spectral analysis and the biodegradation assay reported below additionally the significantly inverse correlation between doc and suva254 r 0 89 p 0 001 was only observed in wjd further supporting this explanation and indicating the importance of the autochthonous contribution for doc increases kothawala et al 2014 jiang et al 2018a b 3 3 fluorescence spectral characteristic examples of the dom eems spectra of the collected porewater are shown in fig 4 protein like components peak b and t are readily linked to dom lability fellman et al 2009 anthropogenic interferences baker 2001 2002 and microbial activities fasching et al 2014 after normalization by doc to remove the concentration dependence the lower peak b doc and peak t doc in ch suggest relatively less microbial material contribution to the dom composition recently some researchers proposed using peak t alone to assess the water quality because of its significant correlation with microbial activities e g microbial number baker et al 2015 sorensen et al 2018a b nowicki et al 2019 a higher protein peak signatures especially the peak t observed in samples of hf and wjd may therefore may indicate a larger contribution from microbial derived dom driven by greater microbial activities than suggested by the optical signature in the porewater of ch both hf and wjd lakes were formed artificially to establish hydroelectric power generation and have a different degree of eutrophication caused by the accumulation of nutrients shang et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 which induce the proliferation of algae and phytoplankton shang et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 that also could heavily influence the abundance of protein like components in the dom zhou et al 2015 2017 local long term cage aquaculture activities are also key factors for the high protein like signatures caused by the high primary production at the two sites he et al 2010 feng et al 2012 thus dom optical signatures of hf and wjd indicate important contributions from anthropogenic effluences active microbial metabolism and algae phytoplankton blooms 3 4 fluorescence indices and two end member mixing model of dom fluorescence indices e g fi bix and r t c are useful tools to characterize dom there are several studies in which these indices has been used and interpreted in pristine and anthropogenically impacted surface waters mcknight et al 2001 baker 2001 2002 huguet et al 2009 kothawala et al 2012 gabor et al 2014 furthermore they are extensively used to characterize dom from other sources such as organic aerosols fu et al 2015 fogwater birdwell and valsaraj 2010 cave and spring water birdwell and engel 2010 and sediment porewater burdige et al 2004 he et al 2016 guillemette et al 2017 autochthonous i e microbial algae and allochthonous i e terrestrial sources can be identified by a fi higher than 1 9 or lower than 1 4 respectively mcknight et al 2001 huguet et al 2009 accordingly while ch had fi values lower than 1 4 suggesting a predominant allochthonous source fi values for hf and wjd indicated a combination of autochthonous and allochthonous sources with wjd more influenced by autochthonous i e microbial algal anthropogenic effluent sources than by allochthonous i e terrestrial sources fig 5 a the bix at hf and wjd was both exceeding 0 8 and in particular wjd had significantly higher values than ch and hf this is good agreement with the results at fi confirming the contribution of biologically derived autochthonous dom in lake wjd fig 5 a two intensity ratios of fluorescent peaks r a c and r t c were calculated fig 5 b the r a c peak is used to reflect the relative proportion of the two humic like components in dom and to distinguish relatively less processed humic material from the more processed pool one rationale for this is the observed increase in the r a c ratio due to a preferential loss of peak c in relation to peak a in photo or bio degradation processes kothawala et al 2012 lower average r a c value in ch 2 76 as compared to 3 37 in hf and 6 47 in wjd indicates a possible enrichment of non processed humic substances in ch as an important indicator of water quality r t c is also used to track influences of wastewater and anthropogenic interferences baker 2001 2002 galapate et al 1998 this empirically r t c higher than approximately 2 0 indicates significant influence of anthropogenic effluences baker 2001 2002 old et al 2012 carstea et al 2016 in hf and wjd most dom samples showed r t c higher than 2 0 also r t c was significantly higher in hf and wjd than in ch p 0 016 but without significant difference between them p 0 21 this higher microbial activity indicated by r t c in hf and wjd also agrees with the peak t observed as abovementioned as shown in fig 6 the contributions from allochthonous dom sources as calculated by the two member mixing model were largest in lake ch porewater and lowest in wjd based on previous studies of typical algae bacterial and terrestrial humic om sources we used typical n c molar ratios values of 0 1 and 0 02 for autochthonous and allochthonous dom respectively perdue and koprivnjak 2007 the mixture of allochthonous and autochthonous sources of dom showed a great consistency among the 7 9 sediment samples within each lake fig 6 the trend among the three lakes was that the ch lake had the highest terrestrial source contribution 66 83 followed by hf 40 75 and the wjd lake had the smallest contribution from terrestrial humic sources 11 45 this trend is well in agreement with the reported suva254 and fi values and relationships of each of those with dom in the three lakes figs 3 and 5 thus these mixing model results in further agreement with the spectral results that the different characteristics of dom are heavily dependent on the sources and anthropogenic activity in conclusion our results show strong signs that dom in the sediment porewaters of all three lakes is a mixture of allochthonous and autochthonous sources porewater in ch lake sediment is clearly controlled by terrestrial inputs showing a distinctly higher humic character as compared to the other two lakes in contrast samples from hf and wjd were more inclined to be influenced by autochthonous algal bacterial organic matter production 3 5 concentrations of mercury in porewater and sediment concentrations of dthg and dmehg ranged over more than one order of magnitude 1 8 17 3 and 0 002 9 4 ng l 1 respectively lake hf and wjd showed higher concentrations of dthg p 0 026 than ch lake mean 3 1 ng l 1 but the highest dmehg concentration was found in wjd mean 2 1 ng l 1 fig 7 a a significant relationship between dmehg and dthg fig 7 a p 0 013 was only observed in lake wjd to resolve the underlying processes behind relationships between total hg and mehg concentrations in sediment and porewater we need to consider several factors and processes skyllberg 2008 drott et al 2008 jonsson et al 2012 2014 the porewater hg concentration is controlled by two factors 1 inorganic hg storage and 2 the partition of hg between aqueous and solid phases the concentration of mehg in porewater is similarly dependent on the total concentration of mehg in the sediment and its partitioning into the aqueous phase but is also affected by the rate of mehg net formation by methylating bacteria and subsequent demethylation the bacteria in turn require electron donors labile om electron acceptors e g h2 sulfate fe iii and inorganic hg which serves as a substrate for the mehg formations based on this thinking the ratio of mehg thg mehg in sediment skyllberg 2008 drott et al 2008 has been shown to be a relevant proxy for the net hg methylation efficiency at a specific site like the analysis of porewaters wjd showed the highest mehg and absolute mehg concentration in sediments fig 7 b and fig s1 indicating the greatest methylation potential of the three lakes the average distribution partition coefficient kd l kg 1 calculated as kd cs cw where cs mg kg 1 and cw mg l 1 are the concentrations in the solid and aqueous phases respectively did not show any significant differences among the three lake sediments fig 7 b b thus the partition of thg commonly caused by differences in solid phase composition of hg or in concentrations of high affinity ligands thiols and inorganic sulfides did not differ among the three lakes the concentration of mehg both in sediment and porewater differed substantially among the three lakes figs s1 a being most concentrated in wjd lake sediments and least concentrated in ch 3 6 environmental implication of porewater dom properties associations with hg a strong positive correlation between hg and doc concentration is often reported in studies of boreal and temperate forest streams suggesting that hg fate in aquatic systems is linked with dom mierle and ingram 1991 driscoll et al 1995 hurley et al 1998 dittman et al 2009 bergamaschi et al 2012 in this study supporting information 6 fig s2 only ch lake showed a significant positive correlation between doc and dthg p 0 033 the fact that dthg was positively correlated also with suva254 fig 8 a bix figs s3 a and fi figs s3 b supporting information 7 fig s3 indicates that dom was enriched in terrestrial dom and points at terrestrial inputs being the major source of hg in lake ch terrestrial inputs has been highlighted as important sources of thg for streams eklöf et al 2012 bravo et al 2018 in comparison to the other two lakes the lack of correlation between dthg and protein parameters e g peak t and r t c is consistent with ch being a natural pristine lake highly influenced by terrestrial soil runoff the negative relationship between dthg and s r figs s3 c further supports the notion that dthg variability is heavily dependent on dom molecular mass distribution yet significant correlations between dmehg and bix fig 8 b and fi figs s3 d suggest that mehg levels in porewater were associated with microbial activities in lake ch this is supported by the negative relationship found between of dissolved dmehg and s r figs s3 e which indicates high dmehg concentrations linked to the presence of low molecular mass dom microbial dom processing could result in high optical signatures of low molecular mass protein like components helms et al 2008 and enhance hg ii methylation bravo et al 2017 noh et al 2018 herrero ortega et al 2017 lake hf presented a contrasting dom signature compared to ch for example dthg and dmehg did not show any significant correlation with neither doc nor cdom fig s2 in this lake autochthonous dom seemed to be a predominant factor responsible for hg variability in porewater as indicated by the significant negative correlation of dthg p 0 003 and dmehg p 0 030 with fi fig 8 c and d additionally the correlation between dmehg and bix supporting information 8 fig s4 a and between mehg and protein like peak t figs s4 b reveals a link between microbial activities and mehg concentration yet dmehg was negatively correlated to r t c figs s4 c in hf possibly indicative of an inhibitory effect on mehg net production caused by a change from more humic like to protein like components yet as aforementioned protein like components in porewater dom in lake hf may not originate only from autochthonous production but also from anthropogenic effluents fig 5 b thus this negative correlation may be the effect of the dilution of protein like characteristics by elevated anthropogenic wastewater inputs instead of merely a consequence of microbial algae production a similar dilution effect may also explain the negative correlation between dthg and fi fig 8 c and between dmehg and fi fig 8 d other possible reason may be that the hg associated with autochthonous dom could deposit in sediments of relative stagnant water bodies such as lake hf this explanation is also supported by the large kd value fig 7 b indicating that solid phase partitioning was an important factor behind the relationship between hg and dom in lake hf porewater in wjd dthg was inversely correlated with doc supporting information 9 figs s5 a and bix figs s5 b suggesting that high doc concentrations with microbial algae signatures could be associated with a decrease in dthg these relations could be explained by two processes 1 biodilution pickhardt et al 2002 and or 2 abiotic reduction of hg ii by dom the first process is enhanced by bacterial uptake and or adsorption of hg onto biomass surfaces during high algal and bacterial production which results in high doc concentrations and bix values the latter process abiotic reduction of hg ii by natural organic matter is ubiquitous in aquatic systems gu et al 2010 jiang et al 2015 and highly enhanced by solar radiation zheng and hintelmann 2009 however this process is not likely to account for data observed in wjd due to the structure specific reduction process of hg ii complexed by weakly bonding ro n e g carboxyl and amino groups and the much stronger bonding rsh e g thiol group in dom with time dependent structural rearrangement jiang et al 2015 estimating the concentration of rsh to be equal to 0 15 doc mass skyllberg 2008 or 0 5 μm of rsh at 10 mg l 1 doc the highest rsh concentrations at the wjd site would be slightly greater than 1 3 μm which indicates the rsh groups are not saturated by hg ii the hg ii rsh ratio is much less than the optimum molar ratios approximately 0 2 10 3 of dark hg ii abiotic reduction gu et al 2010 jiang et al 2015 thus dark reduction processes can likely be discarded as being of major importance although mehg microbial degradation could be a contributor to the inverse correlation between mehg and microbial optical parameters e g bix figs s5 c the relatively small log kd fig 7 may suggest that the negative relationship is more likely induced by bio adsorption or accumulation resulting from the vigorous autochthonous activity machado et al 2016 in wjd the concentration of dthg was positively correlated with both suva254 fig 8 e and peak t figs s5 d suggesting that the dthg variability was significantly related with dom at wjd dmehg followed a similar pattern and was positively correlated with suva254 figs s5 e but also with peak t fig 8 f and r t c figs s5 f the correlation of dmehg with suva254 figs s5 e might denote on one hand an import of mehg from the catchment to the lake herrero ortega et al 2017 and on the other hand the fact that specific terrestrial compounds might have also contributed to an enhanced mehg production previous works gerbig et al 2011 graham 2013 zhang et al 2012 2014 have demonstrated that highly aromatic dom can stabilize the aggregation of hgs nano particles which in turn could be utilized by methylating bacteria also higher aromaticity of dom could enhance dmehg released from the solid phase lowering kd as observed in fig 7 d high mehg levels could be also explained by a higher mehg production in wjd meng et al 2010 2016 additionally the possibility of dmehg transported by dom from allochthonous sources could be negligible because the sampling sites in this lake were far from the adjacent lands and the land use is mostly dryland often in an oxic condition the resulting relations between dmehg and dom is more likely explained by the within lake i e internal process rather than runoff transportation i e external this explanation is also supported by the lack of positive correlation between dmehg and dom concentrations in this study fig s2 c and s2 d therefore the influences of dom on hg in wjd were more complicated than in ch and hf lake with the mixture of both allochthonous and autochthonous dom sources causing possible offsetting effects on solubility and net formation of mehg 3 7 composition and bioavailability of dom interplays with hg speciation the relationships between different dom properties and hg overall suggested that mehg net formation in the lake sediments i e hf and wjd of this study especially in wjd is mainly driven by the activity of methylating microbes fig 8 f fig s4 a b and fig s5 f while other studies have reached similar conclusions kim et al 2011 mazrui et al 2016 to our knowledge only one study has measured and thus linked the bacterial activity to hg methylation processes in sediments bravo et al 2017 bioavailability of dom is dependent on dom composition the microbial community and abundance yang et al 2017 thus to confirm the role of the microbial activity as indicated by dom optical signatures and hg methylation in sediments we conducted a biodegradation incubation test for 16 days to fit the kinetic process of biodegradation fig 9 we assumed that the biodegradability of dom in the collected sediment porewaters was decided by two distinct pools with different biodegradation rates represented by labile and recalcitrant dom fractions the degradation was described by the following first order kinetic model kalbitz et al 2003 wickland et al 2007 4 biodegraded dom of the original doc f a 1 e k1 t f b 1 e k2 t where t is time day f a is the percentage of labile dom f b is the percentage of recalcitrant dom and k 1 and k 2 are the biodegradation rate constants for the two fractions of dom respectively the sum of f a and f b is constrained to 1 0 we determined the half life ln2 k i and average residence time 1 k i of the two pools as reported in table 1 theoretically for a given microbial community labile f a and recalcitrant f b fractions of a dom sample from a given site should be the constant the different f values for different sampling sites table 1 may suggest that the microbial communities and their abilities to degrade dom are totally different in the three studied reservoirs for a given dom sample i e the same sample the microbial capacity to utilize dom was greatest in wjd with wjd hf ch table 1 the fastest biodegradation rate was likewise in wjd while ch samples were slowest fig 10 the highest microbial degradation capacity found in wjd is further evidenced by the microbial dom optical signatures as differences of microbial degradation capacities are generally attributed to the differences of microbial activities including either microbial composition diversity or abundance reimers et al 2013 a higher net hg methylation observed in wjd could be attributed to enhanced microbial activity compared to ch and hf 3 8 limits and significances finally the limitations of this study need to be emphasized as a field investigation based on a limited number of samples we hesitate to establish a general model for describing the variations of dissolved hg species influenced by the dom dynamics in lakes the hg cycling in aquatic systems is such a complex process controlled by many biogeochemical factors in addition to dom we also recognize that lab scale experiments designed to study mechanisms proposed here as well as and larger scale spatial temporal field investigations are needed in order to develop such more generalized models it also should be noted that dom optical characterization can be influenced by concentration effects such as inner filter effects gabor et al 2014 thus optical indices should be used with caution and similarly diluted dom samples are recommended to be used when comparisons are made between waters of different regions with that stated this study has demonstrated the importance of spectroscopic characteristics of dom and we recommend these optical measurements be routinely incorporated into future environmental studies when assessing water quality and or predicting potential risks of pollutants associated with dom obviously not all spectral parameters are informative in relation to the hg cycle this can in part be explained by the structural complexity of dom resulting in a non consistent pattern for some optical parameters kothawala et al 2014 hansen et al 2016 jiang et al 2017a b lescord et al 2018 because of this and the inherent heterogeneity of dom a combination of multiple methods e g uv vis absorption plus fluorescence is recommended for adequately assessing the role of dom in the cycle of contaminants leenheer and croué 2003 aiken et al 2011a b jiang et al 2017b lescord et al 2018 4 conclusion based on the spectral analysis of dom a mixing model consisting of two end members of terrestrial and aquatic origins showed that porewater dom characteristics in three chinese lakes varied from predominantly a terrestrial origin in the pristine lake ch to more algal and microbial derived dom in the hf and wjd lakes our results highlight that while the relationships between doc and hg were inconsistent among lakes dom optical properties were useful in elucidating the sources of dom and hg furthermore the often reported correlations between doc and hg is concluded to be more likely observed in natural rather than anthropogenically influenced lakes in the pristine ch lake allochthonous dom was more likely to bind hg ii but it was less able to provide energy for hg methylating microorganisms labile dom from either autochthonous biological production or anthropogenic sources seemed to drive microbial activity and resulted in high mehg concentrations in the two most urban impacted reservoirs wjd and hf three important highlights can be derived from this study 1 microbial activity reflected from fluorescence and absorption spectra of porewater dom could help explain in part the variation in mehg concentration in sediments and porewaters 2 characterization of dom composition could help explain the fate of hg in environmental systems 3 depending on the dom composition an increased dom concentration might either result in high mehg levels transfer and partition when dom has a strong autochthonous signature or low mehg levels when having terrestrial and recalcitrant signatures our results showed that beyond doc concentrations dom properties helped to explain hg cycling in the lake sediments and analyses of dom composition should be considered in studies of hg cycling in aquatic systems acknowledgments this work is financially supported by national natural science

19273,oily water production is one of the many drawbacks of petroleum and several other industries finding effective ways for the treatment of produced water remain one of the main areas of interest in membrane sciences albeit the many advantages of membrane technology they suffer from the unavoidable problem of fouling which results from the accumulation of dispersed materials at the surface of membranes membrane modification and operational optimization have been approached as a potential cure of the problem of fouling in this work we introduce a new and novel method that minimizes the development of fouling and in the same time utilizes no chemicals i e environmentally friendly the core of this method is based on alternating the pressure in the feed channel in a periodic manner and is therefore named the periodic feed pressure technique pfpt the idea is to make pinned droplets at the surface of the membrane lose essential forces that keep them sticking to the surface the drag force due to permeation flux and the capillary force due to interfacial tension represents the two forces that largely contribute to the pinning of oil droplets at the surface of the membrane other forces including buoyancy and lift forces are generally small to be of significant influence the idea of the pfpt is therefore to eliminate the force due to permeation drag this is done by setting the transmembrane pressure tmp to zero at fixed intervals allowing pinned oil droplets to dislodge the surface when the tmp is set to zero permeation flux stops and the force due to permeation drag vanishes this significantly reduces the overall residence time of pinned oil droplets minimizing the chance for other oil droplets to cluster and coalesce with pinned ones the pfpt does not cause any damage to the support layer of the polymeric membrane which is a drawback of back flushing methodology the novel pfpt displays minimal membrane fouling and very similar permeation recovery despite only half the cycle time is in filtration mode in this work we show how the permeation flux is recovered and provide comparisons between the pfpt and regular filtration methodology furthermore we compare the overall amount of filtrate at the end of the experiments using both methods it is interesting to note that the amount of filtrate using the pfpt is very much comparable to that obtained using regular filtration methodology and even higher by optimizing the frequency of the cycle and the amplitude of the pressure change it is possible to customize the pfpt to various membrane technologies and to achieve the highest recovery of the flux visual inspections of the membranes post operation and post rinsing indicate that membranes undergoing filtration using the pfpt achieves a very clean surface compared with those undergoing regular filtration processes this method is a promising solution to membrane fouling that is easy to implement without any additional use of chemicals or equipment computational fluid dynamics cfd investigation is also conducted on microfiltration processes to show why this technique works graphical abstract image 1 keywords produced water fouling in porous membranes polymeric type membranes cfd 1 introduction produced water generated from the petroleum industry is an important waste stream its management is a significant challenge due to its highly pollutant nature and the large volume of wastewater generated other industries contributing to the production of produced water include food processing metal fabrication power plants pharmaceutical and several other industries mondal 2016 finding effective ways to treat and reuse produced water can lead to financial sustainability of the industry and generate a water source for positive use such as irrigation or reuse by the industry itself membrane filtration technology is leading the way for oily wastewater treatment because of its many advantages they are relatively cheap easy to operate and maintain consume less power etc fakhru l razi et al 2009 padaki et al 2015 however membrane technology also suffers from an unavoidable problem that results in the deterioration of its performance with time this is called membrane fouling and is related to the inevitable accumulation of dispersed materials at the surface of the membrane padaki et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 such accumulation of materials blocks the openings of the membrane pores reducing thereby the area available for filtration the selectivity feature of a membrane controls how the membrane responds to the incoming flux of materials it is also an important design parameter that needs to be optimized the selectivity function of a membrane depends on many things including factors unique to the membrane surface and its properties the properties of the feed stream and the operating conditions of the filtration unit fakhru l razi et al 2009 bilad et al 2012 padaki et al 2015 membrane surface properties are known to play a role in flux control and rate of fouling development examples of these properties include pore sizes surface roughness surface electrical charge and affinity to the dispersed materials dickhout et al 2017 carpintero tepole et al 2017 in particular pore sizes and hydrophilicity character of the membranes are known to play a key role in filtration process and the development of fouling wang and lin 2017 agrwalt et al 2013 studied the effect of membrane surface properties on separation performance of membranes where they highlighted that an ideal membrane is the one that has minimal roughness and is superhydrophilic the importance of surface charge and contact angle was considered in the work of essafi et al 2005 and dresselhuis et al 2008 dresselhuis et al 2008 suggested that a higher ionic strength of the emulsion leads to more spreading of the oil droplet along the membrane surface particularly when oil content is large membrane surface properties is determined by the type of the materials used to fabricate the membrane ceramic and polymeric membranes have both been used for produced water treatment ceramic membranes are made of inorganic materials that are inert to harsh conditions such as solvents and extreme temperatures dickhout et al 2017 polymeric membranes on the other hand are made of organic materials and allow for a more selective separation a key feature unfound in ceramic membranes dickhout et al 2017 membrane modification can lead to the enhancement of the surface properties to optimize the flux and minimize fouling khulbe et al 2010 produced water is considered an oil in water emulsion where the oil phase is dispersed in the aqueous phase dickhout et al 2017 the exact composition of produced water can vary based on its source however the common components include dissolved inorganic and organic material dispersed oil and suspended solids mixed with chemical stabilizers and surfactants sheng 2011 at relatively higher concentrations the stability of the emulsion is influenced by the repulsive electrostatic forces between the droplets and the attractive van der waals forces these forces interact with the inherent charge of the membrane surface influencing filtration rejection and fouling rates dickhout et al 2017 another key player in the rate of membrane fouling and function is the operational conditions operational conditions including crossflow velocity cfv and transmembrane pressure tmp are strongly related to the flux and fouling rates of the membrane carpintero tepole et al 2017 zoubeik et al 2017 there are critical tmp and cfv that need to be estimated to ensure optimal operation of the membrane for example when oil droplets attach to the surface of the membrane they form interfaces that prevent pinned droplets from permeation unless a threshold pressure is surpassed therefore adjusting the tmp such that the threshold pressure is not exceeded ensures that most of the dispersed oil droplets do not permeate on the other hand it is required that the cfv be larger than the critical velocity associated with each size of oil droplets such that pinned droplets may easily detach by the crossflow field however as the filtration process starts accumulation of oil droplets and debris occurs along the surface of the membrane and within the membrane pores leading to fouling as this layer develops more and more oil droplets and debris adhere to form a gel like layer the literature contains many studies that have looked at ways to combat the development of fouling via membrane features and properties modifications ochoa et al 2003 xie et al 2017 liu et al 2017 wang and lin 2017 others have considered intervening with the hydrodynamic forces affecting the stability of pinned droplets by methods like back flushing qaisrani and samhaber 2011 pourbozorg et al 2016 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 ultrasound vibration ahmad 2012 hengl 2014 pulsating flow rodgers and sparks 1992 and crossflow filtration ozaki and yamamoto 2001 crossflow filtration in particular has gained recognition because of its effectiveness in reducing the problem of fouling when the crossflow rate achieves critical velocity pinned oil droplets along the membrane surface are flushed away tanudjaja et al 2017 the critical cfv needed is dependent on the droplet and pore size ranges in addition to interfacial properties of the oil therefore for any given emulsion that is composed of a range of oil droplets and a membrane that has a range of pore sizes the critical cfv that is needed should be maximized to clear off most pinned droplets nevertheless crossflow will not be able to detach all pinned droplets thus accumulations of pinned droplets will occur despite the efforts of the crossflow field leading to the formation of oil chunks that grow to cover the surface of the membrane the point in filtration time where the oil residues start to wet the membrane surface marks the point of irreversible fouling therefore for an antifouling intervention to be effective it must be applied before the point of membrane wetting liu et al 2017 once irreversible fouling occurs hydraulic cleaning is no longer effective in order to better understand the point of occurrence of irreversible fouling recent studies have implemented new visualization methods in order to monitor the fate of oil droplets during filtration from these studies three stages of oil droplet behavior have been identified these include populating the surface of the membrane with oil droplets clustering and or coalescence of incoming droplets with pinned ones and the growth of coalesced oil droplets to form oil chunks or laminates aimar and bacchin 2010 tummons et al 2016 to minimize the problem of fouling one needs to interfere with the previously mentioned mechanisms in attempts to prevent eliminate and minimize their evolution one way has been to introduce chemical materials e g surfactants to the feed mixture to alter the surface tension properties of the oil in water emulsion agarwal et al 2013 zhu et al 2017 such alteration can affect the affinity properties of the oil interfering thereby with the pinning characteristics of oil droplets however as this method involves the addition of chemicals it poses hazards to the environment and is therefore not favorable in this regard physical methods are generally cleaner one such physical methods has been to periodically clean the membrane surface by back flushing which provides an interesting cleaning procedure by alternating the permeation flux direction across the membrane in a predetermined pattern of the alternating pressure field between the feed and the permeate sides it is possible by reversing the flow to open blocked channels and partially restore the performance of the membrane zhu et al 2017 however this process is only effective in partially opening blocked pores while the rest of the gel layer continues to stick to the surface over these attached layers other incoming oil droplets attach and extend to relock opened pores furthermore back flushing is not recommended for some setups due to technical difficulties it is not recommended by the industry for membranes with external support layers e g polymeric membranes in back flushing the pressure in the permeate exceeds the pressure in the feed in this case not only can the membrane delaminate active layer lifted off of the support structure the glue lines sealing the membrane envelopes in spiral wound elements can also be pulled apart as noted either occurrence destroys the membrane https dowac custhelp com app answers detail a id 971 alternatively instead of reversing the direction of permeation flux another method based on pulsating flow has been proposed in pulsating flow methods both the crossflow and permeation flux stop and resume following certain frequency the idea has been to promote instabilities in the flow field to allow for ease dislodgment of pinned droplets however this technique may be effective at the very short transient period between stopping and resuming the flow once both the cfv and permeation flux resume fouling likewise resumes it is believed that the best technique to minimizing the problem of fouling is to dislodge pinned oil droplets before they start to make the gel layer in this work we introduce another technique that is somewhat located between the two previously mentioned techniques namely back flushing and pulsating flow we call this technique the periodic feed pressure technique pfpt in which the crossflow field never stops rather the permeation flux is the one that stops at regular intervals the pfpt has the advantage that it shortens the residence time of pinned oil droplets at the surface of the membrane this is done by periodically changing the pressure of the feed channel according to particular pattern as will be discussed in the next section so when the pressure is high the permeation of water brings with it oil droplets to the surface of the membrane when the pressure is lowered the crossflow will be able to dislodge attached oil droplets an experimental work is conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the pfpt and to provide a proof of concept of the antifouling characteristics of the pfpt we also provide a computational study using cfd to investigate the fate of oil droplets in the feed stream and at the surface of the membrane when the tmp is set to zero this cfd study highlights why this technique works by analyzing the behavior of pinned oil droplets when the pressure is set to zero 2 the periodic feed pressure technique pfpt in order to determine why the periodic feed pressure technique works in eliminating the problem of fouling it is important to highlight the different hydrodynamic forces that determine the fate of oil droplets at the surface of the membrane nazzal and wiesner 1996 tummons et al 2016 salama et al 2017 2018 salama 2018 a d a droplet in the feed stream is dragged towards the membrane by the permeation flux therefore if the permeation flux is set to zero no such drag force exists and oil droplets will continue to be dispersed in the feed stream in this case oil droplets pinning at the surface of the membrane by the virtue of the hydrodynamic forces drag force due to flow field the lift force due to the asymmetric flow field around the droplet and the buyouncy due to density difference will loose important force component that is due to the permeation flux it should be mentioned that electrostatic forces have not been considered for the oily water system studied in the cfd work while it may have been possible to investigate electrostatic effects associated with particles deposition in the feed stream as in the work of kim and zydney 2006 in oily water systems it is more complex by the apparent mobility of charges and ions furthermore previous works on the stability of oil droplets at membrane surface e g darvishzadeh and priezjev 2012 tummons et al 2016 and others have ignored the effect of electostatic charges this imbalance of forces will lead to the detachment of oil droplets from the surface of the membrane furthermore for oil droplets that are permeating as long as part of the leading interface still exists in the pore space when the tmp is set to zero oil droplet will recoil pulling the leading interface back to the feed stream likewise oil droplets that are experiencing breakup the broken portion of the droplet in the pore space will move backward towards the feed side in other words for all the scenarios when the tmp is set to zero oil droplets will dislodge from the surface this is essentially the essence of the periodic feed pressure technique as will be explained in the next section fig 1 shows schematically the different hydrodynamic forces applied on a pinned oil droplet as explained the permeation of water through porous membranes introduces hydrodynamic drag force that pulls dispersed oil droplets towards the membrane surface when the oil droplets pin over pore openings they anchor themselves at the membrane surface by forming an interface at the entrance of pore openings if pinned oil droplets are not detached by crossflow filtration or permeated through the membrane that is if the tmp is larger than the threshold critical entry pressure they stay pinned forming thereby the seeds for other incoming droplets to cluster and or coaleasce with if the permeation flux is reduced or eliminated the incoming flux of dragged oil droplets likewise is reduced furthermore pinned oil droplets will not be stable at the membrane surface therefore if the crossflow field is maintained pinned oil droplets will easily detach off the membrane surface as a proof of concept in this work we introduce an experimental study on the effect of periodic pressure field pattern on the permeation flux with time fig 2 shows the pattern of the periodic pressure field studied in this work two periodic patterns are considered namely a 1 1 and a 1 2 cycles in the 1 1 cycle a 1 min of filtration and a 1 min of cleaning are used in the 1 2 cycle on the other hand a 1 min of filtration and a 2 min of cleaning are used during half the cycle the tmp is large and permeation occurs and during the second half no permeation takes place and the crossflow field cleans the surface of the membrane in the 1 2 cycle the cleaning time doubles the filtration time and therefore it can achieve higher cleaning capacity it is interesting to know whether this technique would result in less overall filtration capacity of the membrane or not based on the fact that the permeation time is smaller by 50 for the 1 1 cycle and by 66 for the 1 2 we compare this technique with the classical case in which the pressure field is continuous with time 3 experimental setup the filtration system used in this experimental work is provided by sterlitech corporation usa fig 3 shows a schematic diagram of the setup used throughout the course of this work as depicted in fig 3 the feed is stored in a stainless steel tank of 5 gallon capacity from there it is pumped into the stainless steel membrane cell cf042 316 from sterlitech corporation at high speed generated by a hydracell cc pump with speed control by emerson controller there are multiple control valves for safety and pressure flow monitoring which are obtained from swagelok co additionally the pressure sensors that are found on either side of the membrane cell are obtained from turck inc the pressure detectors have an accuracy of 0 3 with the signal fed into digital display unit the retentate tube is connected to brine control valve and then to dwyer digital flow meter with an accuracy of 1 the discharge from digital flow meter is then reconnected back into the feed tank the permeate component is collected in a beaker placed on a mass balance from mettler toledo ms4002s with repeatability standard deviation of 0 01 g this is then recorded automatically where the mass balance is logged to a computer that records all the weights and displays them on output screen the performance of the membrane is assessed by determining the oil content in the permeate the oil content was analyzed using the horiba ocma 350 analyzer utilizing a non dispersive infrared ndir spectrophotometric technique the oil analyzer is able to detect the oil content with an uncertainty of 4 mg l although stability of the emulsion was not tested it is our belief that the relatively small oil content and the continuous agitation of the feed by the flow field maintains the dispersal of the oil droplets furthermore no aggregation or formation of larger size oil chunks has been observed during the course of the experimental work the characteristics of the membrane used in this study is shown in table 1 4 operational procedures the membranes were first treated by an overnight soak in di water before placement in the filtration cell the operating parameters were adjusted by the control valves to the desired settings the filtration unit was then initiated and once the permeation flux stabilizes the mass of permeate collected in grams every 3 s was recorded by the computer system a small amount of the permeate was collected for analysis after a few minutes of operation the performance of the membrane at the particular operating conditions is then calculated in terms of the permeation flux and the rejection capacity the amount of permeate was converted into volume of permeate obtained per unit area of membrane per unit time l m2 h the permeate flow once measured was returned to the feed tank in order to maintain a feed with a constant concentration the oil rejection efficiency was calculated using r o c f c f c f 100 initially the filtration experiment was performed using the three feeds with different oil concentrations without the use of the periodic feed pressure technique as our control then the same general process was repeated with the addition of the pressure technique for each of the three feeds in addition thermogravimetric analysis was performed on the membrane prior to fouling and post filtration to investigate the weight decomposition for each the feed was fashioned in the lab with the inspiration of oil from the bakken reservoir in western canada to allow for ease of access to produced water for the experiments and a constant reliable supply of water the use of synthetic oil feed is relatively common in the literature and used by many authors for testing membrane filtration for produced water treatment as highlighted by weschenfelder et al 2015 the density of the oil used to generate the oily emulsion was measured with an anton paar dsa 5000 m digital densitometer 5 10 5 g cm3 the oil used was light oil with a measured density of 0 87844 g cc obtained using anton paar dsa 5000 m digital densitometer with an uncertainty of 5 10 5 g cm3 and a viscosity of 5 23 cp 1 0 accuracy measured by viscometer dv ii pro at 22 5 c a total volume of 0 15 ml 0 31 ml and 0 41 ml of bakken oil was added to a 2 l of ro water and mixed in blender at 18 000 rpm for 2 min to generate a 50 mg l 150 mg l and 200 mg l feeds respectively the oil content of the feed was then measured using oil content analyzer company horiba the contact angle of the oily emulsion on the mw membrane was measured to be approximately 135 using dsa 100 drop shape analyzer with uncertainty 2 the oil droplet size was measured using mastersizer 3000 which required the following properties namely a reflective index of 1 45 and a density of 0 8 g cc the experimental work began with the determination of the oil droplet size distribution the results are seen in graphical form in fig 4 along with the contact angle of the oil droplet 135 2 the resistance of the membrane is experimentally determined by plotting the flux of pure water at different tmp levels and constructing the linear relationship where the slop of the line is equal to the membrane resistance the pure water flux was determined via the permeate weight conversion method fig 5 shows the fitted relationship between the flux and the pressure difference measurements membrane resistance is dependent on many factors including membrane thickness nominal pore size and various morphological features such as the tortuosity porosity and pore size distribution ergun 1952 alsari et al 2007 and many others it is important to report the rejection characteristics of the membrane at the early stage of the filtration process as seen in table 2 the rejection capacity of the membrane is almost 100 for the three considered feeds these membranes therefore are prone to intensified fouling due to their higher rejection capacities and are chosen thereby to test the pfpt 5 results and discussion in order to highlight the significance of the periodic feed pressure technique the results are categorized in three parts in the first the behavior of the membrane to the different feed streams is investigated considering normal filtration cycle i e no periodicity in the feed side pressure then we apply the new technique and compare the flux decline with time for the three feeds second we compare the total amount of permeate at the end of the experiments to investigate the effect of the no permeation half cycle on the permeation flow thirdly visual inspection of the membranes after the experiments indicates how clean the membranes are for the normal and the periodic feed pressure techniques as indicated the filtration experiments were performed initially without the application of the periodic feed pressure method and the flux decline is depicted in fig 6 the feed with the lowest oil concentration showed the slowest rate of flux decline this reflects and supports the theory of the oil droplet behavior at the surface of the membrane as oil droplets increase in number they aggregate and form layers of debris that lead to decrease in flux and an increase in fouling development the flux l m2 hr for the three feeds at the beginning of the experiments which is used to normalize the flux curves are given in table 3 there is very little difference in the maximum permeation flux at the beginning of the experiments is observed this is essentially because the three used membranes are of the same type the development of fouling along the feed side of the membrane is captured at different times fouling appears once oil droplets pin over the surface of the membrane if the time taken for pinned oil droplets to fully permeate breakup or dislodge the surface is relatively long there is a large chance that incoming oil droplets coalesce and cluster with pinned droplets this results in the formation of larger size droplets chunks or laminates of oil films that spread over the surface and block the area available for filtration this behavior is depicted in fig 7 that shows successive pictures of the surface of the membrane after different times of operation one notices that as time proceeds larger oil droplets and chunks of oil laminates develop at the surface of the membrane and the color of the membrane becomes more yellowish until the membrane is fully covered with oil layer if the feed stream contains in addition to the oil content other impurities solid particles debris etc they will deposit over the oil forming a gel like cake layer that is difficult to clean the periodic feed pressure technique is considered to prevent the oil from accumulating along the membrane surface by dividing the filtration process in a cyclic manner to allow filtration during part of the cycle and cleaning in the second part the pfpt is different from both the back flushing and the pulsating flow techniques in the back flushing technique the permeation flux is reversed and in the pulsating flow technique the flows in the feed and the permeate stops and resumes following particular pattern in the pfpt technique the permeation flux stops and resumes while keeping the crossflow field this eliminates permeation drag from holding pinned droplets at the surface of the membrane and make it easy for the crossflow to dislodge them the pfpt therefore is able to clean the whole feed side of the membrane and not only around pore openings the pfpt in this study is implemented following three cycles namely a 1 1 cycle a 1 2 cycle and a 1 2 1 cycle a 1 1 cycle refers to a 1 min permeation and a 1 min cleaning the 1 2 cycle refers to a 1 min permeation and a 2 min cleaning and the 1 2 1 cycle refers likewise to a 1 2 min permeation and a 1 min cleaning a schematic of such cycles is shown in fig 8 as has been mentioned as the motive to the pfpt which is to destabilize oil droplets upon pinning over the membrane visual inspections of the surface of the membrane at different time of operation confirm this fact that is when the permeation drag becomes very small approximately zero and pinned droplets lose the drag force that holds them at the surface oil droplets becomes unstable and can easily dislodge the surface by the crossflow field fig 9 shows pictures of the surface of the feed side of the membrane at different time of operations for the three mentioned pfpt cycles together with the regular filtration technique in all these experiments the oil content is 150 mg l the tmp is set to 1 0 bar and the cfv is set to 1 0 m s the pictures are taken after 0 5 10 20 30 60 80 and 120 min each of these pictures have been captured with respect to new membranes in other words 7 mw membranes have been experimented for each feed pressure pattern to the required time when the picture is to be taken the reason is to minimize the disturbance that may be caused when the membrane is taken from the setup to capture the pictures as seen in fig 9 significant change in the development of fouling can be noticed along the different pfpt cycles following a particular time between the different techniques it is noticed that the intensity of fouling changes between the different feed pressure patterns apparently the smaller the permeation half cycle and the longer the cleaning half cycle the better the performance however this may result in decreasing the overall volume of filtration therefore it is an optimization exercise that would suggest the best cycle that suits particular membrane operating conditions and required filtration capacity furthermore it is to be noticed that the membrane at the end of operation and after rinse with clean water returns to its clean state when using the pfpt technique compared with the case in which regular filtration process occurs in other words the life time of the membrane increases following the use of the pfpt this is very important as it can result in significant saving of time efforts and capital fig 9 suggests that the pfpt is essentially effective in reducing the problem of fouling by providing cleaning periods during the full filtration process furthermore when the cleaning half period is longer the membrane surface is cleaner however making the cleaning period longer intuitively reduces the filtration time and can reduce the overall productivity of the membrane this may be compensated by the increase of the life span of the membrane in the next section we show that this might not essentially be the case and the overall gain that is obtained by the recovery process of the membrane surpasses the reduction in filtration during the cleaning periods before we show this it is important to show the behavior of the permeation flux of the membrane for the three feeds namely the 50 mg l 150 mg l and the 200 mg l oil content concentration the operating conditions for all the feeds are tmp of 1 bar and a cfv of 1 m s three cases are considered with respect to four patterns of the feed pressure namely continuous feed pressure 1 1 pfpt and 1 2 pfpt cycles fig 10 depicts the filtration performance using the 50 mg l feed with the implementation of the periodic feed pressure technique the figure depicts two of the pfpt cycles mentioned before namely the 1 1 and the 1 2 cycles the comparison is done with respect to the permeation flux for the regular filtration process and the two pfpt cycles since the flux obtained using the pfpt alternates between a maximum value during the permeation half cycle and a minimum value during the cleaning half cycle in this graph we only show those associated with the permeation half cycle from fig 10 it is clear that with the normal continuous filtration technique the flux declines with time as a result of fouling development that is oil droplets that neither permeate nor sweep off form the seeds for other droplets to cluster and coalesce with contributing therefore to the development of fouling when the feed pressure follows the 1 1 and the 1 2 cycles the permeation flux recovers to almost the same level when the filtration is first started particularly for the 1 2 cycle this is obviously due to the fact that the cleaning half cycle is longer it also confirms the findings that were obtained through our previous cfd investigation introduced later which highlights that when the pressure in the feed side is set to zero oil droplets undergoing different fates are going to dislodge from the membrane pores when the oil content in the feed stream is 150 mg l the decline in the permeation flux when following regular filtration pattern is faster as depicted in fig 11 on using the periodic feed pressure technique following the 1 1 and the 1 2 cycles better performance is generally observed with the permeation flux recovered to approximately 80 the performance associated with the 1 2 cycle is generally better than the 1 1 cycle similar pattern is also observed for the case when the feed stream had an oil content of 200 mg l fig 12 it is to be noted that the difference between the 150 and the 200 feed oil content is not significantly large and therefore approximately similar patterns of flux recovery is generally observed the general trend is that the permeation flux generally recovers when using the periodic feed pressure technique compared with the regular filtration process also the recovery of the permeation flux is very much dependent of the feed oil concentration and the used pressure cycle the fact that the permeation flux did not recover to almost 100 when the oil content is large highlights that a higher frequency of the periodic feed pressure cycle may need to be implemented to recover the flux back to its original value it is interesting to investigate how the cyclic feed pressure technique will affect the total amount of filtrate at the end of the experiments intuitively one may think that the total amount of filtrate obtained using the periodic feed pressure technique is going to be less than that obtained using regular filtration technique this may be because the time of filtration in the 1 1 cyclic pressure field is half the total time and in the 1 2 cyclic pressure field it is 1 3 of the total time however as shown in fig 13 this is not always true in fact the total amount of filtrate when the oil content in the feed stream is the smallest is very much closer to that when the feed pressure follows the regular pattern when the oil content is larger it is found that the cyclic feed pressure technique produces larger amount of filtrate than the regular process furthermore the 1 2 cyclic pressure field produces the largest it is interesting to highlight the state of the membrane after filtration using the regular filtration process the 1 1 the 1 2 and the 1 2 1 cyclic feed pressure technique which is depicted in fig 9 this figure shows the actual membrane post filtration and post water rinse visual inspections at the end of filtration show that the membrane undergoing the regular filtration process is essentially covered with larger amount of oil after each membrane was rinsed with water the oil at the surface of the membrane largely washes away however for the tested membrane following regular filtration process the surface remains stained and appears yellowish indicating that the oil droplets have invaded the pore cells and started to form a layer of oil films at the surface membranes undergoing 1 1 1 2 and 1 2 1 cycles pfpt on the other hand are to a large extent cleaner and almost recovered to its original state when they get washed with water the surface is almost an oil free environment overall with the use of pfpt oil droplets at the surface and within the pore oscillate and become unstable and this prevents the permanent adherence of oil droplets to the pore walls the membrane is easily cleaned with no staining when the pfpt method is not applied there is increased residence time of the oil droplets at the surface of the membrane and within the pore increasing therefore the chance to get bind to the membrane and pore surface this confirms the effectiveness of the periodic feed pressure technique in eliminating the problem of fouling and in increasing the life span of the membrane thermogravimetric analysis was also performed the results are shown in fig 14 the pre filtration plain membrane showed a weight loss of about 30 wt at around 160 c due to the decomposition of the coating layer on the membrane surface another step seen on the graph of weight loss is seen between 280 c and 400 c is also observed on all the samples due to the decomposition of the membrane support material when the plain mw membrane was thoroughly rinsed with water the extra coating layer on the membrane surface must have suffered some breakdown hence a minor weight loss is recorded for the sample at 160 c on the other hand the post filtration membrane using the periodic feed pressure technique showed a similar profile to the rinsed membrane indicating that no fouling was observed due to the pressure technique whereas the sample obtained after regular filtration with no pressure technique has shown an extra weight loss attributed to the amount of fouling oil on the membrane surface and pores 6 cfd investigation of the microfiltration problem the computational investigation of the behavior of an oil droplet at the membrane surface involving the different fates is conducted using the volume of fluid vof two phase framework enright et al 2002 hirt and nichols 1981 the study of multiphase flows requires the need to capture the interface as the oil droplet is transported along the surface or penetrating through the pore opening there are generally two basic categories when modeling a two phase system involving interface dynamics these are the sharp interface and the diffuse interface models bao et al 2016 2018 in this work we use the vof model along with the finite volume technique because it satisfies the conservation laws locally ansys fluent is used as our vehicle to conduct this study the governing equations that describe the dynamic behavior of this system involve the conservation of mass momentum as well as the transport of a phase field function that describes the phases the volume of fluid method is based on the fact that the two phases form an impenetrable interface where for example each cell in the mesh can either be filled with one of the phases a specific phase zone or be a combination of the two phase interface this is accomplished by defining a phase function α called the volume fraction which is the volume of one phase in the cell over the total cell volume the interface is tracked by solving a transport equation for the volume fraction as well as the momentum equation 1 α t u α 0 where u is the velocity vector along which α is transported the density is calculated by 2 ρ 1 α ρ 1 α ρ 2 where ρ is the average density ρ 1 is the density of phase 1 and ρ 2 is the density of phase 2 one momentum equation is solved and the velocity field is shared between the two phases the momentum equation may be written as 3 ρ u t ρ u u p μ u u t ρ g f where u is the velocity vector g is the gravity vector p is the pressure μ is the viscosity and f is the surface tension force the surface tension force is determined by the following equation 4 f σ ρ κ α 1 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 where σ is the surface tension between the two phases and κ is the mean curvature which is computed in terms of the normal vector to the interface n via 5 κ 1 n n n n n the surface tension force is equal to nonzero only at the interface and it acts in the direction normal to the interface if the interface is in contact with the wall the normal vector is found via the contact angle 6 n i n w cos θ s t n t sin θ s t where n w is the unit vector normal to the wall nt is a vector on the wall and normal to the contact line and θ s t is the contact angle to have a closed system the navier stokes equations require boundary conditions to be outlined for that the membrane surface is considered a no slip boundary the top wall is considered a moving boundary pressure boundary conditions were assigned to the two side boundaries and the outlet of the pore and the two boundaries normal to the flow direction are assigned a periodic conditions more details about the boundary condition are stated in the next section a simple algorithm was used for the pressure velocity decoupling the momentum equation was discretized using a second order upwind scheme to reconstruct the interface and consequently solve the volume fraction transport equation a piecewise linear interface reconstruction method was used the convergence criteria for the different variables has been set to 10 4 for the velocities and continuity and the maximum iteration per time step is set to 100 7 the computational model in this section we provide reasoning why the pfpt technique works in eliminating the problem of fouling by conducting a computational study on microfiltration using cfd the purpose is to highlight the behavior of oil droplets undergoing different fates when the tmp is set to zero the computational domain chosen for this study is very much like that considered in darvishzadeh and priezjev 2012 this provides a framework for comparisons with their work to build confidence in our numerical setup in addition to testing the proposed technique the continuous phase assumed in this work is water and the dispersed phase is oil the properties assumed for the oil include a density of 889 kg m3 a viscosity of 0 0021 pa s and a surface tension of 19 1 mn m for water the density is taken as 998 2 kg m3 and the viscosity is 0 001 pa s the solid surfaces of the domain were considered olephopic with a contact angle greater than 90 the geometry of the computational domain represents a rectangular conduit with a circular pore in the middle as depicted in figure s1 in the supplementary materials the height z direction width y direction and length x direction of the conduit are 2 07 7 and 9 μm respectively a circular pore with a radius of 0 2 μm was created in the middle of the bottom surface with the pore length z direction set to 1 5 μm ansys icem has been used to generate the mesh that consists of hexagonal grids as shown in figure s2 the base mesh used throughout this study is designed such that the number of nodes for the conduit along the x y and z directions are 100 75 and 50 respectively the cylindrical pore cross section is discretized with about 30 cells and 50 nodes were set along the pore length dependency of simulation results on grid resolution have been tested using three meshes namely the base mesh a 2 times finer mesh 2 times the number of nodes in each direction and a 2 times coarser mesh half the mesh in each direction in the case of the finer mesh the number of nodes for the rectangular conduit in the x y and z directions are 200 150 and 100 respectively and the number of cells in the pore section is 60 and 100 nodes along the pore length the volume of fluid vof method has been used in fluent for the simulation of the two phase system a spherical oil droplet was created with a radius of 0 9 μm with the x y and z coordinates of the center of the oil droplet set to 3 4 3 5 and 0 7 μm respectively in other words the droplet is created in the middle just before the entrance of the pore at the bottom surface of the conduit the reason why a droplet of diameter 0 9 μm is chosen for our cfd study is to be able to conduct comparison and validation exercises with previous works in literature to build confidence of our approach in other words it will not change the conclusions obtained from the cfd study should we choose different sizes of the droplets as long as the continuum hypothesis still applies and the same kind of forces are considered when the simulation starts the droplet establishes the equilibrium configuration determined by the surface tension and the contact angle the two boundaries of the duct which are perpendicular to the x axis are assumed periodic boundary conditions the side boundaries of the duct perpendicular to the y axis are pressure inlet boundaries with the inlet pressure set to a predefined value according to the studied scenario the top boundary perpendicular to z axis is considered a moving wall with the velocity likewise pre set according to the required scenario in the positive direction of the x axis direction of the fluid flow the contact angle of the oil droplet at the oil water surface contact along the bottom surface of the conduit as well as along the pore wall was set to 135 the pore bottom boundary is set to pressure outlet boundary with a value of 0 to create the necessary transmembrane pressure the droplet can either enter the pore reside at the entrance of the pore or breakup as indicated earlier the grid resolution might influence the velocity of the droplet due to shear flow using finer meshes 2 times finer for simulations for different situations including breakup rejection and permeation it was confirmed that the resolution of the base mesh was appropriate and simulation results with finer mesh was identical to that of the base mesh this is apparent when comparing the droplet configuration at different times using the three mesh resolutions as depicted in figure s3 from this figure the base mesh is sufficient to provide similar results as those obtained by the finer mesh the coarser mesh generated an interface that is not uniform and is not similar to this obtained by the two other mesh resolutions therefore throughout this work the base mesh resolution will be considered 8 validation of the computational model in order to build confidence in our modeling approach we begin by replicating the computational work found in darvishzadeh and priezjev 2012 and darvishzadeh et al 2013 who looked at the effects of the transmembrane pressure and the shear rate on the behavior of an oil droplet upon encountering a pore opening the simulation continued until the droplet either reaches the outlet penetrates the pore or breaks up four cases were considered that represent four scenarios including rejection permeation and two cases for breakup the conditions adapted to each scenario are shown in table s1 as seen in figure s4 there is a very good resemblance of the different snapshots of the oil droplet at different stages between our simulation and that of darvishzadeh and priezjev 2012 the snapshots of the droplet reflect three different scenarios that can occur which include rejection a aa permeation b bb and break up d dd e ee cases referred to with a single capital letter are those of darvishzadeh et al 2013 and those referred to by double capital letters are from the current simulations looking at the snapshot a which depicts the rejection process at low shear rates under this scenario the droplet passes by the membrane pore without penetration the flow along the membrane drags the droplet along the bottom surface and from the pore opening moving along and examining the snapshot b which falls under the permeation category the droplet penetrates the pore and becomes deformed by the flow and gets pulled into the pore before it is able to breakup this scenario represents the case in which the shear rate is relatively lower with increasing shear rates the effective hydrodynamic forces cause strong droplet deformation at the entrance of the pore leading the droplet to break up as seen in snapshots d and e the higher shear rates cause the deformation and breakup of the droplet the level of the transmembrane pressure determines the minimum breakup pressure snapshot d is just above the minimum breakup pressure and thus a small fragment of the droplet is broken up but the main droplet is carried away by the shear flow at higher transmembrane pressures as seen in snapshot e the breakup of the oil droplet is more significant as the droplet comes in contact with the pore at higher pressures the droplet almost pauses above the pore leading to considerable change in the shape of the droplet and causing it to stretch out in combination of high shear flow the stretched out droplet breakups the volume of the portion of the droplet that gets broken is proportional to the applied pressure in figure s5 comparison between the volumes of that portion of the droplet remained inside the pore after breakup for different tmp between darvishzadeh and priezjev 2012 and our work indicates that very good agreement is obtained 9 cfd modeling using the periodic feed pressure technique in the previous discussion it was mentioned that an effective way to minimize the problem of fouling may be to interfere with the different hydrodynamic forces that lead to the deposition of oil droplets at the surface of the membrane the idea has been to interfere with the previously mentioned mechanisms that affect the stability of oil droplets at the surface of the membrane it has been determined that the tmp represents a key parameter that plays a significant role in all the scenarios that describe the fate of oil droplets at the surface of the membrane therefore the idea of the periodic pressure technique is to set tmp to zero in a periodic manner such that when the pressure is nonzero permeation occurs and when it is zero fouling layer is cleaned to highlight the effect of tmp on the fate of oil droplets when it is set to zero several cases are explored using cfd the different cases represent different possible fates along the journey of oil droplet from the feed stream towards and along the membrane surface apparently when the oil droplet is still in the main stream when the tmp is set to zero it will remain in the feed stream and will not be dragged towards the membrane surface the more interesting scenarios however occur when the oil droplet is at the surface of the membrane proceeding towards its fate when the tmp becomes zero we investigate the different cases involving pinning rejection permeation and breakup when the tmp is set to zero the fates of oil droplets undergoing any of the previously mentioned scenarios change as will be discussed those oil droplets are very much responsible for the development of the fouling layer we study the behavior of oil droplets that experience different fates and look at the change in their fates when the tmp becomes zero it has been determined elsewhere e g tummons et al 2016 that four fates encounter a droplet at the surface of the membrane namely pinning rejection permeation and breakup we are interested to know how these fates change when the tmp is set to zero 9 1 case 1 droplets in main feed stream in this scenario oil droplets that are dispersed in the feed channel are influenced by a net drag force towards the membrane surface when the tmp is nonzero if at some point the pressure in the feed channel becomes zero while keeping the crossflow pattern oil droplets will not be affected any more by a net force towards the membrane and will continue dispersed in feed channel in other words during the period in which the tmp is set to zero no incoming flux of oil droplets towards the membrane surface exists this very much decrease the possibility of the incoming oil droplets flux to cluster and or coalesce with those droplets that are at the surface of the membrane reducing therefore the possibility of building fouling layer fig 15 shows two cases the first fig 15 a represents the case in which the oil droplet is dragged towards the membrane surface in normal filtration process when the pressure supersede the capillary entry pressure the droplet permeates as depicted in fig 15 a the same droplet in the main stream experiences no drag force towards the membrane and has not therefore get dragged towards the membrane surface fig 15 b 9 2 case 2 droplet pinning at the surface of the membrane when the tmp is less than the critical pressure and the cfv is less than the critical velocity oil droplets will stay pinned at the surface of the membrane in this work the pinning condition is achieved when the tmp is set to 0 9 bar and the cfv is set to 0 09 m s under these conditions oil droplet will move along the surface and when it encounters a pore opening it gets anchored and stays at the surface such pinned droplet if not displaced will form a seed for other droplets to cluster and coalesce with starting thereby fouling development when the tmp is set to zero pinned droplet will experience less force and the crossflow field will be enough to sweep off pinned droplets and clean the surface this is illustrated in fig 16 which shows the behavior of oil droplet in the case of normal filtration process fig 16 a and when using the one sided periodic pressure technique b the first set of graphs a shows that the droplet moves along the surface and get anchored by the pore opening and stays pinned at this location when the tmp is set to zero fig 16 b the droplet gets displaced and moves along the surface therefore during the time period in which the tmp is set to zero the crossflow field cleans the surface from pinned droplets 9 3 case 3 rejection scenario oil droplets subject to tmp less than the critical entry pressure and a cfv larger than the critical velocity will be swept off the surface by the crossflow field even if the tmp is set to zero fig 17 shows an oil droplet moving towards the membrane surface under rejection conditions when the tmp is set to zero the droplet detaches the surface as expected 9 4 case 4 permeation scenario when the tmp is larger than the critical pressure and the cfv is less than the critical velocity oil droplet at the surface of the membrane experiences permeation this is depicted in fig 18 a where the droplet permeate totally through the membrane during the permeation time the part of the droplet that exists in the feed channel works as a seed for the incoming flux of oil droplets to coalesce and to cluster when the tmp is set to zero two interesting things occur firstly the incoming flux of oil droplets stops and the second is that either the permeation process completes or reversal of the permeation occurs depending on the shape of the leading interface of the droplet inside the pore that either of the previously mentioned two fates occurs that is if the leading interface has reached the exit boundary the droplet will continue permeating even if the tmp is set to zero if on the other hand part of the interface has not completely passed the exit boundary when the tmp is set to zero the interface recoils and pulls the droplet out of the pore fig 18 b shows two scenarios one in which the leading interface have reached closer to the exit of the pore when the tmp has set to zero in this case the interface recoils and the droplet is pulled out of the pore even if part of the interface has crossed the exit boundary of the pore that the interface is able to recoil and the droplet id pulled out of the pore this last scenario is enlarged for better observation in fig 19 as shown in this figure the leading interface has almost passed through the exit boundary of the pore and only small portion of the interface remains when the tmp switches to zero the interface recoils and the droplet starts to reverse its motion towards the feed channel as depicted in fig 19 and then move along the membrane by the crossflow the permeation scenario that have been considered in this work assumes the tmp to be 1 15 bar and the cfv to be 0 207 m s fig 19 shows the volume of the droplet inside the pore during permeation and reverse permeation during the permeation the volume of the droplet inside the pore increases monotonically when the tmp is set to zero the portion of the droplet inside the pore recedes towards the feed channel and the volume decreases in fig 19 the red dots represent the volume of that part of the droplet inside the pore during permeation and the black dots represents this volume when the tmp is set to zero as seen in fig 20 when the periodic feed pressure technique is applied a reversal of the fate of the oil droplet is seen and the droplet is pulled back out of the membrane pore channel in fig 20 before setting the tmp to zero the droplet was permeating through the pore and this is manifested by the increase in the volume of the droplet along the pore when the tmp is set to zero it is noticed that the volume of the droplet in the pore decreases as it recoils back to the feed side this can then contribute to less pore fouling and improved oil rejection capacity 9 5 case 5 breakup scenario when both the tmp and the cfv are larger than the critical entry pressure and the critical velocity respectively oil droplet at the surface of the membrane will breakup part of the droplet will continue moving along the surface and the other part will move through the pore for this scenario it is interesting to know whether that portion of the droplet that resides in the pore will continue to permeate through the pore or will climb back to the feed stream as explained previously for the permeation scenario the oil droplet permeates when the tmp is larger than the critical entry pressure and the cfv when using the periodic feed pressure technique it can be seen in fig 21 how the broken off piece of the oil droplet was pulled back the membrane channel when the tmp was set to zero and it was ultimately rejected completely this process seems to be slower because the driving force that pushes the remaining of the droplet in the pore is not large the dynamic pressure in the feed side due to crossflow field in fig 22 the oil droplet begins to break up and the volume leaked increases until the droplet is broken off then when the tmp is set to zero the volume leaked is pulled up the channel and decreased until it reached zero it may also be noted that it took longer for the portion of the droplet that is in the pore to get back to the feed side this may be attributed to fact that the driving force that pushes the droplet residue is not strong enough to quickly pull it up to the feed stream when the tmp is set to zero the difference in the pressure between the feed and the permeate side becomes only due to dynamic pressure of the crossflow which is essentially small 10 conclusion the introduced pfpt is very effective in eliminating the development of fouling this technique is based on alternating the pressure in the feed channel between the regular tmp and zero therefore in part of the cycle where the pressure is set to the tmp permeation occurs and in the second part when the pressure is zero cleaning of the surface occurs this novel work shows the development of a new filtration setup whereby fouling is minimized without impairing the overall filtration process an mw polymeric membrane is considered in this study the membrane is tested in the filtration of typical produced water volume three feeds have been considered with oil content of 50 150 and 200 mg l three periodic feed pressure cycles have been studied namely a 1 1 a 1 2 and a 1 2 1 pfpt in all the experiments conducted the pfpt shows to be very effective in recovering the flux to approximately that of a new membrane also the choice of the cycle is very important in optimizing the operation of the membrane visual inspections of the membranes post rinsing at the end of the filtration process show that the pfpt is restoring the membrane surface to almost its state at the beginning of the filtration furthermore even though part of the pressure cycle has been reserved for cleaning purposes i e no filtration the overall filtration capacity of the membrane has exceeded that obtained from regular filtration process this is a direct consequence of the cyclic recovery process of the membrane cfd investigation of the antifouling pfpt technique is also considered in this work the fate of oil droplet at the surface of the membrane is determined by the balance between the hydrodynamic forces interfering with these forces can change the fate of oil droplets in the feed stream and at the surface of the membrane this has been the idea of the periodic feed pressure technique five cases have been considered representing the different fates oil droplets experience in the feed side these cases include droplet in the feed stream droplet pinning at the pore opening rejected droplet droplet undergoing permeation and droplet undergoing breakup in all these scenarios when the tmp is set to zero the aforementioned fates change for an oil droplet in the feed stream when the tmp changes to zero the droplet loose the drag force that drives it towards the membrane and stays therefore held in the main stream for a pinned droplet when the tmp is set to zero it detaches and moves along the surface for a rejected oil droplet when the tmp is set to zero it continues to detach for permeating oil droplet as long as the interface did not fully penetrate the membrane when the tmp is set to zero the droplet recoils back to the main stream finally if a droplet undergoes breakup when the tmp is set to zero the portion of the droplet that exist in the pore slowly moves upwards until picked up by other droplets the pfpt is shown to be effective compared with other physical methods of cleaning fouled membranes like back flushing in back flushing the pressure alternates between the feed and the permeate sides in this case only the pore opening areas in the feed side are relatively cleaned while the rest of membrane surface remains covered with the cake layer furthermore the back permeation flux is not strong enough due to the higher resistance of the membrane to lead to any significant cleaning of the membrane furthermore back flushing can destroy the binding between the active layer of the membrane and the support layer the periodic feed pressure technique is free from these drawbacks from all the studied scenarios it is clear that the periodic feed pressure technique is quite effective in cleaning up the surface of the membrane acknowledgment m z thanks the faculty of graduate studies and research at the university of regina cbie canadian bureau of

19273,oily water production is one of the many drawbacks of petroleum and several other industries finding effective ways for the treatment of produced water remain one of the main areas of interest in membrane sciences albeit the many advantages of membrane technology they suffer from the unavoidable problem of fouling which results from the accumulation of dispersed materials at the surface of membranes membrane modification and operational optimization have been approached as a potential cure of the problem of fouling in this work we introduce a new and novel method that minimizes the development of fouling and in the same time utilizes no chemicals i e environmentally friendly the core of this method is based on alternating the pressure in the feed channel in a periodic manner and is therefore named the periodic feed pressure technique pfpt the idea is to make pinned droplets at the surface of the membrane lose essential forces that keep them sticking to the surface the drag force due to permeation flux and the capillary force due to interfacial tension represents the two forces that largely contribute to the pinning of oil droplets at the surface of the membrane other forces including buoyancy and lift forces are generally small to be of significant influence the idea of the pfpt is therefore to eliminate the force due to permeation drag this is done by setting the transmembrane pressure tmp to zero at fixed intervals allowing pinned oil droplets to dislodge the surface when the tmp is set to zero permeation flux stops and the force due to permeation drag vanishes this significantly reduces the overall residence time of pinned oil droplets minimizing the chance for other oil droplets to cluster and coalesce with pinned ones the pfpt does not cause any damage to the support layer of the polymeric membrane which is a drawback of back flushing methodology the novel pfpt displays minimal membrane fouling and very similar permeation recovery despite only half the cycle time is in filtration mode in this work we show how the permeation flux is recovered and provide comparisons between the pfpt and regular filtration methodology furthermore we compare the overall amount of filtrate at the end of the experiments using both methods it is interesting to note that the amount of filtrate using the pfpt is very much comparable to that obtained using regular filtration methodology and even higher by optimizing the frequency of the cycle and the amplitude of the pressure change it is possible to customize the pfpt to various membrane technologies and to achieve the highest recovery of the flux visual inspections of the membranes post operation and post rinsing indicate that membranes undergoing filtration using the pfpt achieves a very clean surface compared with those undergoing regular filtration processes this method is a promising solution to membrane fouling that is easy to implement without any additional use of chemicals or equipment computational fluid dynamics cfd investigation is also conducted on microfiltration processes to show why this technique works graphical abstract image 1 keywords produced water fouling in porous membranes polymeric type membranes cfd 1 introduction produced water generated from the petroleum industry is an important waste stream its management is a significant challenge due to its highly pollutant nature and the large volume of wastewater generated other industries contributing to the production of produced water include food processing metal fabrication power plants pharmaceutical and several other industries mondal 2016 finding effective ways to treat and reuse produced water can lead to financial sustainability of the industry and generate a water source for positive use such as irrigation or reuse by the industry itself membrane filtration technology is leading the way for oily wastewater treatment because of its many advantages they are relatively cheap easy to operate and maintain consume less power etc fakhru l razi et al 2009 padaki et al 2015 however membrane technology also suffers from an unavoidable problem that results in the deterioration of its performance with time this is called membrane fouling and is related to the inevitable accumulation of dispersed materials at the surface of the membrane padaki et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 such accumulation of materials blocks the openings of the membrane pores reducing thereby the area available for filtration the selectivity feature of a membrane controls how the membrane responds to the incoming flux of materials it is also an important design parameter that needs to be optimized the selectivity function of a membrane depends on many things including factors unique to the membrane surface and its properties the properties of the feed stream and the operating conditions of the filtration unit fakhru l razi et al 2009 bilad et al 2012 padaki et al 2015 membrane surface properties are known to play a role in flux control and rate of fouling development examples of these properties include pore sizes surface roughness surface electrical charge and affinity to the dispersed materials dickhout et al 2017 carpintero tepole et al 2017 in particular pore sizes and hydrophilicity character of the membranes are known to play a key role in filtration process and the development of fouling wang and lin 2017 agrwalt et al 2013 studied the effect of membrane surface properties on separation performance of membranes where they highlighted that an ideal membrane is the one that has minimal roughness and is superhydrophilic the importance of surface charge and contact angle was considered in the work of essafi et al 2005 and dresselhuis et al 2008 dresselhuis et al 2008 suggested that a higher ionic strength of the emulsion leads to more spreading of the oil droplet along the membrane surface particularly when oil content is large membrane surface properties is determined by the type of the materials used to fabricate the membrane ceramic and polymeric membranes have both been used for produced water treatment ceramic membranes are made of inorganic materials that are inert to harsh conditions such as solvents and extreme temperatures dickhout et al 2017 polymeric membranes on the other hand are made of organic materials and allow for a more selective separation a key feature unfound in ceramic membranes dickhout et al 2017 membrane modification can lead to the enhancement of the surface properties to optimize the flux and minimize fouling khulbe et al 2010 produced water is considered an oil in water emulsion where the oil phase is dispersed in the aqueous phase dickhout et al 2017 the exact composition of produced water can vary based on its source however the common components include dissolved inorganic and organic material dispersed oil and suspended solids mixed with chemical stabilizers and surfactants sheng 2011 at relatively higher concentrations the stability of the emulsion is influenced by the repulsive electrostatic forces between the droplets and the attractive van der waals forces these forces interact with the inherent charge of the membrane surface influencing filtration rejection and fouling rates dickhout et al 2017 another key player in the rate of membrane fouling and function is the operational conditions operational conditions including crossflow velocity cfv and transmembrane pressure tmp are strongly related to the flux and fouling rates of the membrane carpintero tepole et al 2017 zoubeik et al 2017 there are critical tmp and cfv that need to be estimated to ensure optimal operation of the membrane for example when oil droplets attach to the surface of the membrane they form interfaces that prevent pinned droplets from permeation unless a threshold pressure is surpassed therefore adjusting the tmp such that the threshold pressure is not exceeded ensures that most of the dispersed oil droplets do not permeate on the other hand it is required that the cfv be larger than the critical velocity associated with each size of oil droplets such that pinned droplets may easily detach by the crossflow field however as the filtration process starts accumulation of oil droplets and debris occurs along the surface of the membrane and within the membrane pores leading to fouling as this layer develops more and more oil droplets and debris adhere to form a gel like layer the literature contains many studies that have looked at ways to combat the development of fouling via membrane features and properties modifications ochoa et al 2003 xie et al 2017 liu et al 2017 wang and lin 2017 others have considered intervening with the hydrodynamic forces affecting the stability of pinned droplets by methods like back flushing qaisrani and samhaber 2011 pourbozorg et al 2016 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 ultrasound vibration ahmad 2012 hengl 2014 pulsating flow rodgers and sparks 1992 and crossflow filtration ozaki and yamamoto 2001 crossflow filtration in particular has gained recognition because of its effectiveness in reducing the problem of fouling when the crossflow rate achieves critical velocity pinned oil droplets along the membrane surface are flushed away tanudjaja et al 2017 the critical cfv needed is dependent on the droplet and pore size ranges in addition to interfacial properties of the oil therefore for any given emulsion that is composed of a range of oil droplets and a membrane that has a range of pore sizes the critical cfv that is needed should be maximized to clear off most pinned droplets nevertheless crossflow will not be able to detach all pinned droplets thus accumulations of pinned droplets will occur despite the efforts of the crossflow field leading to the formation of oil chunks that grow to cover the surface of the membrane the point in filtration time where the oil residues start to wet the membrane surface marks the point of irreversible fouling therefore for an antifouling intervention to be effective it must be applied before the point of membrane wetting liu et al 2017 once irreversible fouling occurs hydraulic cleaning is no longer effective in order to better understand the point of occurrence of irreversible fouling recent studies have implemented new visualization methods in order to monitor the fate of oil droplets during filtration from these studies three stages of oil droplet behavior have been identified these include populating the surface of the membrane with oil droplets clustering and or coalescence of incoming droplets with pinned ones and the growth of coalesced oil droplets to form oil chunks or laminates aimar and bacchin 2010 tummons et al 2016 to minimize the problem of fouling one needs to interfere with the previously mentioned mechanisms in attempts to prevent eliminate and minimize their evolution one way has been to introduce chemical materials e g surfactants to the feed mixture to alter the surface tension properties of the oil in water emulsion agarwal et al 2013 zhu et al 2017 such alteration can affect the affinity properties of the oil interfering thereby with the pinning characteristics of oil droplets however as this method involves the addition of chemicals it poses hazards to the environment and is therefore not favorable in this regard physical methods are generally cleaner one such physical methods has been to periodically clean the membrane surface by back flushing which provides an interesting cleaning procedure by alternating the permeation flux direction across the membrane in a predetermined pattern of the alternating pressure field between the feed and the permeate sides it is possible by reversing the flow to open blocked channels and partially restore the performance of the membrane zhu et al 2017 however this process is only effective in partially opening blocked pores while the rest of the gel layer continues to stick to the surface over these attached layers other incoming oil droplets attach and extend to relock opened pores furthermore back flushing is not recommended for some setups due to technical difficulties it is not recommended by the industry for membranes with external support layers e g polymeric membranes in back flushing the pressure in the permeate exceeds the pressure in the feed in this case not only can the membrane delaminate active layer lifted off of the support structure the glue lines sealing the membrane envelopes in spiral wound elements can also be pulled apart as noted either occurrence destroys the membrane https dowac custhelp com app answers detail a id 971 alternatively instead of reversing the direction of permeation flux another method based on pulsating flow has been proposed in pulsating flow methods both the crossflow and permeation flux stop and resume following certain frequency the idea has been to promote instabilities in the flow field to allow for ease dislodgment of pinned droplets however this technique may be effective at the very short transient period between stopping and resuming the flow once both the cfv and permeation flux resume fouling likewise resumes it is believed that the best technique to minimizing the problem of fouling is to dislodge pinned oil droplets before they start to make the gel layer in this work we introduce another technique that is somewhat located between the two previously mentioned techniques namely back flushing and pulsating flow we call this technique the periodic feed pressure technique pfpt in which the crossflow field never stops rather the permeation flux is the one that stops at regular intervals the pfpt has the advantage that it shortens the residence time of pinned oil droplets at the surface of the membrane this is done by periodically changing the pressure of the feed channel according to particular pattern as will be discussed in the next section so when the pressure is high the permeation of water brings with it oil droplets to the surface of the membrane when the pressure is lowered the crossflow will be able to dislodge attached oil droplets an experimental work is conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the pfpt and to provide a proof of concept of the antifouling characteristics of the pfpt we also provide a computational study using cfd to investigate the fate of oil droplets in the feed stream and at the surface of the membrane when the tmp is set to zero this cfd study highlights why this technique works by analyzing the behavior of pinned oil droplets when the pressure is set to zero 2 the periodic feed pressure technique pfpt in order to determine why the periodic feed pressure technique works in eliminating the problem of fouling it is important to highlight the different hydrodynamic forces that determine the fate of oil droplets at the surface of the membrane nazzal and wiesner 1996 tummons et al 2016 salama et al 2017 2018 salama 2018 a d a droplet in the feed stream is dragged towards the membrane by the permeation flux therefore if the permeation flux is set to zero no such drag force exists and oil droplets will continue to be dispersed in the feed stream in this case oil droplets pinning at the surface of the membrane by the virtue of the hydrodynamic forces drag force due to flow field the lift force due to the asymmetric flow field around the droplet and the buyouncy due to density difference will loose important force component that is due to the permeation flux it should be mentioned that electrostatic forces have not been considered for the oily water system studied in the cfd work while it may have been possible to investigate electrostatic effects associated with particles deposition in the feed stream as in the work of kim and zydney 2006 in oily water systems it is more complex by the apparent mobility of charges and ions furthermore previous works on the stability of oil droplets at membrane surface e g darvishzadeh and priezjev 2012 tummons et al 2016 and others have ignored the effect of electostatic charges this imbalance of forces will lead to the detachment of oil droplets from the surface of the membrane furthermore for oil droplets that are permeating as long as part of the leading interface still exists in the pore space when the tmp is set to zero oil droplet will recoil pulling the leading interface back to the feed stream likewise oil droplets that are experiencing breakup the broken portion of the droplet in the pore space will move backward towards the feed side in other words for all the scenarios when the tmp is set to zero oil droplets will dislodge from the surface this is essentially the essence of the periodic feed pressure technique as will be explained in the next section fig 1 shows schematically the different hydrodynamic forces applied on a pinned oil droplet as explained the permeation of water through porous membranes introduces hydrodynamic drag force that pulls dispersed oil droplets towards the membrane surface when the oil droplets pin over pore openings they anchor themselves at the membrane surface by forming an interface at the entrance of pore openings if pinned oil droplets are not detached by crossflow filtration or permeated through the membrane that is if the tmp is larger than the threshold critical entry pressure they stay pinned forming thereby the seeds for other incoming droplets to cluster and or coaleasce with if the permeation flux is reduced or eliminated the incoming flux of dragged oil droplets likewise is reduced furthermore pinned oil droplets will not be stable at the membrane surface therefore if the crossflow field is maintained pinned oil droplets will easily detach off the membrane surface as a proof of concept in this work we introduce an experimental study on the effect of periodic pressure field pattern on the permeation flux with time fig 2 shows the pattern of the periodic pressure field studied in this work two periodic patterns are considered namely a 1 1 and a 1 2 cycles in the 1 1 cycle a 1 min of filtration and a 1 min of cleaning are used in the 1 2 cycle on the other hand a 1 min of filtration and a 2 min of cleaning are used during half the cycle the tmp is large and permeation occurs and during the second half no permeation takes place and the crossflow field cleans the surface of the membrane in the 1 2 cycle the cleaning time doubles the filtration time and therefore it can achieve higher cleaning capacity it is interesting to know whether this technique would result in less overall filtration capacity of the membrane or not based on the fact that the permeation time is smaller by 50 for the 1 1 cycle and by 66 for the 1 2 we compare this technique with the classical case in which the pressure field is continuous with time 3 experimental setup the filtration system used in this experimental work is provided by sterlitech corporation usa fig 3 shows a schematic diagram of the setup used throughout the course of this work as depicted in fig 3 the feed is stored in a stainless steel tank of 5 gallon capacity from there it is pumped into the stainless steel membrane cell cf042 316 from sterlitech corporation at high speed generated by a hydracell cc pump with speed control by emerson controller there are multiple control valves for safety and pressure flow monitoring which are obtained from swagelok co additionally the pressure sensors that are found on either side of the membrane cell are obtained from turck inc the pressure detectors have an accuracy of 0 3 with the signal fed into digital display unit the retentate tube is connected to brine control valve and then to dwyer digital flow meter with an accuracy of 1 the discharge from digital flow meter is then reconnected back into the feed tank the permeate component is collected in a beaker placed on a mass balance from mettler toledo ms4002s with repeatability standard deviation of 0 01 g this is then recorded automatically where the mass balance is logged to a computer that records all the weights and displays them on output screen the performance of the membrane is assessed by determining the oil content in the permeate the oil content was analyzed using the horiba ocma 350 analyzer utilizing a non dispersive infrared ndir spectrophotometric technique the oil analyzer is able to detect the oil content with an uncertainty of 4 mg l although stability of the emulsion was not tested it is our belief that the relatively small oil content and the continuous agitation of the feed by the flow field maintains the dispersal of the oil droplets furthermore no aggregation or formation of larger size oil chunks has been observed during the course of the experimental work the characteristics of the membrane used in this study is shown in table 1 4 operational procedures the membranes were first treated by an overnight soak in di water before placement in the filtration cell the operating parameters were adjusted by the control valves to the desired settings the filtration unit was then initiated and once the permeation flux stabilizes the mass of permeate collected in grams every 3 s was recorded by the computer system a small amount of the permeate was collected for analysis after a few minutes of operation the performance of the membrane at the particular operating conditions is then calculated in terms of the permeation flux and the rejection capacity the amount of permeate was converted into volume of permeate obtained per unit area of membrane per unit time l m2 h the permeate flow once measured was returned to the feed tank in order to maintain a feed with a constant concentration the oil rejection efficiency was calculated using r o c f c f c f 100 initially the filtration experiment was performed using the three feeds with different oil concentrations without the use of the periodic feed pressure technique as our control then the same general process was repeated with the addition of the pressure technique for each of the three feeds in addition thermogravimetric analysis was performed on the membrane prior to fouling and post filtration to investigate the weight decomposition for each the feed was fashioned in the lab with the inspiration of oil from the bakken reservoir in western canada to allow for ease of access to produced water for the experiments and a constant reliable supply of water the use of synthetic oil feed is relatively common in the literature and used by many authors for testing membrane filtration for produced water treatment as highlighted by weschenfelder et al 2015 the density of the oil used to generate the oily emulsion was measured with an anton paar dsa 5000 m digital densitometer 5 10 5 g cm3 the oil used was light oil with a measured density of 0 87844 g cc obtained using anton paar dsa 5000 m digital densitometer with an uncertainty of 5 10 5 g cm3 and a viscosity of 5 23 cp 1 0 accuracy measured by viscometer dv ii pro at 22 5 c a total volume of 0 15 ml 0 31 ml and 0 41 ml of bakken oil was added to a 2 l of ro water and mixed in blender at 18 000 rpm for 2 min to generate a 50 mg l 150 mg l and 200 mg l feeds respectively the oil content of the feed was then measured using oil content analyzer company horiba the contact angle of the oily emulsion on the mw membrane was measured to be approximately 135 using dsa 100 drop shape analyzer with uncertainty 2 the oil droplet size was measured using mastersizer 3000 which required the following properties namely a reflective index of 1 45 and a density of 0 8 g cc the experimental work began with the determination of the oil droplet size distribution the results are seen in graphical form in fig 4 along with the contact angle of the oil droplet 135 2 the resistance of the membrane is experimentally determined by plotting the flux of pure water at different tmp levels and constructing the linear relationship where the slop of the line is equal to the membrane resistance the pure water flux was determined via the permeate weight conversion method fig 5 shows the fitted relationship between the flux and the pressure difference measurements membrane resistance is dependent on many factors including membrane thickness nominal pore size and various morphological features such as the tortuosity porosity and pore size distribution ergun 1952 alsari et al 2007 and many others it is important to report the rejection characteristics of the membrane at the early stage of the filtration process as seen in table 2 the rejection capacity of the membrane is almost 100 for the three considered feeds these membranes therefore are prone to intensified fouling due to their higher rejection capacities and are chosen thereby to test the pfpt 5 results and discussion in order to highlight the significance of the periodic feed pressure technique the results are categorized in three parts in the first the behavior of the membrane to the different feed streams is investigated considering normal filtration cycle i e no periodicity in the feed side pressure then we apply the new technique and compare the flux decline with time for the three feeds second we compare the total amount of permeate at the end of the experiments to investigate the effect of the no permeation half cycle on the permeation flow thirdly visual inspection of the membranes after the experiments indicates how clean the membranes are for the normal and the periodic feed pressure techniques as indicated the filtration experiments were performed initially without the application of the periodic feed pressure method and the flux decline is depicted in fig 6 the feed with the lowest oil concentration showed the slowest rate of flux decline this reflects and supports the theory of the oil droplet behavior at the surface of the membrane as oil droplets increase in number they aggregate and form layers of debris that lead to decrease in flux and an increase in fouling development the flux l m2 hr for the three feeds at the beginning of the experiments which is used to normalize the flux curves are given in table 3 there is very little difference in the maximum permeation flux at the beginning of the experiments is observed this is essentially because the three used membranes are of the same type the development of fouling along the feed side of the membrane is captured at different times fouling appears once oil droplets pin over the surface of the membrane if the time taken for pinned oil droplets to fully permeate breakup or dislodge the surface is relatively long there is a large chance that incoming oil droplets coalesce and cluster with pinned droplets this results in the formation of larger size droplets chunks or laminates of oil films that spread over the surface and block the area available for filtration this behavior is depicted in fig 7 that shows successive pictures of the surface of the membrane after different times of operation one notices that as time proceeds larger oil droplets and chunks of oil laminates develop at the surface of the membrane and the color of the membrane becomes more yellowish until the membrane is fully covered with oil layer if the feed stream contains in addition to the oil content other impurities solid particles debris etc they will deposit over the oil forming a gel like cake layer that is difficult to clean the periodic feed pressure technique is considered to prevent the oil from accumulating along the membrane surface by dividing the filtration process in a cyclic manner to allow filtration during part of the cycle and cleaning in the second part the pfpt is different from both the back flushing and the pulsating flow techniques in the back flushing technique the permeation flux is reversed and in the pulsating flow technique the flows in the feed and the permeate stops and resumes following particular pattern in the pfpt technique the permeation flux stops and resumes while keeping the crossflow field this eliminates permeation drag from holding pinned droplets at the surface of the membrane and make it easy for the crossflow to dislodge them the pfpt therefore is able to clean the whole feed side of the membrane and not only around pore openings the pfpt in this study is implemented following three cycles namely a 1 1 cycle a 1 2 cycle and a 1 2 1 cycle a 1 1 cycle refers to a 1 min permeation and a 1 min cleaning the 1 2 cycle refers to a 1 min permeation and a 2 min cleaning and the 1 2 1 cycle refers likewise to a 1 2 min permeation and a 1 min cleaning a schematic of such cycles is shown in fig 8 as has been mentioned as the motive to the pfpt which is to destabilize oil droplets upon pinning over the membrane visual inspections of the surface of the membrane at different time of operation confirm this fact that is when the permeation drag becomes very small approximately zero and pinned droplets lose the drag force that holds them at the surface oil droplets becomes unstable and can easily dislodge the surface by the crossflow field fig 9 shows pictures of the surface of the feed side of the membrane at different time of operations for the three mentioned pfpt cycles together with the regular filtration technique in all these experiments the oil content is 150 mg l the tmp is set to 1 0 bar and the cfv is set to 1 0 m s the pictures are taken after 0 5 10 20 30 60 80 and 120 min each of these pictures have been captured with respect to new membranes in other words 7 mw membranes have been experimented for each feed pressure pattern to the required time when the picture is to be taken the reason is to minimize the disturbance that may be caused when the membrane is taken from the setup to capture the pictures as seen in fig 9 significant change in the development of fouling can be noticed along the different pfpt cycles following a particular time between the different techniques it is noticed that the intensity of fouling changes between the different feed pressure patterns apparently the smaller the permeation half cycle and the longer the cleaning half cycle the better the performance however this may result in decreasing the overall volume of filtration therefore it is an optimization exercise that would suggest the best cycle that suits particular membrane operating conditions and required filtration capacity furthermore it is to be noticed that the membrane at the end of operation and after rinse with clean water returns to its clean state when using the pfpt technique compared with the case in which regular filtration process occurs in other words the life time of the membrane increases following the use of the pfpt this is very important as it can result in significant saving of time efforts and capital fig 9 suggests that the pfpt is essentially effective in reducing the problem of fouling by providing cleaning periods during the full filtration process furthermore when the cleaning half period is longer the membrane surface is cleaner however making the cleaning period longer intuitively reduces the filtration time and can reduce the overall productivity of the membrane this may be compensated by the increase of the life span of the membrane in the next section we show that this might not essentially be the case and the overall gain that is obtained by the recovery process of the membrane surpasses the reduction in filtration during the cleaning periods before we show this it is important to show the behavior of the permeation flux of the membrane for the three feeds namely the 50 mg l 150 mg l and the 200 mg l oil content concentration the operating conditions for all the feeds are tmp of 1 bar and a cfv of 1 m s three cases are considered with respect to four patterns of the feed pressure namely continuous feed pressure 1 1 pfpt and 1 2 pfpt cycles fig 10 depicts the filtration performance using the 50 mg l feed with the implementation of the periodic feed pressure technique the figure depicts two of the pfpt cycles mentioned before namely the 1 1 and the 1 2 cycles the comparison is done with respect to the permeation flux for the regular filtration process and the two pfpt cycles since the flux obtained using the pfpt alternates between a maximum value during the permeation half cycle and a minimum value during the cleaning half cycle in this graph we only show those associated with the permeation half cycle from fig 10 it is clear that with the normal continuous filtration technique the flux declines with time as a result of fouling development that is oil droplets that neither permeate nor sweep off form the seeds for other droplets to cluster and coalesce with contributing therefore to the development of fouling when the feed pressure follows the 1 1 and the 1 2 cycles the permeation flux recovers to almost the same level when the filtration is first started particularly for the 1 2 cycle this is obviously due to the fact that the cleaning half cycle is longer it also confirms the findings that were obtained through our previous cfd investigation introduced later which highlights that when the pressure in the feed side is set to zero oil droplets undergoing different fates are going to dislodge from the membrane pores when the oil content in the feed stream is 150 mg l the decline in the permeation flux when following regular filtration pattern is faster as depicted in fig 11 on using the periodic feed pressure technique following the 1 1 and the 1 2 cycles better performance is generally observed with the permeation flux recovered to approximately 80 the performance associated with the 1 2 cycle is generally better than the 1 1 cycle similar pattern is also observed for the case when the feed stream had an oil content of 200 mg l fig 12 it is to be noted that the difference between the 150 and the 200 feed oil content is not significantly large and therefore approximately similar patterns of flux recovery is generally observed the general trend is that the permeation flux generally recovers when using the periodic feed pressure technique compared with the regular filtration process also the recovery of the permeation flux is very much dependent of the feed oil concentration and the used pressure cycle the fact that the permeation flux did not recover to almost 100 when the oil content is large highlights that a higher frequency of the periodic feed pressure cycle may need to be implemented to recover the flux back to its original value it is interesting to investigate how the cyclic feed pressure technique will affect the total amount of filtrate at the end of the experiments intuitively one may think that the total amount of filtrate obtained using the periodic feed pressure technique is going to be less than that obtained using regular filtration technique this may be because the time of filtration in the 1 1 cyclic pressure field is half the total time and in the 1 2 cyclic pressure field it is 1 3 of the total time however as shown in fig 13 this is not always true in fact the total amount of filtrate when the oil content in the feed stream is the smallest is very much closer to that when the feed pressure follows the regular pattern when the oil content is larger it is found that the cyclic feed pressure technique produces larger amount of filtrate than the regular process furthermore the 1 2 cyclic pressure field produces the largest it is interesting to highlight the state of the membrane after filtration using the regular filtration process the 1 1 the 1 2 and the 1 2 1 cyclic feed pressure technique which is depicted in fig 9 this figure shows the actual membrane post filtration and post water rinse visual inspections at the end of filtration show that the membrane undergoing the regular filtration process is essentially covered with larger amount of oil after each membrane was rinsed with water the oil at the surface of the membrane largely washes away however for the tested membrane following regular filtration process the surface remains stained and appears yellowish indicating that the oil droplets have invaded the pore cells and started to form a layer of oil films at the surface membranes undergoing 1 1 1 2 and 1 2 1 cycles pfpt on the other hand are to a large extent cleaner and almost recovered to its original state when they get washed with water the surface is almost an oil free environment overall with the use of pfpt oil droplets at the surface and within the pore oscillate and become unstable and this prevents the permanent adherence of oil droplets to the pore walls the membrane is easily cleaned with no staining when the pfpt method is not applied there is increased residence time of the oil droplets at the surface of the membrane and within the pore increasing therefore the chance to get bind to the membrane and pore surface this confirms the effectiveness of the periodic feed pressure technique in eliminating the problem of fouling and in increasing the life span of the membrane thermogravimetric analysis was also performed the results are shown in fig 14 the pre filtration plain membrane showed a weight loss of about 30 wt at around 160 c due to the decomposition of the coating layer on the membrane surface another step seen on the graph of weight loss is seen between 280 c and 400 c is also observed on all the samples due to the decomposition of the membrane support material when the plain mw membrane was thoroughly rinsed with water the extra coating layer on the membrane surface must have suffered some breakdown hence a minor weight loss is recorded for the sample at 160 c on the other hand the post filtration membrane using the periodic feed pressure technique showed a similar profile to the rinsed membrane indicating that no fouling was observed due to the pressure technique whereas the sample obtained after regular filtration with no pressure technique has shown an extra weight loss attributed to the amount of fouling oil on the membrane surface and pores 6 cfd investigation of the microfiltration problem the computational investigation of the behavior of an oil droplet at the membrane surface involving the different fates is conducted using the volume of fluid vof two phase framework enright et al 2002 hirt and nichols 1981 the study of multiphase flows requires the need to capture the interface as the oil droplet is transported along the surface or penetrating through the pore opening there are generally two basic categories when modeling a two phase system involving interface dynamics these are the sharp interface and the diffuse interface models bao et al 2016 2018 in this work we use the vof model along with the finite volume technique because it satisfies the conservation laws locally ansys fluent is used as our vehicle to conduct this study the governing equations that describe the dynamic behavior of this system involve the conservation of mass momentum as well as the transport of a phase field function that describes the phases the volume of fluid method is based on the fact that the two phases form an impenetrable interface where for example each cell in the mesh can either be filled with one of the phases a specific phase zone or be a combination of the two phase interface this is accomplished by defining a phase function α called the volume fraction which is the volume of one phase in the cell over the total cell volume the interface is tracked by solving a transport equation for the volume fraction as well as the momentum equation 1 α t u α 0 where u is the velocity vector along which α is transported the density is calculated by 2 ρ 1 α ρ 1 α ρ 2 where ρ is the average density ρ 1 is the density of phase 1 and ρ 2 is the density of phase 2 one momentum equation is solved and the velocity field is shared between the two phases the momentum equation may be written as 3 ρ u t ρ u u p μ u u t ρ g f where u is the velocity vector g is the gravity vector p is the pressure μ is the viscosity and f is the surface tension force the surface tension force is determined by the following equation 4 f σ ρ κ α 1 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 where σ is the surface tension between the two phases and κ is the mean curvature which is computed in terms of the normal vector to the interface n via 5 κ 1 n n n n n the surface tension force is equal to nonzero only at the interface and it acts in the direction normal to the interface if the interface is in contact with the wall the normal vector is found via the contact angle 6 n i n w cos θ s t n t sin θ s t where n w is the unit vector normal to the wall nt is a vector on the wall and normal to the contact line and θ s t is the contact angle to have a closed system the navier stokes equations require boundary conditions to be outlined for that the membrane surface is considered a no slip boundary the top wall is considered a moving boundary pressure boundary conditions were assigned to the two side boundaries and the outlet of the pore and the two boundaries normal to the flow direction are assigned a periodic conditions more details about the boundary condition are stated in the next section a simple algorithm was used for the pressure velocity decoupling the momentum equation was discretized using a second order upwind scheme to reconstruct the interface and consequently solve the volume fraction transport equation a piecewise linear interface reconstruction method was used the convergence criteria for the different variables has been set to 10 4 for the velocities and continuity and the maximum iteration per time step is set to 100 7 the computational model in this section we provide reasoning why the pfpt technique works in eliminating the problem of fouling by conducting a computational study on microfiltration using cfd the purpose is to highlight the behavior of oil droplets undergoing different fates when the tmp is set to zero the computational domain chosen for this study is very much like that considered in darvishzadeh and priezjev 2012 this provides a framework for comparisons with their work to build confidence in our numerical setup in addition to testing the proposed technique the continuous phase assumed in this work is water and the dispersed phase is oil the properties assumed for the oil include a density of 889 kg m3 a viscosity of 0 0021 pa s and a surface tension of 19 1 mn m for water the density is taken as 998 2 kg m3 and the viscosity is 0 001 pa s the solid surfaces of the domain were considered olephopic with a contact angle greater than 90 the geometry of the computational domain represents a rectangular conduit with a circular pore in the middle as depicted in figure s1 in the supplementary materials the height z direction width y direction and length x direction of the conduit are 2 07 7 and 9 μm respectively a circular pore with a radius of 0 2 μm was created in the middle of the bottom surface with the pore length z direction set to 1 5 μm ansys icem has been used to generate the mesh that consists of hexagonal grids as shown in figure s2 the base mesh used throughout this study is designed such that the number of nodes for the conduit along the x y and z directions are 100 75 and 50 respectively the cylindrical pore cross section is discretized with about 30 cells and 50 nodes were set along the pore length dependency of simulation results on grid resolution have been tested using three meshes namely the base mesh a 2 times finer mesh 2 times the number of nodes in each direction and a 2 times coarser mesh half the mesh in each direction in the case of the finer mesh the number of nodes for the rectangular conduit in the x y and z directions are 200 150 and 100 respectively and the number of cells in the pore section is 60 and 100 nodes along the pore length the volume of fluid vof method has been used in fluent for the simulation of the two phase system a spherical oil droplet was created with a radius of 0 9 μm with the x y and z coordinates of the center of the oil droplet set to 3 4 3 5 and 0 7 μm respectively in other words the droplet is created in the middle just before the entrance of the pore at the bottom surface of the conduit the reason why a droplet of diameter 0 9 μm is chosen for our cfd study is to be able to conduct comparison and validation exercises with previous works in literature to build confidence of our approach in other words it will not change the conclusions obtained from the cfd study should we choose different sizes of the droplets as long as the continuum hypothesis still applies and the same kind of forces are considered when the simulation starts the droplet establishes the equilibrium configuration determined by the surface tension and the contact angle the two boundaries of the duct which are perpendicular to the x axis are assumed periodic boundary conditions the side boundaries of the duct perpendicular to the y axis are pressure inlet boundaries with the inlet pressure set to a predefined value according to the studied scenario the top boundary perpendicular to z axis is considered a moving wall with the velocity likewise pre set according to the required scenario in the positive direction of the x axis direction of the fluid flow the contact angle of the oil droplet at the oil water surface contact along the bottom surface of the conduit as well as along the pore wall was set to 135 the pore bottom boundary is set to pressure outlet boundary with a value of 0 to create the necessary transmembrane pressure the droplet can either enter the pore reside at the entrance of the pore or breakup as indicated earlier the grid resolution might influence the velocity of the droplet due to shear flow using finer meshes 2 times finer for simulations for different situations including breakup rejection and permeation it was confirmed that the resolution of the base mesh was appropriate and simulation results with finer mesh was identical to that of the base mesh this is apparent when comparing the droplet configuration at different times using the three mesh resolutions as depicted in figure s3 from this figure the base mesh is sufficient to provide similar results as those obtained by the finer mesh the coarser mesh generated an interface that is not uniform and is not similar to this obtained by the two other mesh resolutions therefore throughout this work the base mesh resolution will be considered 8 validation of the computational model in order to build confidence in our modeling approach we begin by replicating the computational work found in darvishzadeh and priezjev 2012 and darvishzadeh et al 2013 who looked at the effects of the transmembrane pressure and the shear rate on the behavior of an oil droplet upon encountering a pore opening the simulation continued until the droplet either reaches the outlet penetrates the pore or breaks up four cases were considered that represent four scenarios including rejection permeation and two cases for breakup the conditions adapted to each scenario are shown in table s1 as seen in figure s4 there is a very good resemblance of the different snapshots of the oil droplet at different stages between our simulation and that of darvishzadeh and priezjev 2012 the snapshots of the droplet reflect three different scenarios that can occur which include rejection a aa permeation b bb and break up d dd e ee cases referred to with a single capital letter are those of darvishzadeh et al 2013 and those referred to by double capital letters are from the current simulations looking at the snapshot a which depicts the rejection process at low shear rates under this scenario the droplet passes by the membrane pore without penetration the flow along the membrane drags the droplet along the bottom surface and from the pore opening moving along and examining the snapshot b which falls under the permeation category the droplet penetrates the pore and becomes deformed by the flow and gets pulled into the pore before it is able to breakup this scenario represents the case in which the shear rate is relatively lower with increasing shear rates the effective hydrodynamic forces cause strong droplet deformation at the entrance of the pore leading the droplet to break up as seen in snapshots d and e the higher shear rates cause the deformation and breakup of the droplet the level of the transmembrane pressure determines the minimum breakup pressure snapshot d is just above the minimum breakup pressure and thus a small fragment of the droplet is broken up but the main droplet is carried away by the shear flow at higher transmembrane pressures as seen in snapshot e the breakup of the oil droplet is more significant as the droplet comes in contact with the pore at higher pressures the droplet almost pauses above the pore leading to considerable change in the shape of the droplet and causing it to stretch out in combination of high shear flow the stretched out droplet breakups the volume of the portion of the droplet that gets broken is proportional to the applied pressure in figure s5 comparison between the volumes of that portion of the droplet remained inside the pore after breakup for different tmp between darvishzadeh and priezjev 2012 and our work indicates that very good agreement is obtained 9 cfd modeling using the periodic feed pressure technique in the previous discussion it was mentioned that an effective way to minimize the problem of fouling may be to interfere with the different hydrodynamic forces that lead to the deposition of oil droplets at the surface of the membrane the idea has been to interfere with the previously mentioned mechanisms that affect the stability of oil droplets at the surface of the membrane it has been determined that the tmp represents a key parameter that plays a significant role in all the scenarios that describe the fate of oil droplets at the surface of the membrane therefore the idea of the periodic pressure technique is to set tmp to zero in a periodic manner such that when the pressure is nonzero permeation occurs and when it is zero fouling layer is cleaned to highlight the effect of tmp on the fate of oil droplets when it is set to zero several cases are explored using cfd the different cases represent different possible fates along the journey of oil droplet from the feed stream towards and along the membrane surface apparently when the oil droplet is still in the main stream when the tmp is set to zero it will remain in the feed stream and will not be dragged towards the membrane surface the more interesting scenarios however occur when the oil droplet is at the surface of the membrane proceeding towards its fate when the tmp becomes zero we investigate the different cases involving pinning rejection permeation and breakup when the tmp is set to zero the fates of oil droplets undergoing any of the previously mentioned scenarios change as will be discussed those oil droplets are very much responsible for the development of the fouling layer we study the behavior of oil droplets that experience different fates and look at the change in their fates when the tmp becomes zero it has been determined elsewhere e g tummons et al 2016 that four fates encounter a droplet at the surface of the membrane namely pinning rejection permeation and breakup we are interested to know how these fates change when the tmp is set to zero 9 1 case 1 droplets in main feed stream in this scenario oil droplets that are dispersed in the feed channel are influenced by a net drag force towards the membrane surface when the tmp is nonzero if at some point the pressure in the feed channel becomes zero while keeping the crossflow pattern oil droplets will not be affected any more by a net force towards the membrane and will continue dispersed in feed channel in other words during the period in which the tmp is set to zero no incoming flux of oil droplets towards the membrane surface exists this very much decrease the possibility of the incoming oil droplets flux to cluster and or coalesce with those droplets that are at the surface of the membrane reducing therefore the possibility of building fouling layer fig 15 shows two cases the first fig 15 a represents the case in which the oil droplet is dragged towards the membrane surface in normal filtration process when the pressure supersede the capillary entry pressure the droplet permeates as depicted in fig 15 a the same droplet in the main stream experiences no drag force towards the membrane and has not therefore get dragged towards the membrane surface fig 15 b 9 2 case 2 droplet pinning at the surface of the membrane when the tmp is less than the critical pressure and the cfv is less than the critical velocity oil droplets will stay pinned at the surface of the membrane in this work the pinning condition is achieved when the tmp is set to 0 9 bar and the cfv is set to 0 09 m s under these conditions oil droplet will move along the surface and when it encounters a pore opening it gets anchored and stays at the surface such pinned droplet if not displaced will form a seed for other droplets to cluster and coalesce with starting thereby fouling development when the tmp is set to zero pinned droplet will experience less force and the crossflow field will be enough to sweep off pinned droplets and clean the surface this is illustrated in fig 16 which shows the behavior of oil droplet in the case of normal filtration process fig 16 a and when using the one sided periodic pressure technique b the first set of graphs a shows that the droplet moves along the surface and get anchored by the pore opening and stays pinned at this location when the tmp is set to zero fig 16 b the droplet gets displaced and moves along the surface therefore during the time period in which the tmp is set to zero the crossflow field cleans the surface from pinned droplets 9 3 case 3 rejection scenario oil droplets subject to tmp less than the critical entry pressure and a cfv larger than the critical velocity will be swept off the surface by the crossflow field even if the tmp is set to zero fig 17 shows an oil droplet moving towards the membrane surface under rejection conditions when the tmp is set to zero the droplet detaches the surface as expected 9 4 case 4 permeation scenario when the tmp is larger than the critical pressure and the cfv is less than the critical velocity oil droplet at the surface of the membrane experiences permeation this is depicted in fig 18 a where the droplet permeate totally through the membrane during the permeation time the part of the droplet that exists in the feed channel works as a seed for the incoming flux of oil droplets to coalesce and to cluster when the tmp is set to zero two interesting things occur firstly the incoming flux of oil droplets stops and the second is that either the permeation process completes or reversal of the permeation occurs depending on the shape of the leading interface of the droplet inside the pore that either of the previously mentioned two fates occurs that is if the leading interface has reached the exit boundary the droplet will continue permeating even if the tmp is set to zero if on the other hand part of the interface has not completely passed the exit boundary when the tmp is set to zero the interface recoils and pulls the droplet out of the pore fig 18 b shows two scenarios one in which the leading interface have reached closer to the exit of the pore when the tmp has set to zero in this case the interface recoils and the droplet is pulled out of the pore even if part of the interface has crossed the exit boundary of the pore that the interface is able to recoil and the droplet id pulled out of the pore this last scenario is enlarged for better observation in fig 19 as shown in this figure the leading interface has almost passed through the exit boundary of the pore and only small portion of the interface remains when the tmp switches to zero the interface recoils and the droplet starts to reverse its motion towards the feed channel as depicted in fig 19 and then move along the membrane by the crossflow the permeation scenario that have been considered in this work assumes the tmp to be 1 15 bar and the cfv to be 0 207 m s fig 19 shows the volume of the droplet inside the pore during permeation and reverse permeation during the permeation the volume of the droplet inside the pore increases monotonically when the tmp is set to zero the portion of the droplet inside the pore recedes towards the feed channel and the volume decreases in fig 19 the red dots represent the volume of that part of the droplet inside the pore during permeation and the black dots represents this volume when the tmp is set to zero as seen in fig 20 when the periodic feed pressure technique is applied a reversal of the fate of the oil droplet is seen and the droplet is pulled back out of the membrane pore channel in fig 20 before setting the tmp to zero the droplet was permeating through the pore and this is manifested by the increase in the volume of the droplet along the pore when the tmp is set to zero it is noticed that the volume of the droplet in the pore decreases as it recoils back to the feed side this can then contribute to less pore fouling and improved oil rejection capacity 9 5 case 5 breakup scenario when both the tmp and the cfv are larger than the critical entry pressure and the critical velocity respectively oil droplet at the surface of the membrane will breakup part of the droplet will continue moving along the surface and the other part will move through the pore for this scenario it is interesting to know whether that portion of the droplet that resides in the pore will continue to permeate through the pore or will climb back to the feed stream as explained previously for the permeation scenario the oil droplet permeates when the tmp is larger than the critical entry pressure and the cfv when using the periodic feed pressure technique it can be seen in fig 21 how the broken off piece of the oil droplet was pulled back the membrane channel when the tmp was set to zero and it was ultimately rejected completely this process seems to be slower because the driving force that pushes the remaining of the droplet in the pore is not large the dynamic pressure in the feed side due to crossflow field in fig 22 the oil droplet begins to break up and the volume leaked increases until the droplet is broken off then when the tmp is set to zero the volume leaked is pulled up the channel and decreased until it reached zero it may also be noted that it took longer for the portion of the droplet that is in the pore to get back to the feed side this may be attributed to fact that the driving force that pushes the droplet residue is not strong enough to quickly pull it up to the feed stream when the tmp is set to zero the difference in the pressure between the feed and the permeate side becomes only due to dynamic pressure of the crossflow which is essentially small 10 conclusion the introduced pfpt is very effective in eliminating the development of fouling this technique is based on alternating the pressure in the feed channel between the regular tmp and zero therefore in part of the cycle where the pressure is set to the tmp permeation occurs and in the second part when the pressure is zero cleaning of the surface occurs this novel work shows the development of a new filtration setup whereby fouling is minimized without impairing the overall filtration process an mw polymeric membrane is considered in this study the membrane is tested in the filtration of typical produced water volume three feeds have been considered with oil content of 50 150 and 200 mg l three periodic feed pressure cycles have been studied namely a 1 1 a 1 2 and a 1 2 1 pfpt in all the experiments conducted the pfpt shows to be very effective in recovering the flux to approximately that of a new membrane also the choice of the cycle is very important in optimizing the operation of the membrane visual inspections of the membranes post rinsing at the end of the filtration process show that the pfpt is restoring the membrane surface to almost its state at the beginning of the filtration furthermore even though part of the pressure cycle has been reserved for cleaning purposes i e no filtration the overall filtration capacity of the membrane has exceeded that obtained from regular filtration process this is a direct consequence of the cyclic recovery process of the membrane cfd investigation of the antifouling pfpt technique is also considered in this work the fate of oil droplet at the surface of the membrane is determined by the balance between the hydrodynamic forces interfering with these forces can change the fate of oil droplets in the feed stream and at the surface of the membrane this has been the idea of the periodic feed pressure technique five cases have been considered representing the different fates oil droplets experience in the feed side these cases include droplet in the feed stream droplet pinning at the pore opening rejected droplet droplet undergoing permeation and droplet undergoing breakup in all these scenarios when the tmp is set to zero the aforementioned fates change for an oil droplet in the feed stream when the tmp changes to zero the droplet loose the drag force that drives it towards the membrane and stays therefore held in the main stream for a pinned droplet when the tmp is set to zero it detaches and moves along the surface for a rejected oil droplet when the tmp is set to zero it continues to detach for permeating oil droplet as long as the interface did not fully penetrate the membrane when the tmp is set to zero the droplet recoils back to the main stream finally if a droplet undergoes breakup when the tmp is set to zero the portion of the droplet that exist in the pore slowly moves upwards until picked up by other droplets the pfpt is shown to be effective compared with other physical methods of cleaning fouled membranes like back flushing in back flushing the pressure alternates between the feed and the permeate sides in this case only the pore opening areas in the feed side are relatively cleaned while the rest of membrane surface remains covered with the cake layer furthermore the back permeation flux is not strong enough due to the higher resistance of the membrane to lead to any significant cleaning of the membrane furthermore back flushing can destroy the binding between the active layer of the membrane and the support layer the periodic feed pressure technique is free from these drawbacks from all the studied scenarios it is clear that the periodic feed pressure technique is quite effective in cleaning up the surface of the membrane acknowledgment m z thanks the faculty of graduate studies and research at the university of regina cbie canadian bureau of

19274,free living amoebae are widespread in freshwater ecosystems although many studies have investigated changes in their communities across space the temporal variability and the drivers of community changes across different habitat types are poorly understood a total of 108 surface water samples were collected on a seasonal basis from four reservoirs and two rivers in xiamen city subtropical china we used high throughput sequencing and qpcr methods to explore the occurrence and abundance of free living amoebae in total 335 amoeba otus were detected and only 32 otus were shared by reservoir and river habitats the reservoirs and rivers harbored unique amoebae communities and exhibited distinct seasonal patterns in community composition high abundance of the 18s rrna gene of acanthamoeba was observed in spring and summer whereas the abundance was low in autumn and winter in addition the abundance of hartmannella was significantly higher when isolated from reservoirs in summer autumn and from river in spring summer moreover the temporal patterns of amoebae communities were significantly associated with water temperature indicating that temperature is an important variable controlling the ecological dynamics of amoebae populations however our comparative analysis indicated that both environmental selection and neutral processes significantly contributed to amoeba community assembly the genera detected here include pathogenic species and species that can act as vectors for microbial pathogens which can cause human infections graphical abstract image 1

constitute significant links in microbial food webs in water and soil amoebae are widely distributed both in natural hsu et al 2011 hsu 2016 and man made aquatic ecosystems thomas et al 2008 delafont

vanessa et al 2012 bonilla lemus et al 2014 most amoebae are able to form cysts allowing them to survive adverse conditions when favorable conditions resume the amoebae can excyst and revert to the active feeding stage khan 2006 the cysts can remain viable for years which allow amoebae to be very resilient to diverse and changing environmental conditions hauer et al 2001 many amoebae have a broad ecological niche amplitude and may thrive in different environments despite this general ecological versatility the abundance and distribution pattern of individual species and thereby the community composition is strongly dependent on environmental conditions such as temperature moisture ph and food availability rodríguez zaragoza 1994 bass and bischoff 2001 the composition of amoeba communities varies between seasons in drinking water treatment system thomas et al 2008 ling et al 2016 but mechanisms that mediate seasonal variation in community structure have not been well investigated similarly most studies of amoeba communities have focused on a single type of habitat bass and bischoff 2001 ettinger et al 2002 ramirez et al 2014 delafont et al 2016 while the variation in composition of free living amoeba communities between habitats remains poorly understood the expanding use of high throughput sequencing provides new opportunities to investigate the relationship between environmental variables and composition of amoeba communities liu et al 2017 the study of free living amoebae is particularly relevant in aquatic systems that serve as drinking water resources amoebae are important predators on bacteria and contribute to the removal of bacteria from water systems but amoebae can also serve as vectors of pathogenic bacteria and some amoebae may act as opportunistic pathogens khan 2006 for example it is well known that amoebae may serve as hosts of two common respiratory pathogens legionella and mycobacterium guimaraes et al 2016 and some strains of acanthamoeba hartmannella and naegleria can directly cause infections in humans abedkhojasteh et al 2013 geisen et al 2014 although the reported cases are extremely rare the diagnosis of free living amoebae must never be overlooked as these are able to cause serious and fatal diseases to date we still know little about whether free living amoeba communities exhibit a habitat dependent pattern and how the assembly proceeds that subsequently drives the amoeba community delafont et al 2016 studies on the dynamics of free living amoeba communities can enhance our knowledge on the dispersal mechanism of amoeba across seasons and water ecosystems it can also contribute to strategies for prevention and control of the emergence and spread of free living amoebae in both natural reservoir and river hoffmann and michel 2001 the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of habitat and seasonal variation on the composition of free living amoeba communities in subtropical reservoirs and rivers in particular we wished to identify the important environmental factors that affect the dynamics of amoeba communities to achieve this we performed a yearlong sampling from four drinking water reservoirs and two rivers located in xiamen southeastern china to determine the abundance and community structure of free living amoebae in those habitats we used illumina high throughput sequencing

amplified each of the 40 reactions in triplicate for qpcr the amplification efficiency e of qpcr was estimated using the slope of the standard curve through the following formula e 10 1 slope 1 after evaluation of the analysis parameters the relation efficiencies for the standard curves were r2 0 9920 for acanthamoeba and 0 9901 for hartmannella respectively the reasonable efficiency of the pcr amplification was 101 8 for acanthamoeba and 99 8 for hartmannella the gene copy number in different samples was expressed as log copy numbers of gene per liter of water spearman s rank correlation coefficients between the abundance or diversity of amoeba 18s rrna gene acanthamoeba and hartmannella and environmental factors were calculated using psych r package version 1 7 8 revelle 2017 one way analysis of variance and tukey s test were performed to determine the significance of differences between samples 2 7 conventional pcr amplification for detection of specific genera for pcr amplification each 25 μl reaction contained 10 ng of template dna 0 5 μm of each primer 2 5u taq dna polymerase takara bio inc otsu shiga japan and 2 mm mgcl2 the primers used in this study are listed in table s2 agarose gel electrophoresis of the 50 μl pcr product was performed prior to purification qia quick gel extraction kit qiagen dusseldorf germany purified pcr products were ligated into the pmd 18t vector takara bio inc otsu shiga japan and transformed into escherichia coli dh5α competent cells positive clones were grown in luria bertani lb medium over night at 37 c sequences of the 18s rrna gene were manually checked and then compared with amoebae sequences deposited in the genbank database using the blastn the representative sequences were deposited in the genbank nucleotide sequence database under the accession no kj000408 to kj000410 2 8 statistical analyses prior to redundancy analysis rda the environmental data were log x 1 transformed except ph to improve normality and homoscedasticity the explanatory variables were sequentially removed with the highest variance inflation factor vif until all vifs were less than 10 to eliminate collinearity among environmental variables nakazawa and nakazawa 2017 we used a forward selection procedure with 999 monte carlo permutation tests to select the environmental variables that significantly explained the variation of amoeba communities p 0 05 in addition to investigate the habitat effect we analyzed the two amoeba communities from reservoir and river stations separately with the same environmental factors non metric multidimensional scaling nmds ordination and analysis of similarities anosim were used to investigate differences in community compositions the community compositions between samples were analyzed based on the bray curtis similarity of amoebal otu read relative abundance these analyses were performed by vegan package in r software version 3 4 3 oksanen et al 2018 we used the kruskal wallis test to compare the difference in environmental variables between reservoir and river samples across the four seasons we created classification models using the environmental variables to predict cluster membership of individual trees we used recursive partitioning for classification with the rpart r package version 4 1 12 therneau et al 2018 to create these models the models can result in a single classification tree for each site a decision tree with leaves representing the two growth signals and branches representing environmental variables that most strongly drive growth patterns loh 2014 at the branches the classification trees display thresholds between the two clusters in terms of the importance of environmental variables the advantage of applying classification trees is the capability of identifying a broad range of environmental factors which can significantly affect the amoeba occurrence goodness of fit of classification tree was calculated using deviance defined by the multinomial log likelihood de ath and fabricius 2000 elith et al 2008 to minimize overfitting trees were pruned to minimize cross validated error for factor predictors the data were ran based on conventional pcr categorized as either presence or absence and the environmental conditions 3 results 3 1 strong habitat pattern but weak seasonal change of amoeba community based on illumina sequencing the distribution of all eukaryotic plankton sequences generated by illumina high throughput sequencing is shown in fig 2 proportion of relative abundance between 8 3 minimum and 22 7 maximum of these sequences belonged to clades mainly consisting of protozoa from the lineages alveolata amoebozoa apusozoa archaeplastida excavata and rhizaria fig 2b tubulinea and discosea together constitute the amoebozoan subphylum lobosa which never have cilia or flagella whereas variosea together with mycetozoa and archamoebea are now grouped as the subphylum conosa whose constituent lineages either have cilia or flagella or have lost them secondarily are the main focus of this paper fig 2c the relative abundance of protozoa and or amoeba in reservoirs was higher than that in rivers over four seasons the relative abundance of free living amoebae peaked during spring summer in reservoirs and during summer in rivers fig 2c overall the most diverse and abundant otus in reservoirs were assigned to the groups of mycetozoa discoba and foraminifera they exhibited significantly higher relative abundance and diversity in the reservoir compared with the river fig 3 a however some groups such as variosea discosea tubulinea mesomycetozoa endomyxa and filosea exhibited an inverse trend and they were more diverse and abundant in the river fig 3a we observed two distinct groups corresponding to the two types of habitats reservoir and river and four seasons spring summer autumn and winter fig 3b further amoeba community compositions were significantly different with regard to both season and habitat as tested with anosim however the community differences between habitats were greater than the seasons global r 0 545 vs global r 0 244 table 1 indicating that the amoeba community patterns were highly consistent within habitat types our venn diagrams indicated that only 9 6 otus 32 otus were shared by reservoir and river habitats fig 3d at otu level 14 otus 6 5 of reservoir taxa and 4 otus 2 6 of river taxa were shared among four seasons in reservoir and river respectively and most of the unique otus occurred in summer season in both reservoir and river 3 2 relationship between ecological variables and processes and amoebae community the impact of physicochemical parameters on the amoebae communities was investigated using redundancy analysis rda the first and second rda axes explained 9 7 and 5 9 of the community variance respectively water temperature wt dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp electrical conductivity ec turbidity and total carbon tc were the significant variables affecting the amoeba community p 0 01 fig 3c the neutral community model explained 66 9 and 52 2 of the variation in the relative abundances of amoebal otus for reservoirs and rivers respectively fig s1 the nm value was a little higher for reservoir nm 26 5 than for river nm 11 5 reservoir waterbodies and river waters

using conventional pcr qpcr and high throughput sequencing only three genera namely acanthamoeba hartmannella and naegleria were detected by the conventional pcr method in the river habitat acanthamoeba was detected in all four seasons with moderate occurrence frequency whereas it was not detected in the reservoirs samples by conventional pcr hartmannella was detected in most sites in all seasons in the rivers and was also found in many sites in the reservoirs with highest incidence in summer fig s2a naegleria was detected only three times in summer samples from the reservoirs the river samples had the highest copy number of the 18s rrna gene of acanthamoeba 11087 4745 copy l in spring and numbers then gradually decreased in autumn 2646 737 copy l and winter 3535 1249 copy l fig s2b the abundance of 18s rrna gene of hartmannella was significantly higher in spring summer autumn of reservoir samples and spring summer of river samples than in other samples fig s2b only one otu of acanthamoeba and three otus of hartmannella were identified from our illumina sequencing data fig s2c and other amoeba genera from illumina sequencing are shown in fig s3 3 4 relationship between amoebae abundance occurrence and environmental variables the abundance of acanthamoeba 18s rrna gene showed a significant positive correlation with water temperature turbidity and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n in rivers table s2 similarly there was a positive correlation between the abundance of hartmannella and water temperature wt in both reservoirs and rivers a negative relationship was found between hartmannella and total carbon tc in reservoirs table s2 the classification tree of acanthamoeba presence in river generated a pruned tree with three splits and four terminal nodes fig 5 a the classification tree of hartmannella presence in reservoirs generated a pruned tree with three splits and four terminal nodes fig 5b this taxon showed a distinct pattern explained by different environmental factors water temperature wt turbidity and dissolved oxygen do were the major factors affecting the presence of hartmannella in reservoirs the determined node for hartmannella presence was classified by river environmental conditions with electrical conductivity ec values 428 4 μs cm in which hartmannella was likely to be present fig 5c the water temperature and electrical conductivity were the key environmental factors affecting the presence of hartmannella in reservoirs and rivers respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the habitat pattern prevails over seasonal change of amoebae community here we address the generalizability of free living amoebae distribution patterns we demonstrate that amoeba taxon distribution depends more on habitat type than on seasonal variation it could have been expected that the ecological properties in the reservoirs were significantly different from those in rivers rivers are constantly influenced by runoff drainage density and vegetation form of upstream areas tornés et al 2014 in this study it is clear that rivers have much higher chlorophyll a chl a electrical conductivity ec turbidity and nutrients than reservoirs fig 4 table s4 generally amoebae will be favored in habitats with a relatively high concentration of carbon and nitrogen and with high turbidity anderson 1997 douglas helders et al 2003 in this regard amoebae inhabiting these aquatic ecosystems can be considered as part of a broader metacommunity that is expressed differentially in response to local environmental and hydrological conditions thus some members of the amoeba communities are always present but vary in population size switching between absence or lower than detection limit and presence due to environmental changes bass and bischoff 2001 in our study both acanthamoeba and hartmannella were the common genera detected by conventional pcr this is in accordance with previous studies where acanthamoeba was the most prevalent genus of free living amoebae found in different aquatic environments magnet et al 2013 and hartmannella has been described as one of the most representative genera of amoebae in drinking water networks hoffmann and michel 2001 thomas et al 2008 valster et al 2009 other genera identified in this study such as gymnamoeba have been detected in several types of water such as ponds anderson 1997 naegleria and vannella in rivers and streams ettinger et al 2002 bonilla lemus et al 2014 and naegleria in water hyacinth root ramirez et al 2010 the impact of seasonality on free living amoebae community has already been studied but without giving consistent results previous studies demonstrated that acanthamoeba or hartmannella can thrive in water ecosystems all year round at a range of temperatures thomas et al 2008 and they have the ability to accommodate gradual water temperature changes to survive delafont et al 2016 however a previous study reported a considerable number of acanthamoeba and hartmannella in a river during the summer ettinger et al 2002 the high abundance of acanthamoeba detected in spring and summer may be caused by their favorable growth temperature about 30 c geisen et al 2014 4 2 water temperature turbidity and nutrients correlated with the amoebae community dynamics previous studies regarding the temperature tolerance of protozoa especially amoebae implied that temperature is an important factor for the distribution of free living amoebae thomas et al 2006 bonilla lemus et al 2014 delafont et al 2016 our results also suggest that water temperature and turbidity directly or indirectly affected the amoebae communities and the presence of acanthamoeba and hartmannella fig 3c fig 5a and b this is in accordance with a previous study that acanthamoeba in a river was richer during spring and early summer and no hartmannella could be isolated in late summer ettinger et al 2002 higher environmental temperature favors thermophilic amoebae like acanthamoeba and hartmannella delafont et al 2016 water temperature varies considerably within aquatic ecosystems generating both opportunities and constraints for their inhabitants schindler 2017 in this study seasonal shifts in the free living amoebae community covaried with water temperature fig 4 from our results it becomes clear that when the temperature is lowered through a small interval especially when the change occurs near the physiological optimum the growth rate of amoeba may be unaffected thomas et al 2008 when the fall in temperature is greater the growth rate may be retarded suddenly or gradually or in rare cases there may even be an acceleration for a brief time miller et al 2018 high turbidity and nutrients indicated that the water contained suspended and soluble material that can provide nutrition and encourage growth of the amoeba douglas helders et al 2003 it may imply that nutrients e g carbon nitrogen phosphorous concentrations can directly and indirectly influence free living amoebae community composition zahn et al 2016 the deep deterministic mechanisms underlying community assembly of free living amoebae deserves further study 4 3 amoebae community assembly exhibited stronger stochastic processes in reservoir than river our results indicate that the importance of stochastic processes in shaping free living amoebae communities is stronger in reservoir than in river the neutral community model is a valid approach for inferring stochastic processes on the community assembly and has been successfully applied to a wide range of ecological phenomena sloan et al 2006 zhou and ning 2017 regarding immigration rate the m value was higher in reservoir 0 80 than in river 0 35 indicating that the dispersal ability was higher in reservoir than river the role of dispersal has been emphasized within the metacommunity concept which concerns local communities that are linked to each other by the dispersal of multiple and potentially interacting species leibold et al 2004 high dispersal ability allows amoebae to have a high probability of colonizing suitable habitats from regional pools thereby potentially reducing the variation of community composition yang et al 2010 as river ecosystems are dynamic under normal conditions and influenced by drainage density and hydrological exchange impact of migration and some of the key environmental variables can change by transport from upstream to downstream hullar et al 2006 our results suggest that both neutral and deterministic processes interact during the amoeba community assembly and their importance may differ depending on the habitat type 4 4 methodological issues and potential limitations the use of pcr based techniques to estimate community composition is complicated by the fact that rrna gene copy number varies from one to thousands in single eukaryotic genomes prokopowich et al 2003 bik et al 2012 furthermore in addition to the variation from species to species it is also known that the dna content can vary substantially between growth phases therefore it has been suggested that the copy number of the 18s rrna gene might vary during the growth cycle of protozoa bowers et al 2000 these facts preclude a direct translation of rdna read number into abundance of individual organisms however the number of rdna copies per genome correlates positively to the size and particularly to the biovolume of the eukaryotic cell it represents de vargas et al 2015 results from tara oceans stations further confirmed the correlation between biovolume and v9 rdna abundance data which was used for illumina sequencing in this study the macroelement contents including carbon and nitrogen with ecological significance exhibited a higher correlation with plankton biomass or biovolume than plankton abundance lv et al 2014 sandrini et al 2014 previous results with hartmannella vermiformis indicate that the copy number of the 18s rrna gene in cysts did not differ significantly from that in trophozoites the estimated copy number for the 18s rrna gene on the genome of h vermiformis 1330 127 mean se copies cell exceeds the values reported for other unicellular eukaryotes le blancq et al 1997 galluzzi et al 2004 these reports and our observations indicate that the use of pcr based techniques is a relevant approach to rapidly and accurately estimate community composition of amoebae in natural freshwater environments however complex matrices such as surface waters may contain organic and inorganic compounds which interfere with several steps in the dna isolation and amplification protocols during the qpcr amplification of target dna difference of ct value by qpcr in environmental samples 2 89 for reservoir and 2 93 for river is slightly less than 3 32 with 10 fold dilution indicating there is minor inhibition in the environmental samples based on the internal control experiments however no significant difference of inhibition value was found between the reservoir samples spiked with undiluted 10 fold diluted cultured amoeba cells and river samples kruskal wallis test p 0 05 these data suggest that the qpcr results were subject to somewhat inhibition effect but the results from the reservoir and river samples from the same season are comparable under same procedure or condition the full evaluation of inhibition effect of qpcr seems to go beyond the scope of this study but it deserves further study for high throughput rdna analysis the protist ribosomal reference pr2 database provides unique access to eukaryotic small sub unit ssu ribosomal rna and dna sequences particularly regarding the fine taxonomy of protists amaral zettler et al 2009 guillou et al 2013 we checked amoebae in the pr2 database and found that there were 2438 otus belonging to amoebozoa 2478 otus belonging to discoba excavata and 5334 otus belonging to cercozoa rhizaria and foraminifera rhizaria in addition there were hundreds of otus belonging to acanthamoeba furthermore despite the pr2 database version 4 1 containing more than 10000 different free living amoeba sequences it is very likely that many more species remain to be discovered or described in water 5 conclusions overall the results of this study suggest that the free living amoeba communities are more affected by habitat river vs reservoir than by the season in these subtropical aquatic ecosystems the results also indicate that abiotic factors in particular water temperature play an important role in amoeba ecology both environmental selection and neutral processes play important roles in the community assembly while the stochastic processes were more important for shaping the communities of free living amoebae in reservoir than in river to fully understand the distribution of free living amoeba communities and assembly mechanisms we propose that future investigations should put more attention on sampling scale effects spatial extent and time scale and species interactions and consider more environmental factors like irradiance and suspended particulates the advent of molecular techniques has enabled the characterization of amoebae communities without the need of culturing and provides easier faster and better opportunities to understand their ecology and their possible impact on the health of humans and on various ecosystems a continual effort to monitor and establish the dynamics of microbial organisms in freshwater ecosystems particularly with an emphasis on free living amoebae over the long term is necessary to determine the impact of rising surface water temperature and increasing eutrophication on community structure and function acknowledgments we thank dr yongming wang for sampling

19274,free living amoebae are widespread in freshwater ecosystems although many studies have investigated changes in their communities across space the temporal variability and the drivers of community changes across different habitat types are poorly understood a total of 108 surface water samples were collected on a seasonal basis from four reservoirs and two rivers in xiamen city subtropical china we used high throughput sequencing and qpcr methods to explore the occurrence and abundance of free living amoebae in total 335 amoeba otus were detected and only 32 otus were shared by reservoir and river habitats the reservoirs and rivers harbored unique amoebae communities and exhibited distinct seasonal patterns in community composition high abundance of the 18s rrna gene of acanthamoeba was observed in spring and summer whereas the abundance was low in autumn and winter in addition the abundance of hartmannella was significantly higher when isolated from reservoirs in summer autumn and from river in spring summer moreover the temporal patterns of amoebae communities were significantly associated with water temperature indicating that temperature is an important variable controlling the ecological dynamics of amoebae populations however our comparative analysis indicated that both environmental selection and neutral processes significantly contributed to amoeba community assembly the genera detected here include pathogenic species and species that can act as vectors for microbial pathogens which can cause human infections graphical abstract image 1 keywords protozoa plankton high throughput sequencing community composition seasonal dynamics 1 introduction free living amoebae feed on various microorganisms including fungi and bacteria and constitute significant links in microbial food webs in water and soil amoebae are widely distributed both in natural hsu et al 2011 hsu 2016 and man made aquatic ecosystems thomas et al 2008 delafont et al 2013 2016 and they play key roles in water purification and in biogeochemical cycling and fertility maintenance of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems thomas et al 2006 falkowski et al 2008 vanessa et al 2012 bonilla lemus et al 2014 most amoebae are able to form cysts allowing them to survive adverse conditions when favorable conditions resume the amoebae can excyst and revert to the active feeding stage khan 2006 the cysts can remain viable for years which allow amoebae to be very resilient to diverse and changing environmental conditions hauer et al 2001 many amoebae have a broad ecological niche amplitude and may thrive in different environments despite this general ecological versatility the abundance and distribution pattern of individual species and thereby the community composition is strongly dependent on environmental conditions such as temperature moisture ph and food availability rodríguez zaragoza 1994 bass and bischoff 2001 the composition of amoeba communities varies between seasons in drinking water treatment system thomas et al 2008 ling et al 2016 but mechanisms that mediate seasonal variation in community structure have not been well investigated similarly most studies of amoeba communities have focused on a single type of habitat bass and bischoff 2001 ettinger et al 2002 ramirez et al 2014 delafont et al 2016 while the variation in composition of free living amoeba communities between habitats remains poorly understood the expanding use of high throughput sequencing provides new opportunities to investigate the relationship between environmental variables and composition of amoeba communities liu et al 2017 the study of free living amoebae is particularly relevant in aquatic systems that serve as drinking water resources amoebae are important predators on bacteria and contribute to the removal of bacteria from water systems but amoebae can also serve as vectors of pathogenic bacteria and some amoebae may act as opportunistic pathogens khan 2006 for example it is well known that amoebae may serve as hosts of two common respiratory pathogens legionella and mycobacterium guimaraes et al 2016 and some strains of acanthamoeba hartmannella and naegleria can directly cause infections in humans abedkhojasteh et al 2013 geisen et al 2014 although the reported cases are extremely rare the diagnosis of free living amoebae must never be overlooked as these are able to cause serious and fatal diseases to date we still know little about whether free living amoeba communities exhibit a habitat dependent pattern and how the assembly proceeds that subsequently drives the amoeba community delafont et al 2016 studies on the dynamics of free living amoeba communities can enhance our knowledge on the dispersal mechanism of amoeba across seasons and water ecosystems it can also contribute to strategies for prevention and control of the emergence and spread of free living amoebae in both natural reservoir and river hoffmann and michel 2001 the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of habitat and seasonal variation on the composition of free living amoeba communities in subtropical reservoirs and rivers in particular we wished to identify the important environmental factors that affect the dynamics of amoeba communities to achieve this we performed a yearlong sampling from four drinking water reservoirs and two rivers located in xiamen southeastern china to determine the abundance and community structure of free living amoebae in those habitats we used illumina high throughput sequencing to characterize the amoeba communities in the samples and we measured a range of environmental variables furthermore we used conventional and quantitative pcr to detect presence absence and 18s rrna gene copy numbers of some common amoeba genera respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection the sampling sites include four reservoirs and two rivers of xiamen city fig 1

coefficients between the abundance or diversity of amoeba 18s rrna gene acanthamoeba and hartmannella and environmental factors were calculated using psych r package version 1 7 8 revelle 2017 one way analysis of variance and tukey s test were performed to determine the significance of differences between samples 2 7 conventional pcr amplification for detection of specific genera for pcr amplification each 25 μl reaction contained 10 ng of template dna 0 5 μm of each primer 2 5u taq dna polymerase takara bio inc otsu shiga japan and 2 mm mgcl2 the primers used in this study are listed in table s2 agarose gel electrophoresis of the 50 μl pcr product was performed prior to purification qia quick gel extraction kit qiagen dusseldorf germany purified pcr products were ligated into the pmd 18t vector takara bio inc otsu shiga japan and transformed into escherichia coli dh5α competent cells positive clones were grown in luria bertani lb medium over night at 37 c sequences of the 18s rrna gene were manually checked and then compared with amoebae sequences deposited in the genbank database using the blastn the representative sequences were deposited in the genbank nucleotide sequence database under the accession no kj000408 to kj000410 2 8 statistical analyses prior to redundancy analysis rda the environmental data were log x 1 transformed except ph to improve normality and homoscedasticity the explanatory variables were sequentially removed with the highest variance inflation factor vif until all vifs were less than 10 to eliminate collinearity among environmental variables nakazawa and nakazawa 2017 we used a forward selection procedure with 999 monte carlo permutation tests to select the environmental variables that significantly explained the variation of amoeba communities p 0 05 in addition to investigate the habitat effect we analyzed the two amoeba communities from reservoir and river stations separately with the same environmental factors non metric multidimensional scaling nmds ordination and analysis of similarities anosim were used to investigate differences in community compositions the community compositions between samples were analyzed based on the bray curtis similarity of amoebal otu read relative abundance these analyses were performed by vegan package in r software version 3 4 3 oksanen et al 2018 we used the kruskal wallis test to compare the difference in environmental variables between reservoir and river samples across the four seasons we created classification models using the environmental variables to predict cluster membership of individual trees we used recursive partitioning for classification with the rpart r package version 4 1 12 therneau et al 2018 to create these models the models can result in a single classification tree for each site a decision tree with leaves representing the two growth signals and branches representing environmental variables that most strongly drive growth patterns loh 2014 at the branches the classification trees display thresholds between the two clusters in terms of the importance of environmental variables the advantage of applying classification trees is the capability of identifying a broad range of environmental factors which can significantly affect the amoeba occurrence goodness of fit of classification tree was calculated using deviance defined by the multinomial log likelihood de ath and fabricius 2000 elith et al 2008 to minimize overfitting trees were pruned to minimize cross validated error for factor predictors the data were ran based on conventional pcr categorized as either presence or absence and the environmental conditions 3 results 3 1 strong habitat pattern but weak seasonal change of amoeba community based on illumina sequencing the distribution of all eukaryotic plankton sequences generated by illumina high throughput sequencing is shown in fig 2 proportion of relative abundance between 8 3 minimum and 22 7 maximum of these sequences belonged to clades mainly consisting of protozoa from the lineages alveolata amoebozoa apusozoa archaeplastida excavata and rhizaria fig 2b tubulinea and discosea together constitute the amoebozoan subphylum lobosa which never have cilia or flagella whereas variosea together with mycetozoa and archamoebea are now grouped as the subphylum conosa whose constituent lineages either have cilia or flagella or have lost them secondarily are the main focus of this paper fig 2c the relative abundance of protozoa and or amoeba in reservoirs was higher than that in rivers over four seasons the relative abundance of free living amoebae peaked during spring summer in reservoirs and during summer in rivers fig 2c overall the most diverse and abundant otus in reservoirs were assigned to the groups of mycetozoa discoba and foraminifera they exhibited significantly higher relative abundance and diversity in the reservoir compared with the river fig 3 a however some groups such as variosea discosea tubulinea mesomycetozoa endomyxa and filosea exhibited an inverse trend and they were more diverse and abundant in the river fig 3a we observed two distinct groups corresponding to the two types of habitats reservoir and river and four seasons spring summer autumn and winter fig 3b further amoeba community compositions were significantly different with regard to both season and habitat as tested with anosim however the community differences between habitats were greater than the seasons global r 0 545 vs global r 0 244 table 1 indicating that the amoeba community patterns were highly consistent within habitat types our venn diagrams indicated that only 9 6 otus 32 otus were shared by reservoir and river habitats fig 3d at otu level 14 otus 6 5 of reservoir taxa and 4 otus 2 6 of river taxa were shared among four seasons in reservoir and river respectively and most of the unique otus occurred in summer season in both reservoir and river 3 2 relationship between ecological variables and processes and amoebae community the impact of physicochemical parameters on the amoebae communities was investigated using redundancy analysis rda the first and second rda axes explained 9 7 and 5 9 of the community variance respectively water temperature wt dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp electrical conductivity ec turbidity and total carbon tc were the significant variables affecting the amoeba community p 0 01 fig 3c the neutral community model explained 66 9 and 52 2 of the variation in the relative abundances of amoebal otus for reservoirs and rivers respectively fig s1 the nm value was a little higher for reservoir nm 26 5 than for river nm 11 5 reservoir waterbodies and river waters

using conventional pcr qpcr and high throughput sequencing only three genera namely acanthamoeba hartmannella and naegleria were detected by the conventional pcr method in the river habitat acanthamoeba was detected in all four seasons with moderate occurrence frequency whereas it was not detected in the reservoirs samples by conventional pcr hartmannella was detected in most sites in all seasons in the rivers and was also found in many sites in the reservoirs with highest incidence in summer fig s2a naegleria was detected only three times in summer samples from the reservoirs the river samples had the highest copy number of the 18s rrna gene of acanthamoeba 11087 4745 copy l in spring and numbers then gradually decreased in autumn 2646 737 copy l and winter 3535 1249 copy l fig s2b the abundance of 18s rrna gene of hartmannella was significantly higher in spring summer autumn of reservoir samples and spring summer of river samples than in other samples fig s2b only one otu of acanthamoeba and three otus of hartmannella were identified from our illumina sequencing data fig s2c and other amoeba genera from illumina sequencing are shown in fig s3 3 4 relationship between amoebae abundance occurrence and environmental variables the abundance of acanthamoeba 18s rrna gene showed a significant positive correlation with water temperature turbidity and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n in rivers table s2 similarly there was a positive correlation between the abundance of hartmannella and water temperature wt in both reservoirs and rivers a negative relationship was found between hartmannella and total carbon tc in reservoirs table s2 the classification tree of acanthamoeba presence in river generated a pruned tree with three splits and four terminal nodes fig 5 a the classification tree of hartmannella presence in reservoirs generated a pruned tree with three splits and four terminal nodes fig 5b this taxon showed a distinct pattern explained by different environmental factors water temperature wt turbidity and dissolved oxygen do were the major factors affecting the presence of hartmannella in reservoirs the determined node for hartmannella presence was classified by river environmental conditions with electrical conductivity ec values 428 4 μs cm in which hartmannella was likely to be present fig 5c the water temperature and electrical conductivity were the key environmental factors affecting the presence of hartmannella in reservoirs and rivers respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the habitat pattern prevails over seasonal change of amoebae community here we address the generalizability of free living amoebae distribution patterns we demonstrate that amoeba taxon distribution depends more on habitat type than on seasonal variation it could have been expected that the ecological properties in the reservoirs were significantly different from those in rivers rivers are constantly influenced by runoff drainage density and vegetation form of upstream areas tornés et al 2014 in this study it is clear that rivers have much higher chlorophyll a chl a electrical conductivity ec turbidity and nutrients than reservoirs fig 4 table s4 generally amoebae will be favored in habitats with a relatively high concentration of carbon and nitrogen and with high turbidity anderson 1997 douglas helders et al 2003 in this regard amoebae inhabiting these aquatic ecosystems can be considered as part of a broader metacommunity that is expressed differentially in response to local environmental and hydrological conditions thus some members of the amoeba communities are always present but vary in population size switching between absence or lower than detection limit and presence due to environmental changes bass and bischoff 2001 in our study both acanthamoeba and hartmannella were the common genera detected by conventional pcr this is in accordance with previous studies where acanthamoeba was the most prevalent genus of free living amoebae found in different aquatic environments magnet et al 2013 and hartmannella has been described as one of the most representative genera of amoebae in drinking water networks hoffmann and michel 2001 thomas et al 2008 valster et al 2009 other genera identified in this study such as gymnamoeba have been detected in several types of water such as ponds anderson 1997 naegleria and vannella in rivers and streams ettinger et al 2002 bonilla lemus et al 2014 and naegleria in water hyacinth root ramirez et al 2010 the impact of seasonality on free living amoebae community has already been studied but without giving consistent results previous studies demonstrated that acanthamoeba or hartmannella can thrive in water ecosystems all year round at a range of temperatures thomas et al 2008 and they have the ability to accommodate gradual water temperature changes to survive delafont et al 2016 however a previous study reported a considerable number of acanthamoeba and hartmannella in a river during the summer ettinger et al 2002 the high abundance of acanthamoeba detected in spring and summer may be caused by their favorable growth temperature about 30 c geisen et al 2014 4 2 water temperature turbidity and nutrients correlated with the amoebae community dynamics previous studies regarding the temperature tolerance of protozoa especially amoebae implied that temperature is an important factor for the distribution of free living amoebae thomas et al 2006 bonilla lemus et al 2014 delafont et al 2016 our results also suggest that water temperature and turbidity directly or indirectly affected the amoebae communities and the presence of acanthamoeba and hartmannella fig 3c fig 5a and b this is in accordance with a previous study that acanthamoeba in a river was richer during spring and early summer and no hartmannella could be isolated in late summer ettinger et al 2002 higher environmental temperature favors thermophilic amoebae like acanthamoeba and hartmannella delafont et al 2016 water temperature varies considerably within aquatic ecosystems generating both opportunities and constraints for their inhabitants schindler 2017 in this study seasonal shifts in the free living amoebae community covaried with water temperature fig 4 from our results it becomes clear that when the temperature is lowered through a small interval especially when the change occurs near the physiological optimum the growth rate of amoeba may be unaffected thomas et al 2008 when the fall in temperature is greater the growth rate may be retarded suddenly or gradually or in rare cases there may even be an acceleration for a brief time miller et al 2018 high turbidity and nutrients indicated that the water contained suspended and soluble material that can provide nutrition and encourage growth of the amoeba douglas helders et al 2003 it may imply that nutrients e g carbon nitrogen phosphorous concentrations can directly and indirectly influence free living amoebae community composition zahn et al 2016 the deep deterministic mechanisms underlying community assembly of free living amoebae deserves further study 4 3 amoebae community assembly exhibited stronger stochastic processes in reservoir than river our results indicate that the importance of stochastic processes in shaping free living amoebae communities is stronger in reservoir than in river the neutral community model is a valid approach for inferring stochastic processes on the community assembly and has been successfully applied to a wide range of ecological phenomena sloan et al 2006 zhou and ning 2017 regarding immigration rate the m value was higher in reservoir 0 80 than in river 0 35 indicating that the dispersal ability was higher in reservoir than river the role of dispersal has been emphasized within the metacommunity concept which concerns local communities that are linked to each other by the dispersal of multiple and potentially interacting species leibold et al 2004 high dispersal ability allows amoebae to have a high probability of colonizing suitable habitats from regional pools thereby potentially reducing the variation of community composition yang et al 2010 as river ecosystems are dynamic under normal conditions and influenced by drainage density and hydrological exchange impact of migration and some of the key environmental variables can change by transport from upstream to downstream hullar et al 2006 our results suggest that both neutral and deterministic processes interact during the amoeba community assembly and their importance may differ depending on the habitat type 4 4 methodological issues and potential limitations the use of pcr based techniques to estimate community composition is complicated by the fact that rrna gene copy number varies from one to thousands in single eukaryotic genomes prokopowich et al 2003 bik et al 2012 furthermore in addition to the variation from species to species it is also known that the dna content can vary substantially between growth phases therefore it has been suggested that the copy number of the 18s rrna gene might vary during the growth cycle of protozoa bowers et al 2000 these facts preclude a direct translation of rdna read number into abundance of individual organisms however the number of rdna copies per genome correlates positively to the size and particularly to the biovolume of the eukaryotic cell it represents de vargas et al 2015 results from tara oceans stations further confirmed the correlation between biovolume and v9 rdna abundance data which was used for illumina sequencing in this study the macroelement contents including carbon and nitrogen with ecological significance exhibited a higher correlation with plankton biomass or biovolume than plankton abundance lv et al 2014 sandrini et al 2014 previous results with hartmannella vermiformis indicate that the copy number of the 18s rrna gene in cysts did not differ significantly from that in trophozoites the estimated copy number for the 18s rrna gene on the genome of h vermiformis 1330 127 mean se copies cell exceeds the values reported for other unicellular eukaryotes le blancq et al 1997 galluzzi et al 2004 these reports and our observations indicate that the use of pcr based techniques is a relevant approach to rapidly and accurately estimate community composition of amoebae in natural freshwater environments however complex matrices such as surface waters may contain organic and inorganic compounds which interfere with several steps in the dna isolation and amplification protocols during the qpcr amplification of target dna difference of ct value by qpcr in environmental samples 2 89 for reservoir and 2 93 for river is slightly less than 3 32 with 10 fold dilution indicating there is minor inhibition in the environmental samples based on the internal control experiments however no significant difference of inhibition value was found between the reservoir samples spiked with undiluted 10 fold diluted cultured amoeba cells and river samples kruskal wallis test p 0 05 these data suggest that the qpcr results were subject to somewhat inhibition effect but the results from the reservoir and river samples from the same season are comparable under same procedure or condition the full evaluation of inhibition effect of qpcr seems to go beyond the scope of this study but it deserves further study for high throughput rdna analysis the protist ribosomal reference pr2 database provides unique access to eukaryotic small sub unit ssu ribosomal rna and dna sequences particularly regarding the fine taxonomy of protists amaral zettler et al 2009 guillou et al 2013 we checked amoebae in the pr2 database and found that there were 2438 otus belonging to amoebozoa 2478 otus belonging to discoba excavata and 5334 otus belonging to cercozoa rhizaria and foraminifera rhizaria in addition there were hundreds of otus belonging to acanthamoeba furthermore despite the pr2 database version 4 1 containing more than 10000 different free living amoeba sequences it is very likely that many more species remain to be discovered or described in water 5 conclusions overall the results of this study suggest that the free living amoeba communities are more affected by habitat river vs reservoir than by the season in these subtropical aquatic ecosystems the results also indicate that abiotic factors in particular water temperature play an important role in amoeba ecology both environmental selection and neutral processes play important roles in the community assembly while the stochastic processes were more important for shaping the communities of free living amoebae in reservoir than in river to fully understand the distribution of free living amoeba communities and assembly mechanisms we propose that future investigations should put more attention on sampling scale effects spatial extent and time scale and species interactions and consider more environmental factors like irradiance and suspended particulates the advent of molecular techniques has enabled the characterization of amoebae communities without the need of culturing and provides easier faster and better opportunities to understand their ecology and their possible impact on the health of humans and on various ecosystems a continual effort to monitor and establish the dynamics of microbial organisms in freshwater ecosystems particularly with an emphasis on free living amoebae over the long term is necessary to determine the impact of rising surface water temperature and increasing eutrophication on community structure and function acknowledgments we thank dr yongming wang for sampling
