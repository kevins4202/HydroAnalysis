15130,disinfection by products dbps are formed through the disinfection of water containing precursors such as natural organic matter or anthropogenic compounds e g pharmaceuticals and pesticides due to the ever increasing use of plastics elastomers and other polymers in our daily lives polymer based materials pbms are detected more frequently and at higher concentrations in water and wastewater the present review provides a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the contribution of pbms including elastomers tire waste polyelectrolytes and microplastics as precursors of dbps in water and wastewater literature shows that the presence of pbms can lead to the leaching of dissolved organic matter dom and subsequent formation of dbps upon disinfection in aqueous media the quantity and type of dbps formed strongly depends on the type of polymer its concentration its age water salinity and disinfection conditions such as oxidant dosage ph temperature and contact time dom leaching from elastomers and tire waste was shown to form n nitrosodimethylamine up to concerning levels of 930 ng l and 466 715 ng l respectively upon chemical disinfection under laboratory conditions polyelectrolytes can also react with chemical disinfectants to form toxic dbps recent findings indicate trihalomethanes formation potential of plastics can be as high as 15 990 µg l based on the maximum formation potential under extreme conditions our analysis highlights an overlooked contribution of dom leaching from pbms as dbp precursors during disinfection of water and wastewater further studies need to be conducted to ascertain the extent of this contribution in real water and wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection by products microplastics polymers polyelectrolytes tire wear particles data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the number of anthropogenic chemicals entering our environment is ever increasing one such widely used chemical class is polymer based materials pbms synthetic polymers are made by polymerizing monomers extracted from the oil gas petroleum industry shams 2019 and can be categorized into thermoplastics thermosets and elastomers according to their response to applied heat ganesan et al 2013 synthetic polymers particularly plastics have become an intrinsic part of our daily lives due to their numerous applications associated with desirable properties such as durability lightweight flexibility chemical inertness and mass production ability lambert and wagner 2018 menéndez pedriza and jaumot 2020 nava and leoni 2021 these features coupled with the high demand for single use plastics have resulted in a massive worldwide plastic production reaching 360 million tonnes in 2018 chen awasthi et al 2021 the majority of existing wastewater treatment plants wwtps cannot completely remove pbms due to the small size and buoyancy of some of the pbms e g microplastic fibers from synthetic textiles mccormick et al 2014 wagner et al 2018 although some wwtps can remove pbms efficiently up to 99 removal depending on treatment processes the great amount of pbms entering the system means a considerable amount escapes the treatment process therefore pbms can enter the disinfection units and eventually be released into the environment through the wwtps effluent discharge shams 2019 for instance lebreton et al 2017 estimated a release of 1 15 2 41 million tonnes of plastic particles typically within a range of 0 3 50 000 mm from rivers wwtps and tributaries into the oceans annually and eriksen et al 2014 estimated that more than five trillion plastic fragments mostly within a range of 0 33 4 75 mm 250 000 tonnes are currently floating in oceans globally furthermore different additives e g fire retardants plasticizers antioxidants and colorants that are added to polymers to improve their processability performance application and durability ambrogi et al 2017 bolívar subirats et al 2021 can simultaneously be released into the aqueous media chen shi et al 2021 and pollute the marine environment the adverse effects of pbms and their additives on flora and fauna have been studied extensively auta et al 2017 li et al 2018 luo et al 2021 unintended reactions between different chemical disinfectants such as free chlorine chloramine ozone and chlorine dioxide and various dissolved constituents in the water matrix such as dissolved organic matter dom can generate harmful disinfection by products dbps ding et al 2019 fang et al 2021 dbps carry a risk of cytotoxicity genotoxicity teratogenicity mutagenicity carcinogenicity diarrhea and other waterborne disorders jasemizad et al 2020 pandian et al 2022 xiao et al 2022 commonly regulated dbps include trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas usepa 2006 to date over 700 dbps have been identified among which about 100 have been thoroughly studied for their formation occurrence and the risk of cytotoxicity genotoxicity carcinogenicity and endocrinological disruption plewa et al 2002 richardson and plewa 2020 a number of factors have led to an increased interest in studying nitrogenous dbps n dbps over conventional carbonaceous dbps c dbps during the past two decades utilities rely on source waters that are affected by municipal wastewater effluents or algal blooms and thus contain higher amounts of organic nitrogen that plays a key role in the formation of n dbps shah and mitch 2012 in addition many drinking water facilities have switched from chlorination to chloramination to minimize the formation of regulated c dbps jasemizad et al 2021 as a result of this change chloramines yield less regulated dbps at the expense of an increased risk of n dbps formation due to the nitrogen present in chloramines jasemizad et al 2021 richardson and plewa 2020 despite being significantly lower in concentrations than c dbps n dbps are more toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic than c dbps jasemizad et al 2021 shah and mitch 2012 the most studied n dbps include halonitroalkanes haloacetamides such as dichloroacetamide dcacam halonitriles and n nitrosamines such as n nitrosodimethylamine ndma shah and mitch 2012 ndma is considered a probable carcinogen and concentrations as low as seven ng l are associated with a 10 5 cancer risk level usepa 2002 2014 a lot of pbms contain nitrogen as one of their constituents either in the polymer structure e g polyelectrolytes polyamide and polyurethane or as additives therefore there is a high potential for the formation of n dbps upon chemical disinfection processes it is important for researchers to investigate the formation potential of n dbps from pbms due to the high number of polymers used in practice that contains nitrogen on the one hand previous research on dbp precursors in water and wastewater has mostly focused on natural organic matter nom and known anthropogenic pollutants hanigan et al 2015 ike et al 2019 shen and andrews 2011 yang et al 2015 nom which is the main precursor of dbps can be found ubiquitously in water resources in colloidal dissolved or particulate forms jasemizad et al 2021 kitis et al 2001 a major fraction of nom in water sources is dom containing both dissolved and colloidal forms i e component that passes a 0 45 µm filter kitis et al 2001 dom which serves as a major precursor of dbps is composed of a heterogeneous mixture of humic and non humic substances i e hydrophilic acids proteins amino acids and hydrocarbons kitis et al 2001 priya et al 2020 as nom or dom cannot be measured directly researchers mostly have quantified these parameters through the measurement of dissolved organic carbon doc kitis et al 2001 on the other hand a recent trend is towards assessing other dbp precursors including present constituents in raw water treatment agents e g polyelectrolytes and dissolved compounds leaching from pbms ateia et al 2020 atkinson et al 2020 beita sandí et al 2019 ding et al 2018 2019 lee et al 2020 zeng et al 2016 the purpose of the present article is to provide a critical review of the current understanding of the role of pbms as potential precursors of dbps in water and wastewater under chemical disinfection in the following sections we discuss elastomeric materials used in the water distribution system tire wear particles twps polyelectrolytes and microplastics mps as these are the most studied polymers reported to form various dbps see table 1 2 elastomers and tire waste pbms especially elastomers have been used in tap water distribution systems for more than five decades samarth and mahanwar 2021 based on iso tr 21960 2020 e 2020 elastomers are macromolecules that are able to return to their original shape and dimension quickly after significant deformation by a weak pressure and subsequent stress release they have been used in a wide range of applications including rubber gaskets valves fittings and hydrants these elastomeric materials are used with different piping materials such as polyvinyl chloride pvc steel copper and ductile cast iron samarth and mahanwar 2021 elastomers mostly rubbers are also the main component of the tire of vehicles a tire can contain up to 200 different additives müller et al 2022 on average a tire contains natural rubber elastomer polyisoprene synthetic rubber such as styrene butadiene rubber 40 60 mass reinforcing agents or fillers such as carbon black silica and chalk 20 35 metals and softeners including oil and resin 15 various additives including plasticizers antioxidants preservatives and desiccants 5 10 textile 5 vulcanization agents such as zinc oxide and sulfur 1 5 baensch baltruschat et al 2020 torretta et al 2015 wagner et al 2018 wik and dave 2009 each of these compounds serves a different purpose and contributes to more durable commercial tires müller et al 2022 found 214 potential organic compounds related to tire waste out of which 145 were known as leachable friction between vehicles tires and road surfaces causes wear and tear of tires and yields tire wear particles twps zhang et al 2021 twps generation ranges from 0 006 to 1 7 g km per tire wagner et al 2018 wik and dave 2009 2 1 occurrence more than 90 of twps are non airborne and settle on road surfaces or roadside reach nearby soil and also be transported to wastewater treatment plants or fresh water bodies through surface runoff luo et al 2021 wagner et al 2018 wik and dave 2009 there is limited quantitative data on twps accumulation and distribution because of the lack of analytical methods to measure twp directly twp markers one of the tire constituents present at known concentrations are analyzed to estimate twps concentrations wagner et al 2018 twp concentrations in road runoff are suggested to be in the range of 0 3 and 197 mg l due to the highest concentrations of benzothiazole and its derivates beita sandí et al 2019 wik and dave 2009 while twp concentrations on the road surface near road side and in river sediments were reported to be much higher in the range of 1 000 70 000 70 80 000 and 400 1 100 mg kg respectively wagner et al 2018 there is a paucity of data on the fate of elastomeric materials especially twps in wwtps and their removal efficiencies however a rough estimation can be made using microplastic removal in wwtps baensch baltruschat et al 2020 wagner et al 2018 because twps also have semi synthetic polymer backbone they are insoluble in water and their particle size is within mps size range baensch baltruschat et al 2020 wwtps are considered to be effective in removing mps 90 removal who 2019 the finer the twps are the lower is their removal efficiency furthermore who 2019 estimates around 67 of the populace in upper middle lower middle and low income countries do not have access to centralized wastewater treatment which means no removal of twps therefore surface water and the marine environment in most places are polluted with twps and their leaching constituents which can further contribute to the formation of dbps during the disinfection of drinking water treatment plants 2 2 leaching and dbps formation potential the degradation of elastomers exposed to disinfectants in the water distribution system has been reviewed previously samarth and mahanwar 2021 schoenbaechler 2007 and it is well accepted that disinfection reactions can lower the lifespan of elastomeric polymers exposed to disinfected water however little is known about elastomer s role as a precursor of dbps the experiment by siemens and kaupenjohann 2003 revealed leaching of doc from elastomeric polymers especially sealings the measured doc leaching from silicone rubber and neoprene polychloroprene was up to 4 6 and 63 mg doc l respectively 0 3 and 4 2 mg doc l cm2 day the leachability of different constituents from tires and the subsequent potential risks to aqueous media have been studied for many years day et al 1993 evans 1997 müller et al 2022 nelson et al 1994 however there are a lot of probable leachable constituents from scrap tires reported in recent years whose toxicity and dbp formation potential is unknown or still controversial for instance tian et al 2021 claimed that the observed acute lethal rate in coho salmon species was caused by an oxidation product of the ubiquitously used tire antioxidant named n 1 3 dimethylbutyl n0 phenyl p phenyldiamine 6ppd 6ppd quinone conversely hiki et al 2021 reported that 6ppd quinone showed no acute fatal toxicity to any freshwater fish i e oryzias latipes and crustacean species at its highest water solubility it is noteworthy that 6ppd added to tires rapidly converts to 6ppd quinone upon oxidation seiwert et al 2022 identified 6ppd quinone up to 0 105 0 037 µg l in wastewater influent during snowmelt but there were no detections in the effluent or during dry weather 6ppd was also estimated at 4 4 and 2 4 µg l levels in wastewater influent and effluent respectively upon snowmelt conditions which was one order of magnitude higher than in dry weather the same authors suggested that retaining twps from runoff before discharge to surface water can significantly decrease the release of 6ppd and most of its transformation product unfortunately no data is available for the contribution of 6ppd or its transformation product 6ppd quinone to dbps formation under chlorination chloramination or ozonation however we believe that 6ppd quinone may be a potential precursor of n dbps because of the secondary amine moiety present in its structure see table 1 another leachable substance from twps that has recently gained attention is a vulcanization accelerator n n diphenylguanidine dpg which has been detected in aquatic media in a number of studies müller et al 2022 seiwert et al 2020 zahn et al 2019 the formation potential of dbps from dpg has been studied by sieira et al 2020 who demonstrated that dpg can rapidly react with chlorine and or bromine to form chloroform and to a minor extent dichloroacetonitrile dcan as a representative of thms and haloacetonitriles hans respectively the formation of dbps from dpg can be expected due to the presence of aliphatic amino groups in the dpg structure the formation of nitrosamines and their precursors in rubber manufacturing plants is well known watson et al 2012 and is related to the high amount of vulcanization agents usage beita sandí et al 2019 morran et al 2011 measured ndma formation from gate valves with rubber lined and rubber sealing rings made from natural rubber styrene butadiene rubber and ethylene propylene diene terpolymer at levels up to 930 ng l 68 ng cm2 teefy et al 2014 observed the formation of ndma both in the presence of chloramine i e reaction of elastomeric gaskets with chloramine and in the absence of chloramine i e direct leaching from elastomeric gaskets in a 14 day exposure to chlorinated water the formation of ndma and n nitrosopiperidine npip from rubber gaskets increased over time whereas that of n nitrosodibutylamine ndba decreased see table 2 teefy et al 2014 the reduction in ndba concentration with time might be because of its higher sorption on elastomer particles compared to ndma and npip selbes et al 2015 reported leaching of doc and dissolved nitrogen from scrap tires at levels up to 30 58 and 2 26 mg l respectively see table 2 the same authors reported higher doc and dissolved nitrogen leaching in basic ph conditions and higher leaching from smaller tire chips neutral conditions ph 6 8 were reported to minimize the leaching of organic constituents from scrap tires selbes et al 2015 the effect of ph on dbps formation depends on the type of dbps formed their precursors and disinfectants for example thm levels often increase at high ph whereas haa and han levels decrease possibly due to the hydrolysis of haas and hans at high ph ph 8 priya et al 2020 for n dbps jasemizad et al 2020 observed that the highest ndma formation from betrixaban occurred at ph 9 ph range of 5 9 while liu et al 2022 found that maximum ndma formation from disinfection of algae organic matter was around ph 6 8 for dithiocarbamates increasing the ph decreased their hydrolysis rate and dma release but it increased nitrosamine formation during ozonation while lower ph resulted in more nitrosamine formation during monochloramination through dichloramine formation padhye et al 2013 these results highlight that the ph effect on dbps formation relies significantly on the precursor s reaction mechanism with specific disinfectants considering the high pka values of most amine containing ndma precursors which lie within a range of 8 11 e g 10 7 for dma 10 0 for trimethylamine 10 0 for diethylamine 8 4 for ranitidine non protonated forms of these amine precursors dominate at basic ph it can explain higher ndma formation under basic ph for many of these precursors beita sandí et al 2019 schreiber and mitch 2006 shen and andrews 2013 wang et al 2019 in contrast beita sandí et al 2019 reported the highest ndma formation at acidic conditions for some precursors this could be due to the presence of other amines with pka in acidic ranges beita sandí et al 2019 or the domination of dichloramine at acidic ph shen and andrews 2013 contrary to chlorination solution ph substantially affects ndma formation under chloramination mainly due to oxidant speciation liu et al 2022 it is known that the nucleophilic attack of unprotonated secondary amines on dichloramine results in the corresponding nitrosamines and dichloramine dominates at acidic ph liu et al 2022 selbes et al 2018 nitrosamines and their precursors can be leached from junk tires in one study chemically disinfected leachates from crumb rubber and tire chips were analyzed for eight nitrosamines including ndma n nitrosomorpholine nmor npip ndba n nitrosodiethylamine ndea n nitrosodipropylamine ndpa n nitrosomethylethylamine nmea and n nitrosopyrrolidine npyr beita sandí et al 2019 the study revealed that more than 90 of nitrosamines formed was either ndma or nmor while other nitrosamines except npip constituted less than 5 of total nitrosamines see table 2 for more details beita sandí et al 2019 showed that ozonation of twp leachates alone did not result in the formation of nitrosamines whereas chloramination led to the formation of ndma nmor and npip up to 126 81 and 6 8 nmol g tire respectively see table 2 ndma formation during chloramination was 3 5 times higher than the amount formed under ozonation followed by chloramination other nitrosamines excluding nmor formed in higher quantities under chloramination alone this suggests that ozonation might lower the formation potential of nitrosamines from scrap tires possibly due to degradation or mineralization of nitrosamine precursors nitrosamines and their precursors might also be transformed or removed by hydroxyl radicals formed during ozonation however nmor formed during ozonation followed by chloramination was roughly twice the amount formed by chloramination alone beita sandí et al 2019 it may indicate a breakdown of some larger molecules to potent nmor precursors during ozonation to sum up twps are mainly made of rubber which is shown to be a potent ndma precursor hence twps can be considered a major precursor of ndma however more realistic studies are required to ascertain the contribution of tire waste to the formation of dbps in real water and wastewater matrices since twp concentrations in real world conditions are generally several orders of magnitude lower than the 50 000 mg l used in the study by beita sandí et al 2019 washing of elastomeric rubbers prior to use or pre washing of scrap tires before reuse might also be a good practice to reduce the amount of nitrosamines precursors i e dom leaching this will allow the early leaching of the most mobile organic constituents from the elastomer for instance less doc was released from the elastomers previously aged in water for 14 days prior to the leaching experiments see table 2 siemens and kaupenjohann 2003 finally periodic monitoring of ndma formation potential during the lifetime of elastomerc materials utilized in water distribution system is highly recommended as they might become a major source of n nitrosamines especially ndma 3 polyelectrolytes polyelectrolytes are high molecular weight synthetic organic polymers with covalently bonded charged groups when dissolved in polar solvents such as water as a result they show a high propensity to adsorb on the surfaces of particulates in aqueous solutions fielding 1999 jayasuriya 2017 stuart et al 2005 polyelectrolytes are used in water and wastewater treatment for coagulation flocculation filter backwashing and sludge dewatering for more than five decades bolto and gregory 2007 fielding 1999 in comparison to inorganic agents advantages of these organic polymers include a lower required dosage of coagulants less sludge production lower level of aluminum in treated water as well as a reduction in costs up to 25 30 bolto and gregory 2007 ding et al 2019 typical dosages of polyelectrolytes used as a primary coagulant in drinking water are 1 10 mg l and only 0 1 0 2 mg l used as coagulant aids bolto and gregory 2007 nsf ansi 2016 reported a typical use level of 1 10 and 25 mg l for polyacrylamide pam poly epichlorohydrin dimethylamine epi dma polyamine and poly diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride polydadmac respectively some countries such as the united kingdom and new zealand have suggested stricter limitations of the maximum dosage of active polymer to 0 5 5 and 10 mg l for pam epi dma and polydadmac respectively water 2016 polymer concentrations at different stages of water and wastewater treatment are typically unknown due to difficulties in their quantification it is estimated that around 95 of the polyelectrolytes are adsorbed removed with floc formation while small amounts 5 may remain dissolved in the water or wastewater and reach the disinfection units fielding 1999 sfynia et al 2020 although the polymer toxicity itself is negligible especially for anionic and non ionic polymers remaining monomers or other pollutants from the production process might be a matter of concern ding et al 2019 fielding 1999 ghernaout 2018 for instance acrylamide monomer is known to be a carcinogen for which the world health organization who has suggested an application limit of 0 5 µg l in drinking water treatment plant flocculation who 2011 because of amine groups on polyelectrolytes these polymers monomers can also contribute to the formation of hazardous n dbps under chlorination chloramination and ozonation below we discuss the formation of dbps from the most common polyelectrolytes in water and wastewater treatment plants table 3 provides a summary of available studies it highlights that polymer concentrations and disinfection conditions vary widely across studies which makes comparisons difficult 3 1 acrylamide acrylamides have a large molecular weight and can be ionic cationic or anionic or non ionic acrylamide polymers used in water and wastewater treatment include but are not limited to pam cationic pam cpam anionic pam apam and aminomethylated polyacrylamide mannich 3 1 1 c dbps formation potential the reaction between pam polymers and chlorine can form thms in the range of several µg thms mg pam in a deionized water matrix ding et al 2019 mallevialle et al 1984 identified chloroform concentrations from chlorination of pam up to 1 4 1 6 µg chcl3 mg pam 7 8 µg l in comparison acrylamide monomer was claimed to form chloroform up to 2500 µg chcl3 mg pam 250 µg l therefore modifying these polymer production processes to decrease the amount of their monomer is critical as a measure to substantially reduce the amount of dbps formation 3 1 2 n dbps formation potential among acrylamide polymers mannich has been shown to form the highest level of ndma during chlorination chloramination and ozonation sgroi et al 2014 and neither apam cpam nor pam could produce considerable amounts of ndma park piyachaturawat et al 2009 found that up to 114 µg ndma mg mannich was formed upon chloramination whereas only 0 88 µg ndma mg cpam was detected for cpam this is mainly because mannich can easily be degraded to formaldehyde and dma which are known ndma precursors song et al 2022 another study conducted by sgroi et al 2016 also reported the low formation of ndma in a range of 1 3 ng l from cationic and anionic pam under ozonation 5 5 mg o3 l utilizing pam in the water and wastewater treatment process did not considerably increase the formation of hans or thms upon post chlorination ding et al 2018 in contrast coagulation with alum salt 10 mg l as alum and pam 2 mg l increased haloacetamides levels from 2 5 5 5 µg l in coagulation with alum alone to 4 9 7 7 µg l despite the fact that haloacetamides formation from polyacrylamides and their monomers is much lower than thms their toxicity is several orders of magnitude higher therefore haloacetamides formation potential should be thoroughly evaluated before selecting pam in water treatment plants under conditions representative of real world water and wastewater treatment the acrylamide dosage is generally kept under control by restricting both the polyacrylamide dosage 1 mg l and the monomer content of the final product 0 05 weight ding et al 2019 fielding 1999 in addition only 5 of these polymers may remain in the water and might reach the disinfection units sfynia et al 2020 as a result the low residual amount of pam 0 05 mg l and its monomer 2 5 µg l reaching the disinfection unit cannot significantly enhance the formation of thms and n nitrosamines in water and wastewater treatment plants in contrast mannich polymers are able to promote the formation of ndma in wastewater substantially hence the application of mannich polymers in wwtps should be preceded by an analysis of ndma formation potential 3 2 polyamines and polydadmac polydadmac and polyamines such as epi dma are cationic polyelectrolytes with a low moderate molecular weight the most utilized polyelectrolytes in water and wastewater with their characteristics are shown in table 1 3 2 1 c dbps formation potential kaiser and lawrence 1977 detected chloroform formation from the reaction of commercial polydadmac in the range of not detected to 2 4 µg l although thm formation from epi dma under chlorination is more variable than formation from polydadmac see table 3 it is still not in the range of concerning levels most of the available studies on c dbps formation from polydadmac and epi dma were conducted several decades ago feige et al 1980 fielding 1999 kaiser and lawrence 1977 and polymers production quality has improved since then in addition concentrations of both polyelectrolytes and chlorine as disinfectants in real water or wastewater treatment plants are lower than those studied in laboratories as a result c dbps formation from either polydadmac or epi dma is probably negligible in comparison to other dbp precursors present in water and wastewater this is also in agreement with a study that reviewed thm formation from polyelectrolytes under chlorination bolto 2005 3 2 2 n dbps formation potential in contrast with c dbps ndma detection in water treatment plants using polydadmac and chlorination can be a cause for concern ding et al 2019 ndma formation from polydadmac and epi dma has been extensively investigated under different disinfection processes see table 3 child et al 1996 identified ndma upon chlorination of highly concentrated polydadmac within a range of 10 up to 310 ng l the reaction between hypochlorite and polymer was almost instantaneous and ndma concentrations did not increase after the first hour of the reaction furthermore padhye et al 2011 observed ndma formation potential from common polyelectrolytes following the order of polydadmac cpam polyamines upon ozonation high ndma formation from polydadmac was related to the oxidation of polymer and further dma release to the matrix among common disinfectants chloramine leads to the highest levels of ndma formation in water and wastewater treatment sgroi et al 2018 ndma was detected in water treatment plants that used polydadmac and practised chloramination in the range of 7 46 ng l polydadmac can form ndma up to 15 000 ng l under chloramination at laboratory conditions which is several orders of magnitude greater than other types of coagulant polymers such as apam and different copolymers of pam liew et al 2015 this can be related to quaternary amines with dma functional groups on polydadmac the ndma formation has been proposed to occur from both the dma moiety mitch and sedlak 2004 and the quaternary ammonium group kemper et al 2010 during chloramination ph is reported to have the most impact on ndma formation from polydadmac and the maximum ndma formed at ph around 7 tan et al 2018 the degradation of polydadmac results in dma release which can further form ndma in reaction with dichloramine available at neutral ph tan et al 2018 the maximum ndma yield occurs at an optimum ph i e usually ph 7 8 where deprotonated amine precursors and dichloramine might be present simultaneously due to a shortage of deprotonated amine precursors at acidic conditions the ndma formation might be constrained although the initial ndma formation might be promoted at basic conditions the final formed ndma could be limited because of the dichloramine shortage selbes et al 2018 shen and andrews 2013 park et al 2015 observed that one of the efficient strategies to curb ndma formation from polyamine and polydadmac during in situ chloramination is to increase chlorination time before adding ammonium chloride to the solution it suppresses dichloramine thus effectively curbing ndma formation for treatment plants using coagulant polymers adding free chlorine to water sources already containing ammonia should be avoided also pre oxidation of polyelectrolytes with oxidants can reduce their ndma formation potential prior to monochloramination except for pre ozonation of polydadmac which increases ndma formation through releasing dma from the structural breakdown of polydadmac park et al 2015 the above results highlight the complexity of reactions involving polyelectrolytes during exposure to oxidants zeng et al 2016 quantified ndma from epi dma at uniform formation conditions ufc up to 244 ng l polyamines formed ndma mainly due to the tertiary amines present on one end of the polymer chain krasner et al 2013 the ndma formation potential from the most common polyelectrolytes in water treatment has been reported to follow the order of mannich epi dma polydadmac cpam regardless of the utilized oxidant park piyachaturawat et al 2009 it can be concluded that exploiting mannich epi dma and polydadmac in water and wastewater treatment can elevate ndma formation upon chloramination to a concerning level hence several studies have been conducted on modifying polymer production processes to decrease the amount of n nitrosamine formation upon disinfection an et al 2019 atkinson et al 2020 zeng et al 2014 2016 treating polyelectrolytes with methyl iodide as an alkylating agent to transform tertiary amine groups of polymers to less reactive quaternary ammonium forms has been demonstrated to reduce ndma formation from polydadmac and epi dma by 74 78 zeng et al 2016 synthesis of polyelectrolytes with dipropylamino substituents also yielded less reactive quaternary ammonium groups reducing ndma formation a study conducted by zeng et al 2014 recommended the replacement of quaternary nitrogen in polydadmac with a phosphorus atom to prevent the formation of n dbps upon chloramination atkinson et al 2020 claimed 54 63 less ndma formation from polydadmac which was purified to eliminate a low molecular weight fraction 10 kda this is mainly because low molecular weight fractions of polydadmac include dadmac monomer and dma which already have been proved to be ndma precursors in aqueous media an et al 2019 park wei et al 2009 although ndma yield from dadmac monomer has been measured only up to 9 4 0 7 ng ndma mg dadmac under ufc tests 90 times lower than dma quaternary ammonium might form more ndma because of the large number of dadmac monomer present in polydadmac polymer zeng et al 2016 to sum up adjusting the manufacturing process of polyamines and polydadmac can lower the required coagulant dosage and subsequent dbps formation it is also important to evaluate the optimum dosage of polyelectrolytes considering a trade off between nmda formation and their efficiency such as turbidity or doc removal in the coagulation process 4 microplastics mps plastic waste has risen steeply in both terrestrial and aqueous ecosystems over the last several decades as a result of the widespread use of plastics in many different industries long lasting features as well as poor waste management lenka et al 2021 nava and leoni 2021 iso tr 21960 2020 e 2020 defined mps as insoluble in water polymeric compounds with any dimension from 1 µm to 1000 µm 1 mm the same report defined large microplastic as plastic particles between 1 and 5 mm as cited in schymanski et al 2021 however most of the current literature acknowledges the range of 1 µm to 5 mm for mps menéndez pedriza and jaumot 2020 wang et al 2020 mps can be classified as either primary or secondary based on to their source primary mps are deliberately manufactured plastics in a microscopic size for industrial or domestic use primary mps usually end up in water bodies either freshwater or marine settings through various pathways including wind transportation wwtps discharge industrial domestic drainage and road runoff see fig 1 lambert and wagner 2018 mei et al 2020 menéndez pedriza and jaumot 2020 during the transportation of these primary plastics to the ocean most of them are exposed to weathering processes and are disintegrated into small particles through uv radiation thermal or mechanical stress and these are termed secondary mps in case they are smaller than 5 mm chen awasthi et al 2021 4 1 occurrence mps concentrations in wwtps influent and effluent have been reported in the range of 61 5 600 µg l and 0 5 170 µg l respectively indicating a removal efficiency of 93 8 99 8 based on mass concentration of mps cheng et al 2021 the majority of available studies measured mps concentration based on numbers per liter of the matrix lenka et al 2021 mps have been detected in wwtps influent and effluent within a range of 1 01 31 400 particles l and 0 004 447 particles l respectively indicating a variation of mps removal from 10 2 to 99 9 cheng et al 2021 similarly lv et al 2019 reported mps removal up to 82 1 in a membrane bioreactor system and 53 6 using an oxidation ditch system representing 99 5 and 97 0 removal on the mass basis tertiary treatments can provide further removal of mps in wwtps and their removal efficiencies are directly related to the applied unit processes the removal efficiency of tertiary treatments has been reported to range from 72 7 to 96 3 based on particle number cheng et al 2021 treated water and wastewater are usually disinfected using chlorination chloramination ozonation or uv radiation prior to being reused or released enfrin et al 2019 data is currently limited on the fate of mps during disinfection passing of mps in the disinfection unit may culminate in the degradation or fragmentation of the plastics into small pieces or particles at a rate of 9 3 to 6 8 cheng et al 2021 wang lin et al 2020 research conducted by wang lin et al 2020 indicated that the numbers of mps within a range of 1 5 µm was increased by 2 8 16 0 after ozonation representing a negative removal of mps in the disinfection unit although the overall mass based removal of mps in wwtps can be considered efficient wwtps still leave a high level of smaller mps in the effluent it has been estimated that the effluent of a single wwtp can release up to ten billion mp particles per day enfrin et al 2019 and that wwtps globally release approximately eight trillion mp particles into the aquatic ecosystems per day rochman et al 2015 nanoplastics also contribute to the plastic particle load but they are difficult to detect and hence they typically remain out of estimation there is now a scientific consensus that wwtps are one of the main sources of mps in water bodies the most abundant plastics found in aquatic ecosystems with their characteristics are shown in table 1 mps have also been detected in the influent and effluent of drinking water treatment plants within a range of 1 6 614 particles l and 1 930 particles l respectively indicating a removal efficiency of 66 9 to 100 regardless of treatment method cheng et al 2021 it is worth mentioning that although data is limited on twps and elastomers occurrence in water or wastewater treatment plants most of the available studies measured twps and elastomers such as styrene butadiene rubber as mps this is because most studies on mps still rely on visual detection which makes it challenging to differentiate between solid particles within a range of mps sizes 4 2 additives chemical substances are frequently added to polymeric compounds to alter their processability performance application and durability in order to make them suitable for commercial use ambrogi et al 2017 bolívar subirats et al 2021 these industrial additives can be plasticizers antioxidants fire retardants uv stabilizers antiozonants colorants coupling agents or other chemical substances bolívar subirats et al 2021 chen shi et al 2021 additives are typically added at levels ranging between 1 and 35 of the final product bolívar subirats et al 2021 additives are also able to migrate from polymers to surrounding environments as they are not chemically bonded with parent polymers chen shi et al 2021 one aspect that has recently received attraction is the leaching of doc from mps and its potential as a precursor of dbps lee et al 2020 romera castillo et al 2018 the leaching of dom accelerates when polymers lose their protective additives during natural aging processes lee et al 2020 nanoplastics can also contribute to the measured doc li et al 2020 as they can pass through membrane filters generally utilized to measure doc i e 0 45 µm filter 4 3 leaching of dissolved organic carbon although much work has been done on additive leaching from mps and their adverse effects on the environment ding et al 2022 hahladakis et al 2018 relatively little is known about dom leaching from plastic polymers table 4 dom can be a precursor of various dbps upon chlorination and chloramination and hence it is important to understand its leaching potential from mps romera castillo et al 2018 estimated that 23 600 tonnes of doc leach from plastics present in the marine environment across the world annually leached dom from plastic particles usually contains various additives in addition to the monomers and oligomers that make up the main polymer chains of the original plastic lee and hur 2020 exposure to uv sunlight can substantially increase the amount of doc leaching from plastic particles zhu et al 2020 including propylene pe pvc expanded polystyrene eps lee et al 2020 2021b and pe shopping bags walsh et al 2021 for instance exposure to uv radiation was shown to increase the leaching of doc by up to 100 times more than that under dark conditions lee et al 2020 several kinetic studies suggested that doc leaching decreases exponentially over time for instance leached doc concentrations from ldpe dropped by 45 within a 200 h time frame until they reached constant leaching of 5 5 µg cm2 romera castillo et al 2018 the drop in doc leaching was attributed to the sorption of doc to plastic particles dissipation of volatile leaching and or mineralization of non volatile doc romera castillo et al 2018 in contrast zhu et al 2020 observed an exponential increase in doc leaching from postconsumer plastics such as eps polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp over 70 days in view of these contradictory conclusions further studies should be conducted to elucidate the mechanism of dom leaching from mps and their kinetics the quantity of doc leaching is strongly dependent on the type of plastic but again contradictory results have been published on the topic for instance lee et al 2020 observed that doc leaching from pe particles were about fourfold that from pp polymers in contrast zhu et al 2020 observed more doc leaching from pp than from pe in general doc leaching from different plastic polymers follows the order of polyamide pa pvc polymethyl methacrylate pmma or acrylic pe ps pet and polylactic acid ateia et al 2020 lee et al 2021b infrared spectra suggest that the molecular structures of dom leached from pe and pp are similar lee et al 2020 dom leaching from mps e g ps pet pp pvc and eps exposed to uv radiation contained more oxygen containing functional groups e g carboxylic and phenolic groups compared to those kept in the dark gewert et al 2018 lee et al 2021b this was attributed to the probable chemical alterations provoked by uv radiations lee and hur 2020 dom leached from mps also show noticeable reactivities akin to those of nom in terms of their propensity to be dbp precursors ateia et al 2020 lee et al 2020 4 4 c dbps formation potential insoluble plastic polymers can release dom and fragmented nanoparticles into the water and wastewater which are potential precursors for dbps upon chlorination chloramination or ozonation although much research has been done on nom and its role in the formation of c dbps wang et al 2017 and n dbps lin et al 2014 mitch and sedlak 2004 little is known about the role of plastic polymers in the formation of dbps table 5 summarizes available studies on the topic disinfection conditions mps concentrations and leaching settings vary widely across the limited number of studies available which makes comparisons difficult exposure to uv irradiation is expected to increase the formation of thms during the chlorination of different mps including pe pp pa pmma pet and ps from 22 110 µg thms l to 85 15 990 µg thms l see table 5 ateia et al 2020 hong et al 2021 lee et al 2020 the release of dbps precursors from plastic particles in dark conditions could be related to hydrolysis for instance enfrin et al 2019 reported the vulnerability of plastic polymers such as pet and polyurethane to hydrolytic cleavage of their bonds therefore it is not surprising to see thms mainly chloroform yield up to 110 µg l for polystyrene as a result of doc leaching in dark conditions ateia et al 2020 chloroform formation also increased linearly with the amount of leached doc from pe and pp lee et al 2020 the age of mps can also contribute to the amount of dbp precursors leaching from mps in water and wastewater for instance ateia et al 2020 studied four consecutive leaching of c dbps precursors from mps brominated precursors of thms were mostly released during the first leaching cycle because they were weakly bonded to mps in contrast doc leaching and other thms generation both increased in the second cycle this observation could be explained by the leaching of hydrolysis stabilizers e g carbodiimides in the first leaching cycle resulting in more susceptibility of mps to hydrolysis in the following cycles ateia et al 2020 all the studies mentioned above suggest the formation of thms from mps but it is important to note that they were all conducted at unrealistic doses of mps i e 1 20 g l which is several orders of magnitude higher than concentrations currently found in real wastewater hence the formation of thms from mps would be less of a concern in real world however it should be reassessed in the future as plastic production increases globally 4 5 n dbps formation potential ateia et al 2020 studied the leaching of hans precursors from different plastic particles including pe pp pa pmma pet and ps in both dark and uv irradiated conditions these plastic particles were able to form hans mainly dcan in the range of 2 5 5 8 µg hans l in ultrapure water in dark conditions see table 5 exposure to uva 340 radiation did not significantly promote the formation of hans it is worth mentioning that hans showed the highest cytotoxicity potential across many classes of dbps studied muellner et al 2007 despite the fact that they are not yet regulated allen et al 2022 concentrations of hans in finished water have been reported in the range of several ng l to a few µg l ding et al 2019 li et al 2021 more research needs to be conducted to assess the role of mps in the formation of n dbps in water and wastewater n dbps are present at substantially lower concentrations than c dbps but they are more toxic and carcinogenic despite being one of the most studied n dbps ndma formation from mps has not been investigated to date this could be due to the absence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone of most common plastics however polyurethane and pa contain nitrogen in their structure and hence may be potential precursors of ndma and or other n nitrosamines see table 1 for pa structure 5 role of miscellaneous parameters on dbps formation 5 1 co existing organic matter the presence of humic substances in water increases the formation potential of both c dbps priya et al 2020 and n dbps jasemizad et al 2021 for instance moreno andrés and peperzak 2019 observed the highest thms and haas concentration upon chlorination of ballast water which contained an augmentation mixture of carbon source with humic substances dom leaching from pe and pp is composed of mostly 61 87 low molecular weight fractions 350 da and only 1 2 of humic substances 1 000 da lee et al 2020 in contrast nom from natural water sources is mainly composed of humic substances krzeminski et al 2019 lee et al 2020 reported much higher thms mainly chloroform formation potential from the humic substances and heavier fractions 1 000 da of leached dom from pp and pe than their low molecular weight fractions the doc normalized thm formation potential of the dom leached from mps was reported to be comparable with thm formation potential of nom in natural waters under similar chlorination conditions i e 5 mg cl mg c 3 days and room temperature lee et al 2020 the aquatic nom in haihe river china and lake reservoir demonstrated doc normalized thm formation potential of 13 71 3 hao et al 2017 and 80 400 µg thms mg c brooks et al 2015 respectively lee et al 2020 comparably the dom leached from pe and pp under uv radiation exhibited similar doc normalized thm formation potential of 40 3 440 and 29 2 453 3 µg thms mg c respectively lee et al 2020 therefore dom leaching from mps can enhance the dbp formation in real water and wastewater treatment plants under disinfection conditions however more research is needed to ascertain the extent of this contribution we note that the levels of pbms in real world conditions are generally lower than those studied in the literature mentioned above 5 2 role of halogens among different operational and environmental parameters affecting dbps formation water salinity is shown to correlate significantly p 0 01 with all dbps including thms and haas moreno andrés and peperzak 2019 more specifically halide levels mostly bromide and iodide concentrations correlate better with both the formation and speciation of halogenated dbps than salinity priya et al 2020 shah et al 2015 these halides can be oxidized to hypobromous acid hobr and hypoiodous acid hoi through the reaction with oxidants such as chlorine which can then react with other organic moieties as secondary oxidants to form brominated and iodinated dbps jasemizad et al 2021 shah et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 salinity levels vary substantially among the water sources for example in freshwater the chloride bromide and iodide mean median concentrations are reported to be 10 0 07 0 1 and 0 0005 0 01 mg l respectively jasemizad et al 2021 shah et al 2015 on the other hand the mean median chloride bromide and iodide levels in marine water are reported to be 19 000 50 80 and 0 02 0 06 mg l respectively kim et al 2015 shah et al 2015 so water treatment plants using groundwater sources may experience high halide levels if seawater intrusion is an issue around coastal areas such high concentrations of halide can facilitate the formation of brominated and iodinated dbps which are believed to be more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated counterparts kim et al 2015 richardson et al 2008 brominated dbps such as brominated thms and haas have been reviewed previously jasemizad et al 2021 sharma et al 2014 ateia et al 2020 observed a major shift towards the increased formation of brominated thms such as dichlorobromomethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform and brominated hans such as bromochloroacetonitrile and dibromoacetonitrile during the chlorination of different mps including pe pp pa pmma pet and ps in the presence of bromide ions in contrast chloroform and dcan dominated dbps in the absence of bromide the same authors measured total organic halogens 2 4 times higher than the known dbps i e thms and hans which indicated the formation of other halogenated dbps beyond the formation of thms and hans mps themselves can release bromide due to the presence of additives such as brominated flame retardants e g polybrominated diphenyl ethers and dibromophenols pivnenko et al 2017 additionally bromide ions can be oxidized to active bromine species upon chloramination gu et al 2020 compared to free chlorine bromide s reaction with monochloramine occurs much slower jasemizad et al 2021 these bromine species can further react with nom or dom to form brominated dbps beita sandí et al 2020 gu et al 2020 the increase of bromide concentrations 0 1 000 µg l in distilled and deionized water were shown to promote the ndma formation from model precursor compounds i e polydadmac polyamine mono di and trimethylamine and ranitidine upon chloramination beita sandí et al 2020 in contrast increased bromide reduced ndma formation in wastewater effluent samples which can be related to the reaction of bromochloramine with nom in lieu of ndma precursors the effect of bromide on dbps formation from model precursors is now relatively well understood in contrast the role of halides in dbp formation from pbms remains poorly studied more realistic studies are required to study the contribution of halide to the formation of dbps in real water and wastewater matrices in the presence of environmentally relevant pbm concentrations since halide concentrations in real world conditions are generally lower than those used in most laboratory studies 6 conclusions and recommendations disinfection of water and wastewater is vital to inactivate pathogens but it may result in the formation of various dbps the present article reviewed the role of pbms as a source of organic precursors to generate dbps upon chemical disinfection of water and wastewater literature shows that tire waste and mps can release high amounts of dom up to 656 8 and 42 100 mg dom kg pbms i e 42 1 and 32 84 mg l respectively under extreme laboratory conditions the dom leaching from pbms is comparable to nom which is the main precursor of dbps in water and wastewater treatment the dom released from elastomers tire waste polyelectrolytes and mps was also shown to have a high propensity to form various c dbps and n dbps upon chlorination chloramination and ozonation considering the small size of insoluble pbms and their buoyancy a large amount of these pbms is likely to remain in the wwtps effluent as a result they pose a high risk for dbps formation upon disinfection in water and wastewater this literature review on the role of pbms in dbps formation highlighted major research gaps and directions for future research which are summarized below the potential contribution of some pbms their additives and transformation products to the formation of dbps has not been studied to date besides there are numerous other chemicals that are released from tire waste and their potential role in dbp formation is unclear specific cases that require more attention include the potential formation of ndma from mps e g polyamide and polyurethane and the role of 6ppd and its transformation product 6ppd quinone as potential precursors of dbps most studies conducted to date considered conditions that are not representative of real treatment conditions more realistic studies including lower concentrations of pbms and disinfectants and better representations of real water and wastewater matrices are needed the exact mechanisms behind the formation of dbps from pbms are often unknown more fundamental studies on the role and contributions of different fractions of the dom leaching from pbms would be beneficial the relative contribution of different types of pbms to the formation of dbps in real world conditions is unknown more critical evaluations are needed on the combined effects of various organic nom humic and fulvic constituents and dom leaching from pbms and inorganic ions e g halogens including bromide and iodide this will allow an assessment of the relative contribution of pbms to the formation of dbps guidelines for sampling or measurement of the pbms in aqueous media are currently lacking considering the high probability of background contamination i e airborne pbms fibers from clothing and sampling equipment specific methods and protocols for collecting samples in different matrices and accurate analyses of pbms is needed as a precautionary approach the occurrence of pbms in disinfection units should be minimised it is desirable not only because of potential risk of dbps formation but also due to their potential direct and indirect toxicity the pbms covered in this review were chemically similar but they have a diverse range of sources hence a range of mitigation measures specific to various sources are likely to be needed to effectively minimize their release in the environment and control the formation of dbps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

15130,disinfection by products dbps are formed through the disinfection of water containing precursors such as natural organic matter or anthropogenic compounds e g pharmaceuticals and pesticides due to the ever increasing use of plastics elastomers and other polymers in our daily lives polymer based materials pbms are detected more frequently and at higher concentrations in water and wastewater the present review provides a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the contribution of pbms including elastomers tire waste polyelectrolytes and microplastics as precursors of dbps in water and wastewater literature shows that the presence of pbms can lead to the leaching of dissolved organic matter dom and subsequent formation of dbps upon disinfection in aqueous media the quantity and type of dbps formed strongly depends on the type of polymer its concentration its age water salinity and disinfection conditions such as oxidant dosage ph temperature and contact time dom leaching from elastomers and tire waste was shown to form n nitrosodimethylamine up to concerning levels of 930 ng l and 466 715 ng l respectively upon chemical disinfection under laboratory conditions polyelectrolytes can also react with chemical disinfectants to form toxic dbps recent findings indicate trihalomethanes formation potential of plastics can be as high as 15 990 µg l based on the maximum formation potential under extreme conditions our analysis highlights an overlooked contribution of dom leaching from pbms as dbp precursors during disinfection of water and wastewater further studies need to be conducted to ascertain the extent of this contribution in real water and wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection by products microplastics polymers polyelectrolytes tire wear particles data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the number of anthropogenic chemicals entering our environment is ever increasing one such widely used chemical class is polymer based materials pbms synthetic polymers are made by polymerizing monomers extracted from the oil gas petroleum industry shams 2019 and can be categorized into thermoplastics thermosets and elastomers according to their response to applied heat ganesan et al 2013 synthetic polymers particularly plastics have become an intrinsic part of our daily lives due to their numerous applications associated with desirable properties such as durability lightweight flexibility chemical inertness and mass production ability lambert and wagner 2018 menéndez pedriza and jaumot 2020 nava and leoni 2021 these features coupled with the high demand for single use plastics have resulted in a massive worldwide plastic production reaching 360 million tonnes in 2018 chen awasthi et al 2021 the majority of existing wastewater treatment plants wwtps cannot completely remove pbms due to the small size and buoyancy of some of the pbms e g microplastic fibers from synthetic textiles mccormick et al 2014 wagner et al 2018 although some wwtps can remove pbms efficiently up to 99 removal depending on treatment processes the great amount of pbms entering the system means a considerable amount escapes the treatment process therefore pbms can enter the disinfection units and eventually be released into the environment through the wwtps effluent discharge shams 2019 for instance lebreton et al 2017 estimated a release of 1 15 2 41 million tonnes of plastic particles typically within a range of 0 3 50 000 mm from rivers wwtps and tributaries into the oceans annually and eriksen et al 2014 estimated that more than five trillion plastic fragments mostly within a range of 0 33 4 75 mm 250 000 tonnes are currently floating in oceans globally furthermore different additives e g fire retardants plasticizers antioxidants and colorants that are added to polymers to improve their processability performance application and durability ambrogi et al 2017 bolívar subirats et al 2021 can simultaneously be released into the aqueous media chen shi et al 2021 and pollute the marine environment the adverse effects of pbms and their additives on flora and fauna have been studied extensively auta et al 2017 li et al 2018 luo et al 2021 unintended reactions between different chemical disinfectants such as free chlorine chloramine ozone and chlorine dioxide and various dissolved constituents in the water matrix such as dissolved organic matter dom can generate harmful disinfection by products dbps ding et al 2019 fang et al 2021 dbps carry a risk of cytotoxicity genotoxicity teratogenicity mutagenicity carcinogenicity diarrhea and other waterborne disorders jasemizad et al 2020 pandian et al 2022 xiao et al 2022 commonly regulated dbps include trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas usepa 2006 to date over 700 dbps have been identified among which about 100 have been thoroughly studied for their formation occurrence and the risk of cytotoxicity genotoxicity carcinogenicity and endocrinological disruption plewa et al 2002 richardson and plewa 2020 a number of factors have led to an increased interest in studying nitrogenous dbps n dbps over conventional carbonaceous dbps c dbps during the past two decades utilities rely on source waters that are affected by municipal wastewater effluents or algal blooms and thus contain higher amounts of organic nitrogen that plays a key role in the formation of n dbps shah and mitch 2012 in addition many drinking water facilities have switched from chlorination to chloramination to minimize the formation of regulated c dbps jasemizad et al 2021 as a result of this change chloramines yield less regulated dbps at the expense of an increased risk of n dbps formation due to the nitrogen present in chloramines jasemizad et al 2021 richardson and plewa 2020 despite being significantly lower in concentrations than c dbps n dbps are more toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic than c dbps jasemizad et al 2021 shah and mitch 2012 the most studied n dbps include halonitroalkanes haloacetamides such as dichloroacetamide dcacam halonitriles and n nitrosamines such as n nitrosodimethylamine ndma shah and mitch 2012 ndma is considered a probable carcinogen and concentrations as low as seven ng l are associated with a 10 5 cancer risk level usepa 2002 2014 a lot of pbms contain nitrogen as one of their constituents either in the polymer structure e g polyelectrolytes polyamide and polyurethane or as additives therefore there is a high potential for the formation of n dbps upon chemical disinfection processes it is important for researchers to investigate the formation potential of n dbps from pbms due to the high number of polymers used in practice that contains nitrogen on the one hand previous research on dbp precursors in water and wastewater has mostly focused on natural organic matter nom and known anthropogenic pollutants hanigan et al 2015 ike et al 2019 shen and andrews 2011 yang et al 2015 nom which is the main precursor of dbps can be found ubiquitously in water resources in colloidal dissolved or particulate forms jasemizad et al 2021 kitis et al 2001 a major fraction of nom in water sources is dom containing both dissolved and colloidal forms i e component that passes a 0 45 µm filter kitis et al 2001 dom which serves as a major precursor of dbps is composed of a heterogeneous mixture of humic and non humic substances i e hydrophilic acids proteins amino acids and hydrocarbons kitis et al 2001 priya et al 2020 as nom or dom cannot be measured directly researchers mostly have quantified these parameters through the measurement of dissolved organic carbon doc kitis et al 2001 on the other hand a recent trend is towards assessing other dbp precursors including present constituents in raw water treatment agents e g polyelectrolytes and dissolved compounds leaching from pbms ateia et al 2020 atkinson et al 2020 beita sandí et al 2019 ding et al 2018 2019 lee et al 2020 zeng et al 2016 the purpose of the present article is to provide a critical review of the current understanding of the role of pbms as potential precursors of dbps in water and wastewater under chemical disinfection in the following sections we discuss elastomeric materials used in the water distribution system tire wear particles twps polyelectrolytes and microplastics mps as these are the most studied polymers reported to form various dbps see table 1 2 elastomers and tire waste pbms especially elastomers have been used in tap water distribution systems for more than five decades samarth and mahanwar 2021 based on iso tr 21960 2020 e 2020 elastomers are macromolecules that are able to return to their original shape and dimension quickly after significant deformation by a weak pressure and subsequent stress release they have been used in a wide range of applications including rubber gaskets valves fittings and hydrants these elastomeric materials are used with different piping materials such as polyvinyl chloride pvc steel copper and ductile cast iron samarth and mahanwar 2021 elastomers mostly rubbers are also the main component of the tire of vehicles a tire can contain up to 200 different additives müller et al 2022 on average a tire contains natural rubber elastomer polyisoprene synthetic rubber such as styrene butadiene rubber 40 60 mass reinforcing agents or fillers such as carbon black silica and chalk 20 35 metals and softeners including oil and resin 15 various additives including plasticizers antioxidants preservatives and desiccants 5 10 textile 5 vulcanization agents such as zinc oxide and sulfur 1 5 baensch baltruschat et al 2020 torretta et al 2015 wagner et al 2018 wik and dave 2009 each of these compounds serves a different purpose and contributes to more durable commercial tires müller et al 2022 found 214 potential organic compounds related to tire waste out of which 145 were known as leachable friction between vehicles tires and road surfaces causes wear and tear of tires and yields tire wear particles twps zhang et al 2021 twps generation ranges from 0 006 to 1 7 g km per tire wagner et al 2018 wik and dave 2009 2 1 occurrence more than 90 of twps are non airborne and settle on road surfaces or roadside reach nearby soil and also be transported to wastewater treatment plants or fresh water bodies through surface runoff luo et al 2021 wagner et al 2018 wik and dave 2009 there is limited quantitative data on twps accumulation and distribution because of the lack of analytical methods to measure twp directly twp markers one of the tire constituents present at known concentrations are analyzed to estimate twps concentrations wagner et al 2018 twp concentrations in road runoff are suggested to be in the range of 0 3 and 197 mg l due to the highest concentrations of benzothiazole and its derivates beita sandí et al 2019 wik and dave 2009 while twp concentrations on the road surface near road side and in river sediments were reported to be much higher in the range of 1 000 70 000 70 80 000 and 400 1 100 mg kg respectively wagner et al 2018 there is a paucity of data on the fate of elastomeric materials especially twps in wwtps and their removal efficiencies however a rough estimation can be made using microplastic removal in wwtps baensch baltruschat et al 2020 wagner et al 2018 because twps also have semi synthetic polymer backbone they are insoluble in water and their particle size is within mps size range baensch baltruschat et al 2020 wwtps are considered to be effective in removing mps 90 removal who 2019 the finer the twps are the lower is their removal efficiency furthermore who 2019 estimates around 67 of the populace in upper middle lower middle and low income countries do not have access to centralized wastewater treatment which means no removal of twps therefore surface water and the marine environment in most places are polluted with twps and their leaching constituents which can further contribute to the formation of dbps during the disinfection of drinking water treatment plants 2 2 leaching and dbps formation potential the degradation of elastomers exposed to disinfectants in the water distribution system has been reviewed previously samarth and mahanwar 2021 schoenbaechler 2007 and it is well accepted that disinfection reactions can lower the lifespan of elastomeric polymers exposed to disinfected water however little is known about elastomer s role as a precursor of dbps the experiment by siemens and kaupenjohann 2003 revealed leaching of doc from elastomeric polymers especially sealings the measured doc leaching from silicone rubber and neoprene polychloroprene was up to 4 6 and 63 mg doc l respectively 0 3 and 4 2 mg doc l cm2 day the leachability of different constituents from tires and the subsequent potential risks to aqueous media have been studied for many years day et al 1993 evans 1997 müller et al 2022 nelson et al 1994 however there are a lot of probable leachable constituents from scrap tires reported in recent years whose toxicity and dbp formation potential is unknown or still controversial for instance tian et al 2021 claimed that the observed acute lethal rate in coho salmon species was caused by an oxidation product of the ubiquitously used tire antioxidant named n 1 3 dimethylbutyl n0 phenyl p phenyldiamine 6ppd 6ppd quinone conversely hiki et al 2021 reported that 6ppd quinone showed no acute fatal toxicity to any freshwater fish i e oryzias latipes and crustacean species at its highest water solubility it is noteworthy that 6ppd added to tires rapidly converts to 6ppd quinone upon oxidation seiwert et al 2022 identified 6ppd quinone up to 0 105 0 037 µg l in wastewater influent during snowmelt but there were no detections in the effluent or during dry weather 6ppd was also estimated at 4 4 and 2 4 µg l levels in wastewater influent and effluent respectively upon snowmelt conditions which was one order of magnitude higher than in dry weather the same authors suggested that retaining twps from runoff before discharge to surface water can significantly decrease the release of 6ppd and most of its transformation product unfortunately no data is available for the contribution of 6ppd or its transformation product 6ppd quinone to dbps formation under chlorination chloramination or ozonation however we believe that 6ppd quinone may be a potential precursor of n dbps because of the secondary amine moiety present in its structure see table 1 another leachable substance from twps that has recently gained attention is a vulcanization accelerator n n diphenylguanidine dpg which has been detected in aquatic media in a number of studies müller et al 2022 seiwert et al 2020 zahn et al 2019 the formation potential of dbps from dpg has been studied by sieira et al 2020 who demonstrated that dpg can rapidly react with chlorine and or bromine to form chloroform and to a minor extent dichloroacetonitrile dcan as a representative of thms and haloacetonitriles hans respectively the formation of dbps from dpg can be expected due to the presence of aliphatic amino groups in the dpg structure the formation of nitrosamines and their precursors in rubber manufacturing plants is well known watson et al 2012 and is related to the high amount of vulcanization agents usage beita sandí et al 2019 morran et al 2011 measured ndma formation from gate valves with rubber lined and rubber sealing rings made from natural rubber styrene butadiene rubber and ethylene propylene diene terpolymer at levels up to 930 ng l 68 ng cm2 teefy et al 2014 observed the formation of ndma both in the presence of chloramine i e reaction of elastomeric gaskets with chloramine and in the absence of chloramine i e direct leaching from elastomeric gaskets in a 14 day exposure to chlorinated water the formation of ndma and n nitrosopiperidine npip from rubber gaskets increased over time whereas that of n nitrosodibutylamine ndba decreased see table 2 teefy et al 2014 the reduction in ndba concentration with time might be because of its higher sorption on elastomer particles compared to ndma and npip selbes et al 2015 reported leaching of doc and dissolved nitrogen from scrap tires at levels up to 30 58 and 2 26 mg l respectively see table 2 the same authors reported higher doc and dissolved nitrogen leaching in basic ph conditions and higher leaching from smaller tire chips neutral conditions ph 6 8 were reported to minimize the leaching of organic constituents from scrap tires selbes et al 2015 the effect of ph on dbps formation depends on the type of dbps formed their precursors and disinfectants for example thm levels often increase at high ph whereas haa and han levels decrease possibly due to the hydrolysis of haas and hans at high ph ph 8 priya et al 2020 for n dbps jasemizad et al 2020 observed that the highest ndma formation from betrixaban occurred at ph 9 ph range of 5 9 while liu et al 2022 found that maximum ndma formation from disinfection of algae organic matter was around ph 6 8 for dithiocarbamates increasing the ph decreased their hydrolysis rate and dma release but it increased nitrosamine formation during ozonation while lower ph resulted in more nitrosamine formation during monochloramination through dichloramine formation padhye et al 2013 these results highlight that the ph effect on dbps formation relies significantly on the precursor s reaction mechanism with specific disinfectants considering the high pka values of most amine containing ndma precursors which lie within a range of 8 11 e g 10 7 for dma 10 0 for trimethylamine 10 0 for diethylamine 8 4 for ranitidine non protonated forms of these amine precursors dominate at basic ph it can explain higher ndma formation under basic ph for many of these precursors beita sandí et al 2019 schreiber and mitch 2006 shen and andrews 2013 wang et al 2019 in contrast beita sandí et al 2019 reported the highest ndma formation at acidic conditions for some precursors this could be due to the presence of other amines with pka in acidic ranges beita sandí et al 2019 or the domination of dichloramine at acidic ph shen and andrews 2013 contrary to chlorination solution ph substantially affects ndma formation under chloramination mainly due to oxidant speciation liu et al 2022 it is known that the nucleophilic attack of unprotonated secondary amines on dichloramine results in the corresponding nitrosamines and dichloramine dominates at acidic ph liu et al 2022 selbes et al 2018 nitrosamines and their precursors can be leached from junk tires in one study chemically disinfected leachates from crumb rubber and tire chips were analyzed for eight nitrosamines including ndma n nitrosomorpholine nmor npip ndba n nitrosodiethylamine ndea n nitrosodipropylamine ndpa n nitrosomethylethylamine nmea and n nitrosopyrrolidine npyr beita sandí et al 2019 the study revealed that more than 90 of nitrosamines formed was either ndma or nmor while other nitrosamines except npip constituted less than 5 of total nitrosamines see table 2 for more details beita sandí et al 2019 showed that ozonation of twp leachates alone did not result in the formation of nitrosamines whereas chloramination led to the formation of ndma nmor and npip up to 126 81 and 6 8 nmol g tire respectively see table 2 ndma formation during chloramination was 3 5 times higher than the amount formed under ozonation followed by chloramination other nitrosamines excluding nmor formed in higher quantities under chloramination alone this suggests that ozonation might lower the formation potential of nitrosamines from scrap tires possibly due to degradation or mineralization of nitrosamine precursors nitrosamines and their precursors might also be transformed or removed by hydroxyl radicals formed during ozonation however nmor formed during ozonation followed by chloramination was roughly twice the amount formed by chloramination alone beita sandí et al 2019 it may indicate a breakdown of some larger molecules to potent nmor precursors during ozonation to sum up twps are mainly made of rubber which is shown to be a potent ndma precursor hence twps can be considered a major precursor of ndma however more realistic studies are required to ascertain the contribution of tire waste to the formation of dbps in real water and wastewater matrices since twp concentrations in real world conditions are generally several orders of magnitude lower than the 50 000 mg l used in the study by beita sandí et al 2019 washing of elastomeric rubbers prior to use or pre washing of scrap tires before reuse might also be a good practice to reduce the amount of nitrosamines precursors i e dom leaching this will allow the early leaching of the most mobile organic constituents from the elastomer for instance less doc was released from the elastomers previously aged in water for 14 days prior to the leaching experiments see table 2 siemens and kaupenjohann 2003 finally periodic monitoring of ndma formation potential during the lifetime of elastomerc materials utilized in water distribution system is highly recommended as they might become a major source of n nitrosamines especially ndma 3 polyelectrolytes polyelectrolytes are high molecular weight synthetic organic polymers with covalently bonded charged groups when dissolved in polar solvents such as water as a result they show a high propensity to adsorb on the surfaces of particulates in aqueous solutions fielding 1999 jayasuriya 2017 stuart et al 2005 polyelectrolytes are used in water and wastewater treatment for coagulation flocculation filter backwashing and sludge dewatering for more than five decades bolto and gregory 2007 fielding 1999 in comparison to inorganic agents advantages of these organic polymers include a lower required dosage of coagulants less sludge production lower level of aluminum in treated water as well as a reduction in costs up to 25 30 bolto and gregory 2007 ding et al 2019 typical dosages of polyelectrolytes used as a primary coagulant in drinking water are 1 10 mg l and only 0 1 0 2 mg l used as coagulant aids bolto and gregory 2007 nsf ansi 2016 reported a typical use level of 1 10 and 25 mg l for polyacrylamide pam poly epichlorohydrin dimethylamine epi dma polyamine and poly diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride polydadmac respectively some countries such as the united kingdom and new zealand have suggested stricter limitations of the maximum dosage of active polymer to 0 5 5 and 10 mg l for pam epi dma and polydadmac respectively water 2016 polymer concentrations at different stages of water and wastewater treatment are typically unknown due to difficulties in their quantification it is estimated that around 95 of the polyelectrolytes are adsorbed removed with floc formation while small amounts 5 may remain dissolved in the water or wastewater and reach the disinfection units fielding 1999 sfynia et al 2020 although the polymer toxicity itself is negligible especially for anionic and non ionic polymers remaining monomers or other pollutants from the production process might be a matter of concern ding et al 2019 fielding 1999 ghernaout 2018 for instance acrylamide monomer is known to be a carcinogen for which the world health organization who has suggested an application limit of 0 5 µg l in drinking water treatment plant flocculation who 2011 because of amine groups on polyelectrolytes these polymers monomers can also contribute to the formation of hazardous n dbps under chlorination chloramination and ozonation below we discuss the formation of dbps from the most common polyelectrolytes in water and wastewater treatment plants table 3 provides a summary of available studies it highlights that polymer concentrations and disinfection conditions vary widely across studies which makes comparisons difficult 3 1 acrylamide acrylamides have a large molecular weight and can be ionic cationic or anionic or non ionic acrylamide polymers used in water and wastewater treatment include but are not limited to pam cationic pam cpam anionic pam apam and aminomethylated polyacrylamide mannich 3 1 1 c dbps formation potential the reaction between pam polymers and chlorine can form thms in the range of several µg thms mg pam in a deionized water matrix ding et al 2019 mallevialle et al 1984 identified chloroform concentrations from chlorination of pam up to 1 4 1 6 µg chcl3 mg pam 7 8 µg l in comparison acrylamide monomer was claimed to form chloroform up to 2500 µg chcl3 mg pam 250 µg l therefore modifying these polymer production processes to decrease the amount of their monomer is critical as a measure to substantially reduce the amount of dbps formation 3 1 2 n dbps formation potential among acrylamide polymers mannich has been shown to form the highest level of ndma during chlorination chloramination and ozonation sgroi et al 2014 and neither apam cpam nor pam could produce considerable amounts of ndma park piyachaturawat et al 2009 found that up to 114 µg ndma mg mannich was formed upon chloramination whereas only 0 88 µg ndma mg cpam was detected for cpam this is mainly because mannich can easily be degraded to formaldehyde and dma which are known ndma precursors song et al 2022 another study conducted by sgroi et al 2016 also reported the low formation of ndma in a range of 1 3 ng l from cationic and anionic pam under ozonation 5 5 mg o3 l utilizing pam in the water and wastewater treatment process did not considerably increase the formation of hans or thms upon post chlorination ding et al 2018 in contrast coagulation with alum salt 10 mg l as alum and pam 2 mg l increased haloacetamides levels from 2 5 5 5 µg l in coagulation with alum alone to 4 9 7 7 µg l despite the fact that haloacetamides formation from polyacrylamides and their monomers is much lower than thms their toxicity is several orders of magnitude higher therefore haloacetamides formation potential should be thoroughly evaluated before selecting pam in water treatment plants under conditions representative of real world water and wastewater treatment the acrylamide dosage is generally kept under control by restricting both the polyacrylamide dosage 1 mg l and the monomer content of the final product 0 05 weight ding et al 2019 fielding 1999 in addition only 5 of these polymers may remain in the water and might reach the disinfection units sfynia et al 2020 as a result the low residual amount of pam 0 05 mg l and its monomer 2 5 µg l reaching the disinfection unit cannot significantly enhance the formation of thms and n nitrosamines in water and wastewater treatment plants in contrast mannich polymers are able to promote the formation of ndma in wastewater substantially hence the application of mannich polymers in wwtps should be preceded by an analysis of ndma formation potential 3 2 polyamines and polydadmac polydadmac and polyamines such as epi dma are cationic polyelectrolytes with a low moderate molecular weight the most utilized polyelectrolytes in water and wastewater with their characteristics are shown in table 1 3 2 1 c dbps formation potential kaiser and lawrence 1977 detected chloroform formation from the reaction of commercial polydadmac in the range of not detected to 2 4 µg l although thm formation from epi dma under chlorination is more variable than formation from polydadmac see table 3 it is still not in the range of concerning levels most of the available studies on c dbps formation from polydadmac and epi dma were conducted several decades ago feige et al 1980 fielding 1999 kaiser and lawrence 1977 and polymers production quality has improved since then in addition concentrations of both polyelectrolytes and chlorine as disinfectants in real water or wastewater treatment plants are lower than those studied in laboratories as a result c dbps formation from either polydadmac or epi dma is probably negligible in comparison to other dbp precursors present in water and wastewater this is also in agreement with a study that reviewed thm formation from polyelectrolytes under chlorination bolto 2005 3 2 2 n dbps formation potential in contrast with c dbps ndma detection in water treatment plants using polydadmac and chlorination can be a cause for concern ding et al 2019 ndma formation from polydadmac and epi dma has been extensively investigated under different disinfection processes see table 3 child et al 1996 identified ndma upon chlorination of highly concentrated polydadmac within a range of 10 up to 310 ng l the reaction between hypochlorite and polymer was almost instantaneous and ndma concentrations did not increase after the first hour of the reaction furthermore padhye et al 2011 observed ndma formation potential from common polyelectrolytes following the order of polydadmac cpam polyamines upon ozonation high ndma formation from polydadmac was related to the oxidation of polymer and further dma release to the matrix among common disinfectants chloramine leads to the highest levels of ndma formation in water and wastewater treatment sgroi et al 2018 ndma was detected in water treatment plants that used polydadmac and practised chloramination in the range of 7 46 ng l polydadmac can form ndma up to 15 000 ng l under chloramination at laboratory conditions which is several orders of magnitude greater than other types of coagulant polymers such as apam and different copolymers of pam liew et al 2015 this can be related to quaternary amines with dma functional groups on polydadmac the ndma formation has been proposed to occur from both the dma moiety mitch and sedlak 2004 and the quaternary ammonium group kemper et al 2010 during chloramination ph is reported to have the most impact on ndma formation from polydadmac and the maximum ndma formed at ph around 7 tan et al 2018 the degradation of polydadmac results in dma release which can further form ndma in reaction with dichloramine available at neutral ph tan et al 2018 the maximum ndma yield occurs at an optimum ph i e usually ph 7 8 where deprotonated amine precursors and dichloramine might be present simultaneously due to a shortage of deprotonated amine precursors at acidic conditions the ndma formation might be constrained although the initial ndma formation might be promoted at basic conditions the final formed ndma could be limited because of the dichloramine shortage selbes et al 2018 shen and andrews 2013 park et al 2015 observed that one of the efficient strategies to curb ndma formation from polyamine and polydadmac during in situ chloramination is to increase chlorination time before adding ammonium chloride to the solution it suppresses dichloramine thus effectively curbing ndma formation for treatment plants using coagulant polymers adding free chlorine to water sources already containing ammonia should be avoided also pre oxidation of polyelectrolytes with oxidants can reduce their ndma formation potential prior to monochloramination except for pre ozonation of polydadmac which increases ndma formation through releasing dma from the structural breakdown of polydadmac park et al 2015 the above results highlight the complexity of reactions involving polyelectrolytes during exposure to oxidants zeng et al 2016 quantified ndma from epi dma at uniform formation conditions ufc up to 244 ng l polyamines formed ndma mainly due to the tertiary amines present on one end of the polymer chain krasner et al 2013 the ndma formation potential from the most common polyelectrolytes in water treatment has been reported to follow the order of mannich epi dma polydadmac cpam regardless of the utilized oxidant park piyachaturawat et al 2009 it can be concluded that exploiting mannich epi dma and polydadmac in water and wastewater treatment can elevate ndma formation upon chloramination to a concerning level hence several studies have been conducted on modifying polymer production processes to decrease the amount of n nitrosamine formation upon disinfection an et al 2019 atkinson et al 2020 zeng et al 2014 2016 treating polyelectrolytes with methyl iodide as an alkylating agent to transform tertiary amine groups of polymers to less reactive quaternary ammonium forms has been demonstrated to reduce ndma formation from polydadmac and epi dma by 74 78 zeng et al 2016 synthesis of polyelectrolytes with dipropylamino substituents also yielded less reactive quaternary ammonium groups reducing ndma formation a study conducted by zeng et al 2014 recommended the replacement of quaternary nitrogen in polydadmac with a phosphorus atom to prevent the formation of n dbps upon chloramination atkinson et al 2020 claimed 54 63 less ndma formation from polydadmac which was purified to eliminate a low molecular weight fraction 10 kda this is mainly because low molecular weight fractions of polydadmac include dadmac monomer and dma which already have been proved to be ndma precursors in aqueous media an et al 2019 park wei et al 2009 although ndma yield from dadmac monomer has been measured only up to 9 4 0 7 ng ndma mg dadmac under ufc tests 90 times lower than dma quaternary ammonium might form more ndma because of the large number of dadmac monomer present in polydadmac polymer zeng et al 2016 to sum up adjusting the manufacturing process of polyamines and polydadmac can lower the required coagulant dosage and subsequent dbps formation it is also important to evaluate the optimum dosage of polyelectrolytes considering a trade off between nmda formation and their efficiency such as turbidity or doc removal in the coagulation process 4 microplastics mps plastic waste has risen steeply in both terrestrial and aqueous ecosystems over the last several decades as a result of the widespread use of plastics in many different industries long lasting features as well as poor waste management lenka et al 2021 nava and leoni 2021 iso tr 21960 2020 e 2020 defined mps as insoluble in water polymeric compounds with any dimension from 1 µm to 1000 µm 1 mm the same report defined large microplastic as plastic particles between 1 and 5 mm as cited in schymanski et al 2021 however most of the current literature acknowledges the range of 1 µm to 5 mm for mps menéndez pedriza and jaumot 2020 wang et al 2020 mps can be classified as either primary or secondary based on to their source primary mps are deliberately manufactured plastics in a microscopic size for industrial or domestic use primary mps usually end up in water bodies either freshwater or marine settings through various pathways including wind transportation wwtps discharge industrial domestic drainage and road runoff see fig 1 lambert and wagner 2018 mei et al 2020 menéndez pedriza and jaumot 2020 during the transportation of these primary plastics to the ocean most of them are exposed to weathering processes and are disintegrated into small particles through uv radiation thermal or mechanical stress and these are termed secondary mps in case they are smaller than 5 mm chen awasthi et al 2021 4 1 occurrence mps concentrations in wwtps influent and effluent have been reported in the range of 61 5 600 µg l and 0 5 170 µg l respectively indicating a removal efficiency of 93 8 99 8 based on mass concentration of mps cheng et al 2021 the majority of available studies measured mps concentration based on numbers per liter of the matrix lenka et al 2021 mps have been detected in wwtps influent and effluent within a range of 1 01 31 400 particles l and 0 004 447 particles l respectively indicating a variation of mps removal from 10 2 to 99 9 cheng et al 2021 similarly lv et al 2019 reported mps removal up to 82 1 in a membrane bioreactor system and 53 6 using an oxidation ditch system representing 99 5 and 97 0 removal on the mass basis tertiary treatments can provide further removal of mps in wwtps and their removal efficiencies are directly related to the applied unit processes the removal efficiency of tertiary treatments has been reported to range from 72 7 to 96 3 based on particle number cheng et al 2021 treated water and wastewater are usually disinfected using chlorination chloramination ozonation or uv radiation prior to being reused or released enfrin et al 2019 data is currently limited on the fate of mps during disinfection passing of mps in the disinfection unit may culminate in the degradation or fragmentation of the plastics into small pieces or particles at a rate of 9 3 to 6 8 cheng et al 2021 wang lin et al 2020 research conducted by wang lin et al 2020 indicated that the numbers of mps within a range of 1 5 µm was increased by 2 8 16 0 after ozonation representing a negative removal of mps in the disinfection unit although the overall mass based removal of mps in wwtps can be considered efficient wwtps still leave a high level of smaller mps in the effluent it has been estimated that the effluent of a single wwtp can release up to ten billion mp particles per day enfrin et al 2019 and that wwtps globally release approximately eight trillion mp particles into the aquatic ecosystems per day rochman et al 2015 nanoplastics also contribute to the plastic particle load but they are difficult to detect and hence they typically remain out of estimation there is now a scientific consensus that wwtps are one of the main sources of mps in water bodies the most abundant plastics found in aquatic ecosystems with their characteristics are shown in table 1 mps have also been detected in the influent and effluent of drinking water treatment plants within a range of 1 6 614 particles l and 1 930 particles l respectively indicating a removal efficiency of 66 9 to 100 regardless of treatment method cheng et al 2021 it is worth mentioning that although data is limited on twps and elastomers occurrence in water or wastewater treatment plants most of the available studies measured twps and elastomers such as styrene butadiene rubber as mps this is because most studies on mps still rely on visual detection which makes it challenging to differentiate between solid particles within a range of mps sizes 4 2 additives chemical substances are frequently added to polymeric compounds to alter their processability performance application and durability in order to make them suitable for commercial use ambrogi et al 2017 bolívar subirats et al 2021 these industrial additives can be plasticizers antioxidants fire retardants uv stabilizers antiozonants colorants coupling agents or other chemical substances bolívar subirats et al 2021 chen shi et al 2021 additives are typically added at levels ranging between 1 and 35 of the final product bolívar subirats et al 2021 additives are also able to migrate from polymers to surrounding environments as they are not chemically bonded with parent polymers chen shi et al 2021 one aspect that has recently received attraction is the leaching of doc from mps and its potential as a precursor of dbps lee et al 2020 romera castillo et al 2018 the leaching of dom accelerates when polymers lose their protective additives during natural aging processes lee et al 2020 nanoplastics can also contribute to the measured doc li et al 2020 as they can pass through membrane filters generally utilized to measure doc i e 0 45 µm filter 4 3 leaching of dissolved organic carbon although much work has been done on additive leaching from mps and their adverse effects on the environment ding et al 2022 hahladakis et al 2018 relatively little is known about dom leaching from plastic polymers table 4 dom can be a precursor of various dbps upon chlorination and chloramination and hence it is important to understand its leaching potential from mps romera castillo et al 2018 estimated that 23 600 tonnes of doc leach from plastics present in the marine environment across the world annually leached dom from plastic particles usually contains various additives in addition to the monomers and oligomers that make up the main polymer chains of the original plastic lee and hur 2020 exposure to uv sunlight can substantially increase the amount of doc leaching from plastic particles zhu et al 2020 including propylene pe pvc expanded polystyrene eps lee et al 2020 2021b and pe shopping bags walsh et al 2021 for instance exposure to uv radiation was shown to increase the leaching of doc by up to 100 times more than that under dark conditions lee et al 2020 several kinetic studies suggested that doc leaching decreases exponentially over time for instance leached doc concentrations from ldpe dropped by 45 within a 200 h time frame until they reached constant leaching of 5 5 µg cm2 romera castillo et al 2018 the drop in doc leaching was attributed to the sorption of doc to plastic particles dissipation of volatile leaching and or mineralization of non volatile doc romera castillo et al 2018 in contrast zhu et al 2020 observed an exponential increase in doc leaching from postconsumer plastics such as eps polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp over 70 days in view of these contradictory conclusions further studies should be conducted to elucidate the mechanism of dom leaching from mps and their kinetics the quantity of doc leaching is strongly dependent on the type of plastic but again contradictory results have been published on the topic for instance lee et al 2020 observed that doc leaching from pe particles were about fourfold that from pp polymers in contrast zhu et al 2020 observed more doc leaching from pp than from pe in general doc leaching from different plastic polymers follows the order of polyamide pa pvc polymethyl methacrylate pmma or acrylic pe ps pet and polylactic acid ateia et al 2020 lee et al 2021b infrared spectra suggest that the molecular structures of dom leached from pe and pp are similar lee et al 2020 dom leaching from mps e g ps pet pp pvc and eps exposed to uv radiation contained more oxygen containing functional groups e g carboxylic and phenolic groups compared to those kept in the dark gewert et al 2018 lee et al 2021b this was attributed to the probable chemical alterations provoked by uv radiations lee and hur 2020 dom leached from mps also show noticeable reactivities akin to those of nom in terms of their propensity to be dbp precursors ateia et al 2020 lee et al 2020 4 4 c dbps formation potential insoluble plastic polymers can release dom and fragmented nanoparticles into the water and wastewater which are potential precursors for dbps upon chlorination chloramination or ozonation although much research has been done on nom and its role in the formation of c dbps wang et al 2017 and n dbps lin et al 2014 mitch and sedlak 2004 little is known about the role of plastic polymers in the formation of dbps table 5 summarizes available studies on the topic disinfection conditions mps concentrations and leaching settings vary widely across the limited number of studies available which makes comparisons difficult exposure to uv irradiation is expected to increase the formation of thms during the chlorination of different mps including pe pp pa pmma pet and ps from 22 110 µg thms l to 85 15 990 µg thms l see table 5 ateia et al 2020 hong et al 2021 lee et al 2020 the release of dbps precursors from plastic particles in dark conditions could be related to hydrolysis for instance enfrin et al 2019 reported the vulnerability of plastic polymers such as pet and polyurethane to hydrolytic cleavage of their bonds therefore it is not surprising to see thms mainly chloroform yield up to 110 µg l for polystyrene as a result of doc leaching in dark conditions ateia et al 2020 chloroform formation also increased linearly with the amount of leached doc from pe and pp lee et al 2020 the age of mps can also contribute to the amount of dbp precursors leaching from mps in water and wastewater for instance ateia et al 2020 studied four consecutive leaching of c dbps precursors from mps brominated precursors of thms were mostly released during the first leaching cycle because they were weakly bonded to mps in contrast doc leaching and other thms generation both increased in the second cycle this observation could be explained by the leaching of hydrolysis stabilizers e g carbodiimides in the first leaching cycle resulting in more susceptibility of mps to hydrolysis in the following cycles ateia et al 2020 all the studies mentioned above suggest the formation of thms from mps but it is important to note that they were all conducted at unrealistic doses of mps i e 1 20 g l which is several orders of magnitude higher than concentrations currently found in real wastewater hence the formation of thms from mps would be less of a concern in real world however it should be reassessed in the future as plastic production increases globally 4 5 n dbps formation potential ateia et al 2020 studied the leaching of hans precursors from different plastic particles including pe pp pa pmma pet and ps in both dark and uv irradiated conditions these plastic particles were able to form hans mainly dcan in the range of 2 5 5 8 µg hans l in ultrapure water in dark conditions see table 5 exposure to uva 340 radiation did not significantly promote the formation of hans it is worth mentioning that hans showed the highest cytotoxicity potential across many classes of dbps studied muellner et al 2007 despite the fact that they are not yet regulated allen et al 2022 concentrations of hans in finished water have been reported in the range of several ng l to a few µg l ding et al 2019 li et al 2021 more research needs to be conducted to assess the role of mps in the formation of n dbps in water and wastewater n dbps are present at substantially lower concentrations than c dbps but they are more toxic and carcinogenic despite being one of the most studied n dbps ndma formation from mps has not been investigated to date this could be due to the absence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone of most common plastics however polyurethane and pa contain nitrogen in their structure and hence may be potential precursors of ndma and or other n nitrosamines see table 1 for pa structure 5 role of miscellaneous parameters on dbps formation 5 1 co existing organic matter the presence of humic substances in water increases the formation potential of both c dbps priya et al 2020 and n dbps jasemizad et al 2021 for instance moreno andrés and peperzak 2019 observed the highest thms and haas concentration upon chlorination of ballast water which contained an augmentation mixture of carbon source with humic substances dom leaching from pe and pp is composed of mostly 61 87 low molecular weight fractions 350 da and only 1 2 of humic substances 1 000 da lee et al 2020 in contrast nom from natural water sources is mainly composed of humic substances krzeminski et al 2019 lee et al 2020 reported much higher thms mainly chloroform formation potential from the humic substances and heavier fractions 1 000 da of leached dom from pp and pe than their low molecular weight fractions the doc normalized thm formation potential of the dom leached from mps was reported to be comparable with thm formation potential of nom in natural waters under similar chlorination conditions i e 5 mg cl mg c 3 days and room temperature lee et al 2020 the aquatic nom in haihe river china and lake reservoir demonstrated doc normalized thm formation potential of 13 71 3 hao et al 2017 and 80 400 µg thms mg c brooks et al 2015 respectively lee et al 2020 comparably the dom leached from pe and pp under uv radiation exhibited similar doc normalized thm formation potential of 40 3 440 and 29 2 453 3 µg thms mg c respectively lee et al 2020 therefore dom leaching from mps can enhance the dbp formation in real water and wastewater treatment plants under disinfection conditions however more research is needed to ascertain the extent of this contribution we note that the levels of pbms in real world conditions are generally lower than those studied in the literature mentioned above 5 2 role of halogens among different operational and environmental parameters affecting dbps formation water salinity is shown to correlate significantly p 0 01 with all dbps including thms and haas moreno andrés and peperzak 2019 more specifically halide levels mostly bromide and iodide concentrations correlate better with both the formation and speciation of halogenated dbps than salinity priya et al 2020 shah et al 2015 these halides can be oxidized to hypobromous acid hobr and hypoiodous acid hoi through the reaction with oxidants such as chlorine which can then react with other organic moieties as secondary oxidants to form brominated and iodinated dbps jasemizad et al 2021 shah et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 salinity levels vary substantially among the water sources for example in freshwater the chloride bromide and iodide mean median concentrations are reported to be 10 0 07 0 1 and 0 0005 0 01 mg l respectively jasemizad et al 2021 shah et al 2015 on the other hand the mean median chloride bromide and iodide levels in marine water are reported to be 19 000 50 80 and 0 02 0 06 mg l respectively kim et al 2015 shah et al 2015 so water treatment plants using groundwater sources may experience high halide levels if seawater intrusion is an issue around coastal areas such high concentrations of halide can facilitate the formation of brominated and iodinated dbps which are believed to be more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated counterparts kim et al 2015 richardson et al 2008 brominated dbps such as brominated thms and haas have been reviewed previously jasemizad et al 2021 sharma et al 2014 ateia et al 2020 observed a major shift towards the increased formation of brominated thms such as dichlorobromomethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform and brominated hans such as bromochloroacetonitrile and dibromoacetonitrile during the chlorination of different mps including pe pp pa pmma pet and ps in the presence of bromide ions in contrast chloroform and dcan dominated dbps in the absence of bromide the same authors measured total organic halogens 2 4 times higher than the known dbps i e thms and hans which indicated the formation of other halogenated dbps beyond the formation of thms and hans mps themselves can release bromide due to the presence of additives such as brominated flame retardants e g polybrominated diphenyl ethers and dibromophenols pivnenko et al 2017 additionally bromide ions can be oxidized to active bromine species upon chloramination gu et al 2020 compared to free chlorine bromide s reaction with monochloramine occurs much slower jasemizad et al 2021 these bromine species can further react with nom or dom to form brominated dbps beita sandí et al 2020 gu et al 2020 the increase of bromide concentrations 0 1 000 µg l in distilled and deionized water were shown to promote the ndma formation from model precursor compounds i e polydadmac polyamine mono di and trimethylamine and ranitidine upon chloramination beita sandí et al 2020 in contrast increased bromide reduced ndma formation in wastewater effluent samples which can be related to the reaction of bromochloramine with nom in lieu of ndma precursors the effect of bromide on dbps formation from model precursors is now relatively well understood in contrast the role of halides in dbp formation from pbms remains poorly studied more realistic studies are required to study the contribution of halide to the formation of dbps in real water and wastewater matrices in the presence of environmentally relevant pbm concentrations since halide concentrations in real world conditions are generally lower than those used in most laboratory studies 6 conclusions and recommendations disinfection of water and wastewater is vital to inactivate pathogens but it may result in the formation of various dbps the present article reviewed the role of pbms as a source of organic precursors to generate dbps upon chemical disinfection of water and wastewater literature shows that tire waste and mps can release high amounts of dom up to 656 8 and 42 100 mg dom kg pbms i e 42 1 and 32 84 mg l respectively under extreme laboratory conditions the dom leaching from pbms is comparable to nom which is the main precursor of dbps in water and wastewater treatment the dom released from elastomers tire waste polyelectrolytes and mps was also shown to have a high propensity to form various c dbps and n dbps upon chlorination chloramination and ozonation considering the small size of insoluble pbms and their buoyancy a large amount of these pbms is likely to remain in the wwtps effluent as a result they pose a high risk for dbps formation upon disinfection in water and wastewater this literature review on the role of pbms in dbps formation highlighted major research gaps and directions for future research which are summarized below the potential contribution of some pbms their additives and transformation products to the formation of dbps has not been studied to date besides there are numerous other chemicals that are released from tire waste and their potential role in dbp formation is unclear specific cases that require more attention include the potential formation of ndma from mps e g polyamide and polyurethane and the role of 6ppd and its transformation product 6ppd quinone as potential precursors of dbps most studies conducted to date considered conditions that are not representative of real treatment conditions more realistic studies including lower concentrations of pbms and disinfectants and better representations of real water and wastewater matrices are needed the exact mechanisms behind the formation of dbps from pbms are often unknown more fundamental studies on the role and contributions of different fractions of the dom leaching from pbms would be beneficial the relative contribution of different types of pbms to the formation of dbps in real world conditions is unknown more critical evaluations are needed on the combined effects of various organic nom humic and fulvic constituents and dom leaching from pbms and inorganic ions e g halogens including bromide and iodide this will allow an assessment of the relative contribution of pbms to the formation of dbps guidelines for sampling or measurement of the pbms in aqueous media are currently lacking considering the high probability of background contamination i e airborne pbms fibers from clothing and sampling equipment specific methods and protocols for collecting samples in different matrices and accurate analyses of pbms is needed as a precautionary approach the occurrence of pbms in disinfection units should be minimised it is desirable not only because of potential risk of dbps formation but also due to their potential direct and indirect toxicity the pbms covered in this review were chemically similar but they have a diverse range of sources hence a range of mitigation measures specific to various sources are likely to be needed to effectively minimize their release in the environment and control the formation of dbps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

15131,progress in heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes aops is hampered by several issues including mass transfer limitation limited diffusion of short lived reactive oxygen species ros aggregation of nanocatalysts and loss of nanocatalysts to treated water these issues have been addressed in recent studies by executing the heterogeneous aops in confinement especially in the nanopores of catalytic membranes under nanoconfinement preferably at the length of less than 25 nm the oxidant nanocatalyst interaction ros micropollutant interaction and diffusion of ros have been observed to significantly improve which results in enhanced ros yield and mass transfer improved reaction kinetics and reduced matrix effect as compared to conventional heterogenous aop configuration given the significance of nanoconfinement effect this study presents a critical review of the current status of membrane based nanoconfined heterogeneous catalysis system for the first time a succinct overview of the nanoconfinement concept in the context of membrane based nanofluidic platforms is provided to elucidate the theoretical and experimental findings related to reaction kinetics reaction mechanisms and molecule transport in membrane based nanoconfined aops vs conventional aops in addition strategies to construct membrane based nanoconfined catalytic systems are explained along with conflicting arguments opinions which provides critical information on the viability of these strategies and future research directions to show the desirability and applicability of membrane based nanoconfined catalysis systems performance governing factors including operating conditions and water matrix effect are particularly focused finally this review presents a systematic account of the opportunities and technological constraints in the development of membrane based nanoconfined catalytic platform to realize effective micropollutant elimination in water treatment graphical abstract

available on request 1 introduction already affecting over 1 8 billion people the united nations estimates that global water consumption could face severe storage of freshwater 40 by 2030 united nations 2014 the depletion of freshwater has been further exacerbated by water pollution caused by rapid economic development and urbanization worldwide ly et al 2019 patel et al 2020 although wastewater reclamation has been considered as the frontline strategy for sustainable water management effective removal of recalcitrant water contaminants such as pharmaceuticals pesticides endocrine disrupting chemicals ingredients of personal care products makes it challenging to warrant the successful implementation of this concept michael kordatou et al 2015 given their toxicity to living organisms after prolonged exposure kovalakova et al 2020 nguyen et al 2022b and their persistent presence in aquatic environments paíga et al 2019 wilkinson et al 2022 yang et al 2017 these recalcitrant contaminants are commonly regarded as hazardous emerging micropollutants a survey of the river waters in three highly urbanization cities of beijing changzhou and shenzhen highlighted the notable occurrence of several emerging micropollutants including sulfadimethoxide indomethacin sulpridie and atenolol at a median concentration of 164 ng l 50 9 ng l 77 3 ng l and 52 9 ng l respectively wang et al 2015 similarly the sum of four paraben metabolites concentration in the new york city wastewater effluent was reported to range from 2060 to 2550 ng l wang and kannan 2016 in another very recent study after examining 258 rivers in 104 nations the most contaminated river sites were de facto located in low to middle income countries for instance the highest concentration of pharmaceuticals was over 700 000 ng l in the samples collected from the river located in the lahore city of pakistan wilkinson et al 2022 non biodegradability and heterogeneous complex structure make micropollutants recalcitrant to conventional water treatment processes al qarni et al 2016 wang and kannan 2016 yang et al 2017 in that manner membrane based filtration has been recognized as an efficient technology for effective rejection of pollutants to produce potable water werber et al 2016 an ideal membrane should possess strong mechanical resistance thin selective layer high throughput and consistent selectivity ly et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a currently although membrane filtration is mostly available in commercial market the popularity of membrane technology has still been constrained from the well known compromise among permeability selectivity stability and energy consumption su et al 2020 ying et al 2017 so far only ultrafiltration uf and nanofiltration nf membranes have advantages of low energy cost and greater water production rate liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021d nevertheless reducing the pore size of uf and nf may achieve rejection of low molecular weight lmw organic contaminants at the expense of water flux liu et al 2021 additionally rejection obviously results in the substantial accumulation of the recalcitrant pollutants in the concentrate posing concerns for its subsequent release into the surrounding environment aftab et al 2021 maeng et al 2018 conventional advanced oxidation processes aops have been proposed as a potent solution as they have been observed to display good performance for the removal of organic micropollutants based on the generation of reactive oxygen species ros of those hydroxyl radical oh is one of the most powerful oxidants which could unselectively break down micropollutants or even may lead to complete mineralization mameda et al 2017 trellu et al 2018 wang and wang 2018 recently sulfate radicals based aops have gained recognition due to the high redox potential of sulfate radicals so4 e 0 so4 so4 2 2 6 3 1 v e 0 oh oh 1 9 2 7 v lee et al 2020 wang and wang 2020 advances in heterogeneous aops using nanocatalysts could aid in enhanced elimination of micropollutants due to their higher stability better acclimatization to environmental changes e g ph and better reusability than traditional homogeneous aops chen et al 2019 chu et al 2021 wang et al 2021b in spite of the merits the practical application of aops in water pollution remediation has been still limited by their low activation efficiency and inefficient utilization of radicals possibly owing to the mass transfer limitation as well as the short lifetime of oh 1 μs and so4 30 40 μs in water the other limitations of nanocatalysts include severe agglomeration breakage under shear stress induced by stirring and low recovery of nanomaterials in conventional batch mode suspension systems meng et al 2022a wang et al 2021b apart from that it is important to note that the loss of nanomaterials to treated water could cause severe health problems and environment concerns ly et al 2020a wang et al 2016 which requires an extra step to separate them from the solution one straightforward strategy to solve the conundrum in either membrane filtration or aops is to precisely immobilize nanocatalysts on a membrane platform not only does such approach help reduce the leakage of nanocatalysts but it could also improve the degradation of micropollutants by enhancing the mass transfer of short lived reactive species under the phenomenon spatial confinement effect the core principle is to control the distance among the micropollutants catalyst surface and oxidant under a certain length at nanoscale preferably 25 nm where the reaction mostly occurs qian et al 2020 zhang et al 2021c zhang et al 2020b by adopting nanosized spatial restriction a significantly higher removal of organic micropollutants has been achieved by heterogeneous catalytic membrane as compared to that in bulk solution for example in situ nucleation of cobalt nanocatalysts within 2d hexagon boron nitride nanosheet h bnns intralayer network permitted outstanding removal of the pharmaceutical ranitidine 99 with an ultrafast degradation rate 80 ms far exceeding the removal achieved by polyvinylidene fluoride peroxymonosulfate pms system and pms only 5 asif et al 2022c with feocl nanocatalysts confined within the 20 nm pores of a ceramic membrane the fenton like heterogeneous catalytic membrane could completely degrade various organic pollutants 100 within a retention time of 10 s zhang et al 2021d similar observation could be found elsewhere e g cobalt single atom co1 graphene oxide go polyethersulfone pes wu et al 2021 co3o4 ns cellulose acetate ca wang et al 2021b coal layered double hydroxide ldh ns pvdf asif et al 2022b and β feooh pvdf zhang et al 2021a notwithstanding a consensus of increased availability of reactive species for oxidation reactions among the previously reported gaging the potential of spatial nano confinement effect in catalytic membrane for industrial applications is still challenging because the concept has not been clearly defined and the underlying mechanisms have not been well recognized unlike conventional catalytic membranes nanoconfined heterogeneous catalytic membrane requires a strict design i e the space in the membrane template that hosts nanocatalysts should be precisely controlled at a nanometer scale to achieve desired chemical reactions nonetheless the exact length scale has not been well specified in fact although a recent study claimed that the optimal length scale for nanoconfined catalysis should be less than 25 nm the membrane pore size of 200 300 nm was still able to generate about a two order of magnitude higher decomposition rate of para chlorobenzoic acid pcba zhang et al 2020b and or 2 4 dichlorophenol dcp zhang et al 2021b as compared to that in bulk solution as the definition of nanoconfinement effect is still ambiguous this review considers all catalytic membrane structure in which the reaction occurs at a space of less than 200 nm additionally special attention is given to the catalytic membrane designed to execute the catalytic reaction at less than 25 nm scale besides the removal efficiency is also dependent on other governing factors such as catalyst loading amount inherent characteristics of materials and water matrix effects e g ph background impurities natural organic matter nom this review elucidates and presents opinions on the formation of major ros as well as the mechanisms of pms and or peroxide activation pollutant degradation pathway and background constituent due to the availability of literature the scope of this review is intentionally restricted to heterogeneous h2o2 pms and peroxydisulfate pds based aops with limited discussion on photo and electro based catalytic membrane processes till date to our best knowledge there has been no previous article that comprehensively discussed the membrane based nanoconfined heterogeneous catalysis systems for water pollution control particularly in the context of nanoconfinement effect accordingly this critical review aims to address the gap of knowledge by covering five sections including 1 to provide fundamental understanding of nanoconfinement effect in nanomaterials 2 to identify the unique properties of membrane based nanoconfined catalysis vs bulk solution and membrane filtration 3 to discuss synthesis of nanoconfined catalytic membranes 4 to elucidate and debate the effects of operating conditions on the efficacy of such nanoconfined systems and finally 5 to provide a roadmap for the future research 2 general fundamentals of nanoconfinement effect on catalysis the concept of spatial confinement was first introduced by rothenberger and grätzel who witnessed the changes in reaction rate when reactants were confined in a small volume rothenberger and grätzel 1989 over the past decades the expansion of studies on nanomaterials and nanotechnology have generated capacious opportunities to open up the prospect to reinvestigate thermodynamics and kinetics of numerous processes at the nanoscale providing further novel approach for a myriad of applications noticeable awareness has been drawn on the spatial restriction of particles molecules and ions on the order of one or several nanometers as the results from literature concur that these matters feature unprecedented physicochemical behaviors as compared to that in bulk solution qian et al 2020 for instance cicero and co workers observed the formation of ordered water layers near the surface of confining materials and disordered bulk like internal region in which water density hydrogen bonds and the molecular orientation are different than those in bulk water fig 1 a cicero et al 2008 further understanding of nanoconfinement effects on molecules particles and ions could be found in previously published reviews qian et al 2020 shen et al 2021 shifa and vomiero 2019 zhang et al 2021c in light of heterogeneous catalysis nanoconfinement effect is likely to alter chemical reactions such as reaction rate reaction selectivity or even unprecedented reaction pathway li et al 2017 xiao et al 2015 yang et al 2019 for example the confinement of fe nanoparticles nps inside carbon nanotubes resulted in an increase of 1 5 fold and 2 fold in co conversion and c5 hydrocarbons yield respectively as compared to that adsorbed on the outer surface fig 1b chen et al 2008 compared to pt loading on substrate surface a 3 fold increase in aromatic intermediate products was likewise detected after embedding pt catalyst within carbon nanofibers solomonsz et al 2013 yang et al reported the removal rate of methyl blue dye by fenton like heterogeneous catalysis employing fe2o3 nps loaded inside carbon nanotubes was 22 5 times faster than its unconfined counterpart difference in confinement structure could alter degradation pathways due to difference in the generation of ros for instance only the singlet oxygen 1o2 was generated by the system employing fe2o3 nps loaded inside carbon nanotubes while only oh formation was observed when the fe2o3 nps were loaded on carbon nanotube surface fig 1c d yang et al 2019 the enhanced degradation rate under spatial nanoconfinement could be elucidated by the effective electron transfer between nanocatalysts and host substrate smaller size of nanocatalysts due to space restriction and enrichment of reactants inside host substrate as well as higher diffusion rate of molecules inside confined channels pan and bao 2011 qian et al 2020 zhang et al 2021c nonetheless the encapsulation of nanocatalysts is not always beneficial for catalysis because it could block or inhibit the chemical reactions guo et al 2010 xiao et al 2017 implying that the nature of nanocatalysts and host substrate together with their mutual interactions could play an important role on catalytic efficiency such contrasting findings advocate the need to develop tools that could effectively examine the nanoconfinement effects for rational design of catalytic systems xiao and co workers introduced the concept of confinement energy using density functional theory dft calculations by combining the approximation and real experiments the study reported the downshift of d band states of the confined fe within cnt channels consequently weakening the adsorption of molecules such as co n2 and o2 on encapsulated fe clusters for instance the consistent lower dissociative binding energy of co gaseous molecules in fe in cnt 1 ev co than that in fe out cnt 2 84 ev co allowed the dissociatively adsorbed co species easier to react with h2 fischer tropsch process enhancing further co adsorption as well as higher reactivity of fe in cnt thus the confined space of cnts enhanced catalytic activities of the confined fe toward these molecules as compared to the unconfined condition xiao et al 2015 similarly dft calculations displayed a weak adsorption of atoms and molecules on the pt 111 surface under the confinement by 2d graphene monolayer the weakened c o bond in co governed by the electronic interaction between the top graphene overlayer and the molecules of confined co could promote co oxidation by the encapsulated pt li et al 2017 while the general concept of nanoconfinement effects has been recognized it appears that the mechanisms and efficacy largely depend on specific systems and targeted purposes posing numerous difficulties and uncertainties to interpret confinement based strategies in this study the removal degradation mechanisms of micropollutants under confinement by heterogenous catalytic membrane have been discussed for the first time in this regard the basic principles stemmed from similar physical and chemical fundamentals of nanoconfinement effects are considered alongside with dft approximations 3 unique properties of nanoconfined catalytic membranes vs conventional catalytic processes in bulk solution 3 1 reaction kinetics and removal efficiency there has been an agreement that nanoconfined catalytic membranes greatly prevail either conventional aops or membrane filtration in terms of micropollutant removal efficiency fig 2 for example less than 9 of the dye orange ii was removed by the pristine pvdf membrane which is significantly less than that removed by s n doped fe pvdf membrane pms system above 95 removal yao et al 2017 in a similar manner only a negligible removal less than 5 of pcba by pristine feocl membrane was observed after long term operation of 5 h possibly due to oversaturation of adsorptive sites on the contrary the feocl membrane h2o2 system maintained more than 95 pcba at the water flux of 100 l m2 h zhang et al 2021d additionally a handful of studies reported improvement in degradation kinetics of organic micropollutants by nanoconfined catalytic membranes fig 2a for example zhang et al reported an increase of 820 fold in the pseudo first order rate constant of pcba by the catalytic feocl membrane with a pore size of 20 nm i e 4 93 10 2 s 1 compared to that of the batch feocl h2o2 system zhang et al 2020b similarly a significant enhancement in dcp removal kinetic constants was observed for mn3o4 loaded channel size of 200 300 nm 40 70 nm and 20 nm with 200 times 1 8 10 3 s 1 500 times 4 2 10 3 s 1 and even 4000 times 3 5 10 2 s 1 respectively higher than that in the same batch reaction 5 4 10 4 min 1 zhang et al 2021b using ranitidine as a probe micropollutant meng and co workers witnessed a significant enhancement in the degradation rate i e 63 600 min 1 which is 5 7 orders of magnitude faster than that obtained by other traditional catalytic methods in bulk solution i e 0 0032 0 33 min 1 meng et al 2022a in another study the first order rate constant for ranitidine in the co cu oxide nanosheets osn membrane pms system was 0 053 ms 1 which was significantly higher than that achieved by the conventional catalytic batch systems including co cu ons pms system 0 07 s 1 and pms alone 1 39 10 4 s 1 meng et al 2022b using nanoconfined cobalt functionalized graphitic carbon nitride co g c3n4 membrane pms a very recent work also witnessed a degradation rate constant of ranitidine of 0 08 ms 1 which was 4 6 orders of magnitude higher than that in batch mode of co g c3n4 suspension pms or pms alone zhang et al 2023 also mentioned is the markedly enhanced removal of several organic micropollutants by controlled catalytic reactions within the nanoconfined membrane fig 2b demonstrating the general applicability of the membrane based nanoconfined catalysis system in water treatment for example a complete removal i e 100 for a set of organic micropollutants such as bisphenol a 2 4 dichlorophenol sulfamethoxazole 17α ethinylestradiol and atrazine was observed in a heterogeneous fenton like catalytic system using the feocl confined ceramic membrane at a flux of 90 lmh the feocl membrane h2o2 outperformed both the pristine feocl membrane and pristine ceramic membrane h2o2 system zhang et al 2021d in another study honeycomb like co3o4 ns membrane pms system achieved high removal for the selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products as well as dyes and phenols showing 100 95 96 100 100 100 92 and 100 removal for tetracycline hydrochloride carbamazepine sulfamethizole methyl orange rhodamine b methylene blue bisphenol a and phenol respectively importantly the removal of these micropollutants was significantly lower in the pms only 10 and conventional co3o4 membrane pms 30 systems wang et al 2021b similar trends were also found elsewhere asif et al 2022c meng et al 2022a zhang et al 2023 apparently nanoconfined catalytic membranes exhibited better performance for the remediation of recalcitrant micropollutants than the conventional heterogeneous catalytic systems in terms of the general applicability according to available literature discussed above different nanomaterial based catalytic membranes have been examined mainly for pms activation the as prepared membranes for nanoconfined catalysis have been observed to achieve a permeate flux of up to 300 lmh fig 2c while the water permeance of above 500 lmh has been reported for co tpml membrane pms system and co bnns membrane pms system fig 2c without the expanse of micropollutant removal regardless of water permeance that directly impacts retention contact time the membrane confined catalysis system could achieve 90 100 removal destruction of micropollutants in continuous flow operating mode 3 2 pollutant removal mechanisms in nanoconfined catalytic membrane it is believed that the outstanding removal efficacies of micropollutants by membrane based nanoconfined catalysis could be elucidated by its particular configuration which is likely constructed of hybrid materials endowed with new physicochemical properties consequently leading to the changes in ros enrichment of reactants more effective diffusion and reactions of ros with target pollutants and stronger electronic interactions transfer at nanoscales fig 3 the unique structure of nanoconfined space within a catalytic membrane could alter the generation of reactive species for enhanced pollutant removal as compared to conventional aops for example a greater contribution of superoxide o2 oh and 1o2 in the overall degradation by nanoconfined catalytic membranes has been reported fig 3a for instance a study led by zhang s group found that the addition of methanol oh and so4 quencher reduced ranitidine degradation by 46 4 while tba oh quencher introduction was found to slightly reduce less than 10 ranitidine degradation by coal ldh pvdf pms system the results suggested that so4 is the primary ros for ranitidine degradation on the other hand the addition of 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone hydrochloride temp could lead to a significant reduction in ranitidine removal 21 asif et al 2022b indicating 1o2 could play a similar role as oh albeit lower redox potential of the former interestingly this nonradical is not commonly found kohantorabi et al 2021 lu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022a or merely play a minor role in ldh pms based conventional aop systems guo et al 2020 similarly other studies demonstrated that 1o2 was one of the major contributors to micropollutant degradation in the pms activated systems such as co bnns membrane pms system asif et al 2022c mn3o4 nanodots g c3n4 nss membrane chen et al 2020 and co g c3n4 membrane pms zhang et al 2023 in contrast in the batch mode 1o2 may not play a significant role in micropollutant degradation indeed in the conventional co3o4 ns pms system wang et al 2022a and mn3o4 pms system wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 micropollutant degradation was achieved via radical pathways and the systematic experiments suggested negligible contribution of the nonradical 1o2 some studies suggested that the improved removal of organic pollutants by membrane based nanoconfined catalysis could be explained by the enriched concentration of ros at the nanoscale domain fig 3b zhang and co workers investigated the pcba decomposition behavior in the fe3o4 functionalized anodized aluminum oxide membrane h2o2 system with different membrane pore sizes i e 200 300 110 150 40 70 20 30 and 20 nm and found that the kinetics of pcba decomposition was correlated exponentially with the reduced membrane pore size based on model simulation this research demonstrated that the highest concentration of oh was produced within the pore size of 25 nm in addition with the increase in pore size oh concentration and diffusion dropped sharply fig 3b as such this particular length scale is highly recommended to prevent the diffusion and mass transfer limitation of short lived ros which is a commonly known drawback of conventional batch aop systems zhang et al 2020b these findings are in good agreement with that obtained using the feocl loaded ceramic membrane h2o2 system compared to a mere concentration 0 036 pm in bulk solution catalytic feocl membrane with a pore size of 20 nm was observed to achieve a steady state oh concentration of 44 6 pm zhang et al 2021d in a recent study enhanced removal of 1 4 dioxane was obtained by cobalt single atom co1 intercalated go membrane pms system this was also attributed to nanoconfinement effect induced by the nanosized water channels 3 5 nm of co1 go membrane fig 3c wu et al 2021 similarly 2d co tiox based membrane could effectively produce 1o2 so4 and oh within its 4 6 å interlayer free spacing and thus significantly enhancing the catalytic performance at the angstrom confined scale meng et al 2022a it is noteworthy that an improved generation of ros may not directly translate into enhanced micropollutant degradation due to mass transfer limitations it has been suggested that the spatial confinement may promote the interactions between ros and micropollutants due to the high diffusion from the center to the boundary of the confined space for example the intercalation of transitional metals metal oxides such as co mn and fe nanomaterials nms within 2d nss or membrane nano pores generally can increase specific surface area sbet and expand the available pore volume vpore of the nanoreactors asif et al reported an increase in sbet from 8 5 m2 g pristine bnns membrane to 14 1 m2 g co bnns membrane asif et al 2022c in another study in situ preparation of feocl nms within membrane pores significantly expanded the surface area available for reaction in the pores of the catalytic feocl ceramic membrane and offered numerous unsaturated fe sites for enhanced catalysis zhang et al 2021d ye et al prepared the 1d 2d fexoy a so called zif mil confined within go nanosheets they found that at the zif mil ratio of 20 1 the lawn structured membrane system had the highest sbet and the largest vpore of 426 89 m2 g and 0 77 m3 g respectively and achieved excellent norfloxacin removal 99 4 in 40 min by pms activation ye et al 2021a apparently such changes in physical parameters of nanoreactors are expected to provide more reactive sites and increase the collision probability between ros and organic micropollutants li et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a additional benefit of a nanoscale domain is to prevent agglomeration and breakage of nms that often occur in conventional configuration due to high surface tension and stirring respectively li et al 2022 moreover unlike the batch mode in which the nanocatalyst can be freely suspended the flow through systems of nanoconfined catalytic membrane propel a thorough contact of target pollutants with the reactive sites of nanocatalyst wu et al 2021 some studies suggested that spatial confinement of metal metal oxide at a nanoscale especially those containing oxygen vacancies ov could further aid catalytic reactions because ov could prompt the redox cycle between metaln and metaln 1 promote the mobility of surface oxygen and improve the efficiency of electron transfer for pms activation fig 3d asif et al 2022b kang et al 2019 meng et al 2022b ye et al 2021a ye et al 2021b for example ye et al observed the enrichment of ov content in zif mils 20 which could be deciphered for the removal of norfloxacin by this heterogeneous catalytic membrane pms system ye et al 2021a meanwhile encapsulated ni co nps could excite electrons to enrich the charge density on the outer n doped carbon nanotubes which resulted in the enhanced pms activation by the associated nanoconfined catalytic membrane kang et al 2019 interestingly those aforementioned mechanisms could be effectively predicted on a quantitative basis via dft calculations fig 3e and f for instance dft calculations illustrated the enlargement of o o bond l o o and s o bond l s o of pms after interaction with nanocatalyst at nanoscale which is an indicator for pms decomposition into ros asif et al observed the increase in l o o in the pms molecules from 1 356 å to 1 466 å following its adsorption on co bnns membrane asif et al 2022c more importantly the smaller spatial confinement was the higher the stretch in bond length a recent finding witnessed the stretch of s o bond from 1 905 å to 2 105 å and 2 121 å at the interlayer free spacing of 50 å and 8 å respectively in the case of co tiox membrane moreover once pms was angstrom confined within the channel size of 4 6 å stretch in the s o bond further increased which inferred the readiness of pms for dissociation meng et al 2022a much like the above observation a correlation between the stretch of o o and s o bonds within interlayer free spacing could also be found in the heterogeneous catalytic co cu ons membrane pms system meng et al 2022b compared to the l o o 1 330 å and l s o 1 900 å of pms co cu ons membrane interaction with pms in the peak pore size of 2 45 nm increased the l o o and l s o of pms to 1 405 å and 1 964 å respectively further decrease in the interlayer free spacing to 0 79 nm led to the cleavage of the l o o and an increase in l s o to 2 015 å meng et al 2022b as a rule of thumb this implies that pms molecules can be more readily activated to trigger the generation of ros such as so4 oh and 1o2 it is to be noted that cleavage of o o and s o bonds results in the formation of two radicals namely so4 and oh and a nonradical 1o2 in another example dft calculations unveiled the spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable dissociation of pms at small interlayer free spacings due to the stronger electrostatic interactions of pms with the nanocatalysts the adsorption energy e ads of pms increased from 0 82 to 3 96 ev when the interlayer free spacing decreased from 50 å to 4 6 å meng et al 2022a similarly the pms molecules adsorbed on the angstrom confined co cu ons membrane displayed a higher e ads value than that adsorbed on the nanoconfined counterpart showing an increase of eads from 7 84 ev to 8 74 ev corresponding with the interlayer free spacing of 2 45 nm and 0 79 nm respectively meng et al 2022b the above results suggested that the nanoconfined spaces within the 2d laminar membrane can significantly enhance the e ads of pms and thus yielding more radicals noticeably the e ads value 8 74 ev of pms within the interlayer free spacing of co cu ons were consistently higher than that for pms adsorbed on the surface of co cu ons 7 80 ev meng et al 2022b confirming more potential generation of ros within nanoconfined spaces rather than that at the surface of nanocatalysts in suspension despite the superior performance of membrane based nanoconfined catalysis over batch mode for water treatment still there has been a lot of gaps in knowledge in elucidation and comparison the formation and identification of ros as well as their corresponding reaction pathways with different targeted pollutants between the membrane based nanoconfined catalysis and catalysis in suspension especially in a quantitative manner with the aid of dft to further untangle the mechanisms between the duo 3 2 1 molecular transport mechanisms in terms of 2d membrane go was the first that has been extensively studied to understand the molecular transport phenomenon through nanoconfined space fig 4 nair and co workers witnessed ultrafast water permeation through a go membrane under pervaporation more precisely the rate of water permeation was found at least 10 fold higher than that of helium and was several magnitudes higher than that predicted by conventional diffusion behavior fig 4a nair et al 2012 this phenomenon was possibly ascribed to large capillary force 1000 bar and frictionless flow of water molecules through the sub nm pores of graphene oxide i e 4 6 å radha et al 2016 other unusual phenomena such as ultra dense packing of ions drastic changes in diffusion coefficients etc in the confined space have also been found elsewhere fig 4b cheng et al 2018 zheng et al 2017 in a further attempt meng and co workers examined the effect of nanoconfinement on the transport of water molecules through the co tiox membrane with different interlayer free spacings 0 46 2 5 3 5 and 5 0 nm by molecular dynamics md calculations fig 4c d they found that the diffusion of water molecules to the surface of co tiox nanosheets can be much easier with the decreasing interlayer free spacing and the hydrogen bonding interaction between water molecules and co tiox nanosheets becomes much stronger at smaller interlayer spacings especially at 4 6 å which could effectively facilitate the diffusion process within the angstrom scale nanochannels and thus improving the catalytic reactions meng et al 2022a evidence of water transport phenomenon under pressure driven mode in nanomaterial modified membranes such as nano catalysts immobilized within membrane pores or embedded within polymeric membrane matrix is yet to be found as widely recognized in many excellent literature review esfahani et al 2019 ren et al 2021 wang et al 2021a 4 preparation of nanoconfined catalytic membranes the preparation of nanoconfined catalytic membrane could be constructed by three common routes including immobilization of nanocatalysts on membrane surface in situ growth of nanocatalysts on within membrane pores and loading nanocatalysts within membrane matrix fig 5 4 1 controlling spatial nanoconfinement in 2d laminar membrane the nanoscale spaces governed by intralayer and interlayer spacing in laminar membranes assembled from 2d materials can be an ideal platform to host the nanoconfined catalysis for water treatment as a result preparing transitional metal based 2d nanosheets or incorporation of metal oxides within 2d nanosheets based membranes such as graphene and its derivatives including go and rgo h bn mxenes transition metal dichalcogenides tmdcs as well as layered double hydroxides ldh appear to be a straightforward approach to control spatial nanoconfinement in 2d laminar membrane fig 5a b asif et al 2022a qing et al 2020 safaei et al 2020 sun and li 2018 wang et al 2020a go is perhaps the most extensively studied material due to its inherent physicochemical properties such as hydrophilicity high dispersity in aqueous solution and promising potential in large scale application upon filtration 2d go layers are formed on the membrane surface in the form of layer by layer stacking of nanosheets with the interlayer spacing of 9 1 å in a dehydrated state this distance could expand up to a few nanometers 3 9 nm due to swelling when go is immersed in water su et al 2020 tao et al 2020 utilizing the sub nm pores free spacing of go nanosheet wang and co workers successfully introduced cobalt single atom co1 in the well stacked 2d layers to generate nanoconfined heterogeneous catalysis for 1 4 dioxane degradation wu et al 2021 in a similar fashion other studies confined metal based nanocatalysts or carbon based composites within the interlayer free spacing of go membrane for the removal of norfloxacin ye et al 2021a and sulfamethoxazole ye et al 2021b via pms activation structurally similar to graphene but with alternating boron and nitrogen atoms instead of carbon 2d h bnns have recently implemented to replace graphene derivatives due to its outstanding physicochemical properties pendse et al 2019 the intralayer spacing of h bnns is commonly found at 0 8 6 nm chen et al 2018 hafeez et al 2020 which could also provide an ideal niche for nanoconfined effects the in situ nucleation of cobalt nanocatalysts i e α co oh 2 and co3o4 within membrane intralayer network was introduced as a facile way to remove ranitidine by heterogeneous aops asif et al 2022c similarly some attempts to intercalate cobalt within 2d tiox meng et al 2022a and mn3o4 nanodots within 2d graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 chen et al 2020 for organic pollutant degradation have been reported as an effective strategy to utilize the potential of nanoconfined catalysis some other inorganic nanosheets such as ldh and co3o4 are also of interest in the fabrication of catalytic membranes asif and co workers synthesized coal ldh membrane with the d spacing corresponding to 003 and 006 planes of 7 68 å and 3 82 å respectively asif et al 2022b ly et al 2020c the interlayer spacings for the 111 220 and 311 planes in the hydrated co3o4 membrane were 0 49 nm 0 30 nm and 0 25 nm respectively wang et al 2022b wang et al 2021b the results of these studies indicated that the interlayer free spacing of the ldh membrane and co3o4 membrane without and with hydration remained comparable which suggested that water transport will occur through intralayer water channels indeed according to barrett joyner halenda bjh model the peak pore size of the ldh membrane and co3o4 membrane was 1 21 nm and 2 06 nm therefore the membrane prepared using nanocatalysts which could not be assembled into a laminar structure could also be employed for nanoconfined catalysis importantly in contrast to go membranes the pore size estimation of ldh membrane and metal oxide membrane requires attention and should ideally be estimated using pore size distribution models such as bjh and examining the rejection of model pollutants of known size to date it seems that the application of nanoconfined catalytic laminar membranes for water treatment has been merely at its early phase for example because their interlayer spacing ranges between 0 615 nm and 0 618 nm respectively xu et al 2017 mos2 and ws2 could also serve as ideal materials to prepare lamellar membrane for nanoconfined catalysis similarly transition metal carbides i e ti3c2tx in the mxene family could also be utilized for catalytic membrane application ascribed to its interlayer spacing of 6 4 å in the wet state ren et al 2015 moreover 2d mof cof for catalytic laminar membrane should also be paid more attention in future research meanwhile it is important to note that different incorporation strategies could also play a crucial role on the control of nanochannels structure for example tsou et al considered three different approaches i e pressure vacuum and evaporation assisted self assembly to prepare go membranes on a modified polyacrylonitrile mpan template the pressure approach resulted in highly ordered laminate while loose and less ordered go layers were formed on the mpan membrane surface in vacuum assisted strategy highly random order of go layers was noticed when go was deposited by evaporation at a controlled humidity tsou et al 2015 additionally interlayer intralayer spacing could be further tuned by various methods such as intercalating ion monomer and polymer cross linkers liu et al 2019 safaei et al 2020 nanomaterials ding et al 2017 xia et al 2016 ying et al 2017 zhang et al 2022b which can affect or enhance the overall performance of nanoconfined catalytic membranes therefore strategies of membrane fabrication to develop nanofluidic platform require to be considered in future research whereby enhanced permeability and degradation can be achieved concurrently 4 2 controlling spatial confinement within membrane pores immobilizing metal oxide based nanomaterials mof or cof within the pores of membrane skin layer or within the porous structures of membrane is widely adopted to execute nanoconfined catalysis in membrane filtration fig 5c d e over the past decades such nanoconfined composite membranes have been prepared by various preparation approaches including the contra diffusion and interfacial synthesis method li et al 2020b wang et al 2020b yin et al 2021 hydro solvothermal method deng et al 2019 lu et al 2021 shi et al 2019 dynamic filtration method lu et al 2020 wang et al 2018 and other in situ growth or immobilization methods gui et al 2012 lu et al 2021 ma et al 2021 wan et al 2017 wang et al 2018 zeng et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021d zhang et al 2020b regardless of the preparation methods literature claimed that any modification within membrane pore structure could directly alter the membrane performance probably due to the changes in tortuosity and porosity sun et al 2018 the effects of spatial confinement within membrane pores were apparent in recent findings which demonstrated the significant improvement in pollutant degradation by the catalytic membrane possessing nanosized pores more precisely degradation rate of pcba by catalytic feocl membrane with a pore size of 200 300 nm was approximately four times lower than that achieved by the catalytic feocl membrane with a pore size of 20 30 nm zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021d optimal loading rate and physicochemical properties of the embedded materials are regarded as a crucial factor determining overall efficiency of the nanoconfined composite membrane for instance at an excessive dose the agglomeration and or random distribution of the nano catalysts could block the passage of water molecules zhang et al 2021a or even result in some defects on membrane structure ma et al 2021 yin et al 2021 as a result careful selection of loading rate preparation methods as well as nanomaterials are highly desired to achieve optimum nanopore size in composite membrane for nanoconfined catalytic oxidation integrity and permeability besides the application of cof mof for nanoconfined catalytic membrane has been largely unexplored which can be an interesting topic for future research 4 3 controlling spatial confinement within mixed matrix membranes unlike immobilizing nano catalysts in membrane pores adding nanomaterials in the polymeric membrane matrix also known as mixed matrix membrane mmm could result in much more interaction between the two phases which can alter the intrinsic properties of the pristine membrane for example it is well recognized that hydrophilic nanomaterials could trigger diffusion rate between the solvent and the non solvent thus constructing a more porous membrane with larger pore sizes alpatova et al 2015 esfahani et al 2019 ly et al 2020b ly et al 2020c ying et al 2017 ideal mmms for heterogeneous catalysis should possess a porous structure with well defined finger like pore channels without macro voids this particular geometry permits a fast convective mass transport of the molecules to the active site of the catalyst for effective catalysis zeng et al 2018 incorporation of metal oxide based nano materials within membrane matrix via phase inversion could not only improve membrane performance but could also improve the removal rate of contaminants by adopting heterogeneous catalysis as evidenced by a handful of studies such as co n c han et al 2022 fe3o4 sio2 zhang et al 2019 fe2o3 alpatova et al 2015 fe n s co doped carbon yao et al 2017 cofe2o4 wang et al 2022c and zn cu fe o nguyen et al 2022a for example an inclusion of 20 wt of fe3o4 sio2 in the mixed matrix membrane broaden the membrane pore size from 95 4 nm to 151 2 nm consequently boosting removal rate of methyl blue dye from 30 to 94 6 by heterogeneous catalysis zhang et al 2019 in order to alleviate the aggregation of nanomaterials during long term operation ren and co workers introduced mof into mmm the uniform distribution of mil fe mof within membrane matrix with analogous membrane pore size of 2 nm improved the membrane permeance up to 222 lmh bar and achieved 75 removal of methyl blue by h2o2 based heterogeneous catalysis ren et al 2019 notwithstanding the promising results we argue that heterogeneous catalysis within mmms could result in a less effective oxidation compared to the immobilization methods found in the previous section because nano catalysts are covered surrounded by polymeric substances which could inhibit the direct contact between the oxidants such as pms and h2o2 and nano catalysts to generate reactive oxidants such as oh and so4 this argument is of significant interest to be explored in the forthcoming research besides despite the synergistic effects of adsorption and oxidation degradation in the catalytic mmms it is difficult to conclude any presence of nanoconfinement effects within catalytic mmm so far this gap in knowledge should be considered in the future studies furthermore lots of drawbacks are required to be tackled for successful implementation of mmms at industrial scale first loading rate and characteristics of modifying agents e g nanocatalysts transition metal based cof and mof should be optimized to avoid agglomeration and ensure the uniform distribution of nanocatalysts within membrane structures second the developed nano materials such as nps mof or cof should be compatible with polymeric membrane to minimize their leakage during operation thus strengthening the stability of mmms third base polymer for catalytic mmms should be resilient and high chemical resistance to prevent concerns over the membrane degradation by strong oxidants in addition their relative component in polymer solution should be taken into account as it could pose significant influence on the membrane structure and morphology during the phase inversion process esfahani et al 2019 ly et al 2020c 5 effects of operating conditions on membrane based nanoconfined catalysis 5 1 effects of catalyst loading and oxidant dosage typically increase in catalyst loading and or oxidant dosage is beneficial for catalytic performance of the membranes table 1 it is believed that higher loading mass of nanocatalysts could provide more active sites for pms or h2o2 activation chen et al 2020 importantly note that much lower catalyst loading is required for better performance in the case of catalytic membranes as compared to that in the bulk solution asif et al 2022b however excessive loading could not further aid catalytic performance or even could pose detrimental effects to membrane performance surplus nanocatalyst sites on membrane surface could quench free radicals thus reducing available radicals for micropollutant degradation zhang et al 2022a in addition increased loading amount increases membrane thickness consequently lowering the membrane permeance meng et al 2022a meng et al 2022b zhang et al 2023 previous studies demonstrated that abundant oxidant did not further help improve the removal efficiency asif et al 2022c chen et al 2020 in turn it is possible that leftover pms may react with itself and diminish its catalytic reactivity han et al 2022 li et al 2020a therefore oxidant dose and nanocatalyst loading should be carefully considered which are pivotal to achieve the optimal membrane performance economically 5 2 effects of ph water flux temperature and background impurities conflicting results regarding the effects of ph on the catalytic performance in nanoconfined membrane have been noticed in literature table 2 asif et al 2022b chen et al 2020 han et al 2022 zhang et al 2021d according to a study led by zhang s group a slight decrease in ranitidine removal 10 by co cu ons membrane pms system was witnessed when solution ph was changed from acidic ph 4 to neutral ph 8 meng et al 2022b wu et al stated that under basic condition the performance of the co1 go membrane was found to decline pcba removal was 71 7 and 40 6 at the ph of 3 5 and 9 5 respectively wu et al 2021 in a stark contrast the removal efficiency for tetracycline by the co n c confined pvdf membrane was affected at the acidic ph han et al 2022 these inconsistent results indicated that the influence of ph is rather complex strongly depending on the oxidants target pollutants as well as functional groups of nanocatalysts wang and wang 2020 zhang et al 2022a for example the low removal efficiency under acidic condition may be elucidated by the occurrence of excess h which would react with so4 thereby lowering the availability of free radicals wang et al 2022b meanwhile under alkaline condition so4 may react with abundant oh altering the main ros from so4 to oh consequently it might lead to a more effective degradation of pms resistant micropollutants but can also favor unwanted competitive reactions involving the non selective oh lee et al 2020 flux is an important factor as it determines the mass transfer of organic micropollutants through nanoconfined catalytic membrane some studies suggested that increased flux can reduce the retention time of catalytic reaction thus impacting the removal of micropollutants table 2 asif et al 2022c wang et al 2022c wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021d for example asif et al encountered a stable and complete removal efficiency of ranitidine when the applied transmembrane pressure tmp was less than 0 8 bar equivalent to a retention time of 80 ms however the removal sharply declined to 60 or even merely 20 at the tmp of 1 0 bar 65 ms and 1 2 bar 55 ms respectively asif et al 2022c the results were well supported by other work zhang et al 2021d which highlighted the decrease in the removal of pcba from 100 to approximately 60 corresponding to the water flux of 75 lmh and 150 lhm respectively many previous works indicated that the increase in temperature enhances the removal efficiency of micropollutants in nanoconfined catalytic membrane table 2 chen et al reported a faster degradation of 4 chlorophenol at elevated temperature with pseudo first order kinetic raised from 0 0818 min 1 to 0 1427 min 1 corresponding to the temperature of 25 to 45 c chen et al 2020 similarly the increase in temperature from 25 to 45 c could help reach 100 removal of ibuprofen ibp by the ni co encapsulated n doped cnt pvdf membrane pms system kang et al 2019 this trend is also similar to a recent finding han et al 2022 in which rapid degradation rate of tetracycline hydrochloride was observed at 45 c than that at 25 c they achieved around 99 removal in 15 min at 45 c vs 45 min at 25 c this could be ascribed to the fact that pms activation via breaking bond cleavage is an endothermic reaction subsequently promoting ros production rate at higher temperature wang and wang 2018 similar to conventional aops the presence of anions can commonly affect the performance of membrane based nanoconfined catalysis asif et al 2022b han et al 2022 meng et al 2022b wang et al 2022b for example spiking the reaction media with 5 mm of sodium salts containing cl no3 and hco3 reduced the ranitidine elimination by 11 16 in the coal ldh pvdf pms system asif et al 2022b the inhibitory effects rendered by those anions albeit to a minor extent could be ascribed to several reasons including ph buffering radical quenching or the formation of less powerful radicals e g e 0 cl cl 2 03 v eqs 1 5 e0 co3 co3 2 1 59 v eqs 6 7 and e0 no3 no3 2 5 v eqs 8 10 lee et al 2020 wang and wang 2018 2020 1 cl so4 cl so4 2 2 cl cl cl2 3 2cl hso5 h so4 2 cl2 h2o 4 cl2 h2o hocl 5 cl hso5 so4 2 hocl 6 so4 hco3 so4 2 h co3 7 ho hco3 h2o co3 8 ho no3 oh no3 9 so4 no3 so4 2 no3 10 h2o eaq no3 2oh no2 5 3 influence of natural organic matter nom natural organic matter is a heterogeneous mixture comprised of thousands of organic molecules derived from biogeochemical processes as well as man made exercises ly et al 2019 ly et al 2020a the ubiquitous existence of nom in water bodies makes its interactions with treatment practices inevitable analogous to inorganic anions nom could lower the available concentration of ros thus reducing the catalytic reactivity for micropollutant elimination in aops lee et al 2020 wang and wang 2020 wang et al 2022b nonetheless this impact has been proven much more trivial in nanoconfined catalytic membranes than conventional aops wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021d zhang et al 2020b for example under similar conditions of 3 mm pms and 2 mgc l suwannee river nom degradation of 1 4 dioxane by the co1 go membrane was 94 5 which is almost double to that achieved by co1 go flakes 57 in suspension solution wu et al 2021 the underlying mechanisms of enhanced pollutant removal efficiency by catalytic membrane could be attributed to the size exclusion capability of nanosized channels or nanopores that restrict the passage of nom especially ones with high molecular weight as a result it minimizes the competition of nom with pms and with micropollutants for activated sites and ros respectively which is well recognized as the major hurdle to avoid the inhibition of the reactivity of aops in addition wu and co workers also witnessed the nanoconfined co1 go membrane pms could alleviate membrane fouling by decomposing nom foulant adsorbed on membrane surface wu et al 2021 to date the interplays between nom and membrane based nanoconfined catalysis have been merely explored using only the reference standard and it is still unclear whether the novel concept can be applicable for real water as the underlying mechanisms of nom interaction with the membrane based nanoconfined catalysis remain largely unknown few questions that require answers include which constituents of nom could be more preferentially degraded what are the associated transformation pathways during the process whether the unique configuration of nanoconfined catalytic membrane could help mitigate the membrane fouling with more complex and heterogenous structure of dom in surface and wastewater the information is critical to warrant the quality of the treated water for real application 6 conclusion and future outlook it is a well documented fact that micropollutants are ubiquitous in freshwater posing a significant threat to aquatic ecosystem and potentially human health to address this issue advanced oxidation processes aops have been employed for effective micropollutant removal from water and wastewater however owing to their inherent limitations conventional aops particularly heterogenous aops could not be scaled up recently the concept of membrane based nanoconfined catalysis whereby a reaction is allowed to take place in small nano spaces or nanopores has been utilized to overcome the limitations of conventional heterogenous catalysis this review attempts to discuss the recent progress in membrane based nanoconfined heterogeneous catalysis for enhanced oxidant activation fast reaction kinetics and effective micropollutant destruction a systematic survey of the available literature consistently suggests that membrane based nanoconfined catalysis always achieves fast reaction kinetics that is a few orders of magnitude faster as compared to conventional aop reactors outstanding removal of a range of micropollutants by membrane based nanoconfined catalysis has been accredited to the changes in reaction dynamics under confinement that promotes diffusion of reactants to desired locations sites and strong electronic interactions between nanocatalysts and oxidant as well as reactive oxygen species ros and micropollutants according to literature density functional theory dft could be used as a powerful tool to elucidate the preferential adsorption behavior and or reaction pathway of oxidant which is critical to understand reaction dynamics under nanoconfinement it could be argued that the methods of membrane fabrication for nanoconfined catalysis such as nanocatalyst immobilization vacuum filtration assisted assembly and in situ growth of nanocatalyst within membrane pores govern the pore size and pore structure consequently affecting the efficacy removal and water permeance of the membrane based nanoconfined catalysis systems irrespective of the fabrication method membrane based nanoconfined catalysis systems have been observed to achieve effective micropollutant removal as long as the reactions are executed at nanoscale preferably below the nanopore size of 20 nm nanopores careful loading amount of nanocatalysts on membrane template should be made to achieve desired removal of micropollutants without compromising water permeance of membrane filtration when considering the effect of operating conditions it is observed that the required oxidant dose in the case of membrane confined catalysis system is often lower than conventional aop reactors importantly influence of water matrix especially dom on the performance of membrane confined catalytic systems is not as pronounced as in conventional aop reactors the contents of this review are arranged and presented to provide a complete picture by providing conflicting results and opinions which opens new avenue for future research notwithstanding the impressive results it is apparent that the development and membrane based nanoconfined heterogenous catalysis systems are still in its inception phase therefore several future research areas are suggested here since nanoconfinement allows the occurrence of many interesting counterintuitive phenomena that are not observed under batch mode theoretical understandings of the physicochemical features of nanoconfined catalysis supported by experimental findings are required for example what governs the driving force of mass transfer under confinement what is significance of hydrogen bonding or capillary pressure on the nanofluidic behavior of membranes how do the electronic interactions occur between catalysts oxidants and pollutants by membrane based nanoconfined catalysis how is the decomposition of oxidant to ros affected by the extent of nanoconfinement how could the different reactive planes of nanocatalyst be grown under confinement how does the extent of confinement dictate ros generation and contribution what is the transformation and mineralization rate of the target pollutants during the nanoconfined condition especially in comparison to those by traditional catalytic processes the development of state of the art techniques to achieve precise tuning of the nanoscale domain in the catalytic membranes is of vital importance in contrast an overly small space e g less than 0 4 nm is likely to become a barrier against the entrance of target pollutant molecules which is expected to inevitably cause significant adverse effects on the permeability and catalytic performance of catalytic membrane it is commonly reported and considered that development of new nanomaterials or nanocatalysts is pivotal to expand understanding and practical application of catalytic membranes in water treatment some materials of interest may include metal oxide single atoms and or carbon based materials these materials have shown promising results and should be further developed and studied before moving on to new materials alternatively mofs and cofs have been understudied in literature and thus their inherent merits of specific pore size and uniform channels could pave a way for new generation of membrane based nanoconfined catalysis with respect to the fact that tight spatial confinement can significantly improve reaction kinetics and efficiency the coupling of nanoconfinement to external fields such as electro or photo energies can be explored through reactor design and systems engineering which may further facilitate in enhancing the desirability of confined catalysis taking the electric field as an example the difference in the interaction between pollutant molecules with different charged properties could be explored and the electrocatalytic membrane is likely to change the applicable scale of the confinement effect of the nanochannel and then change some intrinsic properties of the membrane such as flux and catalytic efficiency to make it viable for practical water treatment applications there is a huge knowledge gap between real world applications of environmental remediation strategies and simplified laboratory scale nanoconfined catalytic membrane systems and the impact of real water wastewater at pilot scale has been paid insufficient attention for example how does the presence of catalysts and nom affect permeability and membrane fouling could the novel concept be beneficial for membrane fouling mitigation in general in addition the operational cost of the membrane based nanoconfined heterogeneous catalysis vs conventional aops should be also evaluated at pilot scale even though the membrane based nanoconfined heterogeneous catalysis could save a lot of catalyst dose less than one twentieth and oxidant dose 15 compared with conventional aops using only the reference standard at laboratory scale due to the heterogeneous structure and complexity of nom it is highly recommended that further investigation should be carried out using real nom aided with advanced nom analyses to warrant the success of membrane based confined catalysis for real water treatment finally most applications of dft have by far focused on pms and more works involving other oxidants such as pds and h2o2 in various catalytic membranes should be carried out to address the gap in knowledge which could bring broad implications for environmental science and

15131,progress in heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes aops is hampered by several issues including mass transfer limitation limited diffusion of short lived reactive oxygen species ros aggregation of nanocatalysts and loss of nanocatalysts to treated water these issues have been addressed in recent studies by executing the heterogeneous aops in confinement especially in the nanopores of catalytic membranes under nanoconfinement preferably at the length of less than 25 nm the oxidant nanocatalyst interaction ros micropollutant interaction and diffusion of ros have been observed to significantly improve which results in enhanced ros yield and mass transfer improved reaction kinetics and reduced matrix effect as compared to conventional heterogenous aop configuration given the significance of nanoconfinement effect this study presents a critical review of the current status of membrane based nanoconfined heterogeneous catalysis system for the first time a succinct

conflicting arguments opinions which provides critical information on the viability of these strategies and future research directions to show the desirability and applicability of membrane based nanoconfined catalysis systems performance governing factors including operating conditions and water matrix effect are particularly focused finally this review presents a systematic account of the

nations 2014 the depletion of freshwater has been further exacerbated by water pollution caused by rapid economic development and urbanization worldwide ly et al 2019 patel et al 2020 although wastewater reclamation has been considered as the frontline strategy for sustainable water management effective removal of recalcitrant water contaminants such as pharmaceuticals pesticides endocrine disrupting chemicals ingredients of personal care products makes it challenging to warrant the successful implementation of this concept michael kordatou et al 2015 given their toxicity to living organisms after prolonged exposure kovalakova et al 2020 nguyen et al 2022b and their persistent presence in aquatic environments paíga et al 2019 wilkinson et al 2022 yang et al 2017 these recalcitrant contaminants are commonly regarded as hazardous emerging micropollutants a survey of the river waters in three highly urbanization cities of beijing changzhou and shenzhen highlighted the notable occurrence of several emerging micropollutants including sulfadimethoxide indomethacin sulpridie and atenolol at a median concentration of 164 ng l 50 9 ng l 77 3 ng l and 52 9 ng l respectively wang et al 2015 similarly the sum of four paraben metabolites concentration in the new york city wastewater effluent was reported to range from 2060 to 2550 ng l wang and kannan 2016 in another very recent study after examining 258 rivers in 104 nations the most contaminated river sites were de facto located in low to middle income countries for instance the highest concentration of pharmaceuticals was over 700 000 ng l in the samples collected from the river located in the lahore city of pakistan wilkinson et al 2022 non biodegradability and heterogeneous complex structure make micropollutants recalcitrant to conventional water treatment processes al qarni et al 2016 wang and kannan 2016 yang et al 2017 in that manner membrane based filtration has been recognized as an efficient technology for effective rejection of pollutants to produce potable water werber et al 2016 an ideal membrane should possess strong mechanical resistance thin selective layer high throughput and consistent selectivity ly et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a currently although membrane filtration is mostly available in commercial market the popularity of membrane technology has still been constrained from the well known compromise among permeability selectivity stability and energy consumption su et al 2020 ying et al 2017 so far only ultrafiltration uf and nanofiltration nf membranes have advantages of low energy cost and greater water production rate liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021d nevertheless reducing the pore size of uf and nf may achieve rejection of low molecular weight lmw organic contaminants at the expense of water flux liu et al 2021 additionally rejection obviously results in the substantial accumulation of the recalcitrant pollutants in the concentrate posing concerns for its subsequent release into the surrounding environment aftab et al 2021 maeng et al 2018 conventional advanced oxidation processes aops have been proposed as a potent solution as they have been observed to display good performance for the removal of organic micropollutants based on the generation of reactive oxygen species ros of those hydroxyl radical oh is one of the most powerful oxidants which could unselectively break down micropollutants or even may lead to complete mineralization mameda et al 2017 trellu et al 2018 wang and wang 2018 recently sulfate radicals based aops have gained recognition due to the high redox potential of sulfate radicals so4 e 0 so4 so4 2 2 6 3 1 v e 0 oh oh 1 9 2 7 v lee et al 2020 wang and wang 2020 advances in heterogeneous aops using nanocatalysts could aid in enhanced elimination of micropollutants due to their higher stability better acclimatization to environmental changes e g ph and better reusability than traditional homogeneous aops chen et al 2019 chu et al 2021 wang et al 2021b in spite of the merits the practical application of aops in water pollution remediation has been still limited by their low activation efficiency and inefficient utilization of radicals possibly owing to the mass transfer limitation as well as the short lifetime of oh 1 μs and so4 30 40 μs in water the other limitations of nanocatalysts include severe agglomeration breakage under shear stress induced by stirring and low recovery of nanomaterials in conventional batch mode suspension systems meng et al 2022a wang et al 2021b apart from that it is important to note that the loss of nanomaterials to treated water could cause severe health problems and environment concerns ly et al 2020a wang et al 2016 which requires an extra step to separate them from the solution one straightforward strategy to solve the conundrum in either membrane filtration or aops is to precisely immobilize nanocatalysts on a membrane platform not only does such approach help reduce the leakage of nanocatalysts but it could also improve the degradation of micropollutants by enhancing the mass transfer of short lived reactive species under the phenomenon spatial confinement effect the core principle is to control the distance among the micropollutants catalyst surface and oxidant under a certain length at nanoscale preferably 25 nm where the reaction mostly occurs qian et al 2020 zhang et al 2021c zhang et al 2020b by adopting nanosized spatial restriction a significantly higher removal of organic micropollutants has been achieved by heterogeneous catalytic membrane as compared to that in bulk solution for example in situ nucleation of cobalt nanocatalysts within 2d hexagon boron nitride nanosheet h bnns intralayer network permitted outstanding removal of the pharmaceutical ranitidine 99 with an ultrafast degradation rate 80 ms far exceeding the removal achieved by polyvinylidene fluoride peroxymonosulfate pms system and pms only 5 asif et al 2022c with feocl nanocatalysts confined within the 20 nm pores of a ceramic membrane the fenton like heterogeneous catalytic membrane could completely degrade various organic pollutants 100 within a retention time of 10 s zhang et al 2021d similar observation could be found elsewhere e g cobalt single atom co1 graphene oxide go polyethersulfone pes wu et al 2021 co3o4 ns cellulose acetate ca wang et al 2021b coal layered double hydroxide ldh ns pvdf asif et al 2022b and β feooh pvdf zhang et al 2021a notwithstanding a consensus of increased availability of reactive species for oxidation reactions among the previously reported gaging the potential of spatial nano confinement effect in catalytic membrane for industrial applications is still challenging because the concept has not been clearly defined and the underlying mechanisms have not been well recognized unlike conventional catalytic membranes nanoconfined heterogeneous catalytic membrane requires a strict design i e the space in the membrane template that hosts nanocatalysts should be precisely controlled at a nanometer scale to achieve desired chemical reactions nonetheless the exact length scale has not been well specified in fact although a recent study claimed that the optimal length scale for nanoconfined catalysis should be less than 25 nm the membrane pore size of 200 300 nm was still able to generate about a two order of magnitude higher decomposition rate of para chlorobenzoic acid pcba zhang et al 2020b and or 2 4 dichlorophenol dcp zhang et al 2021b as compared to that in bulk solution as the definition of nanoconfinement effect is still ambiguous this review considers all catalytic membrane structure in which the reaction occurs at a space of less than 200 nm additionally special attention is given to the catalytic membrane designed to execute the catalytic reaction at less than 25 nm scale besides the removal efficiency is also dependent on other governing factors such as catalyst loading amount inherent characteristics of materials and water matrix effects e g ph background impurities natural organic matter nom this review elucidates and presents opinions on the formation of major ros as well as the mechanisms of pms and or peroxide activation pollutant degradation pathway and background constituent due to the availability of literature the scope of this review is intentionally restricted to heterogeneous h2o2 pms and peroxydisulfate pds based aops with limited discussion on photo and electro based catalytic membrane processes till date to our best knowledge there has been no previous article that comprehensively discussed the membrane based nanoconfined heterogeneous catalysis systems for water pollution control particularly in the context of nanoconfinement effect accordingly this critical review aims to address the gap of knowledge by covering five sections including 1 to provide fundamental understanding of nanoconfinement effect in nanomaterials 2 to identify the unique properties of membrane based nanoconfined catalysis vs bulk solution and membrane filtration 3 to discuss synthesis of nanoconfined catalytic membranes 4 to elucidate and debate the effects of operating conditions on the efficacy of such nanoconfined systems and finally 5 to provide a roadmap for the future research 2 general fundamentals of nanoconfinement effect on catalysis the concept of spatial confinement was first introduced by rothenberger and grätzel who witnessed the changes in reaction rate when reactants were confined in a small volume rothenberger and grätzel 1989 over the past decades the expansion of studies on nanomaterials and nanotechnology have generated capacious opportunities to open up the prospect to reinvestigate thermodynamics and kinetics of numerous processes at the nanoscale providing further novel approach for a myriad of applications noticeable awareness has been drawn on the spatial restriction of particles molecules and ions on the order of one or several nanometers as the results from literature concur that these matters feature unprecedented physicochemical behaviors as compared to that in bulk solution qian et al 2020 for instance cicero and co workers observed the formation of ordered water layers near the surface of confining materials and disordered bulk like internal region in which water density hydrogen bonds and the molecular orientation are different than those in bulk water fig 1 a cicero et al 2008 further understanding of nanoconfinement effects on molecules particles and ions could be found in previously published reviews qian et al 2020 shen et al 2021 shifa and vomiero 2019 zhang et al 2021c in light of heterogeneous catalysis nanoconfinement effect is likely to alter chemical reactions such as reaction rate reaction selectivity or even unprecedented reaction pathway li et al 2017 xiao et al 2015 yang et al 2019 for example the confinement of fe nanoparticles nps inside carbon nanotubes resulted in an increase of 1 5 fold and 2 fold in co conversion and c5 hydrocarbons yield respectively as compared to that adsorbed on the outer surface fig 1b chen et al 2008 compared to pt loading on substrate surface a 3 fold increase in aromatic intermediate products was likewise detected after embedding pt catalyst within carbon nanofibers solomonsz et al 2013 yang et al reported the removal rate of methyl blue dye by fenton like heterogeneous catalysis employing fe2o3 nps loaded inside carbon nanotubes was 22 5 times faster than its unconfined counterpart difference in confinement structure could alter degradation pathways due to difference in the generation of ros for instance only the singlet oxygen 1o2 was generated by the system employing fe2o3 nps loaded inside carbon nanotubes while only oh formation was observed when the fe2o3 nps were loaded on carbon nanotube surface fig 1c d yang et al 2019 the enhanced degradation rate under spatial nanoconfinement could be elucidated by the effective electron transfer between nanocatalysts and host substrate smaller size of nanocatalysts due to space restriction and enrichment of reactants inside host substrate as well as higher diffusion rate of molecules inside confined channels pan and bao 2011 qian et al 2020 zhang et al 2021c nonetheless the encapsulation of nanocatalysts is not always beneficial for catalysis because it could block or inhibit the chemical reactions guo et al 2010 xiao et al 2017 implying that the nature of nanocatalysts and host substrate together with their mutual interactions could play an important role on catalytic efficiency such contrasting findings advocate the need to develop tools that could effectively examine the nanoconfinement effects for rational design of catalytic systems xiao and co workers introduced the concept of confinement energy using density functional theory dft calculations by combining the approximation and real experiments the study reported the downshift of d band states of the confined fe within cnt channels consequently weakening the adsorption of molecules such as co n2 and o2 on encapsulated fe clusters for instance the consistent lower dissociative binding energy of co gaseous molecules in fe in cnt 1 ev co than that in fe out cnt 2 84 ev co allowed the dissociatively adsorbed co species easier to react with h2 fischer tropsch process enhancing further co adsorption as well as higher reactivity of fe in cnt thus the confined space of cnts enhanced catalytic activities of the confined fe toward these molecules as compared to the unconfined condition xiao et al 2015 similarly dft calculations displayed a weak adsorption of atoms and molecules on the pt 111 surface under the confinement by 2d graphene monolayer the weakened c o bond in co governed by the electronic interaction between the top graphene overlayer and the molecules of confined co could promote co oxidation by the encapsulated pt li et al 2017 while the general concept of nanoconfinement effects has been recognized it appears that the mechanisms and efficacy largely depend on specific systems and targeted purposes posing numerous difficulties and uncertainties to interpret confinement based strategies in this study the removal degradation mechanisms of micropollutants under confinement by heterogenous catalytic membrane have been discussed for the first time in this regard the basic principles stemmed from similar physical and chemical fundamentals of nanoconfinement effects are considered alongside with dft approximations 3 unique properties of nanoconfined catalytic membranes vs conventional catalytic processes in bulk solution 3 1 reaction kinetics and removal efficiency there has been an agreement that nanoconfined catalytic membranes greatly prevail either conventional aops or membrane filtration in terms of micropollutant removal efficiency fig 2 for example less than 9 of the dye orange ii was removed by the pristine pvdf membrane which is significantly less than that removed by s n doped fe pvdf membrane pms system above 95 removal yao et al 2017 in a similar manner only a negligible removal less than 5 of pcba by pristine feocl membrane was observed after long term operation of 5 h possibly due to oversaturation of adsorptive sites on the contrary the feocl membrane h2o2 system maintained more than 95 pcba at the water flux of 100 l m2 h zhang et al 2021d additionally a handful of studies reported improvement in degradation kinetics of organic micropollutants by nanoconfined catalytic membranes fig 2a for example zhang et al reported an increase of 820 fold in the pseudo first order rate constant of pcba by the catalytic feocl membrane with a pore size of 20 nm i e 4 93 10 2 s 1 compared to that of the batch feocl h2o2 system zhang et al 2020b similarly a significant enhancement in dcp removal kinetic constants was observed for mn3o4 loaded channel size of 200 300 nm 40 70 nm and 20 nm with 200 times 1 8 10 3 s 1 500 times 4 2 10 3 s 1 and even 4000 times 3 5 10 2 s 1 respectively higher than that in the same batch reaction 5 4 10 4 min 1 zhang et al 2021b using ranitidine as a probe micropollutant meng and co workers witnessed a significant enhancement in the degradation rate i e 63 600 min 1 which is 5 7 orders of magnitude faster than that obtained by other traditional catalytic methods in bulk solution i e 0 0032 0 33 min 1 meng et al 2022a in another study the first order rate constant for ranitidine in the co cu oxide nanosheets osn membrane pms system was 0 053 ms 1 which was significantly higher than that achieved by the conventional catalytic batch systems including co cu ons pms system 0 07 s 1 and pms alone 1 39 10 4 s 1 meng et al 2022b using nanoconfined cobalt functionalized graphitic carbon nitride co g c3n4 membrane pms a very recent work also witnessed a degradation rate constant of ranitidine of 0 08 ms 1 which was 4 6 orders of magnitude higher than that in batch mode of co g c3n4 suspension pms or pms alone zhang et al 2023 also mentioned is the markedly enhanced removal of several organic micropollutants by controlled catalytic reactions within the nanoconfined membrane fig 2b demonstrating the general applicability of the membrane based nanoconfined catalysis system in water treatment for example a complete removal i e 100 for a set of organic micropollutants such as bisphenol a 2 4 dichlorophenol sulfamethoxazole 17α ethinylestradiol and atrazine was observed in a heterogeneous fenton like catalytic system using the feocl confined ceramic membrane at a flux of 90 lmh the feocl membrane h2o2 outperformed both the pristine feocl membrane and pristine ceramic membrane h2o2 system zhang et al 2021d in another study honeycomb like co3o4 ns membrane pms system achieved high removal for the selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products as well as dyes and phenols showing 100 95 96 100 100 100 92 and 100 removal for tetracycline hydrochloride carbamazepine sulfamethizole methyl orange rhodamine b methylene blue bisphenol a and phenol respectively importantly the removal of these micropollutants was significantly lower in the pms only 10 and conventional co3o4 membrane pms 30 systems wang et al 2021b similar trends were also found elsewhere asif et al 2022c meng et al 2022a zhang et al 2023 apparently nanoconfined catalytic membranes exhibited better performance for the remediation of recalcitrant micropollutants than the conventional heterogeneous catalytic systems in terms of the general applicability according to available literature discussed above different nanomaterial based catalytic membranes have been examined mainly for pms activation the as prepared membranes for nanoconfined catalysis have been observed to achieve a permeate flux of up to 300 lmh fig 2c while the water permeance of above 500 lmh has been reported for co tpml membrane pms system and co bnns membrane pms system fig 2c without the expanse of micropollutant removal regardless of water permeance that directly impacts retention contact time the membrane confined catalysis system could achieve 90 100 removal destruction of micropollutants in continuous flow operating mode 3 2 pollutant removal mechanisms in nanoconfined catalytic membrane it is believed that the outstanding removal efficacies of micropollutants by membrane based nanoconfined catalysis could be elucidated by its particular configuration which is likely constructed of hybrid materials endowed with new physicochemical properties consequently leading to the changes in ros enrichment of reactants more effective diffusion and reactions of ros with target pollutants and stronger electronic interactions transfer at nanoscales fig 3 the unique structure of nanoconfined space within a catalytic membrane could alter the generation of reactive species for enhanced pollutant removal as compared to conventional aops for example a greater contribution of superoxide o2 oh and 1o2 in the overall degradation by nanoconfined catalytic membranes has been reported fig 3a for instance a study led by zhang s group found that the addition of methanol oh and so4 quencher reduced ranitidine degradation by 46 4 while tba oh quencher introduction was found to slightly reduce less than 10 ranitidine degradation by coal ldh pvdf pms system the results suggested that so4 is the primary ros for ranitidine degradation on the other hand the addition of 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone hydrochloride temp could lead to a significant reduction in ranitidine removal 21 asif et al 2022b indicating 1o2 could play a similar role as oh albeit lower redox potential of the former interestingly this nonradical is not commonly found kohantorabi et al 2021 lu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022a or merely play a minor role in ldh pms based conventional aop systems guo et al 2020 similarly other studies demonstrated that 1o2 was one of the major contributors to micropollutant degradation in the pms activated systems such as co bnns membrane pms system asif et al 2022c mn3o4 nanodots g c3n4 nss membrane chen et al 2020 and co g c3n4 membrane pms zhang et al 2023 in contrast in the batch mode 1o2 may not play a significant role in micropollutant degradation indeed in the conventional co3o4 ns pms system wang et al 2022a and mn3o4 pms system wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 micropollutant degradation was achieved via radical pathways and the systematic experiments suggested negligible contribution of the nonradical 1o2 some studies suggested that the improved removal of organic pollutants by membrane based nanoconfined catalysis could be explained by the enriched concentration of ros at the nanoscale domain fig 3b zhang and co workers investigated the pcba decomposition behavior in the fe3o4 functionalized anodized aluminum oxide membrane h2o2 system with different membrane pore sizes i e 200 300 110 150 40 70 20 30 and 20 nm and found that the kinetics of pcba decomposition was correlated exponentially with the reduced membrane pore size based on model simulation this research demonstrated that the highest concentration of oh was produced within the pore size of 25 nm in addition with the increase in pore size oh concentration and diffusion dropped sharply fig 3b as such this particular length scale is highly recommended to prevent the diffusion and mass transfer limitation of short lived ros which is a commonly known drawback of conventional batch aop systems zhang et al 2020b these findings are in good agreement with that obtained using the feocl loaded ceramic membrane h2o2 system compared to a mere concentration 0 036 pm in bulk solution catalytic feocl membrane with a pore size of 20 nm was observed to achieve a steady state oh concentration of 44 6 pm zhang et al 2021d in a recent study enhanced removal of 1 4 dioxane was obtained by cobalt single atom co1 intercalated go membrane pms system this was also attributed to nanoconfinement effect induced by the nanosized water channels 3 5 nm of co1 go membrane fig 3c wu et al 2021 similarly 2d co tiox based membrane could effectively produce 1o2 so4 and oh within its 4 6 å interlayer free spacing and thus significantly enhancing the catalytic performance at the angstrom confined scale meng et al 2022a it is noteworthy that an improved generation of ros may not directly translate into enhanced micropollutant degradation due to mass transfer limitations it has been suggested that the spatial confinement may promote the interactions between ros and micropollutants due to the high diffusion from the center to the boundary of the confined space for example the intercalation of transitional metals metal oxides such as co mn and fe nanomaterials nms within 2d nss or membrane nano pores generally can increase specific surface area sbet and expand the available pore volume vpore of the nanoreactors asif et al reported an increase in sbet from 8 5 m2 g pristine bnns membrane to 14 1 m2 g co bnns membrane asif et al 2022c in another study in situ preparation of feocl nms within membrane pores significantly expanded the surface area available for reaction in the pores of the catalytic feocl ceramic membrane and offered numerous unsaturated fe sites for enhanced catalysis zhang et al 2021d ye et al prepared the 1d 2d fexoy a so called zif mil confined within go nanosheets they found that at the zif mil ratio of 20 1 the lawn structured membrane system had the highest sbet and the largest vpore of 426 89 m2 g and 0 77 m3 g respectively and achieved excellent norfloxacin removal 99 4 in 40 min by pms activation ye et al 2021a apparently such changes in physical parameters of nanoreactors are expected to provide more reactive sites and increase the collision probability between ros and organic micropollutants li et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a additional benefit of a nanoscale domain is to prevent agglomeration and breakage of nms that often occur in conventional configuration due to high surface tension and stirring respectively li et al 2022 moreover unlike the batch mode in which the nanocatalyst can be freely suspended the flow through systems of nanoconfined catalytic membrane propel a thorough contact of target pollutants with the reactive sites of nanocatalyst wu et al 2021 some studies suggested that spatial confinement of metal metal oxide at a nanoscale especially those containing oxygen vacancies ov could further aid catalytic reactions because ov could prompt the redox cycle between metaln and metaln 1 promote the mobility of surface oxygen and improve the efficiency of electron transfer for pms activation fig 3d asif et al 2022b kang et al 2019 meng et al 2022b ye et al 2021a ye et al 2021b for example ye et al observed the enrichment of ov content in zif mils 20 which could be deciphered for the removal of norfloxacin by this heterogeneous catalytic membrane pms system ye et al 2021a meanwhile encapsulated ni co nps could excite electrons to enrich the charge density on the outer n doped carbon nanotubes which resulted in the enhanced pms activation by the associated nanoconfined catalytic membrane kang et al 2019 interestingly those aforementioned mechanisms could be effectively predicted on a quantitative basis via dft calculations fig 3e and f for instance dft calculations illustrated the enlargement of o o bond l o o and s o bond l s o of pms after interaction with nanocatalyst at nanoscale which is an indicator for pms decomposition into ros asif et al observed the increase in l o o in the pms molecules from 1 356 å to 1 466 å following its adsorption on co bnns membrane asif et al 2022c more importantly the smaller spatial confinement was the higher the stretch in bond length a recent finding witnessed the stretch of s o bond from 1 905 å to 2 105 å and 2 121 å at the interlayer free spacing of 50 å and 8 å respectively in the case of co tiox membrane moreover once pms was angstrom confined within the channel size of 4 6 å stretch in the s o bond further increased which inferred the readiness of pms for dissociation meng et al 2022a much like the above observation a correlation between the stretch of o o and s o bonds within interlayer free spacing could also be found in the heterogeneous catalytic co cu ons membrane pms system meng et al 2022b compared to the l o o 1 330 å and l s o 1 900 å of pms co cu ons membrane interaction with pms in the peak pore size of 2 45 nm increased the l o o and l s o of pms to 1 405 å and 1 964 å respectively further decrease in the interlayer free spacing to 0 79 nm led to the cleavage of the l o o and an increase in l s o to 2 015 å meng et al 2022b as a rule of thumb this implies that pms molecules can be more readily activated to trigger the generation of ros such as so4 oh and 1o2 it is to be noted that cleavage of o o and s o bonds results in the formation of two radicals namely so4 and oh and a nonradical 1o2 in another example dft calculations unveiled the spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable dissociation of pms at small interlayer free spacings due to the stronger electrostatic interactions of pms with the nanocatalysts the adsorption energy e ads of pms increased from 0 82 to 3 96 ev when the interlayer free spacing decreased from 50 å to 4 6 å meng et al 2022a similarly the pms molecules adsorbed on the angstrom confined co cu ons membrane displayed a higher e ads value than that adsorbed on the nanoconfined counterpart showing an increase of eads from 7 84 ev to 8 74 ev corresponding with the interlayer free spacing of 2 45 nm and 0 79 nm respectively meng et al 2022b the above results suggested that the nanoconfined spaces within the 2d laminar membrane can significantly enhance the e ads of pms and thus yielding more radicals noticeably the e ads value 8 74 ev of pms within the interlayer free spacing of co cu ons were consistently higher than that for pms adsorbed on the surface of co cu ons 7 80 ev meng et al 2022b confirming more potential generation of ros within nanoconfined spaces rather than that at the surface of nanocatalysts in suspension despite the superior performance of membrane based nanoconfined catalysis over batch mode for water treatment still there has been a lot of gaps in knowledge in elucidation and comparison the formation and identification of ros as well as their corresponding reaction pathways with different targeted pollutants between the membrane based nanoconfined catalysis and catalysis in suspension especially in a quantitative manner with the aid of dft to further untangle the mechanisms between the duo 3 2 1 molecular transport mechanisms in terms of 2d membrane go was the first that has been extensively studied to understand the molecular transport phenomenon through nanoconfined space fig 4 nair and co workers witnessed ultrafast water permeation through a go membrane under pervaporation more precisely the rate of water permeation was found at least 10 fold higher than that of helium and was several magnitudes higher than that predicted by conventional diffusion behavior fig 4a nair et al 2012 this phenomenon was possibly ascribed to large capillary force 1000 bar and frictionless flow of water molecules through the sub nm pores of graphene oxide i e 4 6 å radha et al 2016 other unusual phenomena such as ultra dense packing of ions drastic changes in diffusion coefficients etc in the confined space have also been found elsewhere fig 4b cheng et al 2018 zheng et al 2017 in a further attempt meng and co workers examined the effect of nanoconfinement on the transport of water molecules through the co tiox membrane with different interlayer free spacings 0 46 2 5 3 5 and 5 0 nm by molecular dynamics md calculations fig 4c d they found that the diffusion of water molecules to the surface of co tiox nanosheets can be much easier with the decreasing interlayer free spacing and the hydrogen bonding interaction between water molecules and co tiox nanosheets becomes much stronger at smaller interlayer spacings especially at 4 6 å which could effectively facilitate the diffusion process within the angstrom scale nanochannels and thus improving the catalytic reactions meng et al 2022a evidence of water transport phenomenon under pressure driven mode in nanomaterial modified membranes such as nano catalysts immobilized within membrane pores or embedded within polymeric membrane matrix is yet to be found as widely recognized in many excellent literature review esfahani et al 2019 ren et al 2021 wang et al 2021a 4 preparation of nanoconfined catalytic membranes the preparation of nanoconfined catalytic membrane could be constructed by three common routes including immobilization of nanocatalysts on membrane surface in situ growth of nanocatalysts on within membrane pores and loading nanocatalysts within membrane matrix fig 5 4 1 controlling spatial nanoconfinement in 2d laminar membrane the nanoscale spaces governed by intralayer and interlayer spacing in laminar membranes assembled from 2d materials can be an ideal platform to host the nanoconfined catalysis for water treatment as a result preparing transitional metal based 2d nanosheets or incorporation of metal oxides within 2d nanosheets based membranes such as graphene and its derivatives including go and rgo h bn mxenes transition metal dichalcogenides tmdcs as well as layered double hydroxides ldh appear to be a straightforward approach to control spatial nanoconfinement in 2d laminar membrane fig 5a b asif et al 2022a qing et al 2020 safaei et al 2020 sun and li 2018 wang et al 2020a go is perhaps the most extensively studied material due to its inherent physicochemical properties such as hydrophilicity high dispersity in aqueous solution and promising potential in large scale application upon filtration 2d go layers are formed on the membrane surface in the form of layer by layer stacking of nanosheets with the interlayer spacing of 9 1 å in a dehydrated state this distance could expand up to a few nanometers 3 9 nm due to swelling when go is immersed in water su et al 2020 tao et al 2020 utilizing the sub nm pores free spacing of go nanosheet wang and co workers successfully introduced cobalt single atom co1 in the well stacked 2d layers to generate nanoconfined heterogeneous catalysis for 1 4 dioxane degradation wu et al 2021 in a similar fashion other studies confined metal based nanocatalysts or carbon based composites within the interlayer free spacing of go membrane for the removal of norfloxacin ye et al 2021a and sulfamethoxazole ye et al 2021b via pms activation structurally similar to graphene but with alternating boron and nitrogen atoms instead of carbon 2d h bnns have recently implemented to replace graphene derivatives due to its outstanding physicochemical properties pendse et al 2019 the intralayer spacing of h bnns is commonly found at 0 8 6 nm chen et al 2018 hafeez et al 2020 which could also provide an ideal niche for nanoconfined effects the in situ nucleation of cobalt nanocatalysts i e α co oh 2 and co3o4 within membrane intralayer network was introduced as a facile way to remove ranitidine by heterogeneous aops asif et al 2022c similarly some attempts to intercalate cobalt within 2d tiox meng et al 2022a and mn3o4 nanodots within 2d graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 chen et al 2020 for organic pollutant degradation have been reported as an effective strategy to utilize the potential of nanoconfined catalysis some other inorganic nanosheets such as ldh and co3o4 are also of interest in the fabrication of catalytic membranes asif and co workers synthesized coal ldh membrane with the d spacing corresponding to 003 and 006 planes of 7 68 å and 3 82 å respectively asif et al 2022b ly et al 2020c the interlayer spacings for the 111 220 and 311 planes in the hydrated co3o4 membrane were 0 49 nm 0 30 nm and 0 25 nm respectively wang et al 2022b wang et al 2021b the results of these studies indicated that the interlayer free spacing of the ldh membrane and co3o4 membrane without and with hydration remained comparable which suggested that water transport will occur through intralayer water channels indeed according to barrett joyner halenda bjh model the peak pore size of the ldh membrane and co3o4 membrane was 1 21 nm and 2 06 nm therefore the membrane prepared using nanocatalysts which could not be assembled into a laminar structure could also be employed for nanoconfined catalysis importantly in contrast to go membranes the pore size estimation of ldh membrane and metal oxide membrane requires attention and should ideally be estimated using pore size distribution models such as bjh and examining the rejection of model pollutants of known size to date it seems that the application of nanoconfined catalytic laminar membranes for water treatment has been merely at its early phase for example because their interlayer spacing ranges between 0 615 nm and 0 618 nm respectively xu et al 2017 mos2 and ws2 could also serve as ideal materials to prepare lamellar membrane for nanoconfined catalysis similarly transition metal carbides i e ti3c2tx in the mxene family could also be utilized for catalytic membrane application ascribed to its interlayer spacing of 6 4 å in the wet state ren et al 2015 moreover 2d mof cof for catalytic laminar membrane should also be paid more attention in future research meanwhile it is important to note that different incorporation strategies could also play a crucial role on the control of nanochannels structure for example tsou et al considered three different approaches i e pressure vacuum and evaporation assisted self assembly to prepare go membranes on a modified polyacrylonitrile mpan template the pressure approach resulted in highly ordered laminate while loose and less ordered go layers were formed on the mpan membrane surface in vacuum assisted strategy highly random order of go layers was noticed when go was deposited by evaporation at a controlled humidity tsou et al 2015 additionally interlayer intralayer spacing could be further tuned by various methods such as intercalating ion monomer and polymer cross linkers liu et al 2019 safaei et al 2020 nanomaterials ding et al 2017 xia et al 2016 ying et al 2017 zhang et al 2022b which can affect or enhance the overall performance of nanoconfined catalytic membranes therefore strategies of membrane fabrication to develop nanofluidic platform require to be considered in future research whereby enhanced permeability and degradation can be achieved concurrently 4 2 controlling spatial confinement within membrane pores immobilizing metal oxide based nanomaterials mof or cof within the pores of membrane skin layer or within the porous structures of membrane is widely adopted to execute nanoconfined catalysis in membrane filtration fig 5c d e over the past decades such nanoconfined composite membranes have been prepared by various preparation approaches including the contra diffusion and interfacial synthesis method li et al 2020b wang et al 2020b yin et al 2021 hydro solvothermal method deng et al 2019 lu et al 2021 shi et al 2019 dynamic filtration method lu et al 2020 wang et al 2018 and other in situ growth or immobilization methods gui et al 2012 lu et al 2021 ma et al 2021 wan et al 2017 wang et al 2018 zeng et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021d zhang et al 2020b regardless of the preparation methods literature claimed that any modification within membrane pore structure could directly alter the membrane performance probably due to the changes in tortuosity and porosity sun et al 2018 the effects of spatial confinement within membrane pores were apparent in recent findings which demonstrated the significant improvement in pollutant degradation by the catalytic membrane possessing nanosized pores more precisely degradation rate of pcba by catalytic feocl membrane with a pore size of 200 300 nm was approximately four times lower than that achieved by the catalytic feocl membrane with a pore size of 20 30 nm zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021d optimal loading rate and physicochemical properties of the embedded materials are regarded as a crucial factor determining overall efficiency of the nanoconfined composite membrane for instance at an excessive dose the agglomeration and or random distribution of the nano catalysts could block the passage of water molecules zhang et al 2021a or even result in some defects on membrane structure ma et al 2021 yin et al 2021 as a result careful selection of loading rate preparation methods as well as nanomaterials are highly desired to achieve optimum nanopore size in composite membrane for nanoconfined catalytic oxidation integrity and permeability besides the application of cof mof for nanoconfined catalytic membrane has been largely unexplored which can be an interesting topic for future research 4 3 controlling spatial confinement within mixed matrix membranes unlike immobilizing nano catalysts in membrane pores adding nanomaterials in the polymeric membrane matrix also known as mixed matrix membrane mmm could result in much more interaction between the two phases which can alter the intrinsic properties of the pristine membrane for example it is well recognized that hydrophilic nanomaterials could trigger diffusion rate between the solvent and the non solvent thus constructing a more porous membrane with larger pore sizes alpatova et al 2015 esfahani et al 2019 ly et al 2020b ly et al 2020c ying et al 2017 ideal mmms for heterogeneous catalysis should possess a porous structure with well defined finger like pore channels without macro voids this particular geometry permits a fast convective mass transport of the molecules to the active site of the catalyst for effective catalysis zeng et al 2018 incorporation of metal oxide based nano materials within membrane matrix via phase inversion could not only improve membrane performance but could also improve the removal rate of contaminants by adopting heterogeneous catalysis as evidenced by a handful of studies such as co n c han et al 2022 fe3o4 sio2 zhang et al 2019 fe2o3 alpatova et al 2015 fe n s co doped carbon yao et al 2017 cofe2o4 wang et al 2022c and zn cu fe o nguyen et al 2022a for example an inclusion of 20 wt of fe3o4 sio2 in the mixed matrix membrane broaden the membrane pore size from 95 4 nm to 151 2 nm consequently boosting removal rate of methyl blue dye from 30 to 94 6 by heterogeneous catalysis zhang et al 2019 in order to alleviate the aggregation of nanomaterials during long term operation ren and co workers introduced mof into mmm the uniform distribution of mil fe mof within membrane matrix with analogous membrane pore size of 2 nm improved the membrane permeance up to 222 lmh bar and achieved 75 removal of methyl blue by h2o2 based heterogeneous catalysis ren et al 2019 notwithstanding the promising results we argue that heterogeneous catalysis within mmms could result in a less effective oxidation compared to the immobilization methods found in the previous section because nano catalysts are covered surrounded by polymeric substances which could inhibit the direct contact between the oxidants such as pms and h2o2 and nano catalysts to generate reactive oxidants such as oh and so4 this argument is of significant interest to be explored in the forthcoming research besides despite the synergistic effects of adsorption and oxidation degradation in the catalytic mmms it is difficult to conclude any presence of nanoconfinement effects within catalytic mmm so far this gap in knowledge should be considered in the future studies furthermore lots of drawbacks are required to be tackled for successful implementation of mmms at industrial scale first loading rate and characteristics of modifying agents e g nanocatalysts transition metal based cof and mof should be optimized to avoid agglomeration and ensure the uniform distribution of nanocatalysts within membrane structures second the developed nano materials such as nps mof or cof should be compatible with polymeric membrane to minimize their leakage during operation thus strengthening the stability of mmms third base polymer for catalytic mmms should be resilient and high chemical resistance to prevent concerns over the membrane degradation by strong oxidants in addition their relative component in polymer solution should be taken into account as it could pose significant influence on the membrane structure and morphology during the phase inversion process esfahani et al 2019 ly et al 2020c 5 effects of operating conditions on membrane based nanoconfined catalysis 5 1 effects of catalyst loading and oxidant dosage typically increase in catalyst loading and or oxidant dosage is beneficial for catalytic performance of the membranes table 1 it is believed that higher loading mass of nanocatalysts could provide more active sites for pms or h2o2 activation chen et al 2020 importantly note that much lower catalyst loading is required for better performance in the case of catalytic membranes as compared to that in the bulk solution asif et al 2022b however excessive loading could not further aid catalytic performance or even could pose detrimental effects to membrane performance surplus nanocatalyst sites on membrane surface could quench free radicals thus reducing available radicals for micropollutant degradation zhang et al 2022a in addition increased loading amount increases membrane thickness consequently lowering the membrane permeance meng et al 2022a meng et al 2022b zhang et al 2023 previous studies demonstrated that abundant oxidant did not further help improve the removal efficiency asif et al 2022c chen et al 2020 in turn it is possible that leftover pms may react with itself and diminish its catalytic reactivity han et al 2022 li et al 2020a therefore oxidant dose and nanocatalyst loading should be carefully considered which are pivotal to achieve the optimal membrane performance economically 5 2 effects of ph water flux temperature and background impurities conflicting results regarding the effects of ph on the catalytic performance in nanoconfined membrane have been noticed in literature table 2 asif et al 2022b chen et al 2020 han et al 2022 zhang et al 2021d according to a study led by zhang s group a slight decrease in ranitidine removal 10 by co cu ons membrane pms system was witnessed when solution ph was changed from acidic ph 4 to neutral ph 8 meng et al 2022b wu et al stated that under basic condition the performance of the co1 go membrane was found to decline pcba removal was 71 7 and 40 6 at the ph of 3 5 and 9 5 respectively wu et al 2021 in a stark contrast the removal efficiency for tetracycline by the co n c confined pvdf membrane was affected at the acidic ph han et al 2022 these inconsistent results indicated that the influence of ph is rather complex strongly depending on the oxidants target pollutants as well as functional groups of nanocatalysts wang and wang 2020 zhang et al 2022a for example the low removal efficiency under acidic condition may be elucidated by the occurrence of excess h which would react with so4 thereby lowering the availability of free radicals wang et al 2022b meanwhile under alkaline condition so4 may react with abundant oh altering the main ros from so4 to oh consequently it might lead to a more effective degradation of pms resistant micropollutants but can also favor unwanted competitive reactions involving the non selective oh lee et al 2020 flux is an important factor as it determines the mass transfer of organic micropollutants through nanoconfined catalytic membrane some studies suggested that increased flux can reduce the retention time of catalytic reaction thus impacting the removal of micropollutants table 2 asif et al 2022c wang et al 2022c wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021d for example asif et al encountered a stable and complete removal efficiency of ranitidine when the applied transmembrane pressure tmp was less than 0 8 bar equivalent to a retention time of 80 ms however the removal sharply declined to 60 or even merely 20 at the tmp of 1 0 bar 65 ms and 1 2 bar 55 ms respectively asif et al 2022c the results were well supported by other work zhang et al 2021d which highlighted the decrease in the removal of pcba from 100 to approximately 60 corresponding to the water flux of 75 lmh and 150 lhm respectively many previous works indicated that the increase in temperature enhances the removal efficiency of micropollutants in nanoconfined catalytic membrane table 2 chen et al reported a faster degradation of 4 chlorophenol at elevated temperature with pseudo first order kinetic raised from 0 0818 min 1 to 0 1427 min 1 corresponding to the temperature of 25 to 45 c chen et al 2020 similarly the increase in temperature from 25 to 45 c could help reach 100 removal of ibuprofen ibp by the ni co encapsulated n doped cnt pvdf membrane pms system kang et al 2019 this trend is also similar to a recent finding han et al 2022 in which rapid degradation rate of tetracycline hydrochloride was observed at 45 c than that at 25 c they achieved around 99 removal in 15 min at 45 c vs 45 min at 25 c this could be ascribed to the fact that pms activation via breaking bond cleavage is an endothermic reaction subsequently promoting ros production rate at higher temperature wang and wang 2018 similar to conventional aops the presence of anions can commonly affect the performance of membrane based nanoconfined catalysis asif et al 2022b han et al 2022 meng et al 2022b wang et al 2022b for example spiking the reaction media with 5 mm of sodium salts containing cl no3 and hco3 reduced the ranitidine elimination by 11 16 in the coal ldh pvdf pms system asif et al 2022b the inhibitory effects rendered by those anions albeit to a minor extent could be ascribed to several reasons including ph buffering radical quenching or the formation of less powerful radicals e g e 0 cl cl 2 03 v eqs 1 5 e0 co3 co3 2 1 59 v eqs 6 7 and e0 no3 no3 2 5 v eqs 8 10 lee et al 2020 wang and wang 2018 2020 1 cl so4 cl so4 2 2 cl cl cl2 3 2cl hso5 h so4 2 cl2 h2o 4 cl2 h2o hocl 5 cl hso5 so4 2 hocl 6 so4 hco3 so4 2 h co3 7 ho hco3 h2o co3 8 ho no3 oh no3 9 so4 no3 so4 2 no3 10 h2o eaq no3 2oh no2 5 3 influence of natural organic matter nom natural organic matter is a heterogeneous mixture comprised of thousands of organic molecules derived from biogeochemical processes as well as man made exercises ly et al 2019 ly et al 2020a the ubiquitous existence of nom in water bodies makes its interactions with treatment practices inevitable analogous to inorganic anions nom could lower the available concentration of ros thus reducing the catalytic reactivity for micropollutant elimination in aops lee et al 2020 wang and wang 2020 wang et al 2022b nonetheless this impact has been proven much more trivial in nanoconfined catalytic membranes than conventional aops wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021d zhang et al 2020b for example under similar conditions of 3 mm pms and 2 mgc l suwannee river nom degradation of 1 4 dioxane by the co1 go membrane was 94 5 which is almost double to that achieved by co1 go flakes 57 in suspension solution wu et al 2021 the underlying mechanisms of enhanced pollutant removal efficiency by catalytic membrane could be attributed to the size exclusion capability of nanosized channels or nanopores that restrict the passage of nom especially ones with high molecular weight as a result it minimizes the competition of nom with pms and with micropollutants for activated sites and ros respectively which is well recognized as the major hurdle to avoid the inhibition of the reactivity of aops in addition wu and co workers also witnessed the nanoconfined co1 go membrane pms could alleviate membrane fouling by decomposing nom foulant adsorbed on membrane surface wu et al 2021 to date the interplays between nom and membrane based nanoconfined catalysis have been merely explored using only the reference standard and it is still unclear whether the novel concept can be applicable for real water as the underlying mechanisms of nom interaction with the membrane based nanoconfined catalysis remain largely unknown few questions that require answers include which constituents of nom could be more preferentially degraded what are the associated transformation pathways during the process whether the unique configuration of nanoconfined catalytic membrane could help mitigate the membrane fouling with more complex and heterogenous structure of dom in surface and wastewater the information is critical to warrant the quality of the treated water for real application 6 conclusion and future outlook it is a well documented fact that micropollutants are ubiquitous in freshwater posing a significant threat to aquatic ecosystem and potentially human health to address this issue advanced oxidation processes aops have been employed for effective micropollutant removal from water and wastewater however owing to their inherent limitations conventional aops particularly heterogenous aops could not be scaled up recently the concept of membrane based nanoconfined catalysis whereby a reaction is allowed to take place in small nano spaces or nanopores has been utilized to overcome the limitations of conventional heterogenous catalysis this review attempts to discuss the recent progress in membrane based nanoconfined heterogeneous catalysis for enhanced oxidant activation fast reaction kinetics and effective micropollutant destruction a systematic survey of the available literature consistently suggests that membrane based nanoconfined catalysis always achieves fast reaction kinetics that is a few orders of magnitude faster as compared to conventional aop reactors outstanding removal of a range of micropollutants by membrane based nanoconfined catalysis has been accredited to the changes in reaction dynamics under confinement that promotes diffusion of reactants to desired locations sites and strong electronic interactions between nanocatalysts and oxidant as well as reactive oxygen species ros and micropollutants according to literature density functional theory dft could be used as a powerful tool to elucidate the preferential adsorption behavior and or reaction pathway of oxidant which is critical to understand reaction dynamics under nanoconfinement it could be argued that the methods of membrane fabrication for nanoconfined catalysis such as nanocatalyst immobilization vacuum filtration assisted assembly and in situ growth of nanocatalyst within membrane pores govern the pore size and pore structure consequently affecting the efficacy removal and water permeance of the membrane based nanoconfined catalysis systems irrespective of the fabrication method membrane based nanoconfined catalysis systems have been observed to achieve effective micropollutant removal as long as the reactions are executed at nanoscale preferably below the nanopore size of 20 nm nanopores careful loading amount of nanocatalysts on membrane template should be made to achieve desired removal of micropollutants without compromising water permeance of membrane filtration when considering the effect of operating conditions it is observed that the required oxidant dose in the case of membrane confined catalysis system is often lower than conventional aop reactors importantly influence of water matrix especially dom on the performance of membrane confined catalytic systems is not as pronounced as in conventional aop reactors the contents of this review are arranged and presented to provide a complete picture by providing conflicting results and opinions which opens new avenue for future research notwithstanding the impressive results it is apparent that the development and membrane based nanoconfined heterogenous catalysis systems are still in its inception phase therefore several future research areas are suggested here since nanoconfinement allows the occurrence of many interesting counterintuitive phenomena that are not observed under batch mode theoretical understandings of the physicochemical features of nanoconfined catalysis supported by experimental findings are required for example what governs the driving force of mass transfer under confinement what is significance of hydrogen bonding or capillary pressure on the nanofluidic behavior of membranes how do the electronic interactions occur between catalysts oxidants and pollutants by membrane based nanoconfined catalysis how is the decomposition of oxidant to ros affected by the extent of nanoconfinement how could the different reactive planes of nanocatalyst be grown under confinement how does the extent of confinement dictate ros generation and contribution what is the transformation and mineralization rate of the target pollutants during the nanoconfined condition especially in comparison to those by traditional catalytic processes the development of state of the art techniques to achieve precise tuning of the nanoscale domain in the catalytic membranes is of vital importance in contrast an overly small space e g less than 0 4 nm is likely to become a barrier against the entrance of target pollutant molecules which is expected to inevitably cause significant adverse effects on the permeability and catalytic performance of catalytic membrane it is commonly reported and considered that development of new nanomaterials or nanocatalysts is pivotal to expand understanding and practical application of catalytic membranes in water treatment some materials of interest may include metal oxide single atoms and or carbon based materials these materials have shown promising results and should be further developed and studied before moving on to new materials alternatively mofs and cofs have been understudied in literature and thus their inherent merits of specific pore size and uniform channels could pave a way for new generation of membrane based nanoconfined catalysis with respect to the fact that tight spatial confinement can significantly improve reaction kinetics and efficiency the coupling of nanoconfinement to external fields such as electro or photo energies can be explored through reactor design and systems engineering which may further facilitate in enhancing the desirability of confined catalysis taking the electric field as an example the difference in the interaction between pollutant molecules with different charged properties could be explored and the electrocatalytic membrane is likely to change the applicable scale of the confinement effect of the nanochannel and then change some intrinsic properties of the membrane such as flux and catalytic efficiency to make it viable for practical water treatment applications there is a huge knowledge gap between real world applications of environmental remediation strategies and simplified laboratory scale nanoconfined catalytic membrane systems and the impact of real water wastewater at pilot scale has been paid insufficient attention for example how does the presence of catalysts and nom affect permeability and membrane fouling could the novel concept be beneficial for membrane fouling mitigation in general in addition the operational cost of the membrane based nanoconfined heterogeneous catalysis vs conventional aops should be also evaluated at pilot scale even though the membrane based nanoconfined heterogeneous catalysis could save a lot of catalyst dose less than one twentieth and oxidant dose 15 compared with conventional aops using only the reference standard at laboratory scale due to the heterogeneous structure and complexity of nom it is highly recommended that further investigation should be carried out using real nom aided with advanced nom analyses to warrant the success of membrane based confined catalysis for real water treatment finally most applications of dft have by far focused on pms and more works involving other oxidants such as pds and h2o2 in various catalytic membranes should be carried out to address the gap in knowledge which could bring broad implications for environmental science and

15132,a detailed characterization of residential water consumption is essential for ensuring urban water systems capability to cope with changing water resources availability and water demands induced by growing population urbanization and climate change several studies have been conducted in the last decades to investigate the characteristics of residential water consumption with data at a sufficiently fine temporal resolution for grasping individual end uses of water in this paper we systematically review 114 studies to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art research about water consumption at the end use level specifically we contribute with 1 an in depth discussion of the most relevant findings of each study highlighting which water end use characteristics were so far prioritized for investigation in different case studies and water demand modelling and management studies from around the world and 2 a multi level analysis to qualitatively and quantitatively compare the most common results available in the literature i e daily per capita end use water consumption end use parameter average values and statistical distributions end use daily profiles end use determinants and considerations about efficiency and diffusion of water saving end uses our findings can support water utilities consumers and researchers 1 in understanding which key aspects of water end uses were primarily investigated in the last decades and 2 in exploring their main features considering different geographical cultural and socio economic regions of the world graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords residential water consumption water end uses residential end use study end use database multi level analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the availability of water resources is of concern for many regions worldwide mcdonald et al 2010 suero et al 2012 growing population and urbanization have led to large areas under water stress with population growth often coupled with variations in the per capita water consumption rates cosgrove and loucks 2015 population growth can stress local water resources even in areas with decreasing per capita water demands dieter et al 2018 moreover water shortages which currently affect more than 500 million people worldwide are expected to be compounded as a consequence of climate change sønderlund et al 2016 and feed back to changes in water demands across potentially conflicting sectors such as drastic increases in the amount of water needed for irrigation and urban activities due to increasingly frequent and intense drought events evans and sadler 2008 effective planning and management of water systems are thus of great importance to cope with the grand challenges posed by population climate and water resources availability avni et al 2015 however the effectiveness of water supply operations and water demand management strategies to meet future demand under different scenarios depends on our knowledge on where when and how water is being used cardell oliver et al 2016 this has motivated an increasing interest over time towards characterizing water consumption distribution across space and time in the water research literature sanchez et al 2018 in the last decades many studies have been conducted to investigate water consumption characteristics at different spatio temporal scales in some cases danielson 1979 tanverakul and lee 2013 water consumption is explored by relying on monthly to yearly water data typically read manually by water utility technicians for billing however as reported by cominola et al 2015 billed water data generally allow extracting information only to evaluate aggregate volumes of water consumption at a coarse spatiotemporal detail i e entire city or districts and on a coarse temporal scale i e monthly or seasonal to overcome this limitation more attention has recently been devoted to the investigation of water consumption at finer spatiotemporal resolutions i e at the household or end use scale and with hourly to sub minute temporal resolution this finer resolution monitoring was made possible by technological development and the diffusion of smart metering solutions gurung et al 2015 darby 2010 spanning from add on data loggers allowing water consumption data to be gathered in more detail than conventional meters to digital meters capable of automatically processing and transmitting those data to the utility for monitoring and billing purposes smart meters and paired software bastidas pacheco et al 2020 2021b enable detailed analysis on heterogeneous water consumption behaviors and sub daily patterns cubillo gonzález et al 2008 beal and stewart 2011 horsburgh et al 2017 cominola et al 2018b and can be used to develop customized feedback and water conservation programs mayer et al 2000 willis et al 2010b cominola et al 2021a when real time information is available smart metre data can also be exploited to provide real time alerts for domestic leakages or anomalous water consumption patterns britton et al 2013 luciani et al 2019 mayer 2022 thus enabling prompt actions with consequent water conservation or even life saving salomons and housh 2022 furthermore smart meters allow new detailed information about water consumption to be obtained up to the level of individual end uses i e domestic micro components such as shower taps washing machine etc this information includes daily volumes of water consumed along with the daily water consumption profiles and routines at the end use level and other parameters e g duration volume flow rate and frequency of use of individual water uses with increasing frequency greater focus has been given in the literature to the characterization of water consumption at the level of individual end use in the residential sector mainly because residential consumers typically represent the highest number of water users in cities aksela and aksela 2011 residential end uses of water consumption had been scarcely explored before the introduction of smart metering technologies not only digital meters but also in a broader sense the previously developed data logging solutions and paired software for data processing due to the effort required to obtain this information with previously available tools only few water consumption investigations at the end use level were performed prior to the early 1990s they were based on data gathering campaigns developed using surveys audits and questionnaires to characterize the features of domestic appliances and people s habits thus estimating water use e g butler 1991 customer self reported end use water consumption studies have proved to be highly inaccurate as consumers typically have a poor understanding of their water use habits compared to norms and best practices beal et al 2013 nowadays residential water consumption data at the end use level can be used for a variety of purposes such as training and testing water demand models e g blokker et al 2010 or the calibration and validation of water end use disaggregation methods mayer et al 1999 nguyen et al 2013a nguyen et al 2018 mazzoni et al 2021 in addition the availability of this information may support the development of technologies for water reuse and recycling dixon et al 1999 or strategies aimed at increasing consciousness and awareness of water use beal et al 2011b liu et al 2016 water utilities can rely on detailed water end use information to review and improve their incentive and water pricing arrangement gleick et al 2003 whereas users can receive helpful feedback and then change their water consumption behavior willis et al 2010b stewart et al 2018 feedback targeted to specific consumer s water end use consumption behaviors has great potential to conserve water during water scarcity periods fielding et al 2013 yet despite the advantages of end use water consumption data collecting and efficiently processing them is still challenging on the one hand the intrusive monitoring of each domestic appliance may be impractical and householders are unlikely to provide permission to install this intrusive instrumentation cominola et al 2015 on the other hand when non intrusive approaches are considered automated techniques for the end use disaggregation of the water consumption time series generally require information about end use parameters that may be unavailable to the analysts mazzoni et al 2021 in contrast manual approaches typically involve considerable human effort and time due to the large amounts of data to analyse along with potential bias and scarce reproducibility deriving from expert based judgement deoreo et al 1996 while we acknowledge the above limitations related to the direct or indirect collection of end use water consumption data we believe that general analyses water consumption models and technological development may still be conducted by exploiting the ensemble of data and information already available yet fragmented in the literature indeed the literature published in the past two decades includes numerous peer reviewed journal publications or water utility reports exploring water consumption characteristics at the end use level moreover these studies consider different case studies methodological approaches adopted to obtain end use information and end use database features finally there are considerable differences in the numerical end use results shown thus systematic reviews comparisons and elaborations of these fragmented data may promisingly lead to new applications in the field of water resources management in this context some recent studies present the main characteristics of the major residential end use studies available in the literature such as location sample size and approach adopted to obtain end use data nguyen et al 2013a cominola et al 2015 more specifically in a review by di mauro et al 2021 over one hundred studies on water consumption are clustered based on their spatiotemporal scale i e ranging from urban to end use level and from daily to sub minute resolution and the level of accessibility of their related datasets in addition a recent study conducted by abu bakar et al 2021 provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of end use disaggregation and classification techniques along with a discussion of the results proposed by several studies about the determinants of water consumption limited to the household level at the end use level a summary comparison of the daily per capita water consumption values indicated in different studies is available in mayer et al 1999 beal and stewart 2011 gurung et al 2014 and jordán cuebas et al 2018 however to the authors knowledge an extensive review about residential end uses of water not only highlighting similarities and differences amongst the studies available in the literature but also systematically comparing all the numerical results about end use water consumption globally is still missing the current work aims to fill the abovementioned gap by providing a comprehensive review of the existing end use studies conducted globally in the field of residential water consumption along with an in depth discussion of their scope features and results to fully explore and quantify end use characteristics in different contexts worldwide unlike other reviews available in the literature this research is structured as a multi level analysis including 1 a quantitative comparison of all the most common metrics about residential end use water consumption i e per capita daily end use water consumption end use parameter average values end use parameter distributions end use daily profiles and 2 a qualitative discussion about additional aspects of interest in the field of end use water consumption i e considerations about end use determinants and water saving efficiency we believe that the findings of the current work may be applied to several contexts for which end use water consumption data are needed e g demand characterization training and testing of demand models development of technologies for water reuse and conservation adoption of strategies to increase people s awareness revision of water utility rate and billing system water infrastructure planning and management ultimately the results of this study may support water utilities and researchers in understanding which aspects were primarily explored in recent research and identifying the end use databases and studies carried out in different geographical cultural and socio economic regions of the world this review is organized as follows section 2 includes the methodological details of the literature review conducted to explore the state of the art of research about residential end use water consumption along with a preliminary overview of the main characteristics of the reviewed studies and datasets and a presentation of the multi level methodology adopted for end use data analysis section 3 illustrates the quantitative and qualitative outcomes emerging from multi level analysis conducted to compare the information included in the reviewed studies and datasets finally the study s most relevant findings and implications are highlighted in section 4 along with some considerations for future research directions 2 materials and methods 2 1 literature review methods and search outcome we carried out a systematic search of peer reviewed journal papers water utility reports and other grey literature material i e theses research projects presentations etc to explore the current state of research on residential water consumption at the end use level the search was conducted between october 2020 and november 2022 specifically we searched for publications related to residential water consumption at the end use level in the elsevier s scopus database elsevier 2021 as well as in some of the most accessed water journal editor databases such as those of the international water association and the american society of civil engineers we initially searched for combinations of three keywords i e residential water and end uses and limited the subject area to engineering this search led to an initial paper set of 271 publications mostly but not only in english we then manually checked the title and abstract of each publication and retained only those fitting the scope of our study in greater detail 40 publications were retained at this stage finally we expanded the resulting set of papers by including other studies cited in the bibliography of the retained publications the final paper set considered for the following analysis includes a total of 114 studies presenting or making use of residential water consumption data at the end use level we reviewed these 114 studies reported in table 1 and hereinafter called residential end use studies reus to explore their contribution and implications to residential water consumption at the end use level a first analysis evaluated the objectives of each study the primary of which was considered for classification fig 1 fig 1 reveals that in most cases 42 studies i e 37 research was conducted to explore the characteristics of end use water consumption in some specific geographical areas however end use data were widely exploited also for other purposes namely to evaluate the potential for water conservation and recycling 17 studies i e 15 explore the determinants

the above reus characteristics are summarized in table 1 our review reveals that the 114 reus refer to 66 different databases hereinafter called end use databases eud specifically some eud are exploited in more than one reus see e g the british eud used by butler 1991 1993 or the southeast queensland eud exploited by beal et al 2011a 2011b 2013 and other authors in contrast other eud are used in only one reus it is also worth noting that some reus have been conducted by exploiting only part of their related eud willis et al 2009c gato trinidad et al 2011 rathnayaka et al 2015 whereas some other have exploited it entirely bennett and linstedt 1975 mayer et al 2000 fontdecaba et al 2013 alharsha et al 2022 2 2 eud clustering we first clustered eud based on the fields of investigation mentioned above see table 1 overall the fields of investigation selected for clustering are in line with those considered by di mauro et al 2021 however it is worth highlighting that the scope of our study extends the study by di mauro et al 2021 here eud clustering is conducted only to make an initial and qualitative discrimination amongst the eud concerned thus providing an organized dataset to achieve the key aim of the work i e conducting a multi level comparison both qualitative and quantitative of their end use parameters and characteristics eud were clustered manually and exclusively based on the information reported in their related reus this was done with the aim of standardizing the analysis in light of the fact that the majority of eud are not publicly available as detailed below from an operational standpoint we adopted the following criteria for clustering 1 concerning the study period we clustered eud based on the first year of data collection 2 concerning the sample size the average duration of monitoring per household if reported and the temporal data sampling resolution if reported we clustered eud based on the highest values inferred in the respective reus by way of example in the case of eud including water consumption data collected during two subsequent periods the former conducted on a smaller sample and the latter extended to a larger sample the number of households making up the latter sample is considered for clustering similarly when a measurement campaign is conducted in two or more stages the first with a coarser and the second with a finer data sampling temporal resolution the finest resolution is considered as a reference value for clustering finally 3 concerning dataset availability and similarly to di mauro et al 2021 we clustered eud in three main categories of data accessibility open access if available in the literature and freely downloadable from the web restricted if not directly available but details on how to obtain them are explicitly reported in the related reus and unavailable if no information on how to access or purchase them is reported in the related reus the results of the eud clustering are shown in fig 2 the following findings emerge for each considered criterion geographical area fig 2a eud include data collected across all the continents but mainly in north america 18 databases europe 18 databases and oceania 13 a lower number of eud include data collected in asia 10 africa 4 and south america 1 in general a linkage between the level of digitalization of water utilities and the respective number of eud is observed because their realization typically requires technologies and tools that may not be available in the most underdeveloped areas of the world moreover a higher number of analyses hence eud is observed for areas that have been strongly hit by water scarcity and drought conditions such as the western coast of the united states or australia see e g mayer et al 1999 mayer et al 2003 beal and stewart 2011 and beal et al 2014 study period fig 2b although reus have been conducted since the 1970s bennett and lindstedt 1975 siegrist et al 1976 most eud have been developed only after 2000 this finding is mainly due to the technological development in the late 1990s and specifically the advent of smart metering technologies making available water consumption data at a fine spatial and or temporal resolution i e household or end use level cominola et al 2015 gurung et al 2015 this aspect also explains why these first reus were generally conducted in developed countries in contrast developing countries such as sri lanka thailand and vietnam have undergone reus only since the last decade sivakumaran and aramaki 2010 otaki et al 2011 otaki et al 2013 however information on the first year of data collection is not available for a non negligible group of 16 eud i e 24 of the total household sample size fig 2c the majority of the eud include data collected for samples of households in a range between ten and a hundred 17 eud i e 26 of the total or between hundred and a thousand 24 eud i e 36 only a limited number of eud include data observed for samples smaller than ten households 11 i e 17 or larger than a thousand 9 i e 14 in general household sample size typically dependant on the scope of the research is rather limited in the earliest studies for which manual or laborious processes have been generally carried out to obtain water end use data for instance in the eud developed by deoreo et al 1996 the first to be developed by relying on water consumption data at sub minute resolution 16 households were monitored their observed water consumption was manually disaggregated and classified into individual end uses based on the parameters of the water use events recorded at the household level considerable increases in the sample size were made possible by introducing automated methods for data processing and classification mayer et al 1999 kowalski and marshallsay 2003 beal et al 2011a as far as the relationship between household sample size and water consumption results is regarded it is expected that increasing the household sample can lead to eud that are more representative of end use water consumption in a specific location however it is worth observing that to date no reus primarily aiming to explore the effects of sample size on water consumption results thus defining guidelines that can aid water utilities and researchers to identify an optimal sample size have been conducted making this research question still unsolved household monitoring period average fig 2d regarding the eud for which water consumption data have been obtained employing direct measurements different monitoring durations per household are observed ranging from a minimum of a few days i e less than one week to a maximum of more than one year although a marked correlation is not evident between the length of the monitoring period and the other clustering variables an inverse relationship between the length of the monitoring period and temporal data sampling resolution is sometimes observed regarding eud with similar household sample size this emerges for example when the eud presented by mayer et al 1999 and deoreo et al 2011 is compared against the eud reported by cole and stewart 2013 indeed in the former cases about one thousand households were monitored for around two weeks at the 10 s sampling resolution in contrast the latter analysis exploits hourly resolution data from approximately 3000 households lastly for 14 of the eud data were not obtained by the monitoring but with different methods e g interaction with users as reported by bastidas pacheco et al 2023 collecting water consumption data for short periods can lead to results that may not be representative of varying water consumption patterns given that this also depends on seasonal factors although some eud include data collected over different periods of the year in order to explore seasonal water consumption behaviors e g those exploited by mayer et al 1999 roberts 2005 heinrich 2007 beal and stewart 2011 and redhead et al 2013 it is worth noting that also the evaluation of the effects of data monitoring periods on water consumption temporal variability is still an open issue temporal data sampling resolution fig 2e several authors highlight that the introduction of smart metering technologies allows water consumption data to be collected not only at a fine spatial resolution but also at a fine temporal resolution i e from several minutes up to a few seconds cominola et al 2015 clifford et al 2018 in the case of the reviewed reus different monitoring temporal resolutions are observed ranging from a minimum of 1 s to a maximum of less than one reading per month which is in line with the traditional resolution of water metre readings for billing purposes moreover the reus review reveals that in the case of coarse temporal resolution of monitoring it is typically harder to identify all individual end uses of water as also demonstrated by cominola et al 2018a bastidas pacheco et al 2022 and heydari et al 2022 by way of example concerning the hervey bay australia eud including aggregate water consumption data collected at hourly temporal resolution cole and stewart 2013 only limited discriminations are made between indoor and outdoor water use in contrast du plessis et al 2018 reveal that the same discrimination might be done also at the urban level by calculating a water balance i e by relying on household water consumption data at a very coarse resolution i e monthly coupled with information obtained by monitoring wastewater flowing in sewer systems however it is worth noting that detailed information about individual end uses of water is typically obtainable only when data are available at sufficiently fine temporal resolution i e more than one reading per minute in fact as reported by cominola et al 2018a and heydari et al 2022 both on synthetic and real world data such a resolution generally allows end use disaggregation and classification with acceptable accuracy at least for the main end uses this finding explains why most of the eud reviewed include data with a temporal sampling resolution of at least one reading per minute i e 26 of the 51 eud for which this information is available end use data gathering approach fig 2f although some eud were obtained by directly monitoring each domestic end use anderson et al 1993 edwards and martin 1995 kim et al 2007 otaki et al 2008 the economic practical and technological limitations related to this kind of approach have motivated the introduction of non intrusive techniques based on manual or automated processing of the data collected at the household level i e at the domestic inlet point in proximity to the water metre to obtain end use information i e at the level of individual appliance fixture from an operational standpoint this end use level determination can be either achieved utilizing audits reports or questionnaires submitted to users butler 1991 ghisi and oliveira 2007 shan et al 2015 alharsha et al 2018 díaz et al 2021 or by applying manual semi automated or automated methods for water end use disaggregation and classification such as those proposed by mayer et al 1999 kowalski and marshallsay 2003 nguyen et al 2013a and mazzoni et al 2021 some studies adopt hybrid approaches coupling different techniques such as direct monitoring of only a limited subset of end uses coupled with interaction with the users to infer information on other water end uses bennett and linstedt 1975 siegrist et al 1976 brown and caldwell consulting engineers 1984 otaki et al 2017 in general the earliest studies were typically carried out by exploiting analogue tools to record water consumption data i e chart recorders driven by the water metre and by manually processing the data collected conversely in the case of larger or more recent eud end use information is mainly achieved by automatically processing aggregate water consumption data collected at a very fine temporal resolution mayer et al 1999 cubillo gonzález et al 2008 deoreo and mayer 2013 overall the application of methods for end use disaggregation and classification of household level data is the most commonly used technique to obtain information about the end uses of water i e adopted in 23 of the eud discovered or 35 however it is worth observing that eud obtained from data disaggregation and classification may be characterized by different levels of uncertainty based on the accuracy of the method considered along with the inability of some of them to detect overlapping water use events or the a priori exclusion of overlapping events during data cleaning two aspects which are hardly ever discussed in the related reus except those aimed at presenting new methods thus due to the lack of sufficient information eud uncertainty in relation to disaggregation and classification performance will not be considered in the current study dataset availability fig 2g the vast majority of eud is unavailable in the literature 52 i e 79 whereas only a small group have open or restricted access 8 and 6 i e 12 and 9 respectively more specifically most open access eud have been published in recent years e g eud exploited by jordán cuebas et al 2018 di mauro et al 2020 2022 bethke et al 2021 otaki et al 2022 heydari et al 2022 arsene et al 2022 and bastidas pacheco et al 2023 on the one hand this is likely due to technological factors making digital data more available and shareable as also highlighted by di mauro et al 2021 on the other hand this increasing trend in eud accessibility may be fostered by the new policies typically adopted by scientific journals encouraging authors to publicly share data for transparency and reproducibility purposes in fact the acknowledgement and awareness of the reproducibility challenge facing computational environmental modelling fields are currently growing choi et al 2021 conversely only a few instances of open access or even simply restricted eud published in less recent years exist i e eud exploited by mayer et al 1999 2004 beal and stewart 2011 and deoreo and mayer 2013 overall it emerges that despite the recent increase in open access eud end use data availability still represents a significant challenge in the spirit of open science and reproducible research this motivates the current study of individual eud characteristics and outcomes by relying only on the information reported in the reus available in the literature also due to the aim of standardizing the methodology for database analysis 2 3 eud processing we systematically compared the eud based on results reported in the literature by applying a six level analysis fig 3 this multi level analysis aims to explore the characteristics of end use water consumption from several points of view revealing similarities and differences amongst the eud concerning level 1 daily per capita end use water consumption level 2 end use parameter average values level 3 end use statistical parameter distributions level 4 end use daily profiles level 5 end use water consumption determinants and level 6 efficiency and diffusion of water saving end uses 2 3 1 level 1 daily per capita end use water consumption for each eud including information about daily per capita water consumption at the end use level we considered the following categories of indoor water consumption dishwasher d washing machine wm shower s bathtub b toilet flusher f taps t leakages l and other uses o this latter including all the indoor water uses which cannot be included in other categories e g evaporative cooler garbage disposal or ambiguous water uses e g laundry or dishwashing if no information is available about the type of use i e manual or automated specifically for each eud and end use category we processed data as follows for reus presenting daily per capita average values we directly considered the reported values once converted to l person day for reus presenting the end use percent values of the daily per capita indoor water consumption we turned these into daily per capita values by exploiting the information about the average total daily per capita indoor water consumption reported for reus presenting values of end use water consumption per family group per day we turned these into daily per capita values by exploiting the information about the average occupancy rate of the households included in the study for reus presenting values specifically observed in different seasons summer and winter we averaged these to obtain values that could be representative of the overall eud concerned i e not affected by seasonal patterns and therefore to be in line with those reus describing the characteristics of water consumption only in relation to a single sometimes already averaged seasonal period which are the majority for reus presenting multiple end use water consumption values related to different subsets regions household types etc we calculated a weighted average based on the size of each subset i e the number of households monitored in each subset to be in line with those reus describing the characteristics of water consumption only in relation to the overall household sample which are the majority for reus comparing baseline values against those observed after device retrofitting campaigns e g low flow toilet tank or tap aerator installations we considered only pre retrofitting data in order to explore the status quo of water consumption at the beginning of the study period i e the conditions motivating the choice of installing new more efficient fixtures 2 3 2 level 2 end use parameters average values to further explore the characteristics of water consumption at the end use level we computed four parameters describing the main features of different end uses 1 volume per use measured in l use defined as the volume of water consumed during an individual event of water use 2 duration per use measured in min use defined as the duration of an individual event of water use 3 flow rate per use measured in l min defined as the average flow rate characterizing an individual event of water use and 4 frequency of use measured in uses person day defined as the number of times per person per day a water end use occurs level 2 of analysis was conducted for all end use categories introduced in level 1 except for the other category which was ignored due to the heterogeneity of water uses present moreover the average values of the above four metrics were obtained for each study based on the assumptions made in level 1 see the related sub section 2 3 3 level 3 end use statistical parameter distributions level 3 of the analysis further explores the characteristics of end use parameters defined in level 2 by comparing their probability distributions the motivation behind this analysis is that in general predictive or descriptive water demand models are calibrated based on predefined parameter distributions i e the probability distribution of volume per use duration per use flow rate per use and frequency of use for different end uses however to the authors knowledge the literature lacks a comprehensive database including and comparing this kind of information in most of the reus including information about end use parameter distributions this information is shown in diagrams where the independent variable indicates the end use parameter value e g volume per shower use conversely the dependant variable sometimes relates to the number of uses observed or to the relative frequency of occurrence therefore given the tendency to include information in graphical form only and in light of the high variability of the information available we conducted level 3 of analysis as follows 1 we digitized the information originally in graphical form by means of the web plot digitizer v4 3 software rohatgi 2021 specifically we processed the end use parameter distributions shown in the studies for the five most common end use categories i e dishwasher washing machine shower toilet and taps and the four parameters defined in level 2 i e volume per use duration per use flow rate per use and frequency of use 2 we processed the digitized information based on assumptions partially introduced in level 1 and level 2 specifically i we adapted the units of measurements to those selected for each end use parameter in level 2 except tap duration that given its limited average values was assumed in s use ii in the case of reus presenting end use parameter distributions observed in specific seasons summer and winter we averaged these to obtain distributions not affected by seasonal patterns iii in the case of reus presenting multiple parameter distributions related to the type of end use e g front versus top load washing machine we calculated a weighted average based on the size of each subset iv in the case of reus comparing baseline distributions against those observed after device retrofitting we considered pre retrofitting distributions only 3 we converted the distributions into empirical probability density function curves i e empirical pdf 4 we fitted the empirical pdf curves with matlab s r2019a fitdist function specifically five pdfs were assumed to fit each empirical pdf normal lognormal exponential weibull and gamma we applied a one sample kolmogorov smirnov test to each fitted distribution type to evaluate its goodness of fit only the distribution types for which the kolmogorov smirnov test was successful i e provided the rejection of the null hypothesis at the 5 significance level were then submitted to the akaike s information criterion aic test and compared akaike 1974 finally we selected the distribution type passing the kolmogorov smirnov test and characterized by the minimum aic parameter value as the best fitting pdf with its related parameter values overall it is worth noting that uncertainties and potential errors may have arisen due to the reverse engineering process adopted to obtain end use statistical parameter distributions e g digitization inaccuracy induced by low resolution reus histograms and in turn affecting curve fitting accuracy the performance of which should be verified with actual end use data distributions however given the scarce availability of most eud as demonstrated in section 2 2 motivating the characterization of end use water consumption and parameters by relying only on the information reported in the reus available in the literature the above mentioned approach resulted the most suitable method to uniformly process a large and heterogeneous amount of graphical end use data 2 3 4 level 4 daily end use profiles level 4 of the analysis focuses on the comparative analysis of the daily end use profiles shown in the reus overall the most common end use categories for which daily profiles are available are dishwasher washing machine bathtub and shower toilet taps and leakages as in the case of end use parameter distributions this information is typically provided exclusively in graphical form i e by means of charts including the pattern of the average end use water consumption over the 24 h of the day and with different units of measurement therefore as for level 3 of the analysis we first digitized the information on end use daily profiles by means of the web plot digitizer v4 3 software rohatgi 2021 we then normalized standardized the digitized profiles for comparison and processed them based on the following assumptions 1 in the case of reus presenting the end use daily profiles observed in specific seasons summer and winter we averaged these to obtain profiles not affected by seasonal patterns 2 in the case of reus presenting daily profiles related to multiple end uses of the same category e g shower and bathtub or kitchen sink and washbasin we calculated a weighted average profile based on the values of the daily per capita water consumption of each end use and 3 in the reus of studies comparing baseline profiles against those observed after device retrofitting we considered only pre retrofitting profiles 2 3 5 level 5 determinants of end use consumption and parameters given the high heterogeneity in the determinants of the end uses of water presented in the reus level 5 includes analyses aimed at quantifying the most reported categories following an approach similar to cominola et al 2021b we adopted a representation index r defined as the frequency of appearance of a determinant in the set of framework analysis studies to quantify how popular a determinant is in the reviewed literature the frequency of appearance of a given determinant is evaluated with respect to 1 daily per capita end use water consumption and 2 end use parameters i e volume per use duration per use flow rate per use frequency of use moreover we focused on observable and external end use determinants cominola et al 2021b whereas we did not consider latent determinants i e psychological drivers such as people s habits perception and awareness which are typically less investigated at the end use level specifically we explored three categories socio demographic determinants i e occupancy rate family type householders age income occupational status educational level and socio economic region property characteristics i e household type and lot size external determinants i e daily temperature and season 2 3 6 level 6 efficiency and diffusion of water saving end uses level 6 of the analysis aims to explore the efficiency and the diffusion of water saving end uses along with their impact on water consumption specifically due to the variety in the materials methods and implications of the reus including considerations about end use water saving efficiency and diffusion the analysis consists of a review of the main outcomes of the reus focusing on these aspects and their major implications although limited to a qualitative discussion level 6 of the analysis aims to be a reference point for those who intend to investigate the topic of efficiency and diffusion of water saving end uses by providing a qualitative overview of the most relevant outcomes indicated in the literature 3 results and discussion given the differences in the content of the eud and the heterogeneity of data presented in the reus we first assessed whether the information required to carry out the multi level analysis for each eud was included within the body of the corresponding reus results are detailed in table 1 and summarized in fig 4 daily per capita end use water consumption data and the average values of end use parameters are reported for at least one end use category in the case of 52 and 44 of the 66 eud i e 79 and 67 respectively this means that these two aspects are the most explored in the literature in contrast considerations of end use parameter distributions daily end use profiles end use determinants or efficiency and diffusion of water saving end uses can be outlined only in the case of 28 21 21 and 25 of the 66 eud i e 42 32 32 and 38 respectively thus the results of the analysis show that attention is generally paid to the evaluation of daily per capita water consumption of different end uses or the average values of the end use parameters i e level 1 and level 2 while investigation of other aspects of the end use water consumption such as parameter distributions level 3 daily profiles level 4 determinants level 5 or efficiency and diffusion level 6 is still rather limited these outcomes are coherent with the findings of the literature reviews proposed in the framework of some reus mayer et al 1999 beal and stewart 2011 jordán cuebas et al 2018 which include only the most relevant results accessible in the literature in terms of daily per capita end use water consumption lastly we observe a limited number of eud with reported information that does not cover any level of the analysis jacobs 2007 kim et al 2007 cole and stewart 2013 kozlovskiy et al 2016 kofinas et al 2018 this is mainly because the related reus exploit end use data for a variety of applications e g end use demand model training testing end use disaggregation and classification model calibration validation or considerations on data gathering at different sampling resolutions without directly presenting the characteristics of the eud concerned due to the lack of sufficient data these eud are cited in our study but not considered for further analyses 3 1 level 1 daily per capita end use water consumption daily per capita water consumption data are available for at least one end use category in the majority of eud 52 out of 66 i e 79 the average values of each study are shown in table 2 which also features information on the average number of household occupants and the total indoor water consumption we observe that showers and toilets are typically the end uses with the highest per capita daily water consumption average of 44 1 and 38 0 l person day respectively followed by taps 32 9 l person day washing machines 28 8 l person day bathtubs 9 9 l person day and dishwashers 3 0 l person day the eud reviewed also reveal non negligible average values in the case of domestic leakages 16 6 l person day including both permanent e g pipe breaks or temporary leakages e g blockage of toilet float valve first the results obtained confirm that the majority of residential water consumption is primarily tied to the use of water for personal hygiene and flushing second it emerges that some end uses have been drastically reduced due to behavioral change and the introduction of efficient devices as substantiated in the following section this reduction is mainly evident in the case of bathtubs which have been almost entirely replaced by showers but also applies to the case of tap use for dishwashing or laundry however although substantial water savings have generally been observed because of the diffusion of efficient devices like dishwashers agudelo vera et al 2014 the tap component of water use is still non negligible due to the high heterogeneity of uses associated with this end use category ranging from personal hygiene to cooking drinking or house cleaning the box whisker plots of the distributions of the average daily per capita end use consumption values are shown in fig 5 the figure reveals no substantial variations between the median of each distribution white squares and the aforementioned average values red asterisks with the exception of bathtub and leakages whose median about 4 5 and 10 3 l person day respectively is considerably below the average and reveals an asymmetry of the bathtub and leakage distribution also distinguishable from the position of quartiles considering value dispersion the most scattered distributions of the average daily per capita water consumption are those related to toilets and washing machines i e the end uses generally accounting for the largest portion of the total indoor water consumption along with showers in contrast less scattered values are observed for the other end uses e g dishwasher whose daily per capita consumption values are considerably in line the high dispersion of toilet and washing machine values is more likely to be due to technological development rather than behavioral factors i e changes in people s attitude towards water use as demonstrated by the strongly decreasing volume per use trends shown in table 3 and discussed in the subsequent section along with the absence of substantial variations in the daily frequency of use over years however it is worth noting that other factors may also contribute to this spread e g inaccuracies in disaggregation and classification methods causing event misclassification fig 6 shows the trend of the daily per capita end use water consumption over the last three decades where dots represent the average values related to each eud colour and dimension are related to location and sample size respectively specifically the results are limited to those retrieved for the developed continents for which a sufficient number of eud is available i e europe north america and oceania overall fig 6 reveals considerable differences amongst eud even in the case of studies conducted in similar locations and periods see e g the large spread of in the use of dishwasher in north america over the decade 1990 2000 shown in fig 6a or the use of washing machine in oceania over the 2000 2010 decade shown in fig 6b however as far as the trend of the daily per capita water consumption is regarded a decrease between the 1990 2000 and the 2010 2020 decades emerges in most of the end uses shown in the figure more specifically some of the largest drops in water consumption are observed over time in the case of automated or fixed volume end uses such as washing machines from 52 9 to 18 0 l person day fig 6b and toilets from 62 3 to 35 7 l person day fig 6e confirming the large spread of values met in level 1 of the analysis for these end uses this drop is likely to be primarily due to technological development which allowed an increase in the water saving efficiency of these end uses this is demonstrated by the decreasing trend of washing machine and toilet volume per use in europe north america and oceania from the 1990 2000 to the 2010 2020 decade in spite of a constant or even slightly increasing frequency of use observable in table 3 of section 3 2 conversely human controlled end uses do not always show a decrease in their daily per capita average consumption this emerges for example in the case of showers fig 6c for which the 10 year average consumption slightly increases from the 1990 2000 decade 42 0 l person day to the 2010 2020 decade 45 5 l person day whereas tap use drastically decreases over the same period from 38 9 to 18 8 l person day fig 6f on the one hand the increase in shower water consumption may be due to behavioral factors such as the increase in the average frequency of use over decades confirmed by the data reported in table 3 on the other hand the drastic decrease in tap water consumption may be related to the progressive replacement of manual water consuming activities i e laundry dishwashing with automated operations made by appliances despite the lack of clear evidence in the trends of end use parameters such as volume per use and frequency of use lastly we observe a decrease in the daily per capita consumption of dishwashers and bathtubs as well between the 1990 2000 and the 2010 2020 decades fig 6a and 6d reasonably due to the increase in dishwasher water saving efficiency along with the reduction of bathtub use in favour of showers again the above considerations are supported by the results included in table 3 showing a negative trend of the dishwasher volume per load in spite of a slightly increasing dishwasher frequency of use over the last three decades and a strong decrease in bathtub frequency however exceptionally high bathtub consumption emerges in the case of the british eud reported by kowalski and marshallsay 2003 along with a considerably low shower consumption of about 30 l person day and the north american eud by jordán cuebas et al 2018 characterized by a rather limited sample size 3 2 level 2 end use parameters average values average values of end use parameters such as volume per use duration per use flow rate per use or frequency of use are reported in the literature for at least one end use category in the case of 44 eud i e 67 of the total average end use parameter values related to each eud are shown in table 3 along with the references to the respective reus overall volume per use and daily frequency of use are the most frequently reported end use parameters in fact these are available for at least one end use category in the case of 41 and 39 eud respectively for individual end uses volume per use and the daily frequency of use have mainly been explored in the case of toilets 35 and 37 eud respectively washing machines 29 and 32 eud and showers 27 and 32 eud whereas less relevance is given to dishwashers 20 and 25 eud bathtubs 19 and 21 eud and taps 11 and 20 eud these outcomes are most likely due to the major relevance that is typically given to toilets washing machines and showers because of their high daily per capita average water consumption values see the results of level 1 of the analysis but it is also worth noting that the above mentioned end use events are typically amongst the most easily identifiable by automated disaggregation and classification methods either because of their recognizable patterns or high event volume and duration conversely duration per use and flow rate per use are less investigated in fact the average values of these parameters are available for at least one end use category in the case of 34 and 32 eud respectively it is worth noting that event duration is typically expressed in min use in most of the cases whereas concerning taps some studies mayer et al 1999 2000 2003 evaluate it in terms of total duration of tap use per day in addition as far as the daily frequency of use is concerned typically expressed in uses person day some authors e g fontdecaba et al 2013 reported this parameter in terms of uses household day without providing information about the average occupancy rate therefore the above cases are not included in table 3 for individual end uses showers are the most explored with 33 and 31 eud showing average values of duration and flow rate per use respectively followed by taps 8 and 11 eud respectively the other end use categories are almost entirely excluded from the reus specifically their average values of duration and flow rate per use are shown in at most three four cases only the box whisker plots of the end use parameter average values provided in table 3 are shown in fig 7 where we indicated only the sets of end use parameter values appearing in at least five eud in greater detail the following features emerge for different parameters volume per use fig 7a bathtubs are the most consuming end use with an average volume per use of about 105 5 l use followed by washing machines 92 2 l load and showers 63 1 l use whereas considerably lower volumes per use are related to dishwashers 17 6 l load toilets 9 0 l flush and taps of about 2 3 l use only when the dispersion of the distributions is considered it is worth noting that bathtubs and washing machines are also characterized by the highest difference between the first and the last quantile meaning that the average values available in the literature are generally more spread than those shown in the case of showers dishwashers and taps we observe the smallest differences in the case of taps with average values of the volume per use considerably in line with each other and in a range of only a few liters per use or less overall it is worth noting that a variety of values emerge when eud from different geographical areas are compared in particular the average volumes per use observed in the north american eud are typically higher than those reported in european and oceanian eud for all the end use categories in fact the average appliance volume per load in the case of the american eud is about 29 3 l load dishwashers and 138 8 l load washing machines as opposed to the european 16 0 and 58 3 l load respectively and oceanian 17 2 and 109 0 l load values this is also evident in the case of human controlled end uses such as showers and taps being the american eud average values 68 5 and 3 6 l use respectively higher than the corresponding european 58 1 and 1 5 l use and oceanian 57 6 and 2 0 l use values however it is worth observing that the average starting year of the american eud is 2005 whereas those of the european and oceanian eud are 2009 and 2008 respectively therefore differences in end use parameter values might also be due to temporal offsets amongst the eud of different areas duration and flow rate per use figs 7b and 7c although a sufficient number of values is available only for showers and taps our results reveal that shower use is typically characterized by much longer durations on the order of several minutes and with an average of about 8 1 min use and higher flow rates with an average of about 8 1 l min as opposed to taps moreover tap uses typically last less than one minute with an average of about 25 s use and little dispersion of values and have a limited flow rate on average 3 5 l min the lack of sufficient information about the other end use categories is mainly related to the fact that some other end uses are typically characterized by constant durations and flow rates per use e g toilets whereas some others are appliances and thus variations in the duration or flow rate per use are generally due to different programs selected it also emerges that appliance load duration which can be of several minutes up to some hours is generally much longer than the total duration of water inflow which is of a few minutes per load only e g from 1 4 to 5 1 min in the case of dishwasher and from 5 0 to 9 3 min in the case of washing machine based on the values reported by cubillo gonzález et al 2008 blokker et al 2010 and mazzoni et al 2023 furthermore and similarly to the considerations set forth in the case of volume per use different values emerge when the duration of the most reported end uses i e showers and taps is explored for different geographical areas overall the analysis reveals that shower uses in the north american and european case studies are typically longer lasting by about two minutes than those related to oceanian eud being the average duration of about 8 2 8 7 min use in the former case and 6 8 min use in the latter although we do not observe large variations in the average flow rate per use the american eud reveal that on average also tap uses are longer lasting and more intense than oceanian uses i e 34 s use and 4 4 l min versus 25 s use and 2 8 l min respectively however as previously mentioned these results might be affected by different study periods being the year 2005 the average starting year of the american eud and the years 2008 2009 those of oceanian and european eud respectively lastly we highlight that the comparison of end use durations can also be affected by differences in data sampling resolutions adopted across eud specifically the sampling resolution in all the cases of eud for which end use parameter values are reported is equal to or finer than 10 s as a consequence of different data sampling resolutions uncertainties also arise in relation to end use flow rate i e the other time dependant end use parameter however unlike duration the effects of different resolutions on flow rate values cannot be directly assessed based on the information reported in the reus concerned frequency of use fig 7d different behaviors emerge when the daily frequencies of use of the end use categories considered are compared on the one hand a frequent daily use of toilets and taps emerges being the former used on average 4 95 times person day and the latter used on average 16 98 times person day in particular the toilet flusher is activated an average of 4 30 times person day in the case of the oceanian eud and 5 13 5 30 times person day in the case of north american and european eud whereas taps are opened between 16 05 european eud and 18 52 18 78 times person day oceanian and north american eud these end uses are also characterized by the highest difference between the first and the last quantiles on the other hand less frequent use of shower appliances and bathtub is observed with all these devices typically used less than once per person per day i e 0 74 uses person day in the case of showers 0 29 in the case of washing machines 0 20 in the case of dishwashers and 0 11 in the case of bathtubs specifically shower frequency of use is slightly higher in the case of oceanian eud 0 84 times person day as opposed to 0 69 0 70 times person day in the case of north american and european eud whereas washing machine frequency use is highest in north american eud 0 38 loads person day versus 0 26 loads person day in the case of european and oceanian eud finally as far as dishwasher use is considered we observe no relevant differences in frequency of use amongst eud from different continents overall the main takeaways on end use frequency of use are the following 1 taps are generally the most frequently used devices despite the limited duration of tap uses due to their various utilization ranging from personal hygiene to cleaning cooking and washing 2 toilets are typically flushed several times per person per day although less frequently than taps 3 showers are on average used once per person per day or slightly less 4 appliances are activated with daily or higher frequency only in case of households made up by three or more residents 5 bathtubs are nowadays used only occasionally 3 3 level 3 end use statistical parameter distribution end use parameter distributions are available with regard to at least one end use category and parameter in the case of 28 eud i e 42 of the total meaning that in the literature this kind of information is less explored than the respective average parameter values in fig 8 we show a detailed overview of the most common end use parameter distributions where the heat map relates the distribution of each end use and parameter to its availability bathtub is not included due to the insufficient amount of information in the literature about bathtub parameter distributions fig 8 reveals that on average volume per use and frequency of use are the parameters for which distributions are mostly available in the literature followed by duration per use and flow rate per use typically investigated only in the case of showers and taps in the case of individual end uses most of the distributions are related to shower and toilet whereas less relevance is given to taps and appliances overall the results shown in fig 8 in relation to end use statistical parameter distributions are consistent with the outcomes achieved by investigating the availability of information about the average values of end use parameters level 2 of the analysis which are indicated in table 3 the empirical distributions i e empirical pdf curves of end use parameters obtained by digitizing the information available in the reus are shown in fig s1 see the supplemental data whereas the respective probability distributions i e statistical pdf curves fitted by matlab s r2019a fitdist function are shown in fig 9 the main characteristics of each best fitting pdf curve distribution type parameters are also detailed in table s1 see supplemental data along with the results of the preliminary kolmogorov smirnov goodness of fit test the best fitting pdf curves obtained from each distribution of end use parameters allow the stochastic behavior of water consumption at the end use level to be investigated more specifically in particular these findings show that volume per use distributions are fitted by different pdfs based on the end use considered and the characteristics of the respective eud the obtained pdf curves are mostly consistent in the case of shower events fig 9c often assuming a slightly right skewed shape characterized by an upper tail and described by lognormal or gamma distributions a similar behavior is observed for taps fig 9e although covering a range of much smaller volumes and with statistical curves also fitted by weibull distribution as in the case of the eud used in beal and stewart 2011 conversely differences amongst the distributions are clearly distinguishable for end uses not directly human controlled i e appliances figs 9a and 9b and toilet fig 9d these differences are mainly evident in the case of washing machine distributions fig 9b which include two clusters associated with peaks of about 50 80 and 130 150 l load respectively in greater detail the former cluster is tied to european or oceanian reus carried out after year 2008 cubillo gonzález et al 2008 beal and stewart 2011 redhead et al 2013 siriwardene 2018 whereas the latter cluster is related to mainly north american reus conducted before year 2011 bennett and lindstedt 1975 mayer et al 1999 roberts 2005 heinrich 2010 aquacraft 2011 deoreo et al 2011 this difference is most likely due to a variety of temporal and geographical contexts i e study period and location amongst the eud concerned related to different levels of technological development and thus differences in appliance makes and models duration per use distributions are fitted by gamma or lognormal probability distributions in most of the cases sometimes with right skewed pdf curves in the case of individual end uses shower distributions result mainly in line with each other showing peak durations of 5 to 9 min fig 9h whereas differences are observed between tap distributions fig 9j when the 20 s or less peak value indicated in australian or new zealand studies roberts 2005 heinrich et al 2007 mead 2008 redhead et al 2013 siriwardene 2018 is compared against the 30 40 s north american peak values reported by deoreo et al 2011 and deoreo and mayer 2013 flow rate per use distributions are generally fitted by nearly symmetrical shapes in the case of showers fig 9m whereas more skewed distributions emerge in the case of taps fig 9o regarding taps and similarly to the outcomes achieved in the case of tap duration distributions fig 9j differences are observed when the 2 l min peak value indicated in australian or new zealand studies roberts 2005 heinrich et al 2007 mead 2008 redhead et al 2013 siriwardene 2018 are compared against the north american and european peak values of about 4 l min reported by cubillo gonzález et al 2008 deoreo and mayer 2013 and mazzoni et al 2023 small variations in shape and peak values are observed when the frequency per use distributions of different end uses are considered with pdfs generally peaking at about 0 1 0 2 loads person day dishwasher and washing machine 0 7 1 0 uses person day shower and 3 5 flushes person day toilet as limited skewness characterizes the majority of these distributions the above peak values are consistent with the average end use parameter values shown with level 2 of the analysis lastly it is worth observing that the lack of a sufficient number of tap distributions does not allow observations about the frequency of use to be made regarding this end use 3 4 level 4 daily end use profiles information about daily end use profiles is available in the case of 21 eud i e 32 of the total although the majority of reus only show the average end use daily profile some others include several profiles per end use based on season roberts 2005 kowalski and marshallsay 2005 redhead et al 2013 day type siriwardene 2018 or layout of water infrastructure supplying the monitored households willis et al 2011b in all the aforementioned cases we calculated an average daily profile for each reported end use as also described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 levels 1 and 2 of the analysis the results after data digitization and normalization are indicated in fig 10 where box whisker plots of the average end use daily profiles investigated in the reviewed reus are shown we observe peculiar shapes of the daily profiles based on the end use considered because of different water use behaviors although the majority of profiles display minimum values at night and higher values during the day specifically some end uses i e toilet and taps show a smooth profile over the 24 h figs 10d and 10e because people typically make use of these devices almost constantly during the day whereas some others are characterized by marked fluctuations related to periods of increased use this is particularly evident in the case of showers and bathtubs fig 10c which appear to be used mostly in the early morning before leaving home for daily activities and evening when returning home but also applies to the case of dishwasher which is mostly activated after mealtimes fig 10a and washing machine fig 10b whose profile is typically characterized by a single peak in the morning along with a decrease in water consumption during the afternoon in addition the hourly normalized water consumption values available in the literature for each of the 24 h are characterized by quite similar values in the case of toilets and taps meaning that the profiles are mostly close to each other independently of the case study area however higher offsets thus larger differences amongst the eud emerge for dishwasher washing machine shower and bathtub profiles as also observable from the differences between the quartiles of the distribution the largest differences in the values reported in the literature are generally observable in early morning and evening values i e when the largest volumes of water are typically consumed this finding is most likely due to the variety in habits and lifestyles of populations across the globe for instance different peak times of end use water consumption but also different daily distributions emerge from the comparison between north and south european eud the results of which are included in fig s2 see supplemental data different peak times and distributions are likely due to different traditions and climatic conditions and thus different waking times mealtimes and working times with specific reference to the united kingdom and spain where the end use profiles of water consumption have been evaluated by kowalski and marshallsay 2005 and cubillo gonzález et al 2008 respectively the diversity in home return times affects the peak time of shower and bathtub use in the evening between 18 00 and 19 00 in the case of the united kingdom and at around 21 00 in the case of spain similarly a temporal offset of 2 3 h is observed when washing machine daily profiles are compared although the most relevant discrepancies between the two aforementioned case study areas are mainly evident in the case of showers bathtubs and washing machines different peak times and distributions due to different habits also emerge in the case of toilets and taps in fact the analysis reveals that different waking times have effects on the morning peak time of these end uses ranging from 8 00 in the case of the united kingdom to 10 00 or even later in the case of spain finally the box whisker plot of the leakage daily profiles reported in the literature is also shown fig 10f as expected leakage profiles appear nearly constant throughout the day because domestic leakages are typically permanent e g those due to pipe breaks or leaking valves however a slight increase in leakage rate is observed in diurnal hours this may be due to the fact that most of the reus investigating leakage profiles roberts 2005 deoreo et al 2011 willis et al 2011b arbon et al 2014 deoreo et al 2016 siriwardene 2018 also consider temporary leakages e g due to momentary valve blocks which are more likely to occur when end uses are activated with higher frequency 3 5 level 5 determinants of end use consumption and parameters information about the determinants of end use water consumption and parameters are available in the literature for only 21 eud i e 32 of the total we computed the r index for each possible combination of end uses determinants and parameters investigated in the reus the results are shown in fig 11 the heat maps shown in fig 11 reveal that the majority of reus available in the literature focus on the determinants of daily per capita end use water consumption and frequency of use whereas less relevance is given to the investigation of the determinants of end use volume duration and flow rate per use this is also consistent with the findings achieved in similar studies conducted with regard to the household level of detail e g cominola et al 2021b concerning daily per capita end use water consumption the most explored determinants are socio demographic specifically as regards occupancy rate and family income in the case of occupancy rate some studies simply report the daily per capita end use water consumption average values related to different household family sizes whereas others e g mead 2008 make use of optimization methods to obtain the parameter values of the function best approximating the data observed in general the studies agree that daily per capita water consumption is inversely correlated with the occupancy rate in the case of toilets cubillo gonzález et al 2008 beal and stewart 2011 lee et al 2012 willis et al 2013 arbon et al 2014 and reveal different behaviors although characterized by a decrease in the per capita water consumption along with an increase in the occupancy rate in the case of showers and taps roberts 2005 cubillo gonzález et al 2008 beal et al 2012 makki et al 2013 willis et al 2013 redhead et al 2013 arbon et al 2014 siriwardene 2018 moreover discordant findings emerge when the impacts of family size on washing machine per capita water consumption are compared in some cases characterized by a positive correlation with high occupancy rates willis et al 2013 in some others by a negative correlation roberts 2005 mead 2008 arbon et al 2014 or not correlated beal et al 2012 furthermore no marked correlations are found in the case of dishwashers and bathtubs with the daily per capita water consumption on the latter end use more affected by family type e g number of children as in redhead et al 2013 and arbon et al 2014 arbon et al 2014 show that also family type has an impact on water consumption highlighting a higher daily per capita consumption of showers in households without children and even higher in families with teenagers concerning income the studies available in the literature reveal on the one hand a positive correlation with daily per capita water consumption specifically as regards showers makki et al 2013 arbon et al 2014 but also bathtubs and taps hussien et al 2016 these findings are also confirmed by a study by bastidas pacheco et al 2023 relating the daily per capita water consumption of these end uses to the daily total per capita water consumption which may be reasonably considered a rather good substitute indicator of determinants such as family type and income on the other hand a negative correlation sometimes emerges in the case of toilets arbon et al 2014 hussien et al 2016 siriwardene 2018 this finding is most likely because higher income families can have newer and more efficient toilet cisterns allowing water savings upon the activation of flushers however this negative correlation is not observed in the case of human controlled end uses i e showers bathtubs taps whose duration of use thus consumption is at the discretion of householders and may be less moderate in the case of high income residents moreover as in the case of occupancy rate different behaviors emerge from the analysis of the correlation between income and the per capita water consumption for washing machine these parameters show a positive correlation in some cases beal and stewart 2011 and a negative correlation in some others arbon et al 2014 siriwardene 2018 as far as the determinants of end use parameters are concerned the literature lacks sufficient information about the drivers of end use volume duration and flow rate per use except shower duration whose relationship with householders age is explored in several studies reporting that teenagers and young adults typically have longer showers than older people foekema and engelsma 2001 kanne 2005 foekema et al 2008 foekema and van thiel 2011 arbon et al 2014 van thiel 2014 van thiel 2017 moreover more attention is paid to the determinants of the daily per capita frequency of use on the one hand an inverse correlation between daily per capita frequency of shower use and the number of children is reported by some authors roberts 2005 mead 2008 along with a negative correlation between daily per capita frequency of washing machine use and occupancy rate roberts 2005 redhead et al 2013 arbon et al 2014 siriwardene 2018 on the other hand the correlation between end use frequency of use and occupancy rate householders age family type income or socio economic region is deeply explored in the series of dutch studies conducted between 2001 and 2017 foekema and engelsma 2001 kanne 2005 foekema et al 2008 foekema and van thiel 2014 van thiel 2014 van thiel 2017 specifically the studies show a positive correlation between householders age and frequency of toilet use and also demonstrate that bathtubs are more frequently used in households with young children 3 6 level 6 efficiency and diffusion of water saving end uses considerations about efficiency and diffusion of water saving end uses are available in the literature with respect to 25 eud i e 38 of the total mainly focused on american or oceanian case study areas where the analyses about water conservation and end use efficiency are motivated by the presence of areas generally affected by relevant water scarcity issues and drought conditions carrão et al 2016 specifically different approaches are adopted to explore the topic and therefore results are presented in different ways making normalization and comparison impractical only the most relevant key points are discussed in the following whereas the detailed findings of each study are shown in table s2 supplemental data first it is worth noting that many studies presenting results about water saving end use efficiency and diffusion aim to promote water conservation different levels of water savings are achieved by adopting different strategies ranging from the installation of alarm displays in proximity to some end uses for providing real time feedback about water use willis et al 2010b to the retrofitting of some end uses with newer and more efficient ones such as low flow showerheads and toilets anderson et al 1993 but also tap aerators and water saving washing machines darmody et al 1999 mayer et al 2000 mayer et al 2003 roberts 2005 deoreo and mayer 2013 willis et al 2010b observe that the average volume and duration per shower use decreases by 10 and 18 respectively after the installation of alarm displays in showers see the related values in table 3 anderson et al 1993 mayer et al 2000 mayer et al 2003 roberts 2005 and deoreo and mayer 2013 observe a drop in the daily per capita water consumption of the end use categories involved in retrofitting along with a decrease in their volume per use as shown in table 2 and table 3 some studies also show a general increase in the daily frequency of some end uses after retrofitting e g toilets anderson et al 1993 mayer et al 2000 mayer et al 2003 along with an increase in the average duration of some others e g showers deoreo and mayer 2013 however the effects of these increases in the duration and or frequency of water use are balanced by the higher efficiency of water saving devices overall resulting in lower daily per capita water consumption values again in this context bastidas pacheco et al 2023 compare shower toilet and tap parameters obtained by monitoring against those defined by national standards to evaluate the efficiency level for the aforementioned end uses demonstrating that there are conservation opportunities especially with reference to toilet and showerhead retrofitting finally it is also worth noting that studies exploring the potential water conservation achievable by retrofitting highlight that this strategy can have considerable implications on peak consumption beal and stewart 2014b with the most consistent savings obtainable by installing more efficient toilets and washing machines heinrich et al 2007 other studies about efficiency of water saving end uses mayer et al 1999 loh and coghlan 2003 roberts 2005 mead 2008 blokker 2010 blokker et al 2010 aquacraft 2011 beal and stewart 2011 compare the characteristics of different end use makes models and year of installation along with the technologies already available in the monitored households such as top and front load washing machines standard and low flow toilets and normal and efficient showerheads and their related effects on water consumption the studies show different consumption patterns and lower per capita water consumption values in the case of low flow end uses and front load washing machines however as in the case of retrofitting studies they reveal an increase in some characteristics of water use for efficient end uses such as longer shower durations mead 2008 arbon et al 2014 the third group of studies investigate the evolution of end use water consumption over the last decades along with the diffusion of water saving fixtures on the market in replacement of the traditional ones foekema and engelsma 2001 loh and coghlan 2003 white et al 2004 cubillo gonzález et al 2008 blokker 2010 blokker et al 2010 aquacraft 2011 agudelo vera et al 2014 the studies show a general reduction of the per capita water consumption of different end uses although with some exceptions in fact loh and coghlan 2003 observe an increase in the daily per capita water consumption of washing machines between the early 1980s and the late 1990s whereas the aquacraft 2011 study reports an increase in the shower water consumption due to a higher shower duration and frequency of use when the values observed in households built after the year 2000 are compared against those presented by mayer et al 1999 similar observations are also made in the study conducted by deoreo et al 2016 showing an increase in toilet tap and dishwasher frequency of use moreover agudelo vera et al 2014 observe a decrease in the water consumption and daily frequency of use of some end uses over time due to technological improvements and changes in people s habits e g the reduction of baths in favour of showers the study also indicates that the highest efficiency of water saving end uses has been achieved in the case of washing machines dishwashers and toilets with reductions in the average water consumption per use between 1992 and 2010 of about 40 30 and 20 respectively whereas different diffusion rates have emerged based on the end use considered ranging from almost 100 in the case of washing machines to 60 in the case of dishwashers and 50 70 in the case of efficient toilets and showers similar results for toilet dual flush systems are reported in the white et al 2004 study where a sample of over 2500 000 australian users is considered for which a progressive increase in the diffusion of dual flush toilets is observed ranging from 0 in 1980 to 74 in 2010 moreover the foekema et al 2001 blokker 2010 and blokker et al 2010 studies report an increase in the diffusion of dishwashers in the netherlands from 45 to 54 years 2001 2007 along with a decrease in the diffusion of bathtubs the above studies also report that the diffusion of dishwashers positively relates to household occupancy rate whereas the diffusion of bathtub is nowadays mainly dependant on wealth class income coherently with some of the considerations made by cubillo gonzález et al 2008 3 7 summary of study findings in light of the variety of outcomes presented and discussed in the study in relation to the characteristics of end use water consumption from several points of view the major findings that emerged at each level of the analysis can be summarized as follows daily per capita end use water consumption level 1 the highest daily per capita water consumption is typically tied to showers toilets and washing machines whereas lower values are generally related to taps dishwashers and bathtubs with these end uses almost entirely replaced by showers nowadays moreover the analysis points out that the largest decrease in the end use water consumption of developed countries over the last three decades is related to washing machine toilet and tap uses whereas a slight increase has emerged in the case of showers end use parameter average values level 2 volume per use and frequency of use are generally the most explored end use parameters whereas duration and flow rate per use are typically investigated only in the case of specific end uses such as showers and taps in general the highest volumes per use are observed for bathtubs followed by washing machines and showers in addition as far as the end use frequency is concerned the analysis reveals considerable differences amongst the end uses ranging from a maximum of more than 10 times per person per day taps to a minimum of about 0 1 bathtub end use statistical parameter distributions level 3 while less common than the end use parameter average values a large variety of end use parameter distributions are observed as in the case of level 2 of analysis volume per use and frequency of use are mostly investigated whereas duration and flow rate distributions are generally reported only for showers and taps focusing on volume per use distributions are mostly in line in the case of human controlled end uses showers taps leading to greater differences in the case of appliances and toilets daily end use profiles level 4 the studies reviewed reveal different daily patterns based on the end uses in general smaller fluctuations throughout the day are observed for toilets and taps which also relate to end uses with the smallest differences in the daily profiles available in the literature whereas more heterogeneous patterns are observed in the case of appliances bathtubs and showers because of different habits and lifestyles from around the world determinants of end use water consumption and parameters level 5 only the determinants of daily per capita end use water consumption i e the socio demographic ones such as family size and income and end use frequency of use are explored and discussed in a sufficient number of eud concerning family size most of the related reus report an inverse correlation between the occupancy rate and the daily per capita water consumption of toilets showers and taps with a variety of behaviors in the case of appliances moreover regarding the effects of income on water use it emerges that although higher income households typically have more efficient devices their end use water consumption is generally higher efficiency and diffusion of water saving end uses level 6 most of the reus including considerations about water saving efficiency and diffusion of the related eud show that the strategies with the aim of water conservation such as retrofitting programs are generally helpful in reducing water consumption although the installation of low flow devices may result in longer durations per use or higher frequency of use the general decrease in the end use water consumption sometimes related to an increase in the duration of use or frequency per use is likewise reported by the studies making observations about the evolution of water consumption in the last decades which also reveal an increasing diffusion of efficient water saving end uses dishwashers low flow showerheads and toilet flushers water saving washing machines along with the replacement of the most consuming ones 4 conclusions in this review study we provided a comprehensive overview of the state of the art about research in the field of residential water consumption at the end use level specifically we reviewed 114 residential end use studies reus available in the literature and qualitatively and quantitatively investigated the information about the characteristics of 66 related end use databases eud by carrying out a multi level analysis to evaluate the main perspectives from around the world in terms of water consumption based on the results available in the literature our research revealed that most of the reus mainly focus on the evaluation of the daily per capita end use water consumption and the average values of end use parameters i e levels 1 2 of the analysis whereas generally less relevance is given to the investigation of end use parameter distributions daily profiles determinants and efficiency i e levels 3 6 the findings of this study will likely be of interest to different actors involved in water resources management and water demand management first the findings of this work may be a reference for water utilities seeking information about the main characteristics of water consumption at the end use level at both larger i e worldwide and smaller i e regional spatial scales the availability of this information may allow water utilities to introduce or rethink strategies for more efficient management of water resources and infrastructure e g revision of water tariffs and incentives development of campaigns aimed to raise consumers awareness but also planning of additional measurement campaigns or end use studies with the objective of obtaining more detailed end use water consumption data second the end use data presented in the current work can support research involved in the field of water systems in developing and validating demand models methods for water end use disaggregation and classification or technologies for water reuse recycling and conservation in addition the findings of the study may help understand which aspects have been mostly explored in recent research and if needed identify the reus of interest based on their geographical and methodological details third the study can help citizens gain knowledge about the main characteristics of residential end use water consumption from different contexts across the globe and in their living areas the data reported here would be a valid benchmark against which to compare consumer habits and behaviors thus encouraging more conscious and sustainable use of water beside the specific findings of this research we highlight some general outcomes and outline recommendations for future research overall data availability has been demonstrated to still be a substantial challenge considerably limiting open science and reproducible research choi et al 2021 indeed in light of the unavailability of the vast majority of eud in the literature the analyses conducted in this study were carried out by relying only on the information reported in the related reus this may have affected the results presented since the amount of information obtainable from written publications is smaller than the information potentially obtainable by having access to the actual end use data i e the entire eud uncertainties in the reported outcomes may have arisen due to the variety of methods ranging from data averaging to digitization adopted to standardize the variety of results reported in the literature these results are also based on different data collection techniques data resolutions monitoring periods and end use data gathering approaches which all limit the possibility to observe generalized behaviors and differences across studies more specifically the comparison of time dependant end use parameter values could be affected by the exploitation of data collected at different sampling resolutions in fact although all the data exploited in the analysis of end use parameters are characterized by rather fine resolutions e g 1 10 s which have been demonstrated to be typically sufficient to grasp all different end uses of water heydari et al 2022 the comparison of data collected at different resolutions may still affect the accuracy in quantifying residential end use parameter values especially in relation to short duration events this suggests new data sampling to be conducted at the highest possible resolution to allow end use characterization and additional comparisons to be performed with reduced level of uncertainty as also suggested by cominola et al 2018a and bastidas pacheco et al 2022 again we note that the majority of eud were obtained through disaggregation and classification approaches the performance of which can considerably vary across the methods therefore errors in eud may also be due to different method accuracies in disaggregating and classifying end use events along with the potential inability of some methods to successfully detect overlapping water uses when these are not excluded from analysis a priori however this aspect could not be considered in our study due to the lack of sufficient information in the reus concerned lastly it is worth pointing out that despite the relevant number of reus and eud reported and reviewed in the current research some others could have been missed by the authors and thus may be missing in this study due to limited diffusion in the literature or because of publication in languages different from those known by the authors in conclusion our results can be considered as a first step to present and classify a large amount of fragmented data and to outline what is currently available in the literature it is also a sound starting point from which future studies on residential end uses of water can be developed there is still wide room for investigation on many relevant open issues that should be addressed in future research on the one hand although not yet possible based on the very limited number of currently available datasets the realization of a fully open access end use database including a comprehensive number of water events observed and collected in a variety of spatiotemporal contexts would represent an important step forward allowing for detailed and wide analyses to be carried out going beyond the limits currently affecting the literature on residential end uses of water on the other hand in depth evaluations should be carried out in relation to aspects such as the identification of the required household sample size and monitoring period duration to properly determine statistically significant water consumption features this would enable water utilities and researchers to successfully compensate for the differences in water consumption behaviors observable over too limited periods or household samples while reducing monitoring efforts and the invested resources author contributions conceptualization f m s a m b

15132,a detailed characterization of residential water consumption is essential for ensuring urban water systems capability to cope with changing water resources availability and water demands induced by growing population urbanization and climate change several studies have been conducted in the last decades to investigate the characteristics of residential water consumption with data at a sufficiently fine temporal resolution for grasping individual end uses of water in this paper we systematically review 114 studies to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art research about water consumption at the end use level specifically we contribute with 1 an in depth discussion of the most relevant findings of each study highlighting which water end use characteristics were so far prioritized for investigation in different case studies and water demand modelling and management studies from around the world and 2 a multi level analysis to qualitatively and quantitatively compare the most common results available in the literature i e daily per capita end use water consumption end use parameter average values and statistical distributions end use daily profiles end use determinants and considerations about efficiency and diffusion of water saving end uses our findings can support water utilities consumers and researchers 1 in understanding which key aspects of water end uses were primarily investigated in the last decades and 2 in exploring their main features considering different geographical cultural and socio economic regions of the world graphical abstract

1 introduction the availability of water resources is of concern for many regions worldwide mcdonald et al 2010 suero et al 2012 growing population and urbanization have led to large areas under water stress with population growth often coupled with variations in the per capita water consumption rates cosgrove and loucks 2015 population growth can stress local water resources even in areas with decreasing per capita water demands dieter et al 2018 moreover water shortages which currently affect more than 500 million people worldwide are expected to be compounded as a consequence of climate change sønderlund et al 2016 and feed back to changes in water demands across potentially conflicting sectors such as drastic increases in the amount of water needed for irrigation and urban activities due to increasingly frequent and intense drought events evans and sadler 2008 effective planning and management of water systems are thus of great importance to cope with the grand challenges posed by population climate and water resources availability avni et al 2015 however the effectiveness of water supply operations and water demand management strategies to meet future demand under different scenarios depends on our knowledge on where when and how water is being used cardell oliver et al 2016 this has motivated an increasing interest over time towards characterizing water consumption distribution across space and time in the water research literature sanchez et al 2018 in the last decades many studies have been conducted to investigate water consumption characteristics at different spatio temporal scales in some cases danielson 1979 tanverakul and lee 2013 water consumption is explored by relying on monthly to yearly water data typically read manually by water utility technicians for billing however as reported by cominola et al 2015 billed water data generally allow extracting information only to evaluate aggregate volumes of water consumption at a coarse spatiotemporal detail i e entire city or districts and on a coarse temporal scale i e monthly or seasonal to overcome this limitation more attention has recently been devoted to the investigation of water consumption at finer spatiotemporal resolutions i e at the household or end use scale and with hourly to sub minute temporal resolution this finer resolution monitoring was made possible by technological development and the diffusion of smart metering solutions gurung et al 2015 darby 2010 spanning from add on data loggers allowing water consumption data to be gathered in more detail than conventional meters to digital meters capable of automatically processing and transmitting those data to the utility for monitoring and billing purposes smart meters and paired software bastidas pacheco et al 2020 2021b enable detailed analysis on heterogeneous water consumption behaviors and sub daily patterns cubillo gonzález et al 2008 beal and stewart 2011 horsburgh et al 2017 cominola et al 2018b and can be used to develop customized feedback and water conservation programs mayer et al 2000 willis et al 2010b cominola et al 2021a when real time information is available smart metre data can also be exploited to provide real time alerts for domestic leakages or anomalous water consumption patterns britton et al 2013 luciani et al 2019 mayer 2022 thus enabling prompt actions with consequent water conservation or even life saving salomons and housh 2022 furthermore smart meters allow new detailed information about water consumption to be obtained up to the level of individual end uses i e domestic micro components such as shower taps washing machine etc this information includes daily volumes of water consumed along with the daily water consumption profiles and routines at the end use level and other parameters e g duration volume flow rate and frequency of use of individual water uses with increasing frequency greater focus has been given in the literature to the characterization of water consumption at the level of individual end use in the residential sector mainly because residential consumers typically represent the highest number of water users in cities aksela and aksela 2011 residential end uses of water consumption had been scarcely explored before the introduction of smart metering technologies not only digital meters but also in a broader sense the previously developed data logging solutions and paired software for data processing due to the effort required to obtain this information with previously available tools only few water consumption investigations at the end use level were performed prior to the early 1990s they were based on data gathering campaigns developed using surveys audits and questionnaires to characterize the features of domestic appliances and people s habits thus estimating water use e g butler 1991 customer self reported end use water consumption studies have proved to be highly inaccurate as consumers typically have a poor understanding of their water use habits compared to norms and best practices beal et al 2013 nowadays residential water consumption data at the end use level can be used for a variety of purposes such as training and testing water demand models e g blokker et al 2010 or the calibration and validation of water end use disaggregation methods mayer et al 1999 nguyen et al 2013a nguyen et al 2018 mazzoni et al 2021 in addition the availability of this information may support the development of technologies for water reuse and recycling dixon et al 1999 or strategies aimed at increasing consciousness and awareness of water use beal et al 2011b liu et al 2016 water utilities can rely on detailed water end use information to review and improve their incentive and water pricing arrangement gleick et al 2003 whereas users can receive helpful feedback and then change their water consumption behavior willis et al 2010b stewart et al 2018 feedback targeted to specific consumer s water end use consumption behaviors has great potential to conserve water during water scarcity periods fielding et al 2013 yet despite the advantages of end use water consumption data collecting and efficiently processing them is still challenging on the one hand the intrusive monitoring of each domestic appliance may be impractical and householders are unlikely to provide permission to install this intrusive instrumentation cominola et al 2015 on the other hand when non intrusive approaches are considered automated techniques for the end use disaggregation of the water consumption time series generally require information about end use parameters that may be unavailable to the analysts mazzoni et al 2021 in contrast manual approaches typically involve considerable human effort and time due to the large amounts of data to analyse along with potential bias and scarce reproducibility deriving from expert based judgement deoreo et al 1996 while we acknowledge the above limitations related to the direct or indirect collection of end use water consumption data we believe that general analyses water consumption models and technological development may still be conducted by exploiting the ensemble of data and information already available yet fragmented in the literature indeed the literature published in the past two decades includes numerous peer reviewed journal publications or water utility reports exploring water consumption characteristics at the end use level moreover these studies consider different case studies methodological approaches adopted to obtain end use information and end use database features finally there are considerable differences in the numerical end use results shown thus systematic reviews comparisons and elaborations of these fragmented data may promisingly lead to new applications in the field of water resources management in this context some recent studies present the main characteristics of the major residential end use studies available in the literature such as location sample size and approach adopted to obtain end use data nguyen et al 2013a cominola et al 2015 more specifically in a review by di mauro et al 2021 over one hundred studies on water consumption are clustered based on their spatiotemporal scale i e ranging from urban to end use level and from daily to sub minute resolution and the level of accessibility of their related datasets in addition a recent study conducted by abu bakar et al 2021 provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of end use disaggregation and classification techniques along with a discussion of the results proposed by several studies about the determinants of water consumption limited to the household level at the end use level a summary comparison of the daily per capita water consumption values indicated in different studies is available in mayer et al 1999 beal and stewart 2011 gurung et al 2014 and jordán cuebas et al 2018 however to the authors knowledge an extensive review about residential end uses of water not only highlighting similarities and differences amongst the studies available in the literature but also systematically comparing all the numerical results about end use water consumption globally is still missing the current work aims to fill the abovementioned gap by providing a comprehensive review of the existing end use studies conducted globally in the field of residential water consumption along with an in depth discussion of their scope features and results to fully explore and quantify end use characteristics in different contexts worldwide unlike other reviews available in the literature this research is structured as a multi level analysis including 1 a quantitative comparison of all the most common metrics about residential end use water consumption i e per capita daily end use water consumption end use parameter average values end use parameter distributions end use daily profiles and 2 a qualitative discussion about additional aspects of interest in the field of end use water consumption i e considerations about end use determinants and water saving efficiency we believe that the findings of the current work may be applied to several contexts for which end use water consumption data are needed e g demand characterization training and testing of demand models development of technologies for water reuse and conservation adoption of strategies to increase people s awareness revision of water utility rate and billing system water infrastructure planning and management ultimately the results of this study may support water utilities and researchers in understanding which aspects were primarily explored in recent research and identifying the end use databases and studies carried out in different geographical cultural and socio economic regions of the world this review is organized as follows section 2 includes the methodological details of the literature review conducted to explore the state of the art of research about residential end use water consumption along with a preliminary overview of the main characteristics of the reviewed studies and datasets and a presentation of the multi level methodology adopted for end use data analysis section 3 illustrates the quantitative and qualitative outcomes emerging from multi level analysis conducted to compare the information included in the reviewed studies and datasets finally the study s most relevant findings and implications are highlighted in section 4 along with some considerations for future research directions 2 materials and methods 2 1 literature review methods and search outcome we carried out a systematic search of peer reviewed journal papers water utility reports and other grey literature material i e theses research projects presentations etc to explore the current state of research on residential water consumption at the end use level the search was conducted between october 2020 and november 2022 specifically we searched for publications related to residential water consumption at the end use level in the elsevier s scopus database elsevier 2021 as well as in some of the most accessed water journal editor databases such as those of the international water association and the american society of civil engineers we initially searched for combinations of three keywords i e residential water and end uses and limited the subject area to engineering this search led to an initial paper set of 271 publications mostly but not only in english we then manually checked the title and abstract of each publication and retained only those fitting the scope of our study in greater detail 40 publications were retained at this stage finally we expanded the resulting set of papers by including other studies cited in the bibliography of the retained publications the final paper set considered for the following analysis includes a total of 114 studies presenting or making use of residential water consumption data at the end use level we reviewed these 114 studies reported in table 1 and hereinafter called residential end use studies reus to explore their contribution and implications to residential water consumption at the end use level a first analysis evaluated the objectives of each study the primary of which was considered for classification fig 1 fig 1 reveals that in most cases 42 studies i e 37 research was conducted to explore the characteristics of end use water consumption in some specific geographical areas however end use data were widely exploited also for other purposes namely to evaluate the potential for water conservation and recycling 17 studies i e 15 explore the determinants of water consumption 12 studies i e 11 develop or validate algorithms for water end use disaggregation and classification 11 studies i e 10 and for water demand modelling 9 studies i e 8 or the retrieval of end use information and evaluations about end use data gathering and processing 9 studies i e 8 other applications albeit less common include investigation of strategies for wastewater management and or the design of sewer systems data exploitation to assess end use peak demand or evaluate end use probability of use or end use data analysis to quantify variations in users perception and awareness in addition we investigated the following characteristics 1 location 2 period 3 household sample size 4 average duration of the monitoring period per household if conducted 5 temporal resolution of monitoring if conducted 6 approach adopted for end use data gathering i e end use monitoring interaction with householders or end use disaggregation method and 7 dataset availability all the above reus characteristics are summarized in table 1 our review reveals that the 114 reus refer to 66 different databases hereinafter called end use databases eud specifically some eud are exploited in more than one reus see e g the british eud used by butler 1991 1993 or the southeast queensland eud exploited by beal et al 2011a 2011b 2013 and other authors in contrast other eud are used in only one reus it is also worth noting that some reus have been conducted by exploiting only part of their related eud willis et al 2009c gato trinidad et al 2011 rathnayaka et al 2015 whereas some other have exploited it entirely bennett and linstedt 1975 mayer et al 2000 fontdecaba et al 2013 alharsha et al 2022 2 2 eud clustering we first clustered eud based on the fields of investigation mentioned above see table 1 overall the fields of investigation selected for clustering are in line with those considered by di mauro et al 2021 however it is worth highlighting that the scope of our study extends the study by di mauro et al 2021 here eud clustering is conducted only to make an initial and qualitative discrimination amongst the eud concerned thus providing an organized dataset to achieve the key aim of the work i e conducting a multi level comparison both qualitative and quantitative of their end use parameters and characteristics eud were clustered manually and exclusively based on the information reported in their related reus this was done with the aim of standardizing the analysis in light of the fact that the majority of eud are not publicly available as detailed below from an operational standpoint we adopted the following criteria for clustering 1 concerning the study period we clustered eud based on the first year of data collection 2 concerning the sample size the average duration of monitoring per household if reported and the temporal data sampling resolution if reported we clustered eud based on the highest values inferred in the respective reus by way of example in the case of eud including water consumption data collected during two subsequent periods the former conducted on a smaller sample and the latter extended to a larger sample the number of households making up the latter sample is considered for clustering similarly when a measurement campaign is conducted in two or more stages the first with a coarser and the second with a finer data sampling temporal resolution the finest resolution is considered as a reference value for clustering finally 3 concerning dataset availability and similarly to di mauro et al 2021 we clustered eud in three main categories of data accessibility open access if available in the literature and freely downloadable from the web restricted if not directly available but details on how to obtain them are explicitly reported in the related reus and unavailable if no information on how to access or purchase them is reported in the related reus the results of the eud clustering are shown in fig 2 the following findings emerge for each considered criterion geographical area fig 2a eud include data collected across all the continents but mainly in north america 18 databases europe 18 databases and oceania 13 a lower number of eud include data collected in asia 10 africa 4 and south america 1 in general a linkage between the level of digitalization of water utilities and the respective number of eud is observed because their realization typically requires technologies and tools that may not be available in the most underdeveloped areas of the world moreover a higher number of analyses hence eud is observed for areas that have been strongly hit by water scarcity and drought conditions such as the western coast of the united states or australia see e g mayer et al 1999 mayer et al 2003 beal and stewart 2011 and beal et al 2014 study period fig 2b although reus have been conducted since the 1970s bennett and lindstedt 1975 siegrist et al 1976 most eud have been developed only after 2000 this finding is mainly due to the technological development in the late 1990s and specifically the advent of smart metering technologies making available water consumption data at a fine spatial and or temporal resolution i e household or end use level cominola et al 2015 gurung et al 2015 this aspect also explains why these first reus were generally conducted in developed countries in contrast developing countries such as sri lanka thailand and vietnam have undergone reus only since the last decade sivakumaran and aramaki 2010 otaki et al 2011 otaki et al 2013 however information on the first year of data collection is not available for a non negligible group of 16 eud i e 24 of the total household sample size fig 2c the majority of the eud include data collected for samples of households in a range between ten and a hundred 17 eud i e 26 of the total or between hundred and a thousand 24 eud i e 36 only a limited number of eud include data observed for samples smaller than ten households 11 i e 17 or larger than a thousand 9 i e 14 in general household sample size typically dependant on the scope of the research is rather limited in the earliest studies for which manual or laborious processes have been generally carried out to obtain water end use data for instance in the eud developed by deoreo et al 1996 the first to be developed by relying on water consumption data at sub minute resolution 16 households were monitored their observed water consumption was manually disaggregated and classified into individual end uses based on the parameters of the water use events recorded at the household level considerable increases in the sample size were made possible by introducing automated methods for data processing and classification mayer et al 1999 kowalski and marshallsay 2003 beal et al 2011a as far as the relationship between household sample size and water consumption results is regarded it is expected that increasing the household sample can lead to eud that are more representative of end use water consumption in a specific location however it is worth observing that to date no reus primarily aiming to explore the effects of sample size on water consumption results thus defining guidelines that can aid water utilities and researchers to identify an optimal sample size have been conducted making this research question still unsolved household monitoring period average fig 2d regarding the eud for which water consumption data have been obtained employing direct measurements different monitoring durations per household are observed ranging from a minimum of a few days i e less than one week to a maximum of more than one year although a marked correlation is not evident between the length of the monitoring period and the other clustering variables an inverse relationship between the length of the monitoring period and temporal data sampling resolution is sometimes observed regarding eud with similar household sample size this emerges for example when the eud presented by mayer et al 1999 and deoreo et al 2011 is compared against the eud reported by cole and stewart 2013 indeed in the former cases about one thousand households were monitored for around two weeks at the 10 s sampling resolution in contrast the latter analysis exploits hourly resolution data from approximately 3000 households lastly for 14 of the eud data were not obtained by the monitoring but with different methods e g interaction with users as reported by bastidas pacheco et al 2023 collecting water consumption data for short periods can lead to results that may not be representative of varying water consumption patterns given that this also depends on seasonal factors although some eud include data collected over different periods of the year in order to explore seasonal water consumption behaviors e g those exploited by mayer et al 1999 roberts 2005 heinrich 2007 beal and stewart 2011 and redhead et al 2013 it is worth noting that also the evaluation of the effects of data monitoring periods on water consumption temporal variability is still an open issue temporal data sampling resolution fig 2e several authors highlight that the introduction of smart metering technologies allows water consumption data to be collected not only at a fine spatial resolution but also at a fine temporal resolution i e from several minutes up to a few seconds cominola et al 2015 clifford et al 2018 in the case of the reviewed reus different monitoring temporal resolutions are observed ranging from a minimum of 1 s to a maximum of less than one reading per month which is in line with the traditional resolution of water metre readings for billing purposes moreover the reus review reveals that in the case of coarse temporal resolution of monitoring it is typically harder to identify all individual end uses of water as also demonstrated by cominola et al 2018a bastidas pacheco et al 2022 and heydari et al 2022 by way of example concerning the hervey bay australia eud including aggregate water consumption data collected at hourly temporal resolution cole and stewart 2013 only limited discriminations are made between indoor and outdoor water use in contrast du plessis et al 2018 reveal that the same discrimination might be done also at the urban level by calculating a water balance i e by relying on household water consumption data at a very coarse resolution i e monthly coupled with information obtained by monitoring wastewater flowing in sewer systems however it is worth noting that detailed information about individual end uses of water is typically obtainable only when data are available at sufficiently fine temporal resolution i e more than one reading per minute in fact as reported by cominola et al 2018a and heydari et al 2022 both on synthetic and real world data such a resolution generally allows end use disaggregation and classification with acceptable accuracy at least for the main end uses this finding explains why most of the eud reviewed include data with a temporal sampling resolution of at least one reading per minute i e 26 of the 51 eud for which this information is available end use data gathering approach fig 2f although some eud were obtained by directly monitoring each domestic end use anderson et al 1993 edwards and martin 1995 kim et al 2007 otaki et al 2008 the economic practical and technological limitations related to this kind of approach have motivated the introduction of non intrusive techniques based on manual or automated processing of the data collected at the household level i e at the domestic inlet point in proximity to the water metre to obtain end use information i e at the level of individual appliance fixture from an operational standpoint this end use level determination can be either achieved utilizing audits reports or questionnaires submitted to users butler 1991 ghisi and oliveira 2007 shan et al 2015 alharsha et al 2018 díaz et al 2021 or by applying manual semi automated or automated methods for water end use disaggregation and classification such as those proposed by mayer et al 1999 kowalski and marshallsay 2003 nguyen et al 2013a and mazzoni et al 2021 some studies adopt hybrid approaches coupling different techniques such as direct monitoring of only a limited subset of end uses coupled with interaction with the users to infer information on other water end uses bennett and linstedt 1975 siegrist et al 1976 brown and caldwell consulting engineers 1984 otaki et al 2017 in general the earliest studies were typically carried out by exploiting analogue tools to record water consumption data i e chart recorders driven by the water metre and by manually processing the data collected conversely in the case of larger or more recent eud end use information is mainly achieved by automatically processing aggregate water consumption data collected at a very fine temporal resolution mayer et al 1999 cubillo gonzález et al 2008 deoreo and mayer 2013 overall the application of methods for end use disaggregation and classification of household level data is the most commonly used technique to obtain information about the end uses of water i e adopted in 23 of the eud discovered or 35 however it is worth observing that eud obtained from data disaggregation and classification may be characterized by different levels of uncertainty based on the accuracy of the method considered along with the inability of some of them to detect overlapping water use events or the a priori exclusion of overlapping events during data cleaning two aspects which are hardly ever discussed in the related reus except those aimed at presenting new methods thus due to the lack of sufficient information eud uncertainty in relation to disaggregation and classification performance will not be considered in the current study dataset availability fig 2g the vast majority of eud is unavailable in the literature 52 i e 79 whereas only a small group have open or restricted access 8 and 6 i e 12 and 9 respectively more specifically most open access eud have been published in recent years e g eud exploited by jordán cuebas et al 2018 di mauro et al 2020 2022 bethke et al 2021 otaki et al 2022 heydari et al 2022 arsene et al 2022 and bastidas pacheco et al 2023 on the one hand this is likely due to technological factors making digital data more available and shareable as also highlighted by di mauro et al 2021 on the other hand this increasing trend in eud accessibility may be fostered by the new policies typically adopted by scientific journals encouraging authors to publicly share data for transparency and reproducibility purposes in fact the acknowledgement and awareness of the reproducibility challenge facing computational environmental modelling fields are currently growing choi et al 2021 conversely only a few instances of open access or even simply restricted eud published in less recent years exist i e eud exploited by mayer et al 1999 2004 beal and stewart 2011 and deoreo and mayer 2013 overall it emerges that despite the recent increase in open access eud end use data availability still represents a significant challenge in the spirit of open science and reproducible research this motivates the current study of individual eud characteristics and outcomes by relying only on the information reported in the reus available in the literature also due to the aim of standardizing the methodology for database analysis 2 3 eud processing we systematically compared the eud based on results reported in the literature by applying a six level analysis fig 3 this multi level analysis aims to explore the characteristics of end use water consumption from several points of view revealing similarities and differences amongst the eud concerning level 1 daily per capita end use water consumption level 2 end use parameter average values level 3 end use statistical parameter distributions level 4 end use daily profiles level 5 end use water consumption determinants and level 6 efficiency and diffusion of water saving end uses 2 3 1 level 1 daily per capita end use water consumption for each eud including information about daily per capita water consumption at the end use level we considered the following categories of indoor water consumption dishwasher d washing machine wm shower s bathtub b toilet flusher f taps t leakages l and other uses o this latter including all the indoor water uses which cannot be included in other categories e g evaporative cooler garbage disposal or ambiguous water uses e g laundry or dishwashing if no information is available about the type of use i e manual or automated specifically for each eud and end use category we processed data as follows for reus presenting daily per capita average values we directly considered the reported values once converted to l person day for reus presenting the end use percent values of the daily per capita indoor water consumption we turned these into daily per capita values by exploiting the information about the average total daily per capita indoor water consumption reported for reus presenting values of end use water consumption per family group per day we turned these into daily per capita values by exploiting the information about the average occupancy rate of the households included in the study for reus presenting values specifically observed in different seasons summer and winter we averaged these to obtain values that could be representative of the overall eud concerned i e not affected by seasonal patterns and therefore to be in line with those reus describing the characteristics of water consumption only in relation to a single sometimes already averaged seasonal period which are the majority for reus presenting multiple end use water consumption values related to different subsets regions household types etc we calculated a weighted average based on the size of each subset i e the number of households monitored in each subset to be in line with those reus describing the characteristics of water consumption only in relation to the overall household sample which are the majority for reus comparing baseline values against those observed after device retrofitting campaigns e g low flow toilet tank or tap aerator installations we considered only pre retrofitting data in order to explore the status quo of water consumption at the beginning of the study period i e the conditions motivating the choice of installing new more efficient fixtures 2 3 2 level 2 end use parameters average values to further explore the characteristics of water consumption at the end use level we computed four parameters describing the main features of different end uses 1 volume per use measured in l use defined as the volume of water consumed during an individual event of water use 2 duration per use measured in min use defined as the duration of an individual event of water use 3 flow rate per use measured in l min defined as the average flow rate characterizing an individual event of water use and 4 frequency of use measured in uses person day defined as the number of times per person per day a water end use occurs level 2 of analysis was conducted for all end use categories introduced in level 1 except for the other category which was ignored due to the heterogeneity of water uses present moreover the average values of the above four metrics were obtained for each study based on the assumptions made in level 1 see the related sub section 2 3 3 level 3 end use statistical parameter distributions level 3 of the analysis further explores the characteristics of end use parameters defined in level 2 by comparing their probability distributions the motivation behind this analysis is that in general predictive or descriptive water demand models are calibrated based on predefined parameter distributions i e the probability distribution of volume per use duration per use flow rate per use and frequency of use for different end uses however to the authors knowledge the literature lacks a comprehensive database including and comparing this kind of information in most of the reus including information about end use parameter distributions this information is shown in diagrams where the independent variable indicates the end use parameter value e g volume per shower use conversely the dependant variable sometimes relates to the number of uses observed or to the relative frequency of occurrence therefore given the tendency to include information in graphical form only and in light of the high variability of the information available we conducted level 3 of analysis as follows 1 we digitized the information originally in graphical form by means of the web plot digitizer v4 3 software rohatgi 2021 specifically we processed the end use parameter distributions shown in the studies for the five most common end use categories i e dishwasher washing machine shower toilet and taps and the four parameters defined in level 2 i e volume per use duration per use flow rate per use and frequency of use 2 we processed the digitized information based on assumptions partially introduced in level 1 and level 2 specifically i we adapted the units of measurements to those selected for each end use parameter in level 2 except tap duration that given its limited average values was assumed in s use ii in the case of reus presenting end use parameter distributions observed in specific seasons summer and winter we averaged these to obtain distributions not affected by seasonal patterns iii in the case of reus presenting multiple parameter distributions related to the type of end use e g front versus top load washing machine we calculated a weighted average based on the size of each subset iv in the case of reus comparing baseline distributions against those observed after device retrofitting we considered pre retrofitting distributions only 3 we converted the distributions into empirical probability density function curves i e empirical pdf 4 we fitted the empirical pdf curves with matlab s r2019a fitdist function specifically five pdfs were assumed to fit each empirical pdf normal lognormal exponential weibull and gamma we applied a one sample kolmogorov smirnov test to each fitted distribution type to evaluate its goodness of fit only the distribution types for which the kolmogorov smirnov test was successful i e provided the rejection of the null hypothesis at the 5 significance level were then submitted to the akaike s information criterion aic test and compared akaike 1974 finally we selected the distribution type passing the kolmogorov smirnov test and characterized by the minimum aic parameter value as the best fitting pdf with its related parameter values overall it is worth noting that uncertainties and potential errors may have arisen due to the reverse engineering process adopted to obtain end use statistical parameter distributions e g digitization inaccuracy induced by low resolution reus histograms and in turn affecting curve fitting accuracy the performance of which should be verified with actual end use data distributions however given the scarce availability of most eud as demonstrated in section 2 2 motivating the characterization of end use water consumption and parameters by relying only on the information reported in the reus available in the literature the above mentioned approach resulted the most suitable method to uniformly process a large and heterogeneous amount of graphical end use data 2 3 4 level 4 daily end use profiles level 4 of the analysis focuses on the comparative analysis of the daily end use profiles shown in the reus overall the most common end use categories for which daily profiles are available are dishwasher washing machine bathtub and shower toilet taps and leakages as in the case of end use parameter distributions this information is typically provided exclusively in graphical form i e by means of charts including the pattern of the average end use water consumption over the 24 h of the day and with different units of measurement therefore as for level 3 of the analysis we first digitized the information on end use daily profiles by means of the web plot digitizer v4 3 software rohatgi 2021 we then normalized standardized the digitized profiles for comparison and processed them based on the following assumptions 1 in the case of reus presenting the end use daily profiles observed in specific seasons summer and winter we averaged these to obtain profiles not affected by seasonal patterns 2 in the case of reus presenting daily profiles related to multiple end uses of the same category e g shower and bathtub or kitchen sink and washbasin we calculated a weighted average profile based on the values of the daily per capita water consumption of each end use and 3 in the reus of studies comparing baseline profiles against those observed after device retrofitting we considered only pre retrofitting profiles 2 3 5 level 5 determinants of end use consumption and parameters given the high heterogeneity in the determinants of the end uses of water presented in the reus level 5 includes analyses aimed at quantifying the most reported categories following an approach similar to cominola et al 2021b we adopted a representation index r defined as the frequency of appearance of a determinant in the set of framework analysis studies to quantify how popular a determinant is in the reviewed literature the frequency of appearance of a given determinant is evaluated with respect to 1 daily per capita end use water consumption and 2 end use parameters i e volume per use duration per use flow rate per use frequency of use moreover we focused on observable and external end use determinants cominola et al 2021b whereas we did not consider latent determinants i e psychological drivers such as people s habits perception and awareness which are typically less investigated at the end use level specifically we explored three categories socio demographic determinants i e occupancy rate family type householders age income occupational status educational level and socio economic region property characteristics i e household type and lot size external determinants i e daily temperature and season 2 3 6 level 6 efficiency and diffusion of water saving end uses level 6 of the analysis aims to explore the efficiency and the diffusion of water saving end uses along with their impact on water consumption specifically due to the variety in the materials methods and implications of the reus including considerations about end use water saving efficiency and diffusion the analysis consists of a review of the main outcomes of the reus focusing on these aspects and their major implications although limited to a qualitative discussion level 6 of the analysis aims to be a reference point for those who intend to investigate the topic of efficiency and diffusion of water saving end uses by providing a qualitative overview of the most relevant outcomes indicated in the literature 3 results and discussion given the differences in the content of the eud and the heterogeneity of data presented in the reus we first assessed whether the information required to carry out the multi level analysis for each eud was included within the body of the corresponding reus results are detailed in table 1 and summarized in fig 4 daily per capita end use water consumption data and the average values of end use parameters are reported for at least one end use category in the case of 52 and 44 of the 66 eud i e 79 and 67 respectively this means that these two aspects are the most explored in the literature in contrast considerations of end use parameter distributions daily end use profiles end use determinants or efficiency and diffusion of water saving end uses can be outlined only in the case of 28 21 21 and 25 of the 66 eud i e 42 32 32 and 38 respectively thus the results of the analysis show that attention is generally paid to the evaluation of daily per capita water consumption of different end uses or the average values of the end use parameters i e level 1 and level 2 while investigation of other aspects of the end use water consumption such as parameter distributions level 3 daily profiles level 4 determinants level 5 or efficiency and diffusion level 6 is still rather limited these outcomes are coherent with the findings of the literature reviews proposed in the framework of some reus mayer et al 1999 beal and stewart 2011 jordán cuebas et al 2018 which include only the most relevant results accessible in the literature in terms of daily per capita end use water consumption lastly we observe a limited number of eud with reported information that does not cover any level of the analysis jacobs 2007 kim et al 2007 cole and stewart 2013 kozlovskiy et al 2016 kofinas et al 2018 this is mainly because the related reus exploit end use data for a variety of applications e g end use demand model training testing end use disaggregation and classification model calibration validation or considerations on data gathering at different sampling resolutions without directly presenting the characteristics of the eud concerned due to the lack of sufficient data these eud are cited in our study but not considered for further analyses 3 1 level 1 daily per capita end use water consumption daily per capita water consumption data are available for at least one end use category in the majority of eud 52 out of 66 i e 79 the average values of each study are shown in table 2 which also features information on the average number of household occupants and the total indoor water consumption we observe that showers and toilets are typically the end uses with the highest per capita daily water consumption average of 44 1 and 38 0 l person day respectively followed by taps 32 9 l person day washing machines 28 8 l person day bathtubs 9 9 l person day and dishwashers 3 0 l person day the eud reviewed also reveal non negligible average values in the case of domestic leakages 16 6 l person day including both permanent e g pipe breaks or temporary leakages e g blockage of toilet float valve first the results obtained confirm that the majority of residential water consumption is primarily tied to the use of water for personal hygiene and flushing second it emerges that some end uses have been drastically reduced due to behavioral change and the introduction of efficient devices as substantiated in the following section this reduction is mainly evident in the case of bathtubs which have been almost entirely replaced by showers but also applies to the case of tap use for dishwashing or laundry however although substantial water savings have generally been observed because of the diffusion of efficient devices like dishwashers agudelo vera et al 2014 the tap component of water use is still non negligible due to the high heterogeneity of uses associated with this end use category ranging from personal hygiene to cooking drinking or house cleaning the box whisker plots of the distributions of the average daily per capita end use consumption values are shown in fig 5 the figure reveals no substantial variations between the median of each distribution white squares and the aforementioned average values red asterisks with the exception of bathtub and leakages whose median about 4 5 and 10 3 l person day respectively is considerably below the average and reveals an asymmetry of the bathtub and leakage distribution also distinguishable from the position of quartiles considering value dispersion the most scattered distributions of the average daily per capita water consumption are those related to toilets and washing machines i e the end uses generally accounting for the largest portion of the total indoor water consumption along with showers in contrast less scattered values are observed for the other end uses e g dishwasher whose daily per capita consumption values are considerably in line the high dispersion of toilet and washing machine values is more likely to be due to technological development rather than behavioral factors i e changes in people s attitude towards water use as demonstrated by the strongly decreasing volume per use trends shown in table 3 and discussed in the subsequent section along with the absence of substantial variations in the daily frequency of use over years however it is worth noting that other factors may also contribute to this spread e g inaccuracies in disaggregation and classification methods causing event misclassification fig 6 shows the trend of the daily per capita end use water consumption over the last three decades where dots represent the average values related to each eud colour and dimension are related to location and sample size respectively specifically the results are limited to those retrieved for the developed continents for which a sufficient number of eud is available i e europe north america and oceania overall fig 6 reveals considerable differences amongst eud even in the case of studies conducted in similar locations and periods see e g the large spread of in the use of dishwasher in north america over the decade 1990 2000 shown in fig 6a or the use of washing machine in oceania over the 2000 2010 decade shown in fig 6b however as far as the trend of the daily per capita water consumption is regarded a decrease between the 1990 2000 and the 2010 2020 decades emerges in most of the end uses shown in the figure more specifically some of the largest drops in water consumption are observed over time in the case of automated or fixed volume end uses such as washing machines from 52 9 to 18 0 l person day fig 6b and toilets from 62 3 to 35 7 l person day fig 6e confirming the large spread of values met in level 1 of the analysis for these end uses this drop is likely to be primarily due to technological development which allowed an increase in the water saving efficiency of these end uses this is demonstrated by the decreasing trend of washing machine and toilet volume per use in europe north america and oceania from the 1990 2000 to the 2010 2020 decade in spite of a constant or even slightly increasing frequency of use observable in table 3 of section 3 2 conversely human controlled end uses do not always show a decrease in their daily per capita average consumption this emerges for example in the case of showers fig 6c for which the 10 year average consumption slightly increases from the 1990 2000 decade 42 0 l person day to the 2010 2020 decade 45 5 l person day whereas tap use drastically decreases over the same period from 38 9 to 18 8 l person day fig 6f on the one hand the increase in shower water consumption may be due to behavioral factors such as the increase in the average frequency of use over decades confirmed by the data reported in table 3 on the other hand the drastic decrease in tap water consumption may be related to the progressive replacement of manual water consuming activities i e laundry dishwashing with automated operations made by appliances despite the lack of clear evidence in the trends of end use parameters such as volume per use and frequency of use lastly we observe a decrease in the daily per capita consumption of dishwashers and bathtubs as well between the 1990 2000 and the 2010 2020 decades fig 6a and 6d reasonably due to the increase in dishwasher water saving efficiency along with the reduction of bathtub use in favour of showers again the above considerations are supported by the results included in table 3 showing a negative trend of the dishwasher volume per load in spite of a slightly increasing dishwasher frequency of use over the last three decades and a strong decrease in bathtub frequency however exceptionally high bathtub consumption emerges in the case of the british eud reported by kowalski and marshallsay 2003 along with a considerably low shower consumption of about 30 l person day and the north american eud by jordán cuebas et al 2018 characterized by a rather limited sample size 3 2 level 2 end use parameters average values average values of end use parameters such as volume per use duration per use flow rate per use or frequency of use are reported in the literature for at least one end use category in the case of 44 eud i e 67 of the total average end use parameter values related to each eud are shown in table 3 along with the references to the respective reus overall volume per use and daily frequency of use are the most frequently reported end use parameters in fact these are available for at least one end use category in the case of 41 and 39 eud respectively for individual end uses volume per use and the daily frequency of use have mainly been explored in the case of toilets 35 and 37 eud respectively washing machines 29 and 32 eud and showers 27 and 32 eud whereas less relevance is given to dishwashers 20 and 25 eud bathtubs 19 and 21 eud and taps 11 and 20 eud these outcomes are most likely due to the major relevance that is typically given to toilets washing machines and showers because of their high daily per capita average water consumption values see the results of level 1 of the analysis but it is also worth noting that the above mentioned end use events are typically amongst the most easily identifiable by automated disaggregation and classification methods either because of their recognizable patterns or high event volume and duration conversely duration per use and flow rate per use are less investigated in fact the average values of these parameters are available for at least one end use category in the case of 34 and 32 eud respectively it is worth noting that event duration is typically expressed in min use in most of the cases whereas concerning taps some studies mayer et al 1999 2000 2003 evaluate it in terms of total duration of tap use per day in addition as far as the daily frequency of use is concerned typically expressed in uses person day some authors e g fontdecaba et al 2013 reported this parameter in terms of uses household day without providing information about the average occupancy rate therefore the above cases are not included in table 3 for individual end uses showers are the most explored with 33 and 31 eud showing average values of duration and flow rate per use respectively followed by taps 8 and 11 eud respectively the other end use categories are almost entirely excluded from the reus specifically their average values of duration and flow rate per use are shown in at most three four cases only the box whisker plots of the end use parameter average values provided in table 3 are shown in fig 7 where we indicated only the sets of end use parameter values appearing in at least five eud in greater detail the following features emerge for different parameters volume per use fig 7a bathtubs are the most consuming end use with an average volume per use of about 105 5 l use followed by washing machines 92 2 l load and showers 63 1 l use whereas considerably lower volumes per use are related to dishwashers 17 6 l load toilets 9 0 l flush and taps of about 2 3 l use only when the dispersion of the distributions is considered it is worth noting that bathtubs and washing machines are also characterized by the highest difference between the first and the last quantile meaning that the average values available in the literature are generally more spread than those shown in the case of showers dishwashers and taps we observe the smallest differences in the case of taps with average values of the volume per use considerably in line with each other and in a range of only a few liters per use or less overall it is worth noting that a variety of values emerge when eud from different geographical areas are compared in particular the average volumes per use observed in the north american eud are typically higher than those reported in european and oceanian eud for all the end use categories in fact the average appliance volume per load in the case of the american eud is about 29 3 l load dishwashers and 138 8 l load washing machines as opposed to the european 16 0 and 58 3 l load respectively and oceanian 17 2 and 109 0 l load values this is also evident in the case of human controlled end uses such as showers and taps being the american eud average values 68 5 and 3 6 l use respectively higher than the corresponding european 58 1 and 1 5 l use and oceanian 57 6 and 2 0 l use values however it is worth observing that the average starting year of the american eud is 2005 whereas those of the european and oceanian eud are 2009 and 2008 respectively therefore differences in end use parameter values might also be due to temporal offsets amongst the eud of different areas duration and flow rate per use figs 7b and 7c although a sufficient number of values is available only for showers and taps our results reveal that shower use is typically characterized by much longer durations on the order of several minutes and with an average of about 8 1 min use and higher flow rates with an average of about 8 1 l min as opposed to taps moreover tap uses typically last less than one minute with an average of about 25 s use and little dispersion of values and have a limited flow rate on average 3 5 l min the lack of sufficient information about the other end use categories is mainly related to the fact that some other end uses are typically characterized by constant durations and flow rates per use e g toilets whereas some others are appliances and thus variations in the duration or flow rate per use are generally due to different programs selected it also emerges that appliance load duration which can be of several minutes up to some hours is generally much longer than the total duration of water inflow which is of a few minutes per load only e g from 1 4 to 5 1 min in the case of dishwasher and from 5 0 to 9 3 min in the case of washing machine based on the values reported by cubillo gonzález et al 2008 blokker et al 2010 and mazzoni et al 2023 furthermore and similarly to the considerations set forth in the case of volume per use different values emerge when the duration of the most reported end uses i e showers and taps is explored for different geographical areas overall the analysis reveals that shower uses in the north american and european case studies are typically longer lasting by about two minutes than those related to oceanian eud being the average duration of about 8 2 8 7 min use in the former case and 6 8 min use in the latter although we do not observe large variations in the average flow rate per use the american eud reveal that on average also tap uses are longer lasting and more intense than oceanian uses i e 34 s use and 4 4 l min versus 25 s use and 2 8 l min respectively however as previously mentioned these results might be affected by different study periods being the year 2005 the average starting year of the american eud and the years 2008 2009 those of oceanian and european eud respectively lastly we highlight that the comparison of end use durations can also be affected by differences in data sampling resolutions adopted across eud specifically the sampling resolution in all the cases of eud for which end use parameter values are reported is equal to or finer than 10 s as a consequence of different data sampling resolutions uncertainties also arise in relation to end use flow rate i e the other time dependant end use parameter however unlike duration the effects of different resolutions on flow rate values cannot be directly assessed based on the information reported in the reus concerned frequency of use fig 7d different behaviors emerge when the daily frequencies of use of the end use categories considered are compared on the one hand a frequent daily use of toilets and taps emerges being the former used on average 4 95 times person day and the latter used on average 16 98 times person day in particular the toilet flusher is activated an average of 4 30 times person day in the case of the oceanian eud and 5 13 5 30 times person day in the case of north american and european eud whereas taps are opened between 16 05 european eud and 18 52 18 78 times person day oceanian and north american eud these end uses are also characterized by the highest difference between the first and the last quantiles on the other hand less frequent use of shower appliances and bathtub is observed with all these devices typically used less than once per person per day i e 0 74 uses person day in the case of showers 0 29 in the case of washing machines 0 20 in the case of dishwashers and 0 11 in the case of bathtubs specifically shower frequency of use is slightly higher in the case of oceanian eud 0 84 times person day as opposed to 0 69 0 70 times person day in the case of north american and european eud whereas washing machine frequency use is highest in north american eud 0 38 loads person day versus 0 26 loads person day in the case of european and oceanian eud finally as far as dishwasher use is considered we observe no relevant differences in frequency of use amongst eud from different continents overall the main takeaways on end use frequency of use are the following 1 taps are generally the most frequently used devices despite the limited duration of tap uses due to their various utilization ranging from personal hygiene to cleaning cooking and washing 2 toilets are typically flushed several times per person per day although less frequently than taps 3 showers are on average used once per person per day or slightly less 4 appliances are activated with daily or higher frequency only in case of households made up by three or more residents 5 bathtubs are nowadays used only occasionally 3 3 level 3 end use statistical parameter distribution end use parameter distributions are available with regard to at least one end use category and parameter in the case of 28 eud i e 42 of the total meaning that in the literature this kind of information is less explored than the respective average parameter values in fig 8 we show a detailed overview of the most common end use parameter distributions where the heat map relates the distribution of each end use and parameter to its availability bathtub is not included due to the insufficient amount of information in the literature about bathtub parameter distributions fig 8 reveals that on average volume per use and frequency of use are the parameters for which distributions are mostly available in the literature followed by duration per use and flow rate per use typically investigated only in the case of showers and taps in the case of individual end uses most of the distributions are related to shower and toilet whereas less relevance is given to taps and appliances overall the results shown in fig 8 in relation to end use statistical parameter distributions are consistent with the outcomes achieved by investigating the availability of information about the average values of end use parameters level 2 of the analysis which are indicated in table 3 the empirical distributions i e empirical pdf curves of end use parameters obtained by digitizing the information available in the reus are shown in fig s1 see the supplemental data whereas the respective probability distributions i e statistical pdf curves fitted by matlab s r2019a fitdist function are shown in fig 9 the main characteristics of each best fitting pdf curve distribution type parameters are also detailed in table s1 see supplemental data along with the results of the preliminary kolmogorov smirnov goodness of fit test the best fitting pdf curves obtained from each distribution of end use parameters allow the stochastic behavior of water consumption at the end use level to be investigated more specifically in particular these findings show that volume per use distributions are fitted by different pdfs based on the end use considered and the characteristics of the respective eud the obtained pdf curves are mostly consistent in the case of shower events fig 9c often assuming a slightly right skewed shape characterized by an upper tail and described by lognormal or gamma distributions a similar behavior is observed for taps fig 9e although covering a range of much smaller volumes and with statistical curves also fitted by weibull distribution as in the case of the eud used in beal and stewart 2011 conversely differences amongst the distributions are clearly distinguishable for end uses not directly human controlled i e appliances figs 9a and 9b and toilet fig 9d these differences are mainly evident in the case of washing machine distributions fig 9b which include two clusters associated with peaks of about 50 80 and 130 150 l load respectively in greater detail the former cluster is tied to european or oceanian reus carried out after year 2008 cubillo gonzález et al 2008 beal and stewart 2011 redhead et al 2013 siriwardene 2018 whereas the latter cluster is related to mainly north american reus conducted before year 2011 bennett and lindstedt 1975 mayer et al 1999 roberts 2005 heinrich 2010 aquacraft 2011 deoreo et al 2011 this difference is most likely due to a variety of temporal and geographical contexts i e study period and location amongst the eud concerned related to different levels of technological development and thus differences in appliance makes and models duration per use distributions are fitted by gamma or lognormal probability distributions in most of the cases sometimes with right skewed pdf curves in the case of individual end uses shower distributions result mainly in line with each other showing peak durations of 5 to 9 min fig 9h whereas differences are observed between tap distributions fig 9j when the 20 s or less peak value indicated in australian or new zealand studies roberts 2005 heinrich et al 2007 mead 2008 redhead et al 2013 siriwardene 2018 is compared against the 30 40 s north american peak values reported by deoreo et al 2011 and deoreo and mayer 2013 flow rate per use distributions are generally fitted by nearly symmetrical shapes in the case of showers fig 9m whereas more skewed distributions emerge in the case of taps fig 9o regarding taps and similarly to the outcomes achieved in the case of tap duration distributions fig 9j differences are observed when the 2 l min peak value indicated in australian or new zealand studies roberts 2005 heinrich et al 2007 mead 2008 redhead et al 2013 siriwardene 2018 are compared against the north american and european peak values of about 4 l min reported by cubillo gonzález et al 2008 deoreo and mayer 2013 and mazzoni et al 2023 small variations in shape and peak values are observed when the frequency per use distributions of different end uses are considered with pdfs generally peaking at about 0 1 0 2 loads person day dishwasher and washing machine 0 7 1 0 uses person day shower and 3 5 flushes person day toilet as limited skewness characterizes the majority of these distributions the above peak values are consistent with the average end use parameter values shown with level 2 of the analysis lastly it is worth observing that the lack of a sufficient number of tap distributions does not allow observations about the frequency of use to be made regarding this end use 3 4 level 4 daily end use profiles information about daily end use profiles is available in the case of 21 eud i e 32 of the total although the majority of reus only show the average end use daily profile some others include several profiles per end use based on season roberts 2005 kowalski and marshallsay 2005 redhead et al 2013 day type siriwardene 2018 or layout of water infrastructure supplying the monitored households willis et al 2011b in all the aforementioned cases we calculated an average daily profile for each reported end use as also described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 levels 1 and 2 of the analysis the results after data digitization and normalization are indicated in fig 10 where box whisker plots of the average end use daily profiles investigated in the reviewed reus are shown we observe peculiar shapes of the daily profiles based on the end use considered because of different water use behaviors although the majority of profiles display minimum values at night and higher values during the day specifically some end uses i e toilet and taps show a smooth profile over the 24 h figs 10d and 10e because people typically make use of these devices almost constantly during the day whereas some others are characterized by marked fluctuations related to periods of increased use this is particularly evident in the case of showers and bathtubs fig 10c which appear to be used mostly in the early morning before leaving home for daily activities and evening when returning home but also applies to the case of dishwasher which is mostly activated after mealtimes fig 10a and washing machine fig 10b whose profile is typically characterized by a single peak in the morning along with a decrease in water consumption during the afternoon in addition the hourly normalized water consumption values available in the literature for each of the 24 h are characterized by quite similar values in the case of toilets and taps meaning that the profiles are mostly close to each other independently of the case study area however higher offsets thus larger differences amongst the eud emerge for dishwasher washing machine shower and bathtub profiles as also observable from the differences between the quartiles of the distribution the largest differences in the values reported in the literature are generally observable in early morning and evening values i e when the largest volumes of water are typically consumed this finding is most likely due to the variety in habits and lifestyles of populations across the globe for instance different peak times of end use water consumption but also different daily distributions emerge from the comparison between north and south european eud the results of which are included in fig s2 see supplemental data different peak times and distributions are likely due to different traditions and climatic conditions and thus different waking times mealtimes and working times with specific reference to the united kingdom and spain where the end use profiles of water consumption have been evaluated by kowalski and marshallsay 2005 and cubillo gonzález et al 2008 respectively the diversity in home return times affects the peak time of shower and bathtub use in the evening between 18 00 and 19 00 in the case of the united kingdom and at around 21 00 in the case of spain similarly a temporal offset of 2 3 h is observed when washing machine daily profiles are compared although the most relevant discrepancies between the two aforementioned case study areas are mainly evident in the case of showers bathtubs and washing machines different peak times and distributions due to different habits also emerge in the case of toilets and taps in fact the analysis reveals that different waking times have effects on the morning peak time of these end uses ranging from 8 00 in the case of the united kingdom to 10 00 or even later in the case of spain finally the box whisker plot of the leakage daily profiles reported in the literature is also shown fig 10f as expected leakage profiles appear nearly constant throughout the day because domestic leakages are typically permanent e g those due to pipe breaks or leaking valves however a slight increase in leakage rate is observed in diurnal hours this may be due to the fact that most of the reus investigating leakage profiles roberts 2005 deoreo et al 2011 willis et al 2011b arbon et al 2014 deoreo et al 2016 siriwardene 2018 also consider temporary leakages e g due to momentary valve blocks which are more likely to occur when end uses are activated with higher frequency 3 5 level 5 determinants of end use consumption and parameters information about the determinants of end use water consumption and parameters are available in the literature for only 21 eud i e 32 of the total we computed the r index for each possible combination of end uses determinants and parameters investigated in the reus the results are shown in fig 11 the heat maps shown in fig 11 reveal that the majority of reus available in the literature focus on the determinants of daily per capita end use water consumption and frequency of use whereas less relevance is given to the investigation of the determinants of end use volume duration and flow rate per use this is also consistent with the findings achieved in similar studies conducted with regard to the household level of detail e g cominola et al 2021b concerning daily per capita end use water consumption the most explored determinants are socio demographic specifically as regards occupancy rate and family income in the case of occupancy rate some studies simply report the daily per capita end use water consumption average values related to different household family sizes whereas others e g mead 2008 make use of optimization methods to obtain the parameter values of the function best approximating the data observed in general the studies agree that daily per capita water consumption is inversely correlated with the occupancy rate in the case of toilets cubillo gonzález et al 2008 beal and stewart 2011 lee et al 2012 willis et al 2013 arbon et al 2014 and reveal different behaviors although characterized by a decrease in the per capita water consumption along with an increase in the occupancy rate in the case of showers and taps roberts 2005 cubillo gonzález et al 2008 beal et al 2012 makki et al 2013 willis et al 2013 redhead et al 2013 arbon et al 2014 siriwardene 2018 moreover discordant findings emerge when the impacts of family size on washing machine per capita water consumption are compared in some cases characterized by a positive correlation with high occupancy rates willis et al 2013 in some others by a negative correlation roberts 2005 mead 2008 arbon et al 2014 or not correlated beal et al 2012 furthermore no marked correlations are found in the case of dishwashers and bathtubs with the daily per capita water consumption on the latter end use more affected by family type e g number of children as in redhead et al 2013 and arbon et al 2014 arbon et al 2014 show that also family type has an impact on water consumption highlighting a higher daily per capita consumption of showers in households without children and even higher in families with teenagers concerning income the studies available in the literature reveal on the one hand a positive correlation with daily per capita water consumption specifically as regards showers makki et al 2013 arbon et al 2014 but also bathtubs and taps hussien et al 2016 these findings are also confirmed by a study by bastidas pacheco et al 2023 relating the daily per capita water consumption of these end uses to the daily total per capita water consumption which may be reasonably considered a rather good substitute indicator of determinants such as family type and income on the other hand a negative correlation sometimes emerges in the case of toilets arbon et al 2014 hussien et al 2016 siriwardene 2018 this finding is most likely because higher income families can have newer and more efficient toilet cisterns allowing water savings upon the activation of flushers however this negative correlation is not observed in the case of human controlled end uses i e showers bathtubs taps whose duration of use thus consumption is at the discretion of householders and may be less moderate in the case of high income residents moreover as in the case of occupancy rate different behaviors emerge from the analysis of the correlation between income and the per capita water consumption for washing machine these parameters show a positive correlation in some cases beal and stewart 2011 and a negative correlation in some others arbon et al 2014 siriwardene 2018 as far as the determinants of end use parameters are concerned the literature lacks sufficient information about the drivers of end use volume duration and flow rate per use except shower duration whose relationship with householders age is explored in several studies reporting that teenagers and young adults typically have longer showers than older people foekema and engelsma 2001 kanne 2005 foekema et al 2008 foekema and van thiel 2011 arbon et al 2014 van thiel 2014 van thiel 2017 moreover more attention is paid to the determinants of the daily per capita frequency of use on the one hand an inverse correlation between daily per capita frequency of shower use and the number of children is reported by some authors roberts 2005 mead 2008 along with a negative correlation between daily per capita frequency of washing machine use and occupancy rate roberts 2005 redhead et al 2013 arbon et al 2014 siriwardene 2018 on the other hand the correlation between end use frequency of use and occupancy rate householders age family type income or socio economic region is deeply explored in the series of dutch studies conducted between 2001 and 2017 foekema and engelsma 2001 kanne 2005 foekema et al 2008 foekema and van thiel 2014 van thiel 2014 van thiel 2017 specifically the studies show a positive correlation between householders age and frequency of toilet use and also demonstrate that bathtubs are more frequently used in households with young children 3 6 level 6 efficiency and diffusion of water saving end uses considerations about efficiency and diffusion of water saving end uses are available in the literature with respect to 25 eud i e 38 of the total mainly focused on american or oceanian case study areas where the analyses about water conservation and end use efficiency are motivated by the presence of areas generally affected by relevant water scarcity issues and drought conditions carrão et al 2016 specifically different approaches are adopted to explore the topic and therefore results are presented in different ways making normalization and comparison impractical only the most relevant key points are discussed in the following whereas the detailed findings of each study are shown in table s2 supplemental data first it is worth noting that many studies presenting results about water saving end use efficiency and diffusion aim to promote water conservation different levels of water savings are achieved by adopting different strategies ranging from the installation of alarm displays in proximity to some end uses for providing real time feedback about water use willis et al 2010b to the retrofitting of some end uses with newer and more efficient ones such as low flow showerheads and toilets anderson et al 1993 but also tap aerators and water saving washing machines darmody et al 1999 mayer et al 2000 mayer et al 2003 roberts 2005 deoreo and mayer 2013 willis et al 2010b observe that the average volume and duration per shower use decreases by 10 and 18 respectively after the installation of alarm displays in showers see the related values in table 3 anderson et al 1993 mayer et al 2000 mayer et al 2003 roberts 2005 and deoreo and mayer 2013 observe a drop in the daily per capita water consumption of the end use categories involved in retrofitting along with a decrease in their volume per use as shown in table 2 and table 3 some studies also show a general increase in the daily frequency of some end uses after retrofitting e g toilets anderson et al 1993 mayer et al 2000 mayer et al 2003 along with an increase in the average duration of some others e g showers deoreo and mayer 2013 however the effects of these increases in the duration and or frequency of water use are balanced by the higher efficiency of water saving devices overall resulting in lower daily per capita water consumption values again in this context bastidas pacheco et al 2023 compare shower toilet and tap parameters obtained by monitoring against those defined by national standards to evaluate the efficiency level for the aforementioned end uses demonstrating that there are conservation opportunities especially with reference to toilet and showerhead retrofitting finally it is also worth noting that studies exploring the potential water conservation achievable by retrofitting highlight that this strategy can have considerable implications on peak consumption beal and stewart 2014b with the most consistent savings obtainable by installing more efficient toilets and washing machines heinrich et al 2007 other studies about efficiency of water saving end uses mayer et al 1999 loh and coghlan 2003 roberts 2005 mead 2008 blokker 2010 blokker et al 2010 aquacraft 2011 beal and stewart 2011 compare the characteristics of different end use makes models and year of installation along with the technologies already available in the monitored households such as top and front load washing machines standard and low flow toilets and normal and efficient showerheads and their related effects on water consumption the studies show different consumption patterns and lower per capita water consumption values in the case of low flow end uses and front load washing machines however as in the case of retrofitting studies they reveal an increase in some characteristics of water use for efficient end uses such as longer shower durations mead 2008 arbon et al 2014 the third group of studies investigate the evolution of end use water consumption over the last decades along with the diffusion of water saving fixtures on the market in replacement of the traditional ones foekema and engelsma 2001 loh and coghlan 2003 white et al 2004 cubillo gonzález et al 2008 blokker 2010 blokker et al 2010 aquacraft 2011 agudelo vera et al 2014 the studies show a general reduction of the per capita water consumption of different end uses although with some exceptions in fact loh and coghlan 2003 observe an increase in the daily per capita water consumption of washing machines between the early 1980s and the late 1990s whereas the aquacraft 2011 study reports an increase in the shower water consumption due to a higher shower duration and frequency of use when the values observed in households built after the year 2000 are compared against those presented by mayer et al 1999 similar observations are also made in the study conducted by deoreo et al 2016 showing an increase in toilet tap and dishwasher frequency of use moreover agudelo vera et al 2014 observe a decrease in the water consumption and daily frequency of use of some end uses over time due to technological improvements and changes in people s habits e g the reduction of baths in favour of showers the study also indicates that the highest efficiency of water saving end uses has been achieved in the case of washing machines dishwashers and toilets with reductions in the average water consumption per use between 1992 and 2010 of about 40 30 and 20 respectively whereas different diffusion rates have emerged based on the end use considered ranging from almost 100 in the case of washing machines to 60 in the case of dishwashers and 50 70 in the case of efficient toilets and showers similar results for toilet dual flush systems are reported in the white et al 2004 study where a sample of over 2500 000 australian users is considered for which a progressive increase in the diffusion of dual flush toilets is observed ranging from 0 in 1980 to 74 in 2010 moreover the foekema et al 2001 blokker 2010 and blokker et al 2010 studies report an increase in the diffusion of dishwashers in the netherlands from 45 to 54 years 2001 2007 along with a decrease in the diffusion of bathtubs the above studies also report that the diffusion of dishwashers positively relates to household occupancy rate whereas the diffusion of bathtub is nowadays mainly dependant on wealth class income coherently with some of the considerations made by cubillo gonzález et al 2008 3 7 summary of study findings in light of the variety of outcomes presented and discussed in the study in relation to the characteristics of end use water consumption from several points of view the major findings that emerged at each level of the analysis can be summarized as follows daily per capita end use water consumption level 1 the highest daily per capita water consumption is typically tied to showers toilets and washing machines whereas lower values are generally related to taps dishwashers and bathtubs with these end uses almost entirely replaced by showers nowadays moreover the analysis points out that the largest decrease in the end use water consumption of developed countries over the last three decades is related to washing machine toilet and tap uses whereas a slight increase has emerged in the case of showers end use parameter average values level 2 volume per use and frequency of use are generally the most explored end use parameters whereas duration and flow rate per use are typically investigated only in the case of specific end uses such as showers and taps in general the highest volumes per use are observed for bathtubs followed by washing machines and showers in addition as far as the end use frequency is concerned the analysis reveals considerable differences amongst the end uses ranging from a maximum of more than 10 times per person per day taps to a minimum of about 0 1 bathtub end use statistical parameter distributions level 3 while less common than the end use parameter average values a large variety of end use parameter distributions are observed as in the case of level 2 of analysis volume per use and frequency of use are mostly investigated whereas duration and flow rate distributions are generally reported only for showers and taps focusing on volume per use distributions are mostly in line in the case of human controlled end uses showers taps leading to greater differences in the case of appliances and toilets daily end use profiles level 4 the studies reviewed reveal different daily patterns based on the end uses in general smaller fluctuations throughout the day are observed for toilets and taps which also relate to end uses with the smallest differences in the daily profiles available in the literature whereas more heterogeneous patterns are observed in the case of appliances bathtubs and showers because of different habits and lifestyles from around the world determinants of end use water consumption and parameters level 5 only the determinants of daily per capita end use water consumption i e the socio demographic ones such as family size and income and end use frequency of use are explored and discussed in a sufficient number of eud concerning family size most of the related reus report an inverse correlation between the occupancy rate and the daily per capita water consumption of toilets showers and taps with a variety of behaviors in the case of appliances moreover regarding the effects of income on water use it emerges that although higher income households typically have more efficient devices their end use water consumption is generally higher efficiency and diffusion of water saving end uses level 6 most of the reus including considerations about water saving efficiency and diffusion of the related eud show that the strategies with the aim of water conservation such as retrofitting programs are generally helpful in reducing water consumption although the installation of low flow devices may result in longer durations per use or higher frequency of use the general decrease in the end use water consumption sometimes related to an increase in the duration of use or frequency per use is likewise reported by the studies making observations about the evolution of water consumption in the last decades which also reveal an increasing diffusion of efficient water saving end uses dishwashers low flow showerheads and toilet flushers water saving washing machines along with the replacement of the most consuming ones 4 conclusions in this review study we provided a comprehensive overview of the state of the art about research in the field of residential water consumption at the end use level specifically we reviewed 114 residential end use studies reus available in the literature and qualitatively and quantitatively investigated the information about the characteristics of 66 related end use databases eud by carrying out a multi level analysis to evaluate the main perspectives from around the world in terms of water consumption based on the results available in the literature our research revealed that most of the reus mainly focus on the evaluation of the daily per capita end use water consumption and the average values of end use parameters i e levels 1 2 of the analysis whereas generally less relevance is given to the investigation of end use parameter distributions daily profiles determinants and efficiency i e levels 3 6 the findings of this study will likely be of interest to different actors involved in water resources management and water demand management first the findings of this work may be a reference for water utilities seeking information about the main characteristics of water consumption at the end use level at both larger i e worldwide and smaller i e regional spatial scales the availability of this information may allow water utilities to introduce or rethink strategies for more efficient management of water resources and infrastructure e g revision of water tariffs and incentives development of campaigns aimed to raise consumers awareness but also planning of additional measurement campaigns or end use studies with the objective of obtaining more detailed end use water consumption data second the end use data presented in the current work can support research involved in the field of water systems in developing and validating demand models methods for water end use disaggregation and classification or technologies for water reuse recycling and conservation in addition the findings of the study may help understand which aspects have been mostly explored in recent research and if needed identify the reus of interest based on their geographical and methodological details third the study can help citizens gain knowledge about the main characteristics of residential end use water consumption from different contexts across the globe and in their living areas the data reported here would be a valid benchmark against which to compare consumer habits and behaviors thus encouraging more conscious and sustainable use of water beside the specific findings of this research we highlight some general outcomes and outline recommendations for future research overall data availability has been demonstrated to still be a substantial challenge considerably limiting open science and reproducible research choi et al 2021 indeed in light of the unavailability of the vast majority of eud in the literature the analyses conducted in this study were carried out by relying only on the information reported in the related reus this may have affected the results presented since the amount of information obtainable from written publications is smaller than the information potentially obtainable by having access to the actual end use data i e the entire eud uncertainties in the reported outcomes may have arisen due to the variety of methods ranging from data averaging to digitization adopted to standardize the variety of results reported in the literature these results are also based on different data collection techniques data resolutions monitoring periods and end use data gathering approaches which all limit the possibility to observe generalized behaviors and differences across studies more specifically the comparison of time dependant end use parameter values could be affected by the exploitation of data collected at different sampling resolutions in fact although all the data exploited in the analysis of end use parameters are characterized by rather fine resolutions e g 1 10 s which have been demonstrated to be typically sufficient to grasp all different end uses of water heydari et al 2022 the comparison of data collected at different resolutions may still affect the accuracy in quantifying residential end use parameter values especially in relation to short duration events this suggests new data sampling to be conducted at the highest possible resolution to allow end use characterization and additional comparisons to be performed with reduced level of uncertainty as also suggested by cominola et al 2018a and bastidas pacheco et al 2022 again we note that the majority of eud were obtained through disaggregation and classification approaches the performance of which can considerably vary across the methods therefore errors in eud may also be due to different method accuracies in disaggregating and classifying end use events along with the potential inability of some methods to successfully detect overlapping water uses when these are not excluded from analysis a priori however this aspect could not be considered in our study due to the lack of sufficient information in the reus concerned lastly it is worth pointing out that despite the relevant number of reus and eud reported and reviewed in the current research some others could have been missed by the authors and thus may be missing in this study due to limited diffusion in the literature or because of publication in languages different from those known by the authors in conclusion our results can be considered as a first step to present and classify a large amount of fragmented data and to outline what is currently available in the literature it is also a sound starting point from which future studies on residential end uses of water can be developed there is still wide room for investigation on many relevant open issues that should be addressed in future research on the one hand although not yet possible based on the very limited number of currently available datasets the realization of a fully open access end use database including a comprehensive number of water events observed and collected in a variety of spatiotemporal contexts would represent an important step forward allowing for detailed and wide analyses to be carried out going beyond the limits currently affecting the literature on residential end uses of water on the other hand in depth evaluations should be carried out in relation to aspects such as the identification of the required household sample size and monitoring period duration to properly determine statistically significant water consumption features this would enable water utilities and researchers to successfully compensate for the differences in water consumption behaviors observable over too limited periods or household samples while reducing monitoring efforts and the invested resources author contributions conceptualization f m s a m b

15133,the use of traditional faecal indicator bacteria as surrogate organisms for pathogenic viruses in domestic wastewater has been noted as a problematic as concentrations and removal rates of bacteria and viruses do not seem to correlate in this sense bacteriophages phages emerge as potential viral indicators as they are commonly found in wastewater in high levels and can be quantified using simple fast low cost methods somatic and f specific coliphages comprise groups of phages commonly used as indicators of water quality there are two internationally recognised methods to detect and enumerate coliphages in water samples the international standardization organization iso and the us environmental protection agency usepa methods both methods are based on the lysis of specific bacterial host strains infected by phages within this context this systematic literature review aimed at gathering concentrations in raw and treated domestic wastewater secondary biological treatment systems and post treatment systems and removal efficiencies of somatic and f specific coliphages obtained by iso and usepa methods and then compare both methods a total of 33 research papers were considered in this study results showed that the iso method is more commonly applied than the usepa method some discrepancies in terms of concentrations and removal efficiencies were observed between both methods higher removal rates were observed for both somatic and f specific coliphages in activated sludge systems when using the usepa method compared to the iso method in other secondary biological treatment systems this was observed only for f specific coliphages the use of different standardised methods available might lead to difficulties in obtaining and comparing phage data in different conditions and locations future research comparing both iso and usepa methods as well as viral and bacterial pathogens and indicators in wwtp is recommended keywords bacteriophages surrogate organisms enteric viruses wastewater treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the biological treatment of municipal wastewater is an important part of sanitation services as it contributes to preventing the degradation of receiving water bodies in addition it can contribute to the removal of pathogenic microorganisms and therefore to control the spread of infectious diseases okoh et al 2010 ibrahim et al 2021 in this context a good performance of wastewater treatment plants enables wastewater reuse activities which compose potential alternatives to tackle high demand and low availability of water in different parts of the world bicudo 2021 the main groups of organisms of interest from a public health point of view associated with water or faeces are bacteria viruses protozoa and helminths von sperling 2007 unep 2016 delahoy et al 2022 partyka et al 2022 conventional municipal wastewater treatment systems have been shown to be more effective at removing traditional faecal indicator bacteria such as escherichia coli e coli and intestinal enterococci than viruses grabow 2001 okoh et al 2010 the reasons why removing pathogenic viruses is typically more challenging than removing enteric bacteria in wastewater treatment plants are primarily because viruses are significantly smaller than bacteria but also because viruses are generally more resistant than enteric bacteria to treatment systems and can more readily pass through widely used biological treatment processes such as activated sludge la rosa et al 2010 purnell et al 2015 pathogenic viruses are widely associated with waterborne diseases and comprise one of the biggest public health problems in the world noroviruses nov are examples of aetiological agents linked to outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis in children ibrahim et al 2020 as well as human adenoviruses hadv are related to gastrointestinal respiratory urinary diseases and other infections silva et al 2011 in view of the search for new viral indicators in municipal wastewater bacteriophages phages that infect enteric bacteria have been proposed as viral indicators as they are commonly excreted in the faeces of humans and other warm blooded animals present strong survival in aquatic environments and have mode of replication structure composition and size similar to enteric viruses naidoo and olaniran 2013 nasser et al 2021 in addition phages are host specific not being able to replicate in water environments usepa 2015 mcminn et al 2017 aghaee et al 2021 phages are also easier to detect than human enteric viruses and can be identified and quantified by conventional and economically viable analytical methods barrios hernández et al 2020 unlike human enteric viruses whose detection and quantification is performed through cell culture or pcr methods which are costly and time consuming jurzik et al 2010 there are some groups of phages that are used to monitor water quality somatic and f specific coliphages are the most commonly phages applied as viral indicators usepa 2015 grabow 2001 phages that infect bacteroides spp can identify human specific contamination tartera and jofre 1987 grabow 2001 ebdon et al 2007 total coliphages composed of somatic and f specific coliphages are also used guzmán et al 2008 there are also other phages that exhibit similar behaviour to viral pathogens and have the potential to be used as indicators of human faecal pollution in effluent samples amongst these bacteriophages infecting host strains of bacteroides spp have been described payan et al 2005 an iso standardized method 10705 4 2001 for the detection and enumeration of these bacteriophages is already available iso 2001 this method has been applied to different phages of bacteroides spp which effectively discriminates the human or animal origin of faecal water pollution muniesa et al 2012 gómez donate et al 2011 in addition in recent years different molecular methods based on the detection of specific sequences also associated with bacteroides bacteriophages specifically related to human contamination known as crassphage have been defined stachler and bibby 2014 garcía aljaro et al 2017 cinek et al 2018 finally the existence of a fast and accessible somatic coliphage detection method is highlighted namely bluephage which has been widely studied and applied toribio avedillo et al 2019 this method is based on cell lysis due to phage infection where the medium basically changes from yellow to dark blue muniesa et al 2018 it is also important to highlight that phage phi 6 a member of the cystoviridae family has been used as an indicator for enveloped viruses such as ebola virus ebov influenza virus and coronavirus including the new sars cov 2 adcock et al 2009 casanova and waka 2013 carvalho et al 2017 whitworth et al 2020 mohapatra et al 2021 enveloped viruses are characterized by having a nucleus capable of incorporating the genetic material of the virus surrounded by a lipid membrane obtained from the cells from which they arise cann 2008 as an enveloped virus the phi 6 phage has a phospholipid envelope casanova and waka 2013 carvalho et al 2017 coliphages compose a subgroup of phages that infect e coli strains and as previously mentioned are the most commonly phages applied as viral indicators jofre et al 2016 somatic coliphages infect e coli and other associated strains and their replication occurs when they adhere to bacterial cell wall receptors they have a morphology similar to enteric dna viruses are abundant in samples contaminated with the faeces of human and other animals and consequently are widely found in domestic sewage toribio avedillo et al 2021 and can be as numerous as bacteria ballesté et al 2022 according to havelaar et al 1990 and the iawprc 1991 f specific coliphages infect strains of e coli through adsorption to the bacterial pili f and although they are not always found in the faeces of humans and other animals unlike somatic coliphages they are commonly found in domestic wastewater which indicates faecal contamination in addition f specific coliphages show similarities morphological fate and transport characteristics with human enteric viruses such as norovirus and hepatitis a virus toribio avedillo et al 2021 both somatic and f specific coliphages are widely used to verify the efficiency of treatment systems blanch et al 2020 it is also known that coliphages have been increasingly proposed as viral indicators by some relevant national and international regulatory institutions ballesté et al 2022 for drinking water nhmrc 2011 health canada 2019 who 2017a 2017b eu 2020a recreational waters nhmrc 2008 usepa 2015 reclaimed waters france 2014 eu 2020b as well as sludge and biosolids dec 2012 colombia 2014 france 2021 in this sense robust methods to detect and quantify phage groups in water samples have been protocoled by agencies such as the international standardization organization iso and the us environmental protection agency usepa blanch et al 2020 in both methodologies phages are enumerated by direct quantitative plaque assays adams 1959 which provide the results in plaque forming units pfu a plaque forming unit is an entity usually composed of one or a group of virions which gives rise to a single plaque jebri et al 2017 the main difference between the two methodologies are as follows i methods iso 10705 are based on a double layer agar technique dal using e coli host strains wg5 atcc 700078 and e coli host strains c atcc 13706 for somatic coliphages iso 10705 2 2000 iso 2000 and salmonella typhimurium host strain wg49 nctc 12484 for f specific coliphages iso 10705 1 1995 iso 1995 ii usepa methods 1602 usepa 2001a and 1643 usepa 2018b are based on a single layer agar technique sal using e coli host strain cn 13 atcc 700609 for somatic coliphages and e coli host strain famp atcc 700891 for f specific coliphages it is important to highlight a few differences between the iso and usepa methods mentioned above iso methods 10705 2 2000 iso 2000 and 10705 1 1995 iso 1995 are based on a double layer agar technique dal use small volumes of samples 1 ml and target a range of samples including drinking water wastewater sludges and sediments on the other hand usepa methods 1602 usepa 2001a and 1643 usepa 2018b are based on a single layer agar technique sal use large volumes of samples 100 ml being the former applicable to ground waters and the latter to secondary wastewater samples without disinfection in addition two other usepa methods are mentioned i qualitative presence absence method 1601 usepa 2001b targeting ground water samples 100 ml and ii quantitative method 1642 usepa 2018a targeting samples such as marine recreational waters as well as advanced secondary with disinfection and tertiary wastewater treatment effluents it is also important to mention that although methods 1601 and 1602 were originally developed for ground waters these two methods have been approved in the 40 code of federal regulations part 136 and can be applied for the quantification of coliphages in wastewater usepa 2015 finally as a consequence of the different analytical volumes used in the iso 1 ml and usepa 100 ml methods different detection limits are obtained being the usepa methods more applicable for samples with lower concentration of phages e g clean waters and wastewater effluents from advanced treatment systems although iso also presents the standardized method iso 10705 3 2003 iso 2003 to validate concentration procedures applied to water samples with low counts of phages although phages have been widely used as indicators of enteric viruses mcminn et al 2017 ballesté et al 2021 toribio avedillo et al 2021 further research is needed to assess their removal during wastewater treatment at different treatment steps contemplating the quantification of different groups of phages presented usepa 2015 dias et al 2018 furthermore the comparison of standardised methods e g iso and usepa is of paramount importance for obtaining results and comparing them in different circumstances and locations as well as to corroborate the use of phages as indicators in drinking water and wastewater legislations and guidelines iawprc 1991 this work intended to perform a systematic literature review regarding the use of phages as viral indicators in municipal wastewater the main two aims of this study were i to gather concentrations and removal efficiencies of two groups of phages somatic coliphages and f specific coliphages in raw and treated effluents considering different types of secondary and tertiary treatment systems applied worldwide and ii to perform an assessment of the methodologies used for the enumeration of phages namely iso and usepa in order to verify differences between them in terms of concentrations and removal efficiencies of coliphages in varied secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment systems 2 methodology for this systematic review a literature scan within the year range from 2000 to 2021 was performed the following terms were searched for in the title abstract and author specified keywords phage or bacteriophage and sewage or wastewater the platforms used were science direct https www sciencedirect com and scopus https www scopus com on the scopus platform in addition to the keywords mentioned the search was limited to the following areas of knowledge environmental sciences agricultural and biological sciences engineering and chemical engineering studies that contained information on the quantification of somatic coliphages and or f specific coliphages in samples of raw or treated domestic wastewater were selected for a more detailed analysis the phage enumeration methods considered were iso methods 10705 2 2000 and 10705 1 1995 iso 1995 2000 usepa methods 1601 1602 1642 and 1643 usepa 2001a 2001b 2018a usepa 2018b only the host bacteria mentioned in the iso and usepa methods were considered e coli strain wg5 and e coli c somatic coliphages as well as s typhimurium strain wg49 f specific coliphages for iso methods e coli strain cn 13 somatic coliphages and e coli strain famp f specific coliphages for usepa methods information about other phage groups and non domestic wastewater were not considered data obtained from bench top and pilot scale studies were disregarded in the vast majority of the considered studies phage enumeration data were found in tables or within the text for those in which the data were presented only in graphs the plot digitizer software version 2 6 8 source forge san diego united states was used to extract the data finally the data obtained concentrations and removal efficiencies were compiled into three groups i coliphages in activated sludge systems ii coliphages in other secondary biological treatment systems and iii coliphages in post treatment systems at the end of the results section a discussion about the use of phages as indicator of viral pathogens is presented 3 results a total of 256 research articles were found on the science direct platform firstly 138 articles were excluded for not containing information about somatic and f specific phages secondly after reading the remaining articles in full 96 articles were excluded for not meeting the established criteria finally a total of 22 research articles from this search were considered for the development of this literature review on the scopus platform a total of 778 research articles were found of which 188 were duplicates from science direct resulting in 590 articles of these 522 were discarded after reading the title abstract and keywords because they did not contain the phage groups of interest after the complete reading of the 68 remaining articles 11 were found to meet the established criteria and were then selected for data analysis and extraction therefore a total of 33 research articles were considered in this systematic literature review fig 1 presents a summary of the screening process the studies considered in this literature review involving phages as indicator organisms in municipal wastewater were performed in all continents except africa fig 1 it was noted that europe is the continent that developed the most research in this line 20 papers representing 60 6 of all research articles considered the country with the highest number of reported studies was the united states with 6 research articles 18 2 regarding the methodology used in the selected studies it can be seen that the majority of them used the iso methods to quantify the two groups of coliphages of the 33 studies analysed 24 72 7 used the iso methodology and 9 studies 27 3 used the usepa methodology for the enumeration of coliphages no mention of usepa methods 1642 and 1643 has been identified in the selected research articles the larger number of research articles applying the iso methods might be due the fact that the iso methods can be applied to a range of water samples e g drinking water wastewater sediments and sludge whereas the usepa methods 1601 and 1602 were restricted to ground water samples only in the late 2010 s the usepa methods 1642 and 1643 targeted wastewater samples all articles were searched for data on concentrations in raw influent and in treated effluent and removal efficiencies at different treatment systems which involved both secondary e g activated sludge membrane bioreactors trickling filters and stabilization ponds and tertiary e g chlorination and uv stages from this the dataset gathered was then compiled taking into account the treatment system applied as well phage enumeration methodology and bacterial host strains used the data obtained are presented in the sections to follow 3 1 coliphages in activated sludge systems of the 33 studies considered in this review 11 provided data on the enumeration of coliphages in wastewater samples associated with activated sludge as systems as presented in table 1 of the 11 articles 7 of them developed the studies based on the iso methodology of which two quantified only somatic phages two only f specific phages and three quantified both coliphages the other four articles used the usepa methods of which two considered somatic phages only one f specific phages only and one both coliphages table 1 presents a summary of the data gathered from the systematic literature review and fig 2 illustrates the data presented regarding the iso methodology concentrations of f specific coliphages reported in the literature ranged from 3 1 to 6 0 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 5 0 log10 pfu 100 ml n 7 in raw wastewater and from 1 4 to 4 7 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 3 1 log10 pfu 100 ml n 8 in as effluents with removal efficiencies values oscillating between 1 3 to 3 0 log10 mean 2 1 log10 n 7 for somatic coliphages the concentration ranged from 5 9 to 6 8 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 6 2 log10 pfu 100 ml n 4 in raw wastewater and from 3 4 to 5 1 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 4 1 log10 pfu 100 ml n 5 in as effluents with removal efficiencies values oscillating between 1 7 and 2 7 log10 mean 2 3 log10 n 4 in terms of the usepa methods only one data was found for f specific coliphages in raw wastewater 5 0 log10 pfu 100 ml thwaites et al 2018 and one for removal efficiency 3 2 log10 francy et al 2012 whereas no values were found for as effluent regarding somatic coliphages only one data was found for raw wastewater 8 7 log10 pfu 100 ml chacón et al 2020 and for as effluent 3 2 log10 pfu 100 ml chacón et al 2020 whereas removal efficiencies ranged from 1 5 to 6 3 log10 mean 4 7 log10 n 6 some discrepancies in terms of removal efficiencies were observed in as systems for somatic coliphages schmitz et al 2018 reported removals of 6 29 log10 usepa whereas dias et al 2019 observed removals of 2 45 log10 iso for f specific coliphages removals of 3 19 log10 usepa francy et al 2012 and 2 13 log10 iso haramoto et al 2015 have been reported as it can be noted from fig 2 the average quantification of somatic coliphages in general tends to present values approximately 1 log10 higher than those obtained for f specific both for raw wastewater and as treated effluents using the iso methods with removal efficiencies very similar to both coliphage groups 2 log10 despite the limited data of phages from usepa methods levels of somatic phages were also greater than f specific phages in raw wastewater and the removal efficiencies were considerably greater than the observed from the iso methods 3 log10 for f specific and 5 log10 for somatic no values of f specific in as effluents were obtained from the literature herein considered in addition as a consequence of the scarcity of results of phages using the usepa methods it was not possible to statistically compare both methods 3 2 coliphages in other wastewater treatment systems considering the studies that monitored phages in wwtp with biological treatment step other than activated sludge a total of 93 data 50 inlet data 20 outlet data 23 removal efficiency data were obtained from 23 research articles as presented in table 2 treatment systems included membrane bioreactors mbr trickling filters tf and stabilization ponds sp in some cases the treatment system was not specified overall the results gathered from the systematic literature review showed concentrations of f specific coliphages varying from 3 1 to 6 4 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 5 2 log10 pfu 100 ml n 14 in raw wastewater and from 0 8 to 5 2 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 3 6 log10 pfu 100 ml n 11 in treated effluents using the iso method with removal rates ranging from 0 2 to 4 4 log10 mean 1 6 log10 pfu 100 ml n 12 all studies used the host strain e coli wg49 following the iso method regarding concentrations of somatic coliphages also using the iso method the range values observed were equal to 2 0 6 2 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 5 5 log10 pfu 100 ml n 10 in raw wastewater and 0 8 5 2 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 4 1 log10 pfu 100 ml n 6 in treated effluents with removal rates of 0 8 5 6 log10 mean 2 5 log10 n 6 all studies considered here used e coli wg5 as the bacterial host strain which is the host strain most commonly used for the enumeration of somatic coliphages following the iso method according to the observed data that used the usepa methods the range values observed for f specific coliphages were 5 0 5 8 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 5 5 log10 pfu 100 ml n 6 in raw wastewater samples only two values were obtained for treated effluents 2 1 log10 pfu 100 ml plummer et al 2014 and 1 9 log10 pfu 100 ml vijayavel et al 2010 for removal efficiencies values ranged from 2 9 to 4 1 log10 mean 3 61 log10 n 3 for the data on somatic coliphages obtained by using the usepa methods 20 different values of data were gathered for raw wastewater range 4 4 7 3 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 5 8 log10 pfu 100 ml whereas only one data point was found for treated effluent 3 13 log10 pfu 100 ml plummer et al 2014 and only two for removal efficiencies 1 4 log10 francy et al 2012 and 2 2 log10 plummer et al 2014 it is important to highlight that as a consequence of the limited data found in terms of treated effluents and removal efficiencies using the usepa methodology it was not possible to carry out in depth comparisons between the two methods however regarding raw wastewater the mean concentrations of f specific coliphages were very similar for both the iso 5 2 log10 pfu 100 ml and the usepa 5 5 log10 pfu 100 ml methods the same was observed for somatic coliphages 5 5 log10 pfu 100 ml and 5 8 log10 pfu 100 ml for the iso and usepa methods respectively after as the most common secondary treatment systems studied in the research articles considered in this work were tf and mbr with four and three studies respectively for tf all studies used the iso methodology whereas for mbr two used the iso methodology and only one used the usepa methods in mbr systems applying the iso methods purnell et al 2015 showed mean removals equal to 3 5 log10 for f specific phages and 5 3 log10 for somatic phages momba et al 2019 reported removal rates below 7 0 log10 in mbr systems in terms of tf systems removal rates ranged between 0 2 and 1 0 log10 for f specific phages and between 0 9 and 1 1 log10 for somatic phages ebdon et al 2011 dias et al 2019 stefanakis et al 2019 removal rates below 1 0 log10 in tf systems were reported by momba et al 2019 some studies have described their treatments in a generic way as only secondary treatment muniesa et al 2009 biological and chemical treatment baggi et al 2001 and sequencing batch reactors flannery et al 2013 only one study presented sp as a secondary treatment barrios et al 2018 four studies presented data on treated effluent without specified treatment and nine studies presented data on raw wastewater only as for as systems it was not possible to statistically compare both methods as a consequence of the limited data 3 3 coliphages in post treatment systems a total of 11 research articles selected in this systematic literature review presented data on quantification and removal of coliphages in tertiary post treatment stages as presented in table 3 eight studies used the iso methodology three studies used the usepa methodology among the types of post treatment identified in the studies uv was the one that appeared the most being present in three studies the removal efficiencies of uv systems ranged from 0 2 to 3 4 log10 mean 1 41 log10 other types of post treatment studied were as follows disinfection with peracetic acid n 1 mbr n 1 constructed wetlands n 4 sand filters n 2 sedimentation ponds n 2 polishing ponds n 1 chlorination n 1 and four studies did not specify the type of post treatment used 3 4 use of phages as indicator of viral pathogens the ecological and survival characteristics of bacterial and viral pathogens vary with different environmental conditions indicating that probably no single indicator organism can predict the presence of all enteric pathogens for all types of water and different faecal pollution savichtcheva and okabe 2006 in this context growing evidence suggests that faecal indicator bacteria fib are unable to accurately indicate the presence the concentration and the persistence of pathogenic viruses in water environments particularly in wastewater treatment plants wwtp usepa 2015 furthermore research shows that fib may not provide sufficient public health protection given that viruses have different persistence survival and transport rates in water bodies edberg et al 2000 ballesté et al 2019 as already mentioned fib are often used to indicate the contamination of waters with faecal matter however e coli and other fib are less resistant to treatment than many viruses dias et al 2018 jebri et al 2017 momba et al 2019 espinosa et al 2021 therefore considering the limitations of using fib as viral indicators there is an increase in interest in the use of phages as viral surrogate organisms this is because phages are similar in size shape structure and genetic composition to human enteric viruses savichtcheva and okabe 2006 venegas et al 2015 thus it is natural that cases occur in which the removal of e coli is significantly greater than that of coliphages and pathogenic viruses as observed by espinosa et al 2021 some of the virus removal mechanisms in wwtp are adsorption to solids and sedimentation predation sunlight mediated inactivation and disinfection verbyla and mihelcic 2015 the adsorption of viral particles to large settleable solids followed by sedimentation is considered one of the main removal mechanisms in several treatment plants verbyla and mihelcic 2015 however it is important to note that adsorption can vary considerably with the characteristics of the viruses such as size hydrophobicity and isoelectric point xagoraraki et al 2014 being the latter dependant on the solution ph verbyla and mihelcic 2015 considering that wastewater and the biomass in wwtp tend to have ph levels close to neutrality vassalle et al 2020 most enteric viruses and coliphages are expected to have negative surface charges and to be adsorbed onto positively charged surfaces xagoraraki et al 2014 while suspended and dissolved particles in wwtps should have a net negative charge verbyla and mihelcic 2015 therefore the adsorption to biomass based on electrostatic interactions of most enteric viruses should be minimal espinosa et al 2021 in this sense further understanding on removal mechanisms of viruses and bacteria in different treatment systems such as adsorption to the biomass flocs granules biofilm physical removal ultra and nanofiltration competition and predation physic disinfection uv light nano and chemical disinfection chlorination could support the adoption of the ideal indicator organism either fib or phages for viral pathogens in the search for more representative viral indicators some studies revealed statistically significant relationships between the detection of human enteric viruses and phages in wastewater samples baggi et al 2001 aw and gin 2010 chacón et al 2020 on the other hand the selection of phages as surrogates for virus contamination should be viewed with caution as the correlation between phages and enteric viruses strongly depends on treatment conditions and the virus type kaliakatsos et al 2019 and in some cases may present a non correlation flannery et al 2012 furthermore the heterogeneous nature of somatic and f specific coliphages implies that the behaviour of specific phages may not be indicative of the whole group so it is often possible and more desirable to elucidate the treatment effect using both groups of phages as a whole momba et al 2019 that said the need for new alternative indicators of enteric viruses is evident being coliphages a good option however as already suggested by iawprc 1991 it is also necessary to standardise the quantification methods of the different groups of phages f specific and somatic as done by iso iso 1995 2000 and usepa usepa 2001a 2001b 2018a 2018b for somatic and f specific coliphages this allows a more effective comparison between studies developed in different parts of the world and assists in the establishment of detection and quantification methods as well as safe levels of phages in water and wastewater guidelines by relevant international institutes from the data collected and analysed in this work it was possible to perceive that there is a propensity of most of them to use the host strains of e coli wg5 iso and e coli cn 13 usepa for somatic coliphages and s typhimurium wg49 iso and e coli famp host strains usepa for f specific coliphages in addition the iso methods was shown to be more commonly applied than the usepa methodology once again it is important to mention that iso methods can be applied to a range of water samples including wastewater whereas the usepa methods were initially restricted to ground water samples methods 1601 and 1602 only targeting wastewater samples in the late 2010 s methods 1642 and 1643 it was also noted the existence of considerable differences in concentrations and removal efficiencies for the same groups of coliphages which underwent the same types of treatment when quantified by different methodologies evidencing the need for comparative studies applying both iso and usepa methods in some studies that showed post treatment phage concentrations results below the detection limits were observed in the final effluent muniesa et al 2009 vijayavel et al 2010 in these cases there is a need to use volumes of samples larger than 1 0 ml such as 5 ml aliquots as indicated in both iso methods 10705 2 2000 iso 2000 and 10705 1 1995 iso 1995 and as done in vijayavel et al 2010 and dias et al 2018 in addition iso also presents the standardized method iso 10705 3 2003 iso 2003 to validate concentration procedures applied to water samples with low counts of phages as performed in different studies hill et al 2007 rhodes et al 2011 gunnarsdottir et al 2020 pinar méndez et al 2022 korajkic et al 2022 more recently pascual benito et al 2022 proposed adaptations of the iso methods using 100 ml samples without prior processing it is important to mention however that usepa methods use larger volumes of samples 100 ml and method 1642 even consider ultrafiltration concentration method for 2 0 l samples another aspect that deserves attention regarding the use of phages as viral indicators is associated with limited or poor quality control of analytical methods and data analysis the use of bacterial host strains obtained from unofficial or unknown origins as well as the non appropriate maintenance of bacterial host strains acquired from official bodies could lead to negative impacts on the levels of phages obtained from both iso and usepa methods as a consequence weak or non robust phage data could be generated one example of that could be linked to situations where high concentrations of traditional faecal indicator bacteria are observed whereas phages are found to be at very low levels or even not detected therefore it is important work on the quality control of analytical methods applied as indicated and requested by both standardised iso and usepa methods and data analysis in order to support improvements of new scientific contributions and further advances in the field it is also important to note that in recent years some pathogenic enveloped viruses have been gaining attention such as the new coronavirus sars cov 2 responsible for the covid 19 pandemic and capable of causing respiratory enteric liver and neurological diseases and causing zhu et al 2020 and the ebola virus ebov which despite being a rare disease has a high mortality rate of about 50 who 2021 in this sense as both sars cov 2 and ebov are found in human excreta and consequently in faecally contaminated waters haas et al 2017 giacobbo et al 2021 it is important to expand studies with regard to the use of new substitutes for enveloped viruses such as the phage phi 6 whitworth et al 2020 it is relevant to highlight however that so far there is no evidence that infectious sars cov 2 are capable of replicating in environmental faecal waste or wastewater sobsey 2022 from the exposed considering what has been reported in the literature it is important to highlight that phages do present the potential to be used as surrogate organisms of viral pathogens in wastewater untreated and treated and wwtp mcminn et al 2017 dias et al 2018 ballesté et al 2021 toribio avedillo et al 2021 however future research comparing both iso and usepa methods for the enumeration of phages in matrices containing human and non human faecal contamination is recommended in addition there is a need for further studies on the quantification of fib phages and pathogenic viruses at different wastewater treatment systems and different treatment steps other phage groups e g phages that infect bacteroides spp total coliphages f specific somatic crassphage bluephages and enveloped phages and indicator organisms e g spores of aerobic bacteria may also be considered in future studies finally it is important perform statistical analysis e g correlations between indicator organisms and i pathogenic organisms ii physic chemical parameters e g cod and tss and iii wwtp operational parameters e g hrt and hlr 4 conclusion after completing this systematic literature review it was possible to compile the main conclusions and results of this research which can be summarized as follows several research articles could not be selected for this review as they did not present basic information regarding phage work such as the quantification method applied and the host strains used there is a great difference in the number of studies developed involving the two methods in question iso and usepa with the iso methods being the most commonly applied in general somatic coliphages were found in greater abundance in raw wastewater and were shown to be more resistant to wwtp than f specific coliphages the use of different standardization methods available makes it difficult to obtain and compare data in different conditions and locations further research is necessary in order to compare both iso and usepa methods in terms of the enumeration of phages in matrices with faecal contamination e g raw and drinking water raw and treated wastewater sewage sludge as well as the concentrations and removal rates of viral and bacterial pathogens and indicators in wwtp declaration of

15133,the use of traditional faecal indicator bacteria as surrogate organisms for pathogenic viruses in domestic wastewater has been noted as a problematic as concentrations and removal rates of bacteria and viruses do not seem to correlate in this sense bacteriophages phages emerge as potential viral indicators as they are commonly found in wastewater in high levels and can be quantified using simple fast low cost methods somatic and f specific coliphages comprise groups of phages commonly used as indicators of water quality there are two internationally recognised methods to detect and enumerate coliphages in water samples the international standardization organization iso and the us environmental protection agency usepa methods both methods are based on the lysis of specific bacterial host strains infected by phages within this context this systematic literature review aimed at gathering concentrations in raw and treated domestic wastewater secondary biological treatment systems and post treatment systems and removal efficiencies of somatic and f specific coliphages obtained by iso and usepa methods and then compare both methods a total of 33 research papers were considered in this study results showed that the iso method is more commonly applied than the usepa method some discrepancies in terms of concentrations and removal efficiencies were observed between both methods higher removal rates were observed for both somatic and f specific coliphages in activated sludge systems when using the usepa method compared to the iso method in other secondary biological treatment systems this was observed only for f specific coliphages the use of different standardised methods available might lead to difficulties in obtaining and comparing phage data in different conditions and locations future research comparing both iso and usepa methods as well as viral and bacterial pathogens and indicators in wwtp is recommended keywords bacteriophages surrogate organisms enteric viruses wastewater treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the biological treatment of municipal wastewater is an important part of sanitation services as it contributes to preventing the degradation of receiving water bodies in addition it can contribute to the removal of pathogenic microorganisms and therefore to control the spread of infectious diseases okoh et al 2010 ibrahim et al 2021 in this context a good performance of wastewater treatment plants enables wastewater reuse activities which compose potential alternatives to tackle high demand and low availability of water in different parts of the world bicudo 2021 the main groups of organisms of interest from a public health point of view associated with water or faeces are bacteria viruses protozoa and helminths von sperling 2007 unep 2016 delahoy et al 2022 partyka et al 2022 conventional municipal wastewater treatment systems have been shown to be more effective at removing traditional faecal indicator bacteria such as escherichia coli e coli and intestinal enterococci than viruses grabow 2001 okoh et al 2010 the reasons why removing pathogenic viruses is typically more challenging than removing enteric bacteria in wastewater treatment plants are primarily because viruses are significantly smaller than bacteria but also because viruses are generally more resistant than enteric bacteria to treatment systems and can more readily pass through widely used biological treatment processes such as activated sludge la rosa et al 2010 purnell et al 2015 pathogenic viruses are widely associated with waterborne diseases and comprise one of the biggest public health problems in the world noroviruses nov are examples of aetiological agents linked to outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis in children ibrahim et al 2020 as well as human adenoviruses hadv are related to gastrointestinal respiratory urinary diseases and other infections silva et al 2011 in view of the search for new viral indicators in municipal wastewater bacteriophages phages that infect enteric bacteria have been proposed as viral indicators as they are commonly excreted in the faeces of humans and other warm blooded animals present strong survival in aquatic environments and have mode of replication structure composition and size similar to enteric viruses naidoo and olaniran 2013 nasser et al 2021 in addition phages are host specific not being able to replicate in water environments usepa 2015 mcminn et al 2017 aghaee et al 2021 phages are also easier to detect than human enteric viruses and can be identified and quantified by conventional and economically viable analytical methods barrios hernández et al 2020 unlike human enteric viruses whose detection and quantification is performed through cell culture or pcr methods which are costly and time consuming jurzik et al 2010 there are some groups of phages that are used to monitor water quality somatic and f specific coliphages are the most commonly phages applied as viral indicators usepa 2015 grabow 2001 phages that infect bacteroides spp can identify human specific contamination tartera and jofre 1987 grabow 2001 ebdon et al 2007 total coliphages composed of somatic and f specific coliphages are also used guzmán et al 2008 there are also other phages that exhibit similar behaviour to viral pathogens and have the potential to be used as indicators of human faecal pollution in effluent samples amongst these bacteriophages infecting host strains of bacteroides spp have been described payan et al 2005 an iso standardized method 10705 4 2001 for the detection and enumeration of these bacteriophages is already available iso 2001 this method has been applied to different phages of bacteroides spp which effectively discriminates the human or animal origin of faecal water pollution muniesa et al 2012 gómez donate et al 2011 in addition in recent years different molecular methods based on the detection of specific sequences also associated with bacteroides bacteriophages specifically related to human contamination known as crassphage have been defined stachler and bibby 2014 garcía aljaro et al 2017 cinek et al 2018 finally the existence of a fast and accessible somatic coliphage detection method is highlighted namely bluephage which has been widely studied and applied toribio avedillo et al 2019 this method is based on cell lysis due to phage infection where the medium basically changes from yellow to dark blue muniesa et al 2018 it is also important to highlight that phage phi 6 a member of the cystoviridae family has been used as an indicator for enveloped viruses such as ebola virus ebov influenza virus and coronavirus including the new sars cov 2 adcock et al 2009 casanova and waka 2013 carvalho et al 2017 whitworth et al 2020 mohapatra et al 2021 enveloped viruses are characterized by having a nucleus capable of incorporating the genetic material of the virus surrounded by a lipid membrane obtained from the cells from which they arise cann 2008 as an enveloped virus the phi 6 phage has a phospholipid envelope casanova and waka 2013 carvalho et al 2017 coliphages compose a subgroup of phages that infect e coli strains and as previously mentioned are the most commonly phages applied as viral indicators jofre et al 2016 somatic coliphages infect e coli and other associated strains and their replication occurs when they adhere to bacterial cell wall receptors they have a morphology similar to enteric dna viruses are abundant in samples contaminated with the faeces of human and other animals and consequently are widely found in domestic sewage toribio avedillo et al 2021 and can be as numerous as bacteria ballesté et al 2022 according to havelaar et al 1990 and the iawprc 1991 f specific coliphages infect strains of e coli through adsorption to the bacterial pili f and although they are not always found in the faeces of humans and other animals unlike somatic coliphages they are commonly found in domestic wastewater which indicates faecal contamination in addition f specific coliphages show similarities morphological fate and transport characteristics with human enteric viruses such as norovirus and hepatitis a virus toribio avedillo et al 2021 both somatic and f specific coliphages are widely used to verify the efficiency of treatment systems blanch et al 2020 it is also known that coliphages have been increasingly proposed as viral indicators by some relevant national and international regulatory institutions ballesté et al 2022 for drinking water nhmrc 2011 health canada 2019 who 2017a 2017b eu 2020a recreational waters nhmrc 2008 usepa 2015 reclaimed waters france 2014 eu 2020b as well as sludge and biosolids dec 2012 colombia 2014 france 2021 in this sense robust methods to detect and quantify phage groups in water samples have been protocoled by agencies such as the international standardization organization iso and the us environmental protection agency usepa blanch et al 2020 in both methodologies phages are enumerated by direct quantitative plaque assays adams 1959 which provide the results in plaque forming units pfu a plaque forming unit is an entity usually composed of one or a group of virions which gives rise to a single plaque jebri et al 2017 the main difference between the two methodologies are as follows i methods iso 10705 are based on a double layer agar technique dal using e coli host strains wg5 atcc 700078 and e coli host strains c atcc 13706 for somatic coliphages iso 10705 2 2000 iso 2000 and salmonella typhimurium host strain wg49 nctc 12484 for f specific coliphages iso 10705 1 1995 iso 1995 ii usepa methods 1602 usepa 2001a and 1643 usepa 2018b are based on a single layer agar technique sal using e coli host strain cn 13 atcc 700609 for somatic coliphages and e coli host strain famp atcc 700891 for f specific coliphages it is important to highlight a few differences between the iso and usepa methods mentioned above iso methods 10705 2 2000 iso 2000 and 10705 1 1995 iso 1995 are based on a double layer agar technique dal use small volumes of samples 1 ml and target a range of samples including drinking water wastewater sludges and sediments on the other hand usepa methods 1602 usepa 2001a and 1643 usepa 2018b are based on a single layer agar technique sal use large volumes of samples 100 ml being the former applicable to ground waters and the latter to secondary wastewater samples without disinfection in addition two other usepa methods are mentioned i qualitative presence absence method 1601 usepa 2001b targeting ground water samples 100 ml and ii quantitative method 1642 usepa 2018a targeting samples such as marine recreational waters as well as advanced secondary with disinfection and tertiary wastewater treatment effluents it is also important to mention that although methods 1601 and 1602 were originally developed for ground waters these two methods have been approved in the 40 code of federal regulations part 136 and can be applied for the quantification of coliphages in wastewater usepa 2015 finally as a consequence of the different analytical volumes used in the iso 1 ml and usepa 100 ml methods different detection limits are obtained being the usepa methods more applicable for samples with lower concentration of phages e g clean waters and wastewater effluents from advanced treatment systems although iso also presents the standardized method iso 10705 3 2003 iso 2003 to validate concentration procedures applied to water samples with low counts of phages although phages have been widely used as indicators of enteric viruses mcminn et al 2017 ballesté et al 2021 toribio avedillo et al 2021 further research is needed to assess their removal during wastewater treatment at different treatment steps contemplating the quantification of different groups of phages presented usepa 2015 dias et al 2018 furthermore the comparison of standardised methods e g iso and usepa is of paramount importance for obtaining results and comparing them in different circumstances and locations as well as to corroborate the use of phages as indicators in drinking water and wastewater legislations and guidelines iawprc 1991 this work intended to perform a systematic literature review regarding the use of phages as viral indicators in municipal wastewater the main two aims of this study were i to gather concentrations and removal efficiencies of two groups of phages somatic coliphages and f specific coliphages in raw and treated effluents considering different types of secondary and tertiary treatment systems applied worldwide and ii to perform an assessment of the methodologies used for the enumeration of phages namely iso and usepa in order to verify differences between them in terms of concentrations and removal efficiencies of coliphages in varied secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment systems 2 methodology for this systematic review a literature scan within the year range from 2000 to 2021 was performed the following terms were searched for in the title abstract and author specified keywords phage or bacteriophage and sewage or wastewater the platforms used were science direct https www sciencedirect com and scopus https www scopus com on the scopus platform in addition to the keywords mentioned the search was limited to the following areas of knowledge environmental sciences agricultural and biological sciences engineering and chemical engineering studies that contained information on the quantification of somatic coliphages and or f specific coliphages in samples of raw or treated domestic wastewater were selected for a more detailed analysis the phage enumeration methods considered were iso methods 10705 2 2000 and 10705 1 1995 iso 1995 2000 usepa methods 1601 1602 1642 and 1643 usepa 2001a 2001b 2018a usepa 2018b only the host bacteria mentioned in the iso and usepa methods were considered e coli strain wg5 and e coli c somatic coliphages as well as s typhimurium strain wg49 f specific coliphages for iso methods e coli strain cn 13 somatic coliphages and e coli strain famp f specific coliphages for usepa methods information about other phage groups and non domestic wastewater were not considered data obtained from bench top and pilot scale studies were disregarded in the vast majority of the considered studies phage enumeration data were found in tables or within the text for those in which the data were presented only in graphs the plot digitizer software version 2 6 8 source forge san diego united states was used to extract the data finally the data obtained concentrations and removal efficiencies were compiled into three groups i coliphages in activated sludge systems ii coliphages in other secondary biological treatment systems and iii coliphages in post treatment systems at the end of the results section a discussion about the use of phages as indicator of viral pathogens is presented 3 results a total of 256 research articles were found on the science direct platform firstly 138 articles were excluded for not containing information about somatic and f specific phages secondly after reading the remaining articles in full 96 articles were excluded for not meeting the established criteria finally a total of 22 research articles from this search were considered for the development of this literature review on the scopus platform a total of 778 research articles were found of which 188 were duplicates from science direct resulting in 590 articles of these 522 were discarded after reading the title abstract and keywords because they did not contain the phage groups of interest after the complete reading of the 68 remaining articles 11 were found to meet the established criteria and were then selected for data analysis and extraction therefore a total of 33 research articles were considered in this systematic literature review fig 1 presents a summary of the screening process the studies considered in this literature review involving phages as indicator organisms in municipal wastewater were performed in all continents except africa fig 1 it was noted that europe is the continent that developed the most research in this line 20 papers representing 60 6 of all research articles considered the country with the highest number of reported studies was the united states with 6 research articles 18 2 regarding the methodology used in the selected studies it can be seen that the majority of them used the iso methods to quantify the two groups of coliphages of the 33 studies analysed 24 72 7 used the iso methodology and 9 studies 27 3 used the usepa methodology for the enumeration of coliphages no mention of usepa methods 1642 and 1643 has been identified in the selected research articles the larger number of research articles applying the iso methods might be due the fact that the iso methods can be applied to a range of water samples e g drinking water wastewater sediments and sludge whereas the usepa methods 1601 and 1602 were restricted to ground water samples only in the late 2010 s the usepa methods 1642 and 1643 targeted wastewater samples all articles were searched for data on concentrations in raw influent and in treated effluent and removal efficiencies at different treatment systems which involved both secondary e g activated sludge membrane bioreactors trickling filters and stabilization ponds and tertiary e g chlorination and uv stages from this the dataset gathered was then compiled taking into account the treatment system applied as well phage enumeration methodology and bacterial host strains used the data obtained are presented in the sections to follow 3 1 coliphages in activated sludge systems of the 33 studies considered in this review 11 provided data on the enumeration of coliphages in wastewater samples associated with activated sludge as systems as presented in table 1 of the 11 articles 7 of them developed the studies based on the iso methodology of which two quantified only somatic phages two only f specific phages and three quantified both coliphages the other four articles used the usepa methods of which two considered somatic phages only one f specific phages only and one both coliphages table 1 presents a summary of the data gathered from the systematic literature review and fig 2 illustrates the data presented regarding the iso methodology concentrations of f specific coliphages reported in the literature ranged from 3 1 to 6 0 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 5 0 log10 pfu 100 ml n 7 in raw wastewater and from 1 4 to 4 7 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 3 1 log10 pfu 100 ml n 8 in as effluents with removal efficiencies values oscillating between 1 3 to 3 0 log10 mean 2 1 log10 n 7 for somatic coliphages the concentration ranged from 5 9 to 6 8 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 6 2 log10 pfu 100 ml n 4 in raw wastewater and from 3 4 to 5 1 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 4 1 log10 pfu 100 ml n 5 in as effluents with removal efficiencies values oscillating between 1 7 and 2 7 log10 mean 2 3 log10 n 4 in terms of the usepa methods only one data was found for f specific coliphages in raw wastewater 5 0 log10 pfu 100 ml thwaites et al 2018 and one for removal efficiency 3 2 log10 francy et al 2012 whereas no values were found for as effluent regarding somatic coliphages only one data was found for raw wastewater 8 7 log10 pfu 100 ml chacón et al 2020 and for as effluent 3 2 log10 pfu 100 ml chacón et al 2020 whereas removal efficiencies ranged from 1 5 to 6 3 log10 mean 4 7 log10 n 6 some discrepancies in terms of removal efficiencies were observed in as systems for somatic coliphages schmitz et al 2018 reported removals of 6 29 log10 usepa whereas dias et al 2019 observed removals of 2 45 log10 iso for f specific coliphages removals of 3 19 log10 usepa francy et al 2012 and 2 13 log10 iso haramoto et al 2015 have been reported as it can be noted from fig 2 the average quantification of somatic coliphages in general tends to present values approximately 1 log10 higher than those obtained for f specific both for raw wastewater and as treated effluents using the iso methods with removal efficiencies very similar to both coliphage groups 2 log10 despite the limited data of phages from usepa methods levels of somatic phages were also greater than f specific phages in raw wastewater and the removal efficiencies were considerably greater than the observed from the iso methods 3 log10 for f specific and 5 log10 for somatic no values of f specific in as effluents were obtained from the literature herein considered in addition as a consequence of the scarcity of results of phages using the usepa methods it was not possible to statistically compare both methods 3 2 coliphages in other wastewater treatment systems considering the studies that monitored phages in wwtp with biological treatment step other than activated sludge a total of 93 data 50 inlet data 20 outlet data 23 removal efficiency data were obtained from 23 research articles as presented in table 2 treatment systems included membrane bioreactors mbr trickling filters tf and stabilization ponds sp in some cases the treatment system was not specified overall the results gathered from the systematic literature review showed concentrations of f specific coliphages varying from 3 1 to 6 4 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 5 2 log10 pfu 100 ml n 14 in raw wastewater and from 0 8 to 5 2 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 3 6 log10 pfu 100 ml n 11 in treated effluents using the iso method with removal rates ranging from 0 2 to 4 4 log10 mean 1 6 log10 pfu 100 ml n 12 all studies used the host strain e coli wg49 following the iso method regarding concentrations of somatic coliphages also using the iso method the range values observed were equal to 2 0 6 2 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 5 5 log10 pfu 100 ml n 10 in raw wastewater and 0 8 5 2 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 4 1 log10 pfu 100 ml n 6 in treated effluents with removal rates of 0 8 5 6 log10 mean 2 5 log10 n 6 all studies considered here used e coli wg5 as the bacterial host strain which is the host strain most commonly used for the enumeration of somatic coliphages following the iso method according to the observed data that used the usepa methods the range values observed for f specific coliphages were 5 0 5 8 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 5 5 log10 pfu 100 ml n 6 in raw wastewater samples only two values were obtained for treated effluents 2 1 log10 pfu 100 ml plummer et al 2014 and 1 9 log10 pfu 100 ml vijayavel et al 2010 for removal efficiencies values ranged from 2 9 to 4 1 log10 mean 3 61 log10 n 3 for the data on somatic coliphages obtained by using the usepa methods 20 different values of data were gathered for raw wastewater range 4 4 7 3 log10 pfu 100 ml mean 5 8 log10 pfu 100 ml whereas only one data point was found for treated effluent 3 13 log10 pfu 100 ml plummer et al 2014 and only two for removal efficiencies 1 4 log10 francy et al 2012 and 2 2 log10 plummer et al 2014 it is important to highlight that as a consequence of the limited data found in terms of treated effluents and removal efficiencies using the usepa methodology it was not possible to carry out in depth comparisons between the two methods however regarding raw wastewater the mean concentrations of f specific coliphages were very similar for both the iso 5 2 log10 pfu 100 ml and the usepa 5 5 log10 pfu 100 ml methods the same was observed for somatic coliphages 5 5 log10 pfu 100 ml and 5 8 log10 pfu 100 ml for the iso and usepa methods respectively after as the most common secondary treatment systems studied in the research articles considered in this work were tf and mbr with four and three studies respectively for tf all studies used the iso methodology whereas for mbr two used the iso methodology and only one used the usepa methods in mbr systems applying the iso methods purnell et al 2015 showed mean removals equal to 3 5 log10 for f specific phages and 5 3 log10 for somatic phages momba et al 2019 reported removal rates below 7 0 log10 in mbr systems in terms of tf systems removal rates ranged between 0 2 and 1 0 log10 for f specific phages and between 0 9 and 1 1 log10 for somatic phages ebdon et al 2011 dias et al 2019 stefanakis et al 2019 removal rates below 1 0 log10 in tf systems were reported by momba et al 2019 some studies have described their treatments in a generic way as only secondary treatment muniesa et al 2009 biological and chemical treatment baggi et al 2001 and sequencing batch reactors flannery et al 2013 only one study presented sp as a secondary treatment barrios et al 2018 four studies presented data on treated effluent without specified treatment and nine studies presented data on raw wastewater only as for as systems it was not possible to statistically compare both methods as a consequence of the limited data 3 3 coliphages in post treatment systems a total of 11 research articles selected in this systematic literature review presented data on quantification and removal of coliphages in tertiary post treatment stages as presented in table 3 eight studies used the iso methodology three studies used the usepa methodology among the types of post treatment identified in the studies uv was the one that appeared the most being present in three studies the removal efficiencies of uv systems ranged from 0 2 to 3 4 log10 mean 1 41 log10 other types of post treatment studied were as follows disinfection with peracetic acid n 1 mbr n 1 constructed wetlands n 4 sand filters n 2 sedimentation ponds n 2 polishing ponds n 1 chlorination n 1 and four studies did not specify the type of post treatment used 3 4 use of phages as indicator of viral pathogens the ecological and survival characteristics of bacterial and viral pathogens vary with different environmental conditions indicating that probably no single indicator organism can predict the presence of all enteric pathogens for all types of water and different faecal pollution savichtcheva and okabe 2006 in this context growing evidence suggests that faecal indicator bacteria fib are unable to accurately indicate the presence the concentration and the persistence of pathogenic viruses in water environments particularly in wastewater treatment plants wwtp usepa 2015 furthermore research shows that fib may not provide sufficient public health protection given that viruses have different persistence survival and transport rates in water bodies edberg et al 2000 ballesté et al 2019 as already mentioned fib are often used to indicate the contamination of waters with faecal matter however e coli and other fib are less resistant to treatment than many viruses dias et al 2018 jebri et al 2017 momba et al 2019 espinosa et al 2021 therefore considering the limitations of using fib as viral indicators there is an increase in interest in the use of phages as viral surrogate organisms this is because phages are similar in size shape structure and genetic composition to human enteric viruses savichtcheva and okabe 2006 venegas et al 2015 thus it is natural that cases occur in which the removal of e coli is significantly greater than that of coliphages and pathogenic viruses as observed by espinosa et al 2021 some of the virus removal mechanisms in wwtp are adsorption to solids and sedimentation predation sunlight mediated inactivation and disinfection verbyla and mihelcic 2015 the adsorption of viral particles to large settleable solids followed by sedimentation is considered one of the main removal mechanisms in several treatment plants verbyla and mihelcic 2015 however it is important to note that adsorption can vary considerably with the characteristics of the viruses such as size hydrophobicity and isoelectric point xagoraraki et al 2014 being the latter dependant on the solution ph verbyla and mihelcic 2015 considering that wastewater and the biomass in wwtp tend to have ph levels close to neutrality vassalle et al 2020 most enteric viruses and coliphages are expected to have negative surface charges and to be adsorbed onto positively charged surfaces xagoraraki et al 2014 while suspended and dissolved particles in wwtps should have a net negative charge verbyla and mihelcic 2015 therefore the adsorption to biomass based on electrostatic interactions of most enteric viruses should be minimal espinosa et al 2021 in this sense further understanding on removal mechanisms of viruses and bacteria in different treatment systems such as adsorption to the biomass flocs granules biofilm physical removal ultra and nanofiltration competition and predation physic disinfection uv light nano and chemical disinfection chlorination could support the adoption of the ideal indicator organism either fib or phages for viral pathogens in the search for more representative viral indicators some studies revealed statistically significant relationships between the detection of human enteric viruses and phages in wastewater samples baggi et al 2001 aw and gin 2010 chacón et al 2020 on the other hand the selection of phages as surrogates for virus contamination should be viewed with caution as the correlation between phages and enteric viruses strongly depends on treatment conditions and the virus type kaliakatsos et al 2019 and in some cases may present a non correlation flannery et al 2012 furthermore the heterogeneous nature of somatic and f specific coliphages implies that the behaviour of specific phages may not be indicative of the whole group so it is often possible and more desirable to elucidate the treatment effect using both groups of phages as a whole momba et al 2019 that said the need for new alternative indicators of enteric viruses is evident being coliphages a good option however as already suggested by iawprc 1991 it is also necessary to standardise the quantification methods of the different groups of phages f specific and somatic as done by iso iso 1995 2000 and usepa usepa 2001a 2001b 2018a 2018b for somatic and f specific coliphages this allows a more effective comparison between studies developed in different parts of the world and assists in the establishment of detection and quantification methods as well as safe levels of phages in water and wastewater guidelines by relevant international institutes from the data collected and analysed in this work it was possible to perceive that there is a propensity of most of them to use the host strains of e coli wg5 iso and e coli cn 13 usepa for somatic coliphages and s typhimurium wg49 iso and e coli famp host strains usepa for f specific coliphages in addition the iso methods was shown to be more commonly applied than the usepa methodology once again it is important to mention that iso methods can be applied to a range of water samples including wastewater whereas the usepa methods were initially restricted to ground water samples methods 1601 and 1602 only targeting wastewater samples in the late 2010 s methods 1642 and 1643 it was also noted the existence of considerable differences in concentrations and removal efficiencies for the same groups of coliphages which underwent the same types of treatment when quantified by different methodologies evidencing the need for comparative studies applying both iso and usepa methods in some studies that showed post treatment phage concentrations results below the detection limits were observed in the final effluent muniesa et al 2009 vijayavel et al 2010 in these cases there is a need to use volumes of samples larger than 1 0 ml such as 5 ml aliquots as indicated in both iso methods 10705 2 2000 iso 2000 and 10705 1 1995 iso 1995 and as done in vijayavel et al 2010 and dias et al 2018 in addition iso also presents the standardized method iso 10705 3 2003 iso 2003 to validate concentration procedures applied to water samples with low counts of phages as performed in different studies hill et al 2007 rhodes et al 2011 gunnarsdottir et al 2020 pinar méndez et al 2022 korajkic et al 2022 more recently pascual benito et al 2022 proposed adaptations of the iso methods using 100 ml samples without prior processing it is important to mention however that usepa methods use larger volumes of samples 100 ml and method 1642 even consider ultrafiltration concentration method for 2 0 l samples another aspect that deserves attention regarding the use of phages as viral indicators is associated with limited or poor quality control of analytical methods and data analysis the use of bacterial host strains obtained from unofficial or unknown origins as well as the non appropriate maintenance of bacterial host strains acquired from official bodies could lead to negative impacts on the levels of phages obtained from both iso and usepa methods as a consequence weak or non robust phage data could be generated one example of that could be linked to situations where high concentrations of traditional faecal indicator bacteria are observed whereas phages are found to be at very low levels or even not detected therefore it is important work on the quality control of analytical methods applied as indicated and requested by both standardised iso and usepa methods and data analysis in order to support improvements of new scientific contributions and further advances in the field it is also important to note that in recent years some pathogenic enveloped viruses have been gaining attention such as the new coronavirus sars cov 2 responsible for the covid 19 pandemic and capable of causing respiratory enteric liver and neurological diseases and causing zhu et al 2020 and the ebola virus ebov which despite being a rare disease has a high mortality rate of about 50 who 2021 in this sense as both sars cov 2 and ebov are found in human excreta and consequently in faecally contaminated waters haas et al 2017 giacobbo et al 2021 it is important to expand studies with regard to the use of new substitutes for enveloped viruses such as the phage phi 6 whitworth et al 2020 it is relevant to highlight however that so far there is no evidence that infectious sars cov 2 are capable of replicating in environmental faecal waste or wastewater sobsey 2022 from the exposed considering what has been reported in the literature it is important to highlight that phages do present the potential to be used as surrogate organisms of viral pathogens in wastewater untreated and treated and wwtp mcminn et al 2017 dias et al 2018 ballesté et al 2021 toribio avedillo et al 2021 however future research comparing both iso and usepa methods for the enumeration of phages in matrices containing human and non human faecal contamination is recommended in addition there is a need for further studies on the quantification of fib phages and pathogenic viruses at different wastewater treatment systems and different treatment steps other phage groups e g phages that infect bacteroides spp total coliphages f specific somatic crassphage bluephages and enveloped phages and indicator organisms e g spores of aerobic bacteria may also be considered in future studies finally it is important perform statistical analysis e g correlations between indicator organisms and i pathogenic organisms ii physic chemical parameters e g cod and tss and iii wwtp operational parameters e g hrt and hlr 4 conclusion after completing this systematic literature review it was possible to compile the main conclusions and results of this research which can be summarized as follows several research articles could not be selected for this review as they did not present basic information regarding phage work such as the quantification method applied and the host strains used there is a great difference in the number of studies developed involving the two methods in question iso and usepa with the iso methods being the most commonly applied in general somatic coliphages were found in greater abundance in raw wastewater and were shown to be more resistant to wwtp than f specific coliphages the use of different standardization methods available makes it difficult to obtain and compare data in different conditions and locations further research is necessary in order to compare both iso and usepa methods in terms of the enumeration of phages in matrices with faecal contamination e g raw and drinking water raw and treated wastewater sewage sludge as well as the concentrations and removal rates of viral and bacterial pathogens and indicators in wwtp declaration of

technology which can be used to remove mps from wastewater treatment plant effluent this study aimed to improve mp removal of cws by optimizing the design of batch operated cw three pilot scale cws were built to study the effect of two design features the use of a support matrix a mixture of bark and biochar and continuous aeration the use of bark biochar as support matrix increased the removal of 11 of 12 studied mps compared to the cw filled with conventional material sand the highest improved removal by the addition of bark biochar was more than 40 median for irbesartan carbamazepine hydrochlorothiazide and benzotriazole aerating the bed of the bark biochar cw did not change mp removal besides the presence of bark biochar also enhanced the removal of total nitrogen during 10 months of operation but no improvement was observed on the total organic carbon and total phosphorus removal considering the application in a batch operated cw mp removal can be greatly enhanced by replacing sand with bark biochar that will act as mp adsorbing matrix graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords post treatment municipal wastewater effluent bark biochar aeration constructed wetland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction micropollutants mps such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products are often detected in the aquatic environment including wastewater surface water groundwater and drinking water at trace concentrations from ng l to μg l luo et al 2014 the discharge of effluent from wastewater treatment plants wttps is considered as a major path to introduce mps to surface water as current wttps are not designed to specifically remove mps kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 luo et al 2014 the discharge of unremoved mps to receiving water bodies may lead to potential risks to ecosystems and humans after short term and or long term exposure such as the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in microorganisms wu et al 2015 in europe some strategies have been implemented to monitor the occurrence and spread of mps in the aquatic environment for example in 2020 the european commission updated the list of priority substances to monitor mp presence in the surface water including nineteen compounds such as the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and the antidepressant venlafaxine and its metabolite o desmethylvenlafaxine decision 2020 1161 eu 2020 upgrading the existing wwtps by adding an additional treatment step i e post treatment is a possible solution to reduce the spread of mps to the aquatic environment for example in the netherlands the ministry of infrastructure and water management the foundation for applied water research stowa and the joint dutch water authorities financed an innovation program micropollutants removal ipmv since 2019 to assess the performance of several tertiary treatment technologies for removal of 19 guide mps from wastewater effluent van weeren et al 2021 these 19 guiding mps such as carbamazepine and diclofenac were selected since they are insufficiently removed in dutch wwtps and often present in the dutch water bodies dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management et al 2020 physical chemical technologies such as activated carbon and ozone are tested or already used as a post treatment step for mp removal in switzerland germany and netherlands athing et al 2018 boehler et al 2012 hollender et al al 2009 margot et al 2013 van weeren et al 2021 compared with the physical chemical technologies biological technologies have the potential to treat wastewater in an eco friendly and sustainable manner such as constructed wetlands cws cws are a natural based wastewater treatment technology which mainly consists of support matrix plants and microorganisms gorito et al 2017 in cws various physical chemical and biological processes take place to remove organic compounds such as photochemical oxidation sorption plant uptake and biodegradation imfeld et al 2009 susarla et al 2002 cws can be classified into free water surface cws fws cws and subsurface flow cws including horizontal flow cws hf cws vertical flow cws vf cws and french vf cws dotro et al 2017 in subsurface flow cws the water flows through the support matrix which is often sand or gravel the support matrix of subsurface flow cws promotes more adsorption and interaction between wastewater support matrix plants and microorganisms resulting in a higher potential to remove biodegradable mps compared to fws cws where the water flows on top of the support matrix gorito et al 2017 cws are either operated in a batch continuous or intermittent feeding mode meng et al 2014 batch feeding mode consists of alternating cycles of filling and draining which brings atmospheric air into the cw bed thereby promoting aerobic biodegradation aerobic biodegradation is generally a more efficient mp removal pathway in cws than anaerobic biodegradation ilyas and hullebusch 2020 for example zhang et al 2012 found that cws with batch feeding mode removed ibuprofen caffeine salicylic acid ketoprofen and diclofenac more efficiently than that with continuous feeding mode some mps are recalcitrant to biodegradation and other removal processes are needed to further remove them such as carbamazepine with sorption as its preferable removal pathway matamoros et al 2005 optimizing the design of batch operated cw can be a solution to improve the removal of this mp possibilities for enhancing mp removal efficiency of batch operated cws by small technological adjustments are the implementation of enhanced adsorption support matrix or aeration sorption is a dominant removal pathway for hydrophobic mps such as carbamazepine matamoros et al 2005 sorption of mps in cws can be improved by adding a support matrix with high adsorption capacity previous studies with columns and small scale indoor cws showed that the re use of natural materials bark and biochar could enhance the removal of mps through enhanced adsorption such as carbamazepine lei et al 2021 2022 the bark and biochar are nature based materials which have potential to be biodegraded after use bark can be biodegraded by fungi to providing nutrients for fungal growth in the fungal bioremediation valentín et al 2010 biological mineralization of biochar has been studied by incubating biochar under diverse conditions such as sand soil inoculum solutions or nutrients liu et al 2013 when applying bark and biochar as support matrix in a cw a higher oxygen consumption within the system can be expected due to active biological activities compared to a cw with sand to maintain aerobic conditions in the bark biochar batch operated cw and promote aerobic biodegradation of mps aeration can be used to maintain aerobic conditions in the cw which is reported as an efficient method to increase an oxidizing condition in batch operated cws stefanakis and tsihrintzis 2012 wu et al 2016 the aim of this study is to determine the effect of two cw design features on the removal efficiency of mps in a batch operated cw the use of an enhanced adsorption support matrix or aeration three pilot scale cws were studied a control with sand as support matrix and two with bark biochar as support matrix of which one was continuously aerated a year round monitoring was performed to evaluate the mp removal in the pilot cws under varying climatic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals trimethoprim was purchased from sigma aldrich us metoprolol

the studied cws the aeration pipe in the bark biochar cw 2 was installed at the middle of 10 cm gravel bottom and 20 cm sand layers fig 1 the cws were planted with typha angustifolia directplant the netherlands in march 2020 and the invasion of other plant species was prevented manually each cw was connected to its own 1 m3 polyvinyl chloride influent tank fig 2 this influent tank was used to make a homogeneous influent for each batch feeding cycle the wwtp effluent was continuously pumped into each influent tank before feeding it into the corresponding cw all cws were run in a semi batch mode with an 8 hour per cycle which was repeated continuously during the operation each cycle consisted of three phases influent feeding treatment and drainage first 0 737 m3 of wwtp effluent was pumped from the influent tank to the cw at a flow rate of 0 05 m3 min in 0 25 h then the wastewater remained in the cw for 7 25 h thereafter the treated wastewater was discharged within 0 5 h the operation mode used in this study batch feeding combined with drainage after a certain period is also used in other mp removal oriented batch operated cws such as dan et al 2017 and marcelino et al 2020 the feeding and discharge cycle was controlled by a siemens logo automation system siemens germany that governed the feeding times and opening and closing of the valves the cws were started in march 2020 and fed with mainly rainwater and occasionally wastewater effluent only in summer due to high water evaporation rate to promote the growth of microorganisms and plants after that the research and addition of mps to the cws started on december 21th 2020 with two phases in phase 1 december 21th 2020 to february 21th 2021 the three cws were fed with wwtp effluent to test the operation of set ups wwtp effluent was continuously pumped into the influent tank with 1535 m min and subsequently fed to the cws according to the feeding cycle in phase 2 february 23th 2021 to december 24th 2021 a stock solution of 29 mg l of target mps each compound was spiked to wwtp effluent at a flow rate of 0 305 ml min to obtain the targeted mp influent for the cws this mp solution was prepared in demi water diluted from a 400 mg l each compound solution prepared in methanol the final concentration of mps in the cw influent was the sum of the actual wwtp effluent concentration and the spiked mps which was around 5 μg l appendix c the wwtp effluent was spiked with mps to achieve a stable concentration of target micropollutants around 5 μg l of each compound during 10 months in this way the observed removal efficiencies in the constructed wetlands at the same climate conditions are due to different configurations of the tested constructed wetlands the mp solution and wwtp effluent were homogeneously mixed in the influent tank as tested in separate experiments appendix d from october 20th 2021 to december 24th 2021 the bed of the bark biochar cw 2 was aerated with a continuous air flow 180 ml min controlled by a brooks 5850e massflow controller brooks veenendaal the netherlands during each cycle during the operation at least two complete influent effluent cycles 8 h per cycle were sampled per month liquid samples were manually collected at the influent t 0 h and effluent t 8 h fig 2 and stored at 20 c prior to chemical analysis 2 4 chemical analysis 2 4 1

ion chromatography with a dionex ics2100 thermo fisher scientific us based on the method of wagner et al 2020a dissolved oxygen of influent effluent and inside the cws was measured by oxygen probe with pst3 sensorspots presens germany and an oxy 10 mini readout unit 2 4 2 micropollutants for the analysis of mps in the influent and effluent of the cws liquid samples were taken and centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was collected for analysis the concentration of 9 target mps was measured with a triple quad 5500 qtrap ready liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms sciex the netherlands except for the sum of 4 and 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole clarithromycin and hydrochlorothiazide the used column was a kinetex 1 7 μm phenyl hexyl 100 a phenomenex usa and its operation temperature was 35 c the injection volume was 25 μl per sample two mobile phases were used eluent a 0 1 fumaric acid in water and eluent b 0 1 fumaric acid in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min samples were analysed with a gradient elution 95 eluent a and 5 eluent b were used from 0 to 0 5 min the composition of two eluents was changed to 20 eluent a and 80 eluent b from 0 5 to 3 5 min this composition was kept from 3 5 to 7 5 min the composition of two eluents was changed again to 95 eluent a and 5 eluent b from 7 5 to 8 5 min this composition was kept constant until 12 4 min a detection range from 50 ng l to 900 ng l was used the internal standards sulfamethoxazole d4 furosemide d5 diclofenac d4 propranolol d7 carbamazepine d10 irbesartan d6 and benzotriazole d4 were used to correct for matrix effects the calibration standards 50 ng l to 900 ng l showed a good linearity r2 0 99 the concentration of sum 4 and 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole clarithromycin and hydrochlorothiazide was measured by aqualysis waterlaboratorium zwolle the netherlands 3 results and discussion 3 1 micropollutants 3 1 1 bark biochar constructed wetland the bark biochar cw 1 and the sand cw were able to remove all 12 target mps after start up fig 3 the bark biochar cw 1 showed a high removal median 80 for trimethoprim metoprolol propranolol furosemide the sum of 4 and 5 methyl 1h benzotrizaole and clarithromycin followed by a moderate removal median from 40 to 80 of benzotriazole irbesartan carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole diclofenac and hydrochlorothiazide these removal efficiencies were similar in the bark biochar cw 2 prior to the aeration period appendix e showing that these two cws were actual duplicates of which one of the two could be used as a control in phase 2 to determine the effect of aeration on the mp removal efficiency by replacing sand with bark and biochar the highest improvement in removal i e with more than 40 median was seen for irbesartan carbamazepine hydrochlorothiazide and benzotriazole fig 3 during 10 months higher removal efficiencies of irbesartan carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide were observed in the bark biochar cw 1 40 to 90 over time than in the sand cw 40 fig 4 this positive effect of bark biochar on the removal of irbesartan and carbamazepine is in line with the findings reported in mesocosm batch operated cws lei et al 2022 in this mesocosm cw study irbesartan and carbamazepine had higher removal efficiencies in the bark biochar cw 80 than in the sand cw 45 and 34 one important reason to explain the improved removal is the higher adsorption capacity of bark biochar to these two mps than the sand as demonstrated by lei et al 2021 in abiotic column tests sorption is likely to be an important removal mechanism for irbesartan in a cw which is firstly reported by the present study carbamazepine is recalcitrant to biodegradation and adsorption is its main removal pathway matamoros et al 2005 the recalcitrant behaviour of carbamazepine was also reported in other sand gravel based batch operated cws 30 nivala et al 2019 in the present study using adsorptive material bark biochar significantly improved the removal of hydrochlorothiazide 60 compared to the sand cw 40 indicating that adsorption is likely an important removal mechanism for hydrochlorothiazide in a cw to date this study is the first research to explore the removal of hydrochlorothiazide in a batch operated cw the removal of hydrochlorothiazide has been studied in continuous operated cws with reported removal varying from with 18 91 by chen et al 2016 and 44 83 by vymazal et al 2017 unlike irbesartan carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide the bark biochar cw1 showed higher removal efficiencies of benzotriazole 70 in the start up phase of operation compared to the sand cw 20 fig 4 after that its removal efficiencies in the sand cw increased over time and were comparable to the bark biochar cw this shows that using bark biochar as support matrix avoids a long adaption period to achieve efficient benzotriazole removal in a cw the main removal mechanisms of benzotriazole in cws are adsorption biodegradation and plant uptake followed by photodegradation with a minor role wagner et al 2020b the efficient removal of benzotriazole at the start up phase probably attributed to the high adsorption of bark biochar to benzotriazole lei et al 2021 reported the bark biochar showed higher adsorption of benzotriazole 75 than sand 8 in abiotic column tests the presence of bark biochar moderately improved the removal of furosemide and diclofenac in the cw ranging from 20 to 40 median compared to the sand cw fig 3 with higher removal efficiencies found in the bark biochar cw over time than the sand cw fig 4 for furosemide and diclofenac the positive effect of bark biochar found in this study is opposed to the conclusion of mesocosm batch operated cws with no effect lei et al 2022 this is explained by the effect of operation conditions in the mesocosm batch operated cws biological processes e g biodegradation and plant uptake play an important role in the removal of these two mps due to ideal conditions with the optimal temperature light and humidity etc lei et al 2022 in contrast in an outdoor environment the biological processes were probably affected by the seasonality and sorption became the main factor to influence the removal of these compounds the bark biochar showed better sorption of furosemide and diclofenac than the sand lei et al 2021 in general the bark biochar cw 1 showed only a slight improvement median 10 for the removal of trimethoprim metoprolol propranolol sulfamethoxazole and the sum of 4 and 5 methyl 1h benzotrizaole during 10 months operation compared to the sand cw fig 3 the added value of bark biochar seems limited for improving the removal of these mps however considering the removal processes in 10 months the bark biochar cw showed a higher removal of these mps in the first months of operation after that the removal efficiencies in the sand cw increased and reached a comparable removal efficiency as in the bark biochar cw fig 4 indicating that biological processes e g biodegradation and plant uptake play an important role in removing these mps in the sand cw and need to be built up before high removal can be reached in the sand cw the bark biochar cw had immediate high removal for these compounds most likely by sorption and on the longer term also biological processes started to contribute to their removal taking trimethoprim as an example trimethoprim was highly removed by the bark biochar cw 1 median 100 and the sand cw median 95 fig 3 the bark biochar cw 1 showed a stable and high removal of trimethoprim during 10 months while it was only moderately removed by the sand cw at the beginning phase of the operation fig 4 after the beginning phase of the operation both cws showed a high removal of trimethoprim close to 100 which is in line with a high removal 100 in the mesocosm batch operated cw filled with bark biochar or sand lei et al 2022 a similar high removal of trimethoprim 95 in summer and 89 in winter was also reported in a sand continuous operated cw by rühmland et al 2015 sorption biodegradation and plant uptake can attribute to trimethoprim removal in a cw trimethoprim was adsorbed by various adsorptive materials in abiotic columns lei et al 2021 and on activated sludge li and zhang 2010 in the present cws the batch feeding offered possible aerobic condition trimethoprim could be removed by heterotroph nitrifying bacteria which may degrade trimethoprim to nh4 that is subsequently converted to no3 during a nitrification process khunjar et al 2011 liu et al 2018 trimethoprim could be taken up from water phase by plants such as typha angustifolia of mesocosm batch operated cws after treatment lei et al 2022 cabbage brassica rapa var pekinensis and wisconsin fast plants brassica rapa herklotz et al 2010 and pea p sativum tanoue et al 2012 thus plants in this study might also have contributed to the removal trimethoprim the bark biochar cw 1 showed a similar removal of clarithromycin with the sand cw close to 100 during 10 months figs 3 and 4 showing that using bark biochar had no added value on the improvement of clarithromycin removal the removal efficiencies of clarithromycin in this study are higher than that in a sand continuous operated cw with 0 17 in summer and 89 in winter ruhmland et al 2015 to date the removal mechanisms of clarithromycin in cws were not reported in the present study such high clarithromycin removal efficiencies close to 100 also occurred in the studied cws during periods with non optimal plant growth before may and after october appendix f indicating a minor role of plants in the removal of this compound it is inferred that biodegradation and or sorption are likely the main removal mechanisms for clarithromycin in the batch operated cw systems this study partly validates the speculation of hijosa valsero et al 2011 on this compound these authors studied clarithromycin removal in diverse continuous operated cws and suggested that photodegradation algal interactions sorption and or a slow biodegradation are the main removal mechanism of this compound in cws with plants playing a minor role for its removal 3 1 2 bark biochar constructed wetland combined with aeration continuous aeration at the bottom of the bark biochar cw 2 was applied during phase 2 the do of the wastewater was monitored at the outlet of the bark biochar cw 1 and cw 2 fig 5 after starting the aeration on ay 1 the do in the effluent of the bark biochar cw 2 was higher max 1 3 mg l to 1 7 mg l than that in the bark biochar cw 1 without aeration max 0 mg l to 0 1 mg l fig 5 this shows that the aeration improved do in the wastewater of the bark biochar cw 2 the aeration used did not change the mp removal efficiencies in the bark biochar cws fig 6 this is due to that the wastewater in the bark biochar cw was not completely depleted in do the bark biochar cw1 in fig 5 and therefore adding more oxygen had no effect on the aerobic biodegradation of mps the positive effect of aeration on improving mp removal from wwtp effluent was reported in gravel based batch operated cw such auvinen et al 2017 in the present study the used batch feeding mode offered an aerobic environment within the bark biochar cws therefore biodegradation of mps was not dependent on the increased availability of oxygen in the system 3 2 water quality parameters the ph and electrical conductivity of the influent and effluent remained similar and stable during the operation of the three cws table 1 indicating the operation stability of the systems the bark biochar cw 1 showed a higher tn removal 50 than the sand cw 23 table 1 this shows that the addition of bark biochar had a positive effect on tn removal in a batch operated cw ajibade et al 2021 reported that incorporating biochar to sand was able to improve nitrogen removal in batch operated cws from secondary effluent as the presence of biochar enhanced the activities of nitrogen removal related microorganisms aeration did not result in a significant change of tn removal table 1 this is due to that the used batch feeding offered an aerobic environment in the cw system and adding more oxygen did not change tn removal in the bark biochar cw the sand cw removed 51 of the tp while negative tp removal efficiencies were observed in the bark biochar cws table 1 nevertheless the concentration of tp in the cw effluents 0 1 0 8 mg l was below the emission standard 2 mg l in the netherlands for wwtps with 2000 to 100 000 population equivalents kenniscentrum infomil 2014 this negative removal means that the bark biochar released phosphorus to the treated wastewater biochar bark and sand contain phosphorus respectively 21 473 mg kg 117 mg kg and 57 mg kg phosphorus appendix g indicating that phosphorus release from biochar can have a big impact on the tp concentration this release of phosphorus from the bark biochar cws reduced over time appendix h a similar phosphorus releasing trend was also reported for biochar made of oak pine and grass in batch experiments mukherjee and zimmerman 2013 all three studied cws showed a similar performance on toc removal of 40 table 1 showing that bark biochar and aeration had no significant effect on toc removal 3 3 implications for application a year round removal performance monitoring is conducive to comprehensively evaluate the highest and lowest treatment performance and the system sensitivity to deal with various operation conditions kahl et al 2017 this study shows that the cw filled with bark biochar increased the removal of most mps studied and tn in a long term operation compared to the cw filled with the conventional material sand reproducible removal efficiencies were gained in the bark biochar cws which shows a stable and constant ability to deal with the change of the composition of pollutants in real operations a longer monitoring is still needed to further study the interaction between the phosphorus release and the cw functioning meanwhile the biochar made by other biomass without phosphorus release can also be considered as a candidate to replace the current biochar used except for animal fecal biochar biochar also includes other types such as straw biochar shell biochar wood biochar and bamboo biochar dai et al 2019 adding a post treatment or replacing the current regular sand to a new type of sand functionalized to enhance binding phosphorus such as iron oxide coated sand boujelben et al 2008 huang et al 2014 can also be alternative solutions to remove the released phosphorus thus more investigations are still important 4 conclusions the present study demonstrates that the addition of bark and biochar as a support matrix strongly improved the removal of most studied mps in a batch operated cw giving a more stable and robust removal in the start up phase as well as in the phase with full grown plants no additional removal was accomplished by aeration measures where it should note that the treated effluent had a dissolved oxygen level by itself from the other water quality parameters monitored in the cw influent and effluent the addition of bark and biochar to the cw promoted the removal for tn compared to the sand cw but not for toc and tp additional cw optimization measures are needed to mitigate the leaching of tp out of the bark biochar matrix funding sources this work was supported by the china scholarship council csc beijing china waterschap vallei en veluwe apeldoorn the

15134,micropollutants mps such as pharmaceuticals and antibiotics are present in the environment at low concentrations ng l μg l a constructed wetland cw is a nature based wastewater treatment technology which can be used to remove mps from wastewater treatment plant effluent this study aimed to improve mp removal of cws by optimizing the design of batch operated cw three pilot scale cws were built to study the effect of two design features the use of a support matrix a mixture of bark and biochar and continuous aeration the use of bark biochar as support matrix increased the removal of 11 of 12 studied mps compared to the cw filled with conventional material sand the highest improved removal by the addition of bark biochar was more than 40 median for irbesartan carbamazepine hydrochlorothiazide and benzotriazole aerating the bed of the bark biochar cw did not change mp removal besides the presence of bark biochar also enhanced the removal of total nitrogen during 10 months of operation but no improvement was observed on the total organic carbon and total phosphorus removal considering the application in a batch operated cw mp removal can be greatly enhanced by replacing sand with bark biochar that will act as mp adsorbing matrix graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords post treatment municipal wastewater effluent bark biochar aeration constructed wetland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction micropollutants mps such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products are often detected in the aquatic environment including wastewater surface water groundwater and drinking water at trace concentrations from ng l to μg l luo et al 2014 the discharge of effluent from wastewater treatment plants wttps is considered as a major path to introduce mps to surface water as current wttps are not designed to specifically remove mps kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 luo et al 2014 the discharge of unremoved mps to receiving water bodies may lead to potential risks to ecosystems and humans after short term and or long term exposure such as the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in microorganisms wu et al 2015 in europe some strategies have been implemented to monitor the occurrence and spread of mps in the aquatic environment for example in 2020 the european commission updated the list of priority substances to monitor mp presence in the surface water including nineteen compounds such as the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and the antidepressant venlafaxine and its metabolite o desmethylvenlafaxine decision 2020 1161 eu 2020 upgrading the existing wwtps by adding an additional treatment step i e post treatment is a possible solution to reduce the spread of mps to the aquatic environment for example in the netherlands the ministry of infrastructure and water management the foundation for applied water research stowa and the joint dutch water authorities financed an innovation program micropollutants removal ipmv since 2019 to assess the performance of several tertiary treatment technologies for removal of 19 guide mps from wastewater effluent van weeren et al 2021 these 19 guiding mps such as carbamazepine and diclofenac were selected since they are insufficiently removed in dutch wwtps and often present in the dutch water bodies dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management et al 2020 physical chemical technologies such as activated carbon and ozone are tested or already used as a post treatment step for mp removal in switzerland germany and netherlands athing et al 2018 boehler et al 2012 hollender et al al 2009 margot et al 2013 van weeren et al 2021 compared with the physical chemical technologies biological technologies have the potential to treat wastewater in an eco friendly and sustainable manner such as constructed wetlands cws cws are a natural based wastewater treatment technology which mainly consists of support matrix plants and microorganisms gorito et al 2017 in cws various physical chemical and biological processes take place to remove organic compounds such as photochemical oxidation sorption plant uptake and biodegradation imfeld et al 2009 susarla et al 2002 cws can be classified into free water surface cws fws cws and subsurface flow cws including horizontal flow cws hf cws vertical flow cws vf cws and french vf cws dotro et al 2017 in subsurface flow cws the water flows through the support matrix which is often sand or gravel the support matrix of subsurface flow cws promotes more adsorption and interaction between wastewater support matrix plants and microorganisms resulting in a higher potential to remove biodegradable mps compared to fws cws where the water flows on top of the support matrix gorito et al 2017 cws are either operated in a batch continuous or intermittent feeding mode meng et al 2014 batch feeding mode consists of alternating cycles of filling and draining which brings atmospheric air into the cw bed thereby promoting aerobic biodegradation aerobic biodegradation is generally a more efficient mp removal pathway in cws than anaerobic biodegradation ilyas and hullebusch 2020 for example zhang et al 2012 found that cws with batch feeding mode removed ibuprofen caffeine salicylic acid ketoprofen and diclofenac more efficiently than that with continuous feeding mode some mps are recalcitrant to biodegradation and other removal processes are needed to further remove them such as carbamazepine with sorption as its preferable removal pathway matamoros et al 2005 optimizing the design of batch operated cw can be a solution to improve the removal of this mp possibilities for enhancing mp removal efficiency of batch operated cws by small technological adjustments are the implementation of enhanced adsorption support matrix or aeration sorption is a dominant removal pathway for hydrophobic mps such as carbamazepine matamoros et al 2005 sorption of mps in cws can be improved by adding a support matrix with high adsorption capacity previous studies with columns and small scale indoor cws showed that the re use of natural materials bark and biochar could enhance the removal of mps through enhanced adsorption such as carbamazepine lei et al 2021 2022 the bark and biochar are nature based materials which have potential to be biodegraded after use bark can be biodegraded by fungi to providing nutrients for fungal growth in the fungal bioremediation valentín et al 2010 biological mineralization of biochar has been studied by incubating biochar under diverse conditions such as sand soil inoculum solutions or nutrients liu et al 2013 when applying bark and biochar as support matrix in a cw a higher oxygen consumption within the system can be expected due to active biological activities compared to a cw with sand to maintain aerobic conditions in the bark biochar batch operated cw and promote aerobic biodegradation of mps aeration can be used to maintain aerobic conditions in the cw which is reported as an efficient method to increase an oxidizing condition in batch operated cws stefanakis and tsihrintzis 2012 wu et al 2016 the aim of this study is to determine the effect of two cw design features on the removal efficiency of mps in a batch operated cw the use of an enhanced adsorption support matrix or aeration three pilot scale cws were studied a control with sand as support matrix and two with bark biochar as support matrix of which one was continuously aerated a year round monitoring was performed to evaluate the mp removal in the pilot cws under varying climatic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals trimethoprim was purchased from sigma aldrich us metoprolol

water methanol and acetonitrile were purchase from actu all chemicals the netherlands 2 2 wastewater effluent the wastewater effluent used was obtained from bennekom wwtp bennekom the netherlands the population equivalent of bennekom wastewater treatment plant is 20 000 de wilt et al 2018 the raw wastewater is treated by primary screening activated sludge clarifier and sand filtration afterwards the treated wastewater effluent is discharged to the surface water average ph and conductivity of the wastewater effluent were 7 2 and 537 μs cm respectively average total organic carbon toc average total nitrogen tn and average total phosphorous tp of wastewater effluent were 8 4 toc mg l 7 5 mg tn l and 0 2 mg tp l respectively the concentration of mps in the treated wwtp effluent is presented in appendix b 2 3 pilot constructed wetlands three pilot scale batch operated subsurface flow cws were built in march 2020 at the campus of wageningen university and research the netherlands a sand cw and two bark biochar cws see fig 1 the cws were built in 11 6 m2 polyethylene basins 3 96 m 2 94 m 1 m that were embedded into the ground the support matrix in the sand cw consisted of 10 cm gravel bottom 10 60 mm 85 cm sand 0 2 mm and 5 cm gravel top the support matrix in the bark biochar cw 1 and 2 consisted of 10 cm gravel bottom 20 cm sand 60 cm of a mixture of bark 5 25 mm lensli the netherlands and biochar made from cow manure 0 5 5 mm mavitec the netherlands with ratio 9 1 wet v v 5 cm sand and 5 cm gravel top influent and effluent pipes were installed at the top and bottom of the studied cws the aeration pipe in the bark biochar cw 2 was installed at the middle of 10 cm gravel bottom and 20 cm sand layers fig 1 the cws were planted with typha angustifolia directplant the netherlands in march 2020 and the invasion of other plant species was prevented manually each cw was connected to its own 1 m3 polyvinyl chloride influent tank fig 2 this influent tank was used to make a homogeneous influent for each batch feeding cycle the wwtp effluent was continuously pumped into each influent tank before feeding it into the corresponding cw all cws were run in a semi batch mode with an 8 hour per cycle which was repeated continuously during the operation each cycle consisted of three phases influent feeding treatment and drainage first 0 737 m3 of wwtp effluent was pumped from the influent tank to the cw at a flow rate of 0 05 m3 min in 0 25 h then the wastewater remained in the cw for 7 25 h thereafter the treated wastewater was discharged within 0 5 h the operation mode used in this study batch feeding combined with drainage after a certain period is also used in other mp removal oriented batch operated cws such as dan et al 2017 and marcelino et al 2020 the feeding and discharge cycle was controlled by a siemens logo automation system siemens germany that governed the feeding times and opening and closing of the valves the cws were started in march 2020 and fed with mainly rainwater and occasionally wastewater effluent only in summer due to high water evaporation rate to promote the growth of microorganisms and plants after that the research and addition of mps to the cws started on december 21th 2020 with two phases in phase 1 december 21th 2020 to february 21th 2021 the three cws were fed with wwtp effluent to test the operation of set ups wwtp effluent was continuously pumped into the influent tank with 1535 m min and subsequently fed to the cws according to the feeding cycle in phase 2 february 23th 2021 to december 24th 2021 a stock solution of 29 mg l of target mps each compound was spiked to wwtp effluent at a flow rate of 0 305 ml min to obtain the targeted mp influent for the cws this mp solution was prepared in demi water diluted from a 400 mg l each compound solution prepared in methanol the final concentration of mps in the cw influent was the sum of the actual wwtp effluent concentration and the spiked mps which was around 5 μg l appendix c the wwtp effluent was spiked with mps to achieve a stable concentration of target micropollutants around 5 μg l of each compound during 10 months in this way the observed removal efficiencies in the constructed wetlands at the same climate conditions are due to different configurations of the tested constructed wetlands the mp solution and wwtp effluent were homogeneously mixed in the influent tank as tested in separate experiments appendix d from october 20th 2021 to december 24th 2021 the bed of the bark biochar cw 2 was aerated with a continuous air flow 180 ml min controlled by a brooks 5850e massflow controller brooks veenendaal the netherlands during each cycle during the operation at least two complete influent effluent cycles 8 h per cycle were sampled per month liquid samples were manually collected at the influent t 0 h and effluent t 8 h fig 2 and stored at 20 c prior to chemical analysis 2 4 chemical analysis 2 4 1

with pst3 sensorspots presens germany and an oxy 10 mini readout unit 2 4 2 micropollutants for the analysis of mps in the influent and effluent of the cws liquid samples were taken and centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was collected for analysis the concentration of 9 target mps was measured with a triple quad 5500 qtrap ready liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms sciex the netherlands except for the sum of 4 and 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole clarithromycin and hydrochlorothiazide the used column was a kinetex 1 7 μm phenyl hexyl 100 a phenomenex usa and its operation temperature was 35 c the injection volume was 25 μl per sample two mobile phases were used eluent a 0 1 fumaric acid in water and eluent b 0 1 fumaric acid in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min samples were analysed with a gradient elution 95 eluent a and 5 eluent b were used from 0 to 0 5 min the composition of two eluents was changed to 20 eluent a and 80 eluent b from 0 5 to 3 5 min this composition was kept from 3 5 to 7 5 min the composition of two eluents was changed again to 95 eluent a and 5 eluent b from 7 5 to 8 5 min this composition was kept constant until 12 4 min a detection range from 50 ng l to 900 ng l was used the internal standards sulfamethoxazole d4 furosemide d5 diclofenac d4 propranolol d7 carbamazepine d10 irbesartan d6 and benzotriazole d4 were used to correct for matrix effects the calibration standards 50 ng l to 900 ng l showed a good linearity r2 0 99 the concentration of sum 4 and 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole clarithromycin and hydrochlorothiazide was measured by aqualysis waterlaboratorium zwolle the netherlands 3 results and discussion 3 1 micropollutants 3 1 1 bark biochar constructed wetland the bark biochar cw 1 and the sand cw were able to remove all 12 target mps after start up fig 3 the bark biochar cw 1 showed a high removal median 80 for trimethoprim metoprolol propranolol furosemide the sum of 4 and 5 methyl 1h benzotrizaole and clarithromycin followed by a moderate removal median from 40 to 80 of benzotriazole irbesartan carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole diclofenac and hydrochlorothiazide these removal efficiencies were similar in the bark biochar cw 2 prior to the aeration period appendix e showing that these two cws were actual duplicates of which one of the two could be used as a control in phase 2 to determine the effect of aeration on the mp removal efficiency by replacing sand with bark and biochar the highest improvement in removal i e with more than 40 median was seen for irbesartan carbamazepine hydrochlorothiazide and benzotriazole fig 3 during 10 months higher removal efficiencies of irbesartan carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide were observed in the bark biochar cw 1 40 to 90 over time than in the sand cw 40 fig 4 this positive effect of bark biochar on the removal of irbesartan and carbamazepine is in line with the findings reported in mesocosm batch operated cws lei et al 2022 in this mesocosm cw study irbesartan and carbamazepine had higher removal efficiencies in the bark biochar cw 80 than in the sand cw 45 and 34 one important reason to explain the improved removal is the higher adsorption capacity of bark biochar to these two mps than the sand as demonstrated by lei et al 2021 in abiotic column tests sorption is likely to be an important removal mechanism for irbesartan in a cw which is firstly reported by the present study carbamazepine is recalcitrant to biodegradation and adsorption is its main removal pathway matamoros et al 2005 the recalcitrant behaviour of carbamazepine was also reported in other sand gravel based batch operated cws 30 nivala et al 2019 in the present study using adsorptive material bark biochar significantly improved the removal of hydrochlorothiazide 60 compared to the sand cw 40 indicating that adsorption is likely an important removal mechanism for hydrochlorothiazide in a cw to date this study is the first research to explore the removal of hydrochlorothiazide in a batch operated cw the removal of hydrochlorothiazide has been studied in continuous operated cws with reported removal varying from with 18 91 by chen et al 2016 and 44 83 by vymazal et al 2017 unlike irbesartan carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide the bark biochar cw1 showed higher removal efficiencies of benzotriazole 70 in the start up phase of operation compared to the sand cw 20 fig 4 after that its removal efficiencies in the sand cw increased over time and were comparable to the bark biochar cw this shows that using bark biochar as support matrix avoids a long adaption period to achieve efficient benzotriazole removal in a cw the main removal mechanisms of benzotriazole in cws are adsorption biodegradation and plant uptake followed by photodegradation with a minor role wagner et al 2020b the efficient removal of benzotriazole at the start up phase probably attributed to the high adsorption of bark biochar to benzotriazole lei et al 2021 reported the bark biochar showed higher adsorption of benzotriazole 75 than sand 8 in abiotic column tests the presence of bark biochar moderately improved the removal of furosemide and diclofenac in the cw ranging from 20 to 40 median compared to the sand cw fig 3 with higher removal efficiencies found in the bark biochar cw over time than the sand cw fig 4 for furosemide and diclofenac the positive effect of bark biochar found in this study is opposed to the conclusion of mesocosm batch operated cws with no effect lei et al 2022 this is explained by the effect of operation conditions in the mesocosm batch operated cws biological processes e g biodegradation and plant uptake play an important role in the removal of these two mps due to ideal conditions with the optimal temperature light and humidity etc lei et al 2022 in contrast in an outdoor environment the biological processes were probably affected by the seasonality and sorption became the main factor to influence the removal of these compounds the bark biochar showed better sorption of furosemide and diclofenac than the sand lei et al 2021 in general the bark biochar cw 1 showed only a slight improvement median 10 for the removal of trimethoprim metoprolol propranolol sulfamethoxazole and the sum of 4 and 5 methyl 1h benzotrizaole during 10 months operation compared to the sand cw fig 3 the added value of bark biochar seems limited for improving the removal of these mps however considering the removal processes in 10 months the bark biochar cw showed a higher removal of these mps in the first months of operation after that the removal efficiencies in the sand cw increased and reached a comparable removal efficiency as in the bark biochar cw fig 4 indicating that biological processes e g biodegradation and plant uptake play an important role in removing these mps in the sand cw and need to be built up before high removal can be reached in the sand cw the bark biochar cw had immediate high removal for these compounds most likely by sorption and on the longer term also biological processes started to contribute to their removal taking trimethoprim as an example trimethoprim was highly removed by the bark biochar cw 1 median 100 and the sand cw median 95 fig 3 the bark biochar cw 1 showed a stable and high removal of trimethoprim during 10 months while it was only moderately removed by the sand cw at the beginning phase of the operation fig 4 after the beginning phase of the operation both cws showed a high removal of trimethoprim close to 100 which is in line with a high removal 100 in the mesocosm batch operated cw filled with bark biochar or sand lei et al 2022 a similar high removal of trimethoprim 95 in summer and 89 in winter was also reported in a sand continuous operated cw by rühmland et al 2015 sorption biodegradation and plant uptake can attribute to trimethoprim removal in a cw trimethoprim was adsorbed by various adsorptive materials in abiotic columns lei et al 2021 and on activated sludge li and zhang 2010 in the present cws the batch feeding offered possible aerobic condition trimethoprim could be removed by heterotroph nitrifying bacteria which may degrade trimethoprim to nh4 that is subsequently converted to no3 during a nitrification process khunjar et al 2011 liu et al 2018 trimethoprim could be taken up from water phase by plants such as typha angustifolia of mesocosm batch operated cws after treatment lei et al 2022 cabbage brassica rapa var pekinensis and wisconsin fast plants brassica rapa herklotz et al 2010 and pea p sativum tanoue et al 2012 thus plants in this study might also have contributed to the removal trimethoprim the bark biochar cw 1 showed a similar removal of clarithromycin with the sand cw close to 100 during 10 months figs 3 and 4 showing that using bark biochar had no added value on the improvement of clarithromycin removal the removal efficiencies of clarithromycin in this study are higher than that in a sand continuous operated cw with 0 17 in summer and 89 in winter ruhmland et al 2015 to date the removal mechanisms of clarithromycin in cws were not reported in the present study such high clarithromycin removal efficiencies close to 100 also occurred in the studied cws during periods with non optimal plant growth before may and after october appendix f indicating a minor role of plants in the removal of this compound it is inferred that biodegradation and or sorption are likely the main removal mechanisms for clarithromycin in the batch operated cw systems this study partly validates the speculation of hijosa valsero et al 2011 on this compound these authors studied clarithromycin removal in diverse continuous operated cws and suggested that photodegradation algal interactions sorption and or a slow biodegradation are the main removal mechanism of this compound in cws with plants playing a minor role for its removal 3 1 2 bark biochar constructed wetland combined with aeration continuous aeration at the bottom of the bark biochar cw 2 was applied during phase 2 the do of the wastewater was monitored at the outlet of the bark biochar cw 1 and cw 2 fig 5 after starting the aeration on ay 1 the do in the effluent of the bark biochar cw 2 was higher max 1 3 mg l to 1 7 mg l than that in the bark biochar cw 1 without aeration max 0 mg l to 0 1 mg l fig 5 this shows that the aeration improved do in the wastewater of the bark biochar cw 2 the aeration used did not change the mp removal efficiencies in the bark biochar cws fig 6 this is due to that the wastewater in the bark biochar cw was not completely depleted in do the bark biochar cw1 in fig 5 and therefore adding more oxygen had no effect on the aerobic biodegradation of mps the positive effect of aeration on improving mp removal from wwtp effluent was reported in gravel based batch operated cw such auvinen et al 2017 in the present study the used batch feeding mode offered an aerobic environment within the bark biochar cws therefore biodegradation of mps was not dependent on the increased availability of oxygen in the system 3 2 water quality parameters the ph and electrical conductivity of the influent and effluent remained similar and stable during the operation of the three cws table 1 indicating the operation stability of the systems the bark biochar cw 1 showed a higher tn removal 50 than the sand cw 23 table 1 this shows that the addition of bark biochar had a positive effect on tn removal in a batch operated cw ajibade et al 2021 reported that incorporating biochar to sand was able to improve nitrogen removal in batch operated cws from secondary effluent as the presence of biochar enhanced the activities of nitrogen removal related microorganisms aeration did not result in a significant change of tn removal table 1 this is due to that the used batch feeding offered an aerobic environment in the cw system and adding more oxygen did not change tn removal in the bark biochar cw the sand cw removed 51 of the tp while negative tp removal efficiencies were observed in the bark biochar cws table 1 nevertheless the concentration of tp in the cw effluents 0 1 0 8 mg l was below the emission standard 2 mg l in the netherlands for wwtps with 2000 to 100 000 population equivalents kenniscentrum infomil 2014 this negative removal means that the bark biochar released phosphorus to the treated wastewater biochar bark and sand contain phosphorus respectively 21 473 mg kg 117 mg kg and 57 mg kg phosphorus appendix g indicating that phosphorus release from biochar can have a big impact on the tp concentration this release of phosphorus from the bark biochar cws reduced over time appendix h a similar phosphorus releasing trend was also reported for biochar made of oak pine and grass in batch experiments mukherjee and zimmerman 2013 all three studied cws showed a similar performance on toc removal of 40 table 1 showing that bark biochar and aeration had no significant effect on toc removal 3 3 implications for application a year round removal performance monitoring is conducive to comprehensively evaluate the highest and lowest treatment performance and the system sensitivity to deal with various operation conditions kahl et al 2017 this study shows that the cw filled with bark biochar increased the removal of most mps studied and tn in a long term operation compared to the cw filled with the conventional material sand reproducible removal efficiencies were gained in the bark biochar cws which shows a stable and constant ability to deal with the change of the composition of pollutants in real operations a longer monitoring is still needed to further study the interaction between the phosphorus release and the cw functioning meanwhile the biochar made by other biomass without phosphorus release can also be considered as a candidate to replace the current biochar used except for animal fecal biochar biochar also includes other types such as straw biochar shell biochar wood biochar and bamboo biochar dai et al 2019 adding a post treatment or replacing the current regular sand to a new type of sand functionalized to enhance binding phosphorus such as iron oxide coated sand boujelben et al 2008 huang et al 2014 can also be alternative solutions to remove the released phosphorus thus more investigations are still important 4 conclusions the present study demonstrates that the addition of bark and biochar as a support matrix strongly improved the removal of most studied mps in a batch operated cw giving a more stable and robust removal in the start up phase as well as in the phase with full grown plants no additional removal was accomplished by aeration measures where it should note that the treated effluent had a dissolved oxygen level by itself from the other water quality parameters monitored in the cw influent and effluent the addition of bark and biochar to the cw promoted the removal for tn compared to the sand cw but not for toc and tp additional cw optimization measures are needed to mitigate the leaching of tp out of the bark biochar matrix funding sources this work was supported by the china scholarship council csc beijing china waterschap vallei en veluwe apeldoorn the
