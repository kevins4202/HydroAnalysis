10970,drought stress due to its stage of occurrence is one of the factors affecting wheat yield and jasmonates are plant growth regulators that play an important role in increasing the resistance of plants to environmental stresses such as drought stress therefore in order to study the effect of spraying different concentrations of methyl jasmonate on water productivity yield and its components of two wheat cultivars under different irrigation regimes a split factorial experiment was conducted based on a randomized complete block design with three replications in two crop years 2015 2017 in this experiment different irrigation regimes including normal irrigation control irrigation cut off from the booting and milk stage as the main factor and two wheat cultivars and various concentrations of methyl jasmonate in four levels of 0 50 100 and 150 μm were investigated as factorial in subfactor the results showed that use of 100 μm methyl jasmonate increase growth period and a number of days until plant physiological maturity under drought stress conditions the number of grains per spike weight of one thousand seed grain yield and harvest index are decreased in every two years of experiment also using 100 μm methyl jasmonate lead to increase these traits by 22 2 14 4 8 5 and 11 4 respectively in pishtaz cultivar and 10 3 10 7 8 5 and 11 2 respectively in the sirvan cultivar compared to the control group the highest water productivity at each of the three levels of irrigation was related to the concentration of 100 μm methyl jasmonate according to the results although drought stress reduced yield and its components methyl jasmonate was able to compensate somewhat 10 for the reduced yield due to drought stress the irrigation cut off at the grain milking stage can be beneficial with increasing water productivity in managing this valuable resource also the use of 100 μm jasmonate in these conditions is recommended as a practical way to increase tolerance to drought stress conditions and improve the growth and yield of wheat keywords jasmonic acid plant growth regulator drought stress water productivity irrigation management 1 introduction global climate change exacerbates the effects of various environmental stresses on crop growth consequently crop production around the world will be at risk crops in their natural habitat should tolerate several abiotic stresses such as drought salinity heat and cold fahad et al 2015 drought stress is considered to be the most important global threat to food security and limits production rate tardieu 2011 therefore low irrigation is an optimal solution for agricultural production in water deficit conditions the main objective of low irrigation irrigation cut off is to increase the water use efficiency by reducing the irrigation water extent at each period or removing irrigation with the lowest productivity zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 over the past several decades developing countries have gradually become major wheat importers and wheat accounts for 43 of food imports in these countries dixon et al 2009 in regions with mediterranean climate wheat grain filling stage is often associated with drought stress richards et al 2001 which reduced grain yield by decreasing the rate of photosynthesis source size aging of leaves physiological sink capacity number of endosperm cells and enzymatic activity of grain and shortening the grain filling period royo et al 2000 yang and zhang 2006 in most wheat growing regions grain filling is affected by biotic and abiotic stresses using photosynthetic materials in this case the final and general result of these stresses is the wrinkled grain the reduction in the weight of a thousand grains and thus the decrease in grain yield mohammadi et al 2010 the effect of drought stress on development and yield depends on the sensitivity of the growth and development stage of the plant for example the occurrence of water stress in the pollination stage reduced the number of fertilized spikes a number of spikes and the number of grains per spike are susceptible to drought stress ahmadi lahijani and emam 2016 also the occurrence of drought stress from the pollination stage to the maturity decreases the average weight of the grains wang et al 2014 ehdaie et al 2008 observed that in wheat the average weight of thousand grains under drought stress after flowering decreased from 46 8 to 34 7 g drought stress significantly reduces biological yield harvest indexو and wheat water use efficiency ahmadi and bajelan 2008 due to the fact that the nutrients are absorbed as water soluble limitation in water resources leads to a limitation in all nourishment sources and the plant is forced to slow down the vegetative growth and to finish the vegetative stage early and begin the reproductive stage as a result the length of the growth period plant height peduncle length straw yield and even the length of the awn decreases this is interpreted by mitra 2001 as an escape from the drought riaz and chowdhry 2003 stated that the number of grains per spike is one of the most important components of yield in wheat the genotypes that are shown stability for this trait are often show more tolerant under drought stress samarah 2005 showed that drought stress reduced grain yield by falling the number of grain per spike and weight of thousand grains but the number of tillers was not affected compared to the stress free conditions nouri ganbalani et al 2009 examined 13 autumn wheat genotypes under drought stress conditions after heading by irrigation cut off method who stated that grain yield of genotypes in these conditions decreased by an average of 50 however the decrease in grain yield was not the same for all cultivars and some of them were less affected by drought stress increasing the number of grains per spike as a way to increase yield under drought stress cannot possibly have a positive effect on grain yield because under the photosynthetic restriction conditions the increase in the number of grains will be accompanied by a reduction in the weight of grains and will not result in improved grain yields gonzález et al 2007 in the estimation of wheat water productivity using long term yield statistics and the hydrologic model for determining evapotranspiration it was found that wheat water productivity was varied from 0 15 to 1 55 rainfed wheat and 0 28 to 0 75 kg m3 irrigated wheat and this range of variations was higher for rainfed wheat faramarzi et al 2010 in order to improve water use efficiency the yield should be increased along with the reduction of water consumption based on the results water use efficiency based on the wheat biomass at the tillering and vegetative stages until stem elongation and stem elongation until heading was in the range of 1 37 4 03 and 6 41 7 03 kg m3 respectively the maximum water use efficiency occurred at the heading stage and then began to decrease zhao et al 2007 typically abiotic stresses reduce the synthesis of plant hormones and destroy these hormones in plants under this condition the use of growth regulators before seeding seed priming or in plant growth stages spraying may be useful to compensate for internal deficiencies of growth regulators and to reduce the destructive effects of abiotic stresses ashraf and foolad 2007 jasmonates as a family of phytohormones play an important role in plant growth there are reports of the involvement of jasmonic acid in drought stress tiwari et al 2016 in other studies it has been reported that the use of salicylic acid and jasmonic acid increases grain yield anjum et al 2011 vahabi et al 2017 showed that water stress and increase in its intensity reduced leaf area spike length number of grains per spike biological yield and wheat grain yield however using growth regulators improved grain yield components and eventually increased grain yield however the effect of chlormequat chloride was higher than salicylic acid and jasmonic acid so that the spraying of these three regulators increased grain yield by 7 20 8 13 and 24 7 in the greenhouse experiment and 3 18 2 12 and 1 8 in the field experiment respectively the use of growth regulators is easier and more economical than breeding methods which are often long term and cost effective bartels and sunkar 2005 the use of plant growth regulating agents such as methyl jasmonate can be a practical way to reduce the damage caused by drought stress in recent years the use of plant growth regulators or plant hormones has expanded to improve plant growth under stress and non stress conditions jasmonic acid and methyl jasmonate are regulating materials that have been considered in this regard however there is not much information about the best using method and use rate of them in different wheat cultivars and the exact amount and effects of it in different plants under stress conditions therefore the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of methyl jasmonate on the yield and its components of two bread wheat cultivars under the drought stress at the end of the season 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and climatic characteristics the research was carried out in a research farm with the longitude of 52 41 e and the latitude of 29 58 n and a height of 1595 m from the sea level in fars province iran the average annual rainfall was 365 mm and the maximum and minimum temperature were 41 and 9 c respectively table 1 the physical and chemical analysis of the soil of the site before the first and second planting were shown in table 1 2 2 experimental material the seeds of wheat sirvan and pishtaz cultivar were planted on november 15 2015 and 2016 in plots with the length of 4 m the width of 1 6 m 8 planting rows with 20 cm row spacing and a planting density of 400 plants per m2 wheat sirvan cultivar with prl 2 pastor pedigrees ws 85 10 code high yield and good bakery quality is proposed for naming and replacing part of the area under cultivation of irrigated cultivars in the regions facing drought stress compatible with warm to moderate climate najafian et al 2012 pishtaz wheat cultivar has a spring growth type and the height of 92 cm fertilization resistance to lodging high water use efficiency and moderate drought tolerance are another characteristic of wheat pishtaz cultivar abdoli and saeidi 2012 all experimental plots were irrigated at the same time until the booting the plots for the first stress were not irrigated from the booting code 45 of the zadoks table and for the second one irrigation cut off from the grain milking stage code 71 72 of the zadoks table at the time of stress application the control treatment was irrigated normally the different concentrations of methyl jasmonate 0 50 100 and 150 μm was sprayed at the end of april of every two years 2016 and 2017 when the stipules appear 39 in accordance with the zadoks before applying drought stress 1 5 liters of solution was used for each plot using knapsack sprayer 2 3 measuring method the number of days until heading number of days until physiological maturity and plant height were measured in each plot at the end grain yield per m2 and its components number of spikes per m2 number of grains per spike and weight of thousand grains biological yield per m2 and harvest index were calculated at the time of physiological maturity the water productivity was calculated by dividing the grain yield to total irrigation water measured with volume meter and rainfall howell 1994 2 4 statistical analysis the experiment was conducted as split factorial in a randomized complete block design with three replications in two crop years of 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 data were exposed to two way analysis of variance anova using sas statistical software bartlett test was carried out on all traits studied and when the error variance of the traits was homogeneous for two consecutive years the combined analysis of the data was performed the tables of variance analysis were not shown in the manuscript but were publicized in supplementary materials if main treatments and interactions were significant the comparison of interaction was merely described in results in order to compare the average of the main effects or interactions after slicing the least squares difference lsd test at 5 error probability level were used 3 results 3 1 the role of methyl jasmonate on plant growth traits in different irrigation regimes the length of the plant growth period is usually influenced by different irrigation regimes comparing the means of the number of days until heading under the influence of irrigation and drought stress levels showed that the highest number of days until heading was observed under non stress conditions stress at the stage of grain milking and booting respectively at all levels of stress and in both cultivars in each two years the concentration of 100 μm of methyl jasmonate increased this trait compared to the non hormone levels so that under full irrigation conditions the use of this level of methyl jasmonate increased the number of days until heading in both bread wheat cultivars by about 3 compared to the non hormone conditions the use of 100 μm of methyl jasmonate in the irrigation cut off regime at the stage of booting also caused the highest amount of time until heading which increased by 3 in pishtaz cultivar and 3 2 in the sirvan cultivar compared to the non hormone level this increase at irrigation intercut off condition during milking stage was 3 8 and 2 3 in two wheat cultivars respectively however it was reduced only 0 7 compared to the full irrigation conditions fig 1 the results of plant growth a maturity period indicated that the highest number of days until the physiological maturity of wheat grain was observed in non stress condition drought stress at the milking stage and booting respectively under full irrigation conditions pishtaz cultivar under the influence of 100 μm hormones had the highest amount of days until physiological maturity which had a 2 difference with non hormone levels but there was no significant difference between 50 and 100 μm concentrations in sirvan cultivar under irrigation cut off regime at the booting the number of days until physiological maturity compared to the stress conditions in both pishtaz and sirvan cultivars was reduced by 6 5 and 6 1 however the use of 100 μm methyl jasmonate in these conditions resulted in an increase in the number of days until physiological maturity by 2 3 in both cultivars compared to the non hormone the irrigation cut off regime in the grain milking stage reduced the maturity period in pishtaz and sirvan cultivars by 2 5 and 1 respectively compared to non stress conditions as in the previous condition the use of 100 μm of methyl jasmonate increased this period by 2 3 and 3 in both wheat cultivars compared to control no hormone respectively fig 2 comparison of means shows that in all environmental conditions sirvan cultivar had the utmost height compared to pishtaz cultivar withhold of irrigation at the booting reduced the plant height in the sirvan cultivar by 29 6 and 15 5 in the first and second years of experiment respectively compared to the full irrigation withhold of irrigation at the grain milking stage reduced the plant height in the sirvan cultivar by 11 4 and 7 3 in the first and second years of experiment respectively fig 3 a under full irrigation and irrigation cut off at the booting the use of 100 μm hormones increased the height by 6 2 and 5 respectively compared to the non hormone group at the stress in grain milking stage the maximum height was observed using 50 μm of methyl jasmonate which showed no significant difference with 100 μm hormones fig 3b in both wheat cultivars the highest plant height was related to 100 μm methyl jasmonate this concentration of hormone increased plant height by about 4 compared to the non hormone group fig 3c 3 2 the role of methyl jasmonate on yield and its components of wheat grain in different irrigation regimes the crop yield is usually influenced by its components directly and any factor that changes in these components can affect the final yield the results showed that in both years the highest number of grains was related to the full irrigation conditions and then by the beginning of stress at grain milking stage the number of grains decreased by 8 4 in the first year and 8 9 in the second year compared to non stress conditions however the highest reduction in the number of grains occurred at stress conditions in the booting compared to the full irrigated condition in the first year 23 3 and the second year 19 3 fig 4 a also the highest number of grains per spike was obtained by use of 100 μm methyl jasmonate in two years of experiment this increase was higher in the first year in the second year there was no significant difference between 100 and 50 μm fig 4b the irrigation cut off regime at the booting decreased the number of grains per spike by 20 while spraying 100 μm methyl jasmonate increased this yield component by 9 as a result the lowest number of grains per spike was observed under drought stress conditions at the booting stage and non application of hormone in pishtaz cultivar the highest number of grains per spike was observed by use of 100 μm methyl jasmonate in two wheat cultivars fig 5 in general sirvan cultivar had more grains per spike than pishtaz cultivar generally sirvan cultivar had the highest thousand grains weight among the wheat cultivars irrigation cut off at the booting caused the main reduction about 22 in weight of thousand grains of both wheat cultivars compared to other irrigation regimes table 2 under full irrigation conditions the application of 100 μm methyl jasmonate increased the weight of the grain by 5 4 and 9 3 in both years under irrigation cut off at the booting application of 100 μm methyl jasmonate increased the weight of thousand grains by 5 8 in the first year compared to the non hormone group but in the second year there was no significant difference between the levels of the hormone application of 100 μm hormones under the irrigation cut off at the grain milking stage increased the weight of the grain by 4 8 and 4 4 in the first and second years respectively compared to the non hormone group table 3 the interaction of drought cultivar and methyl jasmonate was significant for spike numbers per m2 every two years in the first year of the experiment 2015 2016 irrigation cut off at the booting reduced the number of spikes by 50 and 42 in pishtaz and sirvan cultivars respectively in this year application of 100 μm methyl jasmonate significantly increased the number of spikes per m2 in both wheat cultivars in all irrigation regimes however in the second year 2016 2017 the use of methyl jasmonate in both cultivars could not improve the damage caused by irrigation cut off at the booting in other irrigation regimes 50 μm hormones could significantly increase the number of spikes per m2 compared to the non hormone conditions fig 6 the results of the interaction between cultivar and drought stress levels showed that in full irrigation conditions biological yield of pishtaz cultivar was 12 9 higher than sirvan cultivar at the other levels of stress there was no significant difference between sirvan and pishtaz cultivars but the irrigation cut off regime at the booting and grain milking reduced the biological yield by 23 and 15 respectively compared to the control group in both wheat cultivars table 2 in the first year in all irrigation regimes non hormone levels had a higher biological yield compared to the use of the hormone in the second year there was no significant difference between the use and non use of hormone in irrigation cut off regimes fig 7 a the application of different concentrations of methyl jasmonate has no effect on the biological yield of pishtaz cultivar and even reduced its level compared to the control in the sirvan cultivar the use of methyl jasmonate hormone reduced biological yield fig 7b comparison of means showed that sirvan cultivar had more grain yield compared to the pishtaz cultivar in all three irrigation regimes full irrigation 11 irrigation cut off at the booting 14 8 and irrigation cut off at the grain milking stage 15 3 table 2 grain yield at full irrigation levels was more than two stresses levels in both years irrigation cut off at the booting reduced the grain yield by 41 7 and 35 9 in every two years of experiment respectively compared to the full irrigation conditions irrigation cut off at grain milking stage reduced the grain yield by 34 3 and 14 3 in every two years of experiment respectively compared to the full irrigation regimes moreover in each of two years the use of 100 μm methyl jasmonate increased grain yield compared to the non hormone group in all irrigation regimes and could lead to improved damage caused by irrigation cut off but in the irrigation cut off regimes there was no significant difference between the levels of 50 and 100 μm hormones in the second year in terms of increase in the grain yield fig 8 a in both pishtaz and sirvan cultivars in the first year 2015 2016 with the application of 100 μm methyl jasmonate grain yield increased by 6 9 and 1 8 respectively compared to non hormone conditions in the second year as in the first year the application of 100 μm methyl jasmonate increased the grain yield compared to the level without application of hormones however there was no significant difference among all levels of methyl jasmonate for the sirvan and between levels of 50 and 100 μm for the pishtaz cultivar in the first and second year of experiment respectively fig 8b 3 3 the role of methyl jasmonate on wheat harvest index and water productivity in different irrigation regimes as shown in fig 9 in full irrigation conditions the harvest index in the pishtaz cultivar increased by 10 7 in the concentration of 100 μm methyl jasmonate in comparison to the non hormone level in the sirvan cultivar the highest harvest index 1 9 is related to the 100 μm methyl jasmonate compared to the non hormone level in the irrigation cut off at the booting the harvest index in both cultivars decreased by about 15 20 however the application of 50 and 100 μm hormone increased the harvest index irrigation cut off in the grain milking stage also reduced the harvest index of wheat cultivars however hormone use increased the harvest index at this level of stress the use of 100 μm and 50 μm methyl jasmonate in sirvan and pishtaz cultivar respectively increased harvest index by 19 and 7 compared to non hormone levels fig 9 among the different levels of methyl jasmonate in non stress conditions the concentration of 100 μm increased the water productivity by 6 2 and 13 2 in both years respectively compared to non hormone levels in the pishtaz cultivar but in the sirvan cultivar only in the second year spraying of 100 μm methyl jasmonate increased water productivity by 8 7 the irrigation cut off regime at the booting in pishtaz cultivar reduced water productivity by 28 2 in the first year but this percentage increased by 13 4 compared to the non hormone level using 100 μm methyl jasmonate however in the second year the use of 50 and 100 μm hormones increased the water productivity in the sirvan cultivar compared to the non hormone levels at stress in grain milking stage there was no significant difference between pishtaz and sirvan cultivars at all levels of methyl jasmonate in the first year however in the second year the concentration of 50 and 100 μm methyl jasmonate in pishtaz cultivar increased water productivity compared to the non hormone level and there was no significant difference between these two levels but in the sirvan cultivar use of 100 μm methyl jasmonate increased water productivity by 11 8 in comparison with non hormone level generally different concentrations of methyl jasmonate increased water productivity in both cultivars water productivity was higher in sirvan cultivar in both years fig 10 4 discussion drought stress causes changes in plant development time the number of days until heading and the physiological maturity are phonological development duration in this research drought stress in both cultivars reduced the days until the spike emergence and prematurely in both cultivars the higher reduction in the number of growth days was observed in the sirvan cultivar because the development rate is affected faster than the growth rate of the plant this can be due to the escape of the cultivars from drought to survival eventually it causes prematurely the exact observation of the spike emergence time and the number of days until the spike emergence can be a suitable measure for judging the early or late maturely of cultivars kerr et al 1992 kirby et al 1999 in all irrigation regimes in this research application of 100 μm methyl jasmonate increased the length of spike emergence period in both cultivars application of methyl jasmonate could increase the photosynthesis the length of the spike emergence period and the number of days until maturity under stress conditions plant height was a morphological characteristic of the plant that was affected negatively by drought stress in two bread wheat cultivars but the application of 100 μm methyl jasmonate improved the effect of drought stress on this trait one of the first symptoms of water deficiency is the reduction of turgidity and consequently the reduction of cell division and differentiation especially in the stems and leaves and therefore the first tangible effect of water deficiency on plants can be detected from smaller leaf sizes and lower plant height sio se mardeh et al 2006 reported that drought stress reduced the height of the wheat plant which is consistent with the results of this study this decrease in plant height can be due to a reduction in the length of the vegetative stage escape from drought fast completion of the reproductive stage and a number of days until heading in many plants of the grasses family water deficiency stress causes delays in stem elongation and reduces the distance between internodes and thus reduces plant size ghodsi et al 2004 khajeh et al 2008 applied drought stress on barley plant in the post flowering stage they found that plant height was not significantly affected by drought stress because the plant at this time reached its final height the use of methyl jasmonate by the effect on plant stoma cells increases the relative water content of the leaf it has no negative effect on the photosynthesis of the plant so it helps to grow the plant garcı a mata and lamattina 2001 wheat grain yield components were also affected by different irrigation regimes one of these components is the number of grains per spike drought stress from the booting stage until the physiological maturity as well as in the grain milking stage reduced the number of grains in both cultivars by reducing the length of the growth period this decrease was higher in pishtaz cultivar the application of 100 μm methyl jasmonate with increasing length of the growth period photosynthesis sink capacity in the stem and possibly remobilization can modify and increase the number of grains in both cultivars reducing the number of grains per spike under drought stress at grain milking stage compared to the control can be due to the fineness of the grains and no counting unhealthy grains in counting in cereals the most sensitive stage to drought stress is the interval between heading until flowering and cultivars that can increase the biomass production and storage of assimilates in the stem before flowering are considered to be drought tolerant cultivars reducing the number of grains indicated a decrease in fertility due to inappropriate inoculation and grain competition for water and food intake reducing the number of grains in drought stress at the flowering stage can also be due to the reduction of fertilized pollen ji et al 2010 sinclair and jamieson 2006 stated that the number of grains per wheat depends heavily on environmental conditions before and after flowering richards et al 2001 declared that the effects of drought stress during flowering and shortly afterward lead to a decrease in the number of grains per spike through sterilization of pollen grains and pollination disturbances current photosynthesis and mobilization of stem reserve to spike water deficiency is considered a plant growth inhibitor for the formation of the aerial organ the number of spikes is not affected by post flowering conditions including drought but drought can affect fertile spikes in this experiment irrigation cut off decreased the number of spikes in both cultivars but the number of spikes in each year and at all levels of irrigation was higher in sirvan cultivar the difference between the numbers of spikes under stress at the booting stage between two years of the experiment can be attributed to the difference in weather conditions and the higher rainfall and lower temperature at the time of the spike formation and during the growth and development of the tiller in the second year table 1 in fact the number of spikes in the plant is the number of tillers that are determined in the pre flowering and even before stemming in some cultivars more spikes are due to their genetic potential the weight of grains and the number of grains per spike are two other important components in determining the yield of wheat grain it seems that reducing the weight of thousand grains under severe stress conditions can be explained by the reduction of photosynthesis and the inadequate distribution of storage materials in this study with increasing drought stress the weight of thousand grains decreased in both cultivars despite this decline in the second year sirvan cultivar had more weight of grains compared to pishtaz cultivar at all levels of stress and irrigation with 100 μm methyl jasmonate application at flowering the height of the stem of wheat usually reaches its maximum and after this stage the stem height does not change significantly reducing moisture content during the grain filling period lead to reducing the current photosynthesis during this growth period and as a result the weight of the grains decreases abdoli and saeidi 2012 reported that the occurrence of drought stress after pollination in wheat led to a further reduction in the grain weight compared to other components of yield gonzález et al 2007 indicated that drought stress at the end of the growing season reduced the length of the grain filling period disruption of current photosynthesis accelerated leaf aging and eventually shrinkage of the grains and decreased the weight of thousand grains of different barley cultivars the effect of drought stress on the grain filling stage is very significant since the potential yield is dependent on the weight of the grain which itself requires the accumulation of photosynthetic materials in the grains in the wheat plant immediately after fertilization grains are formed and begin to divide the cell and reach maturity 24 35 days after fertilization depending on temperature and humidity some researchers believe that although the relative increase during the grain filling period in optimal moisture conditions transfer more photosynthetic materials to the grains and thus increase the weight of grains and yield it seems that at water stress the mobilization rate is more important and in these conditions the relative prematurity shortening the grain filling period is considered to be a desirable trait reynolds et al 2000 the yield of each cultivar depends on its components drought stress reduced grain yield by reducing the number of fertile spikes number of grains and weight of thousand grains the stress at the booting caused a decrease in grain yield in both cultivars and this decrease in the sirvan cultivar was less than pishtaz cultivar due to a lower decrease in the weight of thousand grains the number of grains and a number of fertile spikes therefore stress in the pollination stage reduces the grain yield by reducing the weight of grains and therefore any decrease in the amount of water available to the plant causes grains to shrink in the present experiment grain yield in the second year was more than the first year this can be due to weather conditions lower temperatures and higher precipitation rates during spraying it led to a better absorption of methyl jasmonate in this year which ultimately increased the grain yield the importance of a number of grains per spike and its imperative role in increasing the grain yield of wheat grain has also been expressed by dogan 2009 arduini et al 2014 indicated that a number of spikes per m2 and number of grains per spike had direct and positive effects on grain yield in order to obtain the proper yield all yield components should be balanced the use of methyl jasmonate increased grain yield in this regard sheteawi 2007 reported that soaking soybeans seeds in methyl jasmonate solution with a concentration of 1 μm increased grain yield of each plant by 17 compared to control treatment korkmaz 2005 stated that in sweet peppers spraying the methyl jasmonate 5 and 10 mg l increased the yield by 15 to 40 the early mature sirvan cultivar due to the mechanisms of escape from the moisture and heat stress at late growth period of wheat under stress conditions had more yield than the late mature pishtaz cultivar due to the nature of the escape and the ability to release methyl jasmonate through the cell membrane this hormone was considered as an important candidate for intermediate molecular signaling communications inside and outside plants modifying the defensive responses of a plant wasternack 2007 and regulating plant reproduction processes von malek et al 2002 increased grain yield due to the use of methyl jasmonate also reported by shakirova et al 2003 dehghan et al 2017 also reported that cultivar sirvan using brassinolide growth regulator increased the number of grain per spike by 9 17 the weight of thousand grains by 6 62 and grain yield by 7 3 compared to non use of it in stress conditions despite the positive effects of methyl jasmonate on yield improvement kim et al 2009 reported that the use of methyl jasmonate in transgenic rice plants stimulates the production of the abscisic acid hormone which also leads to a decrease in grain yield water stress reduced biological yield in both studied cultivars biological yield in stress at the booting was lower than other levels of irrigation the use of higher concentration of methyl jasmonate had no effect on the increase of biological yield in comparison with the non hormone but it had a significant effect on grain yield indicating the role of remobilization and further increases the contribution of photosynthetic material transfer from vegetative parts to reproductive organs and further stimulation of it in cultivar sirvan saeidi and abdoli 2015 also reported a decline in biological yield at drought stress in the post pollination stage drought stress also reduced the harvest index in both wheat cultivars which was higher in sirvan due to elevated grain yield methyl jasmonate by improving the grain yield reduced the biological yield and increased the harvest index in sirvan cultivar compared to pishtaz cultivar reducing the harvest index in drought stress after flowering can be attributed to condensed access to the current growing material during the grain filling period which has a direct relationship with grain yield parizvand et al 2012 piraste anoshe and emam 2011 reported that the use of growth regulators by maintaining the dry matter produced could increase yield by raising the harvest index by comparing water productivity of irrigation regimes it can be stated that in the treatment of irrigation cut off from booting for each unit of water use the production of grain yield decreased in the case of water shortage pishtaz cultivar cannot be considered as superior cultivar due to the lower water productivity the accumulation of dry matter in a genotype under water shortage conditions indicates water productivity in addition dry matter is assigned to the plant s economic organs leading to a higher harvest index therefore the accumulation of more dry matter in the reproductive organs during pollination can be a suitable criterion for choosing under drought conditions kumar 2004 methyl jasmonate increased the water productivity by increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis and the grain yield compared to the amount of water use fugate et al 2018 studied on sugar beet and reported that the application of 10 μm methyl jasmonate reduced the effects of mild and severe drought stress on leaf relative water content and water use efficiency methyl jasmonate can improve the water productivity of the plant by delaying water stress in the plant and protect the photosynthetic apparatus from drought stress disorders 5 conclusion in general different irrigation regimes can influence the growth and yield of wheat cultivars in which case plant growth regulators such as jasmonates can play an important role in this process among different concentrations of methyl jasmonate 100 μm concentrations improved the negative effects of drought stress this positive effect was more observed in irrigation cut off at the booting stage according to the results in different wheat irrigation regimes the use of methyl jasmonate increased the harvest index by increasing the growth period until the physiological maturity of grain as well as increase grain yield components including a number of grains per spike and weight of thousand grains resulting in the final grain yield and by decreasing biological yield also due to the importance of water productivity in world climatic conditions the problem of reducing agricultural water reserves and increasing drought stress in wheat production the use of methyl jasmonate growth regulator as spraying by increasing water productivity in wheat cultivar it can play an significant role in maintaining food security in the future as one of the most

plants to environmental stresses such as drought stress therefore in order to study the effect of spraying different concentrations of methyl jasmonate on water productivity yield and its components of two wheat cultivars under different irrigation regimes a split factorial experiment was conducted based on a randomized complete block design with three replications in two crop years 2015 2017 in this experiment different irrigation regimes including normal irrigation control irrigation cut off from the booting and milk stage as the main factor and two wheat cultivars and various concentrations of methyl jasmonate in four levels of 0 50 100 and 150 μm were investigated as factorial in subfactor the results showed that use of 100 μm methyl jasmonate increase growth period and a number of days until plant physiological maturity under drought stress conditions the number of grains per spike weight of one thousand seed grain yield and harvest index are decreased in every two years of experiment also using 100 μm methyl jasmonate lead to increase these traits by 22 2 14 4 8 5 and 11 4 respectively in pishtaz cultivar and 10 3 10 7 8 5 and 11 2 respectively in the sirvan cultivar compared to the control group the highest water productivity at each of the three levels of irrigation was related to the concentration of 100 μm methyl jasmonate according to the results although drought stress reduced yield and its components methyl jasmonate was able to compensate somewhat 10 for the reduced yield due to drought stress the irrigation cut off at the grain milking stage can be beneficial with increasing water productivity in managing this valuable resource also the use of 100 μm jasmonate in these conditions is recommended as a practical way to increase tolerance to drought stress conditions and improve the growth and yield of wheat keywords jasmonic acid plant growth regulator drought stress water productivity irrigation management 1 introduction global climate change exacerbates the effects of various environmental stresses on crop growth consequently crop production around the world will be at risk crops in their natural habitat should tolerate several abiotic stresses such as drought salinity heat and cold fahad et al 2015 drought stress is considered to be the most important global threat to food security and limits production rate tardieu 2011 therefore low irrigation is an optimal solution for agricultural production in water deficit conditions the main objective of low irrigation irrigation cut off is to increase the water use efficiency by reducing the irrigation water extent at each period or removing irrigation with the lowest productivity zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 over the past several decades developing countries have gradually become major wheat importers and wheat accounts for 43 of food imports in these countries dixon et al 2009 in regions with mediterranean climate wheat grain filling stage is often associated with drought stress richards et al 2001 which reduced grain yield by decreasing the rate of photosynthesis source size aging of leaves physiological sink capacity number of endosperm cells and enzymatic activity of grain and shortening the grain filling period royo et al 2000 yang and zhang 2006 in most wheat growing regions grain filling is affected by biotic and abiotic stresses using photosynthetic materials in this case the final and general result of these stresses is the wrinkled grain the reduction in the weight of a thousand grains and thus the decrease in grain yield mohammadi et al 2010 the effect of drought stress on development and yield depends on the sensitivity of the growth and development stage of the plant for example the occurrence of water stress in the pollination stage reduced the number of fertilized spikes a number of spikes and the number of grains per spike are susceptible to drought stress ahmadi lahijani and emam 2016 also the occurrence of drought stress from the pollination stage to the maturity decreases the average weight of the grains wang et al 2014 ehdaie et al 2008 observed that in wheat the average weight of thousand grains under drought stress after flowering decreased from 46 8 to 34 7 g drought stress significantly reduces biological yield harvest indexو and wheat water use efficiency ahmadi and bajelan 2008 due to the fact that the nutrients are absorbed as water soluble limitation in water resources leads to a limitation in all nourishment sources and the plant is forced to slow down the vegetative growth and to finish the vegetative stage early and begin the reproductive stage as a result the length of the growth period plant height peduncle length straw yield and even the length of the awn decreases this is interpreted by mitra 2001 as an escape from the drought riaz and chowdhry 2003 stated that the number of grains per spike is one of the most important components of yield in wheat the genotypes that are shown stability for this trait are often show more tolerant under drought stress samarah 2005 showed that drought stress reduced grain yield by falling the number of grain per spike and weight of thousand grains but the number of tillers was not affected compared to the stress free conditions nouri ganbalani et al 2009 examined 13 autumn wheat genotypes under drought stress conditions after heading by irrigation cut off method who stated that grain yield of genotypes in these conditions decreased by an average of 50 however the decrease in grain yield was not the same for all cultivars and some of them were less affected by drought stress increasing the number of grains per spike as a way to increase yield under drought stress cannot possibly have a positive effect on grain yield because under the photosynthetic restriction conditions the increase in the number of grains will be accompanied by a reduction in the weight of grains and will not result in improved grain yields gonzález et al 2007 in the estimation of wheat water productivity using long term yield statistics and the hydrologic model for determining evapotranspiration it was found that wheat water productivity was varied from 0 15 to 1 55 rainfed wheat and 0 28 to 0 75 kg m3 irrigated wheat and this range of variations was higher for rainfed wheat faramarzi et al 2010 in order to improve water use efficiency the yield should be increased along with the reduction of water consumption based on the results water use efficiency based on the wheat biomass at the tillering and vegetative stages until stem elongation and stem elongation until heading was in the range of 1 37 4 03 and 6 41 7 03 kg m3 respectively the maximum water use efficiency occurred at the heading stage and then began to decrease zhao et al 2007 typically abiotic stresses reduce the synthesis of plant hormones and destroy these hormones in plants under this condition the use of growth regulators before seeding seed priming or in plant growth stages spraying may be useful to compensate for internal deficiencies of growth regulators and to reduce the destructive effects of abiotic stresses ashraf and foolad 2007 jasmonates as a family of phytohormones play an important role in plant growth there are reports of the involvement of jasmonic acid in drought stress tiwari et al 2016 in other studies it has been reported that the use of salicylic acid and jasmonic acid increases grain yield anjum et al 2011 vahabi et al 2017 showed that water stress and increase in its intensity reduced leaf area spike length number of grains per spike biological yield and wheat grain yield however using growth regulators improved grain yield components and eventually increased grain yield however the effect of chlormequat chloride was higher than salicylic acid and jasmonic acid so that the spraying of these three regulators increased grain yield by 7 20 8 13 and 24 7 in the greenhouse experiment and 3 18 2 12 and 1 8 in the field experiment respectively the use of growth regulators is easier and more economical than breeding methods which are often long term and cost effective bartels and sunkar 2005 the use of plant growth regulating agents such as methyl jasmonate can be a practical way to reduce the damage caused by drought stress in recent years the use of plant growth regulators or plant hormones has expanded to improve plant growth under stress and non stress conditions jasmonic acid and methyl jasmonate are regulating materials that have been considered in this regard however there is not much information about the best using method and use rate of them in different wheat cultivars and the exact amount and effects of it in different plants under stress conditions therefore the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of methyl jasmonate on the yield and its components of two bread wheat cultivars under the drought stress at the end of the season 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and climatic characteristics the research was carried out in a research farm with the longitude of 52 41 e and the latitude of 29 58 n and a height of 1595 m from the sea level in fars province iran the average annual rainfall was 365 mm and the maximum and minimum temperature were 41 and 9 c respectively table 1 the physical and chemical analysis of the soil of the site before the first and second planting were shown in table 1 2 2 experimental material the seeds of wheat sirvan and pishtaz cultivar were planted on november 15 2015 and 2016 in plots with the length of 4 m the width of 1 6 m 8 planting rows with 20 cm row spacing and a planting density of 400 plants per m2 wheat sirvan cultivar with prl 2 pastor pedigrees ws 85 10 code high yield and good bakery quality is proposed for naming and replacing part of the area under cultivation of irrigated cultivars in the regions facing drought stress compatible with warm to moderate climate najafian et al 2012 pishtaz wheat cultivar has a spring growth type and the height of 92 cm fertilization resistance to lodging high water use efficiency and moderate drought tolerance are another characteristic of wheat pishtaz cultivar abdoli and saeidi 2012 all experimental plots were irrigated at the same time until the booting the plots for the first stress were not irrigated from the booting code 45 of the zadoks table and for the second one irrigation cut off from the grain milking stage code 71 72 of the zadoks table at the time of stress application the control treatment was irrigated normally the different concentrations of methyl jasmonate 0 50 100 and 150 μm was sprayed at the end of april of every two years 2016 and 2017 when the stipules appear 39 in accordance with the zadoks before applying drought stress 1 5 liters of solution was used for each plot using knapsack sprayer 2 3 measuring method the number of days until heading number of days until physiological maturity and plant height were measured in each plot at the end grain yield per m2 and its components number of spikes per m2 number of grains per spike and weight of thousand grains biological yield per m2 and harvest index were calculated at the time of physiological maturity the water productivity was calculated by dividing the grain yield to total irrigation water measured with volume meter and rainfall howell 1994 2 4 statistical analysis the experiment was conducted as split factorial in a randomized complete block design with three replications in two crop years of 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 data were exposed to two way analysis of variance anova using sas statistical software bartlett test was carried out on all traits studied and when the error variance of the traits was homogeneous for two consecutive years the combined analysis of the data was performed the tables of variance analysis were not shown in the manuscript but were publicized in supplementary materials if main treatments and interactions were significant the comparison of interaction was merely described in results in order to compare the average of the main effects or interactions after slicing the least squares difference lsd test at 5 error probability level were used 3 results 3 1 the role of methyl jasmonate on plant growth traits in different irrigation regimes the length of the plant growth period is usually influenced by different irrigation regimes comparing the means of the number of days until heading under the influence of irrigation and drought stress levels showed that the highest number of days until heading was observed under non stress conditions stress at the stage of grain milking and booting respectively at all levels of stress and in both cultivars in each two years the concentration of 100 μm of methyl jasmonate increased this trait compared to the non hormone levels so that under full irrigation conditions the use of this level of methyl jasmonate increased the number of days until heading in both bread wheat cultivars by about 3 compared to the non hormone conditions the use of 100 μm of methyl jasmonate in the irrigation cut off regime at the stage of booting also caused the highest amount of time until heading which increased by 3 in pishtaz cultivar and 3 2 in the sirvan cultivar compared to the non hormone level this increase at irrigation intercut off condition during milking stage was 3 8 and 2 3 in two wheat cultivars respectively however it was reduced only 0 7 compared to the full irrigation conditions fig 1 the results of plant growth a maturity period indicated that the highest number of days until the physiological maturity of wheat grain was observed in non stress condition drought stress at the milking stage and booting respectively under full irrigation conditions pishtaz cultivar under the influence of 100 μm hormones had the highest amount of days until physiological maturity which had a 2 difference with non hormone levels but there was no significant difference between 50 and 100 μm concentrations in sirvan cultivar under irrigation cut off regime at the booting the number of days until physiological maturity compared to the stress conditions in both pishtaz and sirvan cultivars was reduced by 6 5 and 6 1 however the use of 100 μm methyl jasmonate in these conditions resulted in an increase in the number of days until physiological maturity by 2 3 in both cultivars compared to the non hormone the irrigation cut off regime in the grain milking stage reduced the maturity period in pishtaz and sirvan cultivars by 2 5 and 1 respectively compared to non stress conditions as in the previous condition the use of 100 μm of methyl jasmonate increased this period by 2 3 and 3 in both wheat cultivars compared to control no hormone respectively fig 2 comparison of means shows that in all environmental conditions sirvan cultivar had the utmost height compared to pishtaz cultivar withhold of irrigation at the booting reduced the plant height in the sirvan cultivar by 29 6 and 15 5 in the first and second years of experiment respectively compared to the full irrigation withhold of irrigation at the grain milking stage reduced the plant height in the sirvan cultivar by 11 4 and 7 3 in the first and second years of experiment respectively fig 3 a under full irrigation and irrigation cut off at the booting the use of 100 μm hormones increased the height by 6 2 and 5 respectively compared to the non hormone group at the stress in grain milking stage the maximum height was observed using 50 μm of methyl jasmonate which showed no significant difference with 100 μm hormones fig 3b in both wheat cultivars the highest plant height was related to 100 μm methyl jasmonate this concentration of hormone increased plant height by about 4 compared to the non hormone group fig 3c 3 2 the role of methyl jasmonate on yield and its components of wheat grain in different irrigation regimes the crop yield is usually influenced by its components directly and any factor that changes in these components can affect the final yield the results showed that in both years the highest number of grains was related to the full irrigation conditions and then by the beginning of stress at grain milking stage the number of grains decreased by 8 4 in the first year and 8 9 in the second year compared to non stress conditions however the highest reduction in the number of grains occurred at stress conditions in the booting compared to the full irrigated condition in the first year 23 3 and the second year 19 3 fig 4 a also the highest number of grains per spike was obtained by use of 100 μm methyl jasmonate in two years of experiment this increase was higher in the first year in the second year there was no significant difference between 100 and 50 μm fig 4b the irrigation cut off regime at the booting decreased the number of grains per spike by 20 while spraying 100 μm methyl jasmonate increased this yield component by 9 as a result the lowest number of grains per spike was observed under drought stress conditions at the booting stage and non application of hormone in pishtaz cultivar the highest number of grains per spike was observed by use of 100 μm methyl jasmonate in two wheat cultivars fig 5 in general sirvan cultivar had more grains per spike than pishtaz cultivar generally sirvan cultivar had the highest thousand grains weight among the wheat cultivars irrigation cut off at the booting caused the main reduction about 22 in weight of thousand grains of both wheat cultivars compared to other irrigation regimes table 2 under full irrigation conditions the application of 100 μm methyl jasmonate increased the weight of the grain by 5 4 and 9 3 in both years under irrigation cut off at the booting application of 100 μm methyl jasmonate increased the weight of thousand grains by 5 8 in the first year compared to the non hormone group but in the second year there was no significant difference between the levels of the hormone application of 100 μm hormones under the irrigation cut off at the grain milking stage increased the weight of the grain by 4 8 and 4 4 in the first and second years respectively compared to the non hormone group table 3 the interaction of drought cultivar and methyl jasmonate was significant for spike numbers per m2 every two years in the first year of the experiment 2015 2016 irrigation cut off at the booting reduced the number of spikes by 50 and 42 in pishtaz and sirvan cultivars respectively in this year application of 100 μm methyl jasmonate significantly increased the number of spikes per m2 in both wheat cultivars in all irrigation regimes however in the second year 2016 2017 the use of methyl jasmonate in both cultivars could not improve the damage caused by irrigation cut off at the booting in other irrigation regimes 50 μm hormones could significantly increase the number of spikes per m2 compared to the non hormone conditions fig 6 the results of the interaction between cultivar and drought stress levels showed that in full irrigation conditions biological yield of pishtaz cultivar was 12 9 higher than sirvan cultivar at the other levels of stress there was no significant difference between sirvan and pishtaz cultivars but the irrigation cut off regime at the booting and grain milking reduced the biological yield by 23 and 15 respectively compared to the control group in both wheat cultivars table 2 in the first year in all irrigation regimes non hormone levels had a higher biological yield compared to the use of the hormone in the second year there was no significant difference between the use and non use of hormone in irrigation cut off regimes fig 7 a the application of different concentrations of methyl jasmonate has no effect on the biological yield of pishtaz cultivar and even reduced its level compared to the control in the sirvan cultivar the use of methyl jasmonate hormone reduced biological yield fig 7b comparison of means showed that sirvan cultivar had more grain yield compared to the pishtaz cultivar in all three irrigation regimes full irrigation 11 irrigation cut off at the booting 14 8 and irrigation cut off at the grain milking stage 15 3 table 2 grain yield at full irrigation levels was more than two stresses levels in both years irrigation cut off at the booting reduced the grain yield by 41 7 and 35 9 in every two years of experiment respectively compared to the full irrigation conditions irrigation cut off at grain milking stage reduced the grain yield by 34 3 and 14 3 in every two years of experiment respectively compared to the full irrigation regimes moreover in each of two years the use of 100 μm methyl jasmonate increased grain yield compared to the non hormone group in all irrigation regimes and could lead to improved damage caused by irrigation cut off but in the irrigation cut off regimes there was no significant difference between the levels of 50 and 100 μm hormones in the second year in terms of increase in the grain yield fig 8 a in both pishtaz and sirvan cultivars in the first year 2015 2016 with the application of 100 μm methyl jasmonate grain yield increased by 6 9 and 1 8 respectively compared to non hormone conditions in the second year as in the first year the application of 100 μm methyl jasmonate increased the grain yield compared to the level without application of hormones however there was no significant difference among all levels of methyl jasmonate for the sirvan and between levels of 50 and 100 μm for the pishtaz cultivar in the first and second year of experiment respectively fig 8b 3 3 the role of methyl jasmonate on wheat harvest index and water productivity in different irrigation regimes as shown in fig 9 in full irrigation conditions the harvest index in the pishtaz cultivar increased by 10 7 in the concentration of 100 μm methyl jasmonate in comparison to the non hormone level in the sirvan cultivar the highest harvest index 1 9 is related to the 100 μm methyl jasmonate compared to the non hormone level in the irrigation cut off at the booting the harvest index in both cultivars decreased by about 15 20 however the application of 50 and 100 μm hormone increased the harvest index irrigation cut off in the grain milking stage also reduced the harvest index of wheat cultivars however hormone use increased the harvest index at this level of stress the use of 100 μm and 50 μm methyl jasmonate in sirvan and pishtaz cultivar respectively increased harvest index by 19 and 7 compared to non hormone levels fig 9 among the different levels of methyl jasmonate in non stress conditions the concentration of 100 μm increased the water productivity by 6 2 and 13 2 in both years respectively compared to non hormone levels in the pishtaz cultivar but in the sirvan cultivar only in the second year spraying of 100 μm methyl jasmonate increased water productivity by 8 7 the irrigation cut off regime at the booting in pishtaz cultivar reduced water productivity by 28 2 in the first year but this percentage increased by 13 4 compared to the non hormone level using 100 μm methyl jasmonate however in the second year the use of 50 and 100 μm hormones increased the water productivity in the sirvan cultivar compared to the non hormone levels at stress in grain milking stage there was no significant difference between pishtaz and sirvan cultivars at all levels of methyl jasmonate in the first year however in the second year the concentration of 50 and 100 μm methyl jasmonate in pishtaz cultivar increased water productivity compared to the non hormone level and there was no significant difference between these two levels but in the sirvan cultivar use of 100 μm methyl jasmonate increased water productivity by 11 8 in comparison with non hormone level generally different concentrations of methyl jasmonate increased water productivity in both cultivars water productivity was higher in sirvan cultivar in both years fig 10 4 discussion drought stress causes changes in plant development time the number of days until heading and the physiological maturity are phonological development duration in this research drought stress in both cultivars reduced the days until the spike emergence and prematurely in both cultivars the higher reduction in the number of growth days was observed in the sirvan cultivar because the development rate is affected faster than the growth rate of the plant this can be due to the escape of the cultivars from drought to survival eventually it causes prematurely the exact observation of the spike emergence time and the number of days until the spike emergence can be a suitable measure for judging the early or late maturely of cultivars kerr et al 1992 kirby et al 1999 in all irrigation regimes in this research application of 100 μm methyl jasmonate increased the length of spike emergence period in both cultivars application of methyl jasmonate could increase the photosynthesis the length of the spike emergence period and the number of days until maturity under stress conditions plant height was a morphological characteristic of the plant that was affected negatively by drought stress in two bread wheat cultivars but the application of 100 μm methyl jasmonate improved the effect of drought stress on this trait one of the first symptoms of water deficiency is the reduction of turgidity and consequently the reduction of cell division and differentiation especially in the stems and leaves and therefore the first tangible effect of water deficiency on plants can be detected from smaller leaf sizes and lower plant height sio se mardeh et al 2006 reported that drought stress reduced the height of the wheat plant which is consistent with the results of this study this decrease in plant height can be due to a reduction in the length of the vegetative stage escape from drought fast completion of the reproductive stage and a number of days until heading in many plants of the grasses family water deficiency stress causes delays in stem elongation and reduces the distance between internodes and thus reduces plant size ghodsi et al 2004 khajeh et al 2008 applied drought stress on barley plant in the post flowering stage they found that plant height was not significantly affected by drought stress because the plant at this time reached its final height the use of methyl jasmonate by the effect on plant stoma cells increases the relative water content of the leaf it has no negative effect on the photosynthesis of the plant so it helps to grow the plant garcı a mata and lamattina 2001 wheat grain yield components were also affected by different irrigation regimes one of these components is the number of grains per spike drought stress from the booting stage until the physiological maturity as well as in the grain milking stage reduced the number of grains in both cultivars by reducing the length of the growth period this decrease was higher in pishtaz cultivar the application of 100 μm methyl jasmonate with increasing length of the growth period photosynthesis sink capacity in the stem and possibly remobilization can modify and increase the number of grains in both cultivars reducing the number of grains per spike under drought stress at grain milking stage compared to the control can be due to the fineness of the grains and no counting unhealthy grains in counting in cereals the most sensitive stage to drought stress is the interval between heading until flowering and cultivars that can increase the biomass production and storage of assimilates in the stem before flowering are considered to be drought tolerant cultivars reducing the number of grains indicated a decrease in fertility due to inappropriate inoculation and grain competition for water and food intake reducing the number of grains in drought stress at the flowering stage can also be due to the reduction of fertilized pollen ji et al 2010 sinclair and jamieson 2006 stated that the number of grains per wheat depends heavily on environmental conditions before and after flowering richards et al 2001 declared that the effects of drought stress during flowering and shortly afterward lead to a decrease in the number of grains per spike through sterilization of pollen grains and pollination disturbances current photosynthesis and mobilization of stem reserve to spike water deficiency is considered a plant growth inhibitor for the formation of the aerial organ the number of spikes is not affected by post flowering conditions including drought but drought can affect fertile spikes in this experiment irrigation cut off decreased the number of spikes in both cultivars but the number of spikes in each year and at all levels of irrigation was higher in sirvan cultivar the difference between the numbers of spikes under stress at the booting stage between two years of the experiment can be attributed to the difference in weather conditions and the higher rainfall and lower temperature at the time of the spike formation and during the growth and development of the tiller in the second year table 1 in fact the number of spikes in the plant is the number of tillers that are determined in the pre flowering and even before stemming in some cultivars more spikes are due to their genetic potential the weight of grains and the number of grains per spike are two other important components in determining the yield of wheat grain it seems that reducing the weight of thousand grains under severe stress conditions can be explained by the reduction of photosynthesis and the inadequate distribution of storage materials in this study with increasing drought stress the weight of thousand grains decreased in both cultivars despite this decline in the second year sirvan cultivar had more weight of grains compared to pishtaz cultivar at all levels of stress and irrigation with 100 μm methyl jasmonate application at flowering the height of the stem of wheat usually reaches its maximum and after this stage the stem height does not change significantly reducing moisture content during the grain filling period lead to reducing the current photosynthesis during this growth period and as a result the weight of the grains decreases abdoli and saeidi 2012 reported that the occurrence of drought stress after pollination in wheat led to a further reduction in the grain weight compared to other components of yield gonzález et al 2007 indicated that drought stress at the end of the growing season reduced the length of the grain filling period disruption of current photosynthesis accelerated leaf aging and eventually shrinkage of the grains and decreased the weight of thousand grains of different barley cultivars the effect of drought stress on the grain filling stage is very significant since the potential yield is dependent on the weight of the grain which itself requires the accumulation of photosynthetic materials in the grains in the wheat plant immediately after fertilization grains are formed and begin to divide the cell and reach maturity 24 35 days after fertilization depending on temperature and humidity some researchers believe that although the relative increase during the grain filling period in optimal moisture conditions transfer more photosynthetic materials to the grains and thus increase the weight of grains and yield it seems that at water stress the mobilization rate is more important and in these conditions the relative prematurity shortening the grain filling period is considered to be a desirable trait reynolds et al 2000 the yield of each cultivar depends on its components drought stress reduced grain yield by reducing the number of fertile spikes number of grains and weight of thousand grains the stress at the booting caused a decrease in grain yield in both cultivars and this decrease in the sirvan cultivar was less than pishtaz cultivar due to a lower decrease in the weight of thousand grains the number of grains and a number of fertile spikes therefore stress in the pollination stage reduces the grain yield by reducing the weight of grains and therefore any decrease in the amount of water available to the plant causes grains to shrink in the present experiment grain yield in the second year was more than the first year this can be due to weather conditions lower temperatures and higher precipitation rates during spraying it led to a better absorption of methyl jasmonate in this year which ultimately increased the grain yield the importance of a number of grains per spike and its imperative role in increasing the grain yield of wheat grain has also been expressed by dogan 2009 arduini et al 2014 indicated that a number of spikes per m2 and number of grains per spike had direct and positive effects on grain yield in order to obtain the proper yield all yield components should be balanced the use of methyl jasmonate increased grain yield in this regard sheteawi 2007 reported that soaking soybeans seeds in methyl jasmonate solution with a concentration of 1 μm increased grain yield of each plant by 17 compared to control treatment korkmaz 2005 stated that in sweet peppers spraying the methyl jasmonate 5 and 10 mg l increased the yield by 15 to 40 the early mature sirvan cultivar due to the mechanisms of escape from the moisture and heat stress at late growth period of wheat under stress conditions had more yield than the late mature pishtaz cultivar due to the nature of the escape and the ability to release methyl jasmonate through the cell membrane this hormone was considered as an important candidate for intermediate molecular signaling communications inside and outside plants modifying the defensive responses of a plant wasternack 2007 and regulating plant reproduction processes von malek et al 2002 increased grain yield due to the use of methyl jasmonate also reported by shakirova et al 2003 dehghan et al 2017 also reported that cultivar sirvan using brassinolide growth regulator increased the number of grain per spike by 9 17 the weight of thousand grains by 6 62 and grain yield by 7 3 compared to non use of it in stress conditions despite the positive effects of methyl jasmonate on yield improvement kim et al 2009 reported that the use of methyl jasmonate in transgenic rice plants stimulates the production of the abscisic acid hormone which also leads to a decrease in grain yield water stress reduced biological yield in both studied cultivars biological yield in stress at the booting was lower than other levels of irrigation the use of higher concentration of methyl jasmonate had no effect on the increase of biological yield in comparison with the non hormone but it had a significant effect on grain yield indicating the role of remobilization and further increases the contribution of photosynthetic material transfer from vegetative parts to reproductive organs and further stimulation of it in cultivar sirvan saeidi and abdoli 2015 also reported a decline in biological yield at drought stress in the post pollination stage drought stress also reduced the harvest index in both wheat cultivars which was higher in sirvan due to elevated grain yield methyl jasmonate by improving the grain yield reduced the biological yield and increased the harvest index in sirvan cultivar compared to pishtaz cultivar reducing the harvest index in drought stress after flowering can be attributed to condensed access to the current growing material during the grain filling period which has a direct relationship with grain yield parizvand et al 2012 piraste anoshe and emam 2011 reported that the use of growth regulators by maintaining the dry matter produced could increase yield by raising the harvest index by comparing water productivity of irrigation regimes it can be stated that in the treatment of irrigation cut off from booting for each unit of water use the production of grain yield decreased in the case of water shortage pishtaz cultivar cannot be considered as superior cultivar due to the lower water productivity the accumulation of dry matter in a genotype under water shortage conditions indicates water productivity in addition dry matter is assigned to the plant s economic organs leading to a higher harvest index therefore the accumulation of more dry matter in the reproductive organs during pollination can be a suitable criterion for choosing under drought conditions kumar 2004 methyl jasmonate increased the water productivity by increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis and the grain yield compared to the amount of water use fugate et al 2018 studied on sugar beet and reported that the application of 10 μm methyl jasmonate reduced the effects of mild and severe drought stress on leaf relative water content and water use efficiency methyl jasmonate can improve the water productivity of the plant by delaying water stress in the plant and protect the photosynthetic apparatus from drought stress disorders 5 conclusion in general different irrigation regimes can influence the growth and yield of wheat cultivars in which case plant growth regulators such as jasmonates can play an important role in this process among different concentrations of methyl jasmonate 100 μm concentrations improved the negative effects of drought stress this positive effect was more observed in irrigation cut off at the booting stage according to the results in different wheat irrigation regimes the use of methyl jasmonate increased the harvest index by increasing the growth period until the physiological maturity of grain as well as increase grain yield components including a number of grains per spike and weight of thousand grains resulting in the final grain yield and by decreasing biological yield also due to the importance of water productivity in world climatic conditions the problem of reducing agricultural water reserves and increasing drought stress in wheat production the use of methyl jasmonate growth regulator as spraying by increasing water productivity in wheat cultivar it can play an significant role in maintaining food security in the future as one of the most

biodegradable bio based and compostable plastics are gaining increasing interest as preferred alternatives while there has been much work done on the development of preformed biodegradable plastic mulch films the use of sprayable plastic mulch coatings has received increasing attention globally as a next generation alternative because of its environmental benefits and ease of application sartore et al 2007 2008 saif al kalbani et al 2009 bio co agri ec project 2005 polysaccharides have been chosen as the basic ingredients in most of the newly developed water borne formulations as they are biodegradable biocompatible non toxic low cost and available from renewable resources avella et al 2007 and mormile et al 2007 however the issue with polysaccharide based formulations is their high hydrophilicity and poor mechanical properties various approaches to optimize macromolecular reorganizations retro degradation and gel formation processes by changing ph and cross linking have been investigated in order to develop films with reduced hydrophilicity from polysaccharides the eu project bio co agri 2005 reported several sprayable biodegradable materials for soil mulching using natural polymers such as starch cellulose chitosan alginate and glucomannan vox et al 2013 at the institute of chemistry and technology of polymers group ictp have also reported a sprayable

up to 60 biodegradability in 6 months vaicekauskaite et al 2019 saif al kalbani et al 2009 reported a field trial of an aqueous sprayable formulation based on polysiloxane polymer guilspare they were able to provide a sprayable water based product which could be applied to the soil surface and reduced not only soil evaporation but also allowed liquid water to infiltrate into the soil and prevented weed growth in their field trial they observed an increase in crop yield of 10 to 80 and a reduction in weed growth and herbicide pesticide usage with water savings from 25 to 50 an aqueous sprayable porous polymer formulation based on natural rubber ecotex has also been reported eliezer et al 2000 to form a porous membrane upon drying with claims that the permeability of the membrane can be adjusted by the volume of compound which is sprayed polyurethane pu has also been investigated as a sprayable mulch film in blend with acrylic latex formulations in about 40 60 by weight of a polyurethane acrylic hybrid dispersion pillai and ruhoff 2014 in all the above classes of sprayable formulations reported in the literature wicking is known to be affected by soil properties including particle size and the continuity of pore spaces cedergren 1997 and may lead to excessive polymer use poor membrane formation inconsistences in membrane thickness and low water barrier properties the higher the viscosity of the fluid the slower the fluid will flow because of the increase in resistance or drag forces newman 2008 therefore increasing the viscosity of sprayable polymers could be a way to reduce wicking and hence reduce the amount of polymer needed to form an effective water barrier provided it does not compromise polymer sprayability recently adhikari et al 2015a 2015b 2016 reported a water dispersible sprayable biodegradable polyurethane membrane to reduce soil water evaporation with claims that polyurethane composition could be adjusted to minimise wicking and membrane properties on specific soil type and supress weed growth in this paper we investigate modification of an aqueous polyurethane formulation using a range of viscosity modifiers and study their miscibility and effects on viscosity wicking sprayability mechanical properties of the membrane and performance in reducing soil water evaporation in laboratory conditions the four viscosity modifiers investigated in this study were gelatine gl alginate alg xanthan gum xan and polyacrylamide pam this study clearly shows that by carefully choosing the viscosity modifier we could reduce wicking of the pf into the soil without compromising sprayability and reduced soil water evaporation the study also included preliminary field trials of one of the viscosity modified formulations 2 materials and methods the pf used in this study was a water dispersible polyurethane with a 27 wt polymer solid content its composition and synthesis have been reported by adhikari et al 2015a the viscosity modifying agents gl alg batch 309013 the melbourne food ingredient depot vic xan lot g 1235 and pam batch 178042500 were obtained from aldrich pty ltd and used as received loam soil was obtained from griffith nsw australia for this study the sample codes used in the manuscript are expressed as i a wt fraction based on the wt of the pf of the vm stock solution added to the pf and ii the concentration of the vm in the vm stock solution wt for example pf xan 50 2 indicates the pf contains an additional 50 by weight of a 2 wt concentration of xan similarly pf alg 9 3 indicates the pf contains an additional 9 by weight of a 3 wt concentration of alg 2 1 preparation of the viscosity modifier stock solution separate vm stock solutions were prepared at specific concentrations by slowly adding the powder into water to yield a homogenous solution the solution was then mechanically stirred using a standard laboratory overhead mechanical stirrer ika rw20 digital 60 2000 rpm using a four blade propeller blade diameter 48 mm stirred at 300 rpm to provide high shear stress to facilitate the mixing process and to obtain a homogenous solution some viscosity modifiers such as pam were soluble in hot water only so the mixed solution was warmed and stirred at 60 c 2 2 wicking and sprayability test wicking of the pf was tested by placing approximately 10 to 15 g of 2 mm sieved loam soil inside a glass vial fig 1 a approximately 1 ml of water was applied to wet the soil surface and reduce surface hydrophobicity reduction in hydrophobicity was necessary to ensure that the pf covered the soil surface once the soil surface had been wetted 2 ml of the pf was applied drop wise using a pipette and wicking measured by determining the depth the liquid penetrated vertically downwards from the soil surface fig 1a in contrast to this the pf s sprayability was assessed using a hand held trigger sprayer fig 1b 2 3 viscosity measurement the viscosity values for the original polymer and vm modified fluids were determined using a brookfield dv ii programmable viscometer at room temperature 20 25 c using spindle no 2 at different rotation speeds rpm 2 4 membrane formation test the membrane formation test was performed by spraying the pf onto the soil surface fig 1c plastic petri dishes d 8 5 cm and h 1 5 cm were filled with soil and approximately 5 0 g of pf containing a particular vm was sprayed onto the soil to obtain a uniform thickness as in the wicking test the soil surface was first wetted with a few light mist sprays of water before applying the polymer mixture the treated soil surface was then left to dry overnight once the near surface soil dried the membrane that had formed on top of the soil was clearly visible 2 5 sample preparation for mechanical testing routine mechanical tests were performed using dumbbells of the polyurethane membrane 0 5 1 mm thickness the membrane was prepared by casting the pf 27 wt solids into teflon trays and drying at ambient temperature dumbbell specimens l 35 mm w 8 mm gauge length 12 5 mm gauge width 3 mm were punched and stored under ambient conditions for at least 24 h prior to testing and results reported are those of four replicates in table 2 2 6 membrane property characterisation the thermal transitions of the materials were measured by differential scanning calorimetry dsc using a mettler dsc 30 approximately 8 mg of polymer was encapsulated in a pierced 40 μl aluminium pan the sample was heated under nitrogen 25 ml min 1 from 25 to 60 c at a rate of 10 c min 1 held at 60 c for 1 min cooled to 50 c 10 c min 1 and held for 1 min to remove the thermal history of the materials finally the samples were heated from 50 to 200 c at a rate of 10 c min 1 the crystallisation temperature t c was identified in the cooling cycle while the glass transition temperature and melting temperatures t g and t m respectively were measured in the final heating cycle fig 6 tensile testing was performed on dry films using an instron model 4468 universal testing machine following the astm d 882 02 test method at ambient temperature 23 c with a 54 relative humidity a 1000 n load cell was used with a crosshead speed of 200 mm min the tensile strength yield stress elongation at break and young s modulus were calculated using bluehill v 2 5 the contact angles on preformed films were measured in static mode using a tensiometer cam 200 ksv instruments ltd finland connected to a high resolution digital camera basler a602i germany the results are expressed as the mean contact angles of one experiment se n 4 and summarised in fig 7 2 7 soil water evaporation tests the soil water evaporation tests of the pf with and without viscosity modifiers were performed on soil cores using an in house standard test method the soil used was a sandy clay loam with a surface bulk density of 1500 kg m3 particle size distribution was 22 clay 6 silt 62 fine sand and 10 coarse sand in the 0 0 1 m depth range soil 400 500 g was packed into an open metal cylinder diameter 10 5 cm x height 5 cm with a wire mesh bottom fig 1d the pf was sprayed onto the surface of the soil at an application loading of 0 58 kg m2 and left to dry overnight to form a membrane the soil cores were subsequently infused with water from the bottom up until the soil surface was wet and glistened the soil cores were then placed on individual balances located in a temperature controlled room 30 c and 40 relative humidity for a minimum of 3 days during this time soil water evaporation was determined by measuring the cumulative weight loss of each soil core at regular time intervals this allowed us to identify the polymer formulation that performed best at reducing soil water evaporation relative to bare soil the results reported are an average of three replicates with error bars showing one standard deviation from the mean figs 8 and 9 2 8 biodegradation the biodegradation of a preformed film and control was evaluated by the aerobic biodegradation test method astm 5988 under laboratory conditions for 180 days fig 10 2 9 preliminary small plot field trials to test the efficacy of the viscosity modified formulation in field conditions one of the reformed formulations was tested at a csiro experimental field site in griffith nsw within the murrumbidgee irrigation ltd site table 3 3 results and discussion the sprayable polyurethane membrane was developed to reduce soil water evaporation we noted that due to its low viscosity it wicked into soil and required a large amount of polymer to produce an effective membrane barrier the objective of this research study was to identify a suitable viscosity modifier and optimise its concentrations to achieve minimal wicking without compromising polymer sprayability viscosity and membrane mechanical properties four different viscosity modifiers gl alg xan and pam were used in concentrations between 2 8 wt and weight fractions between 1 50 this range of concentrations provided a reasonable fluid viscosity that blended well with the pf for soil wicking and sprayability tests the wt fraction amount of the required viscosity modifier concentration was drawn from the appropriate stock solution and blended with the pf solution by stirring for 30 min at ambient temperature 3 1 wicking and sprayability tests the wicking and sprayability of the pf containing various weight fractions of 2 3 or 8 concentrations of four vms were initially evaluated to assess their sprayability and wicking behaviour the results are summarized in table 1 under the given test conditions the control polymer formulation pf 0 showed the greatest degree of wicking 2 5 cm in general wicking reduced with increasing weight fractions but at higher weight fractions sprayability was compromised and no wicking value could be determined the least wicking without sprayability being compromised was observed with pf xan 9 2 8 of control and pf pam 5 2 9 of control and pf alg 5 8 20 of control while the gl modified pfs showed only slight reductions in wicking 80 of control except for pf gl 50 2 it may be attributed to the fact that these specific compositions showed better thixotropic behaviour and recovery to normal viscosity was faster and caused minimum wicking post spray the alg series was the only series where both weight fraction and vm concentration were systematically varied in these cases an increasing weight fraction and vm concentration reduced wicking but beyond moderate increases sprayability was compromised both the xan and pam pfs behaved similarly of the three xan formulations pf xan 5 2 and pf xan 9 2 showed good sprayability and wicking 1 cm 8 40 of control cured membranes on the soil surface showed good strength and appeared to be glossy on the surface the pf xan 50 2 formulation was very viscous was poorly miscible with the pf and had unacceptable sprayability pam based formulations pf pam 1 2 and pf pam 5 2 showed good sprayability and wicking 1 cm 12 40 of control but as weight fractions increased sprayability was compromised sprayability of the pf is an important feature and if the polymer can be delivered as a mist spray to avoid reduce excess delivery then theoretically less polymer should be required to form the membrane the above results table 1 suggest that the sprayability non sprayability of the pf is strongly influenced by viscosity with a more viscous material such as alg the resistance of the fluid to flow through the sprayer would be higher than a less viscous material however despite having low viscosity two pam based formulations pf pam 9 2 and pf pam 50 2 did not achieve acceptable sprayability it was difficult to control the pam viscosity at concentrations less than 400 ppm which meant it behaved like a newtonian fluid and compromised the sprayability bjorneberg 1998 in this study we used a hand held trigger spray commonly available in supermarkets fig 1b it should however be noted that the sprayability of the pf will be influenced by the choice of sprayer and the way it is operated there are a multitude of commercially available sprayers that have different nozzles fan patterns and operating pressures that influence the spray pattern and coverage of the soil surface consequently it is likely that some of the non sprayable pfs reported in table 1 may well be sprayable in commercial systems and that the results reported above should be viewed only in the context of the current study 3 2 viscosity measurements based on sprayability and wicking experiments a further series of sprayable pfs were selected for analysis of their viscosity figs 2 5 the viscosity profile of a series of pfs containing different weight fractions of 2 wt concentration of gl is shown in fig 2 the original pf which serves as a control showed very low viscosity 8 mpa s and provided inconsistent results so its viscosity measurement is not plotted this observation was also consistent in other pfs containing low concentrations of viscosity modifiers the viscosity values of the pf with gl increased significantly from 7 925 mpa s as the weight fraction of gl increased from 1 to 33 with the highest weight fraction exhibiting shear thinning behaviour a decrease in viscosity as the spindle s rotation speed increased the viscosity of a series of pfs containing alg also increased significantly from 521 to 2340 mpa s depending on weight fraction and concentration with all exhibiting some shear thinning behaviour the viscosity profiles of these pf alg formulations are shown in fig 3 the xan feedstock solution was highly viscous and difficult to blend with the pf it was found that in order to achieve a viscosity suitable for good sprayability using the hand held trigger sprayer small weight fractions were required so only 2 wt xan concentrations were used the pf xan formulation also showed increased viscosity 88 311 mpa s at rpm 10 with increasing weight fraction and shear thinning behaviour as shown in fig 4 pam feedstock solution had a very high viscosity and resulted in a stringy polymer mixture after mixing with the pf this required small weight fractions of 2 wt concentration to achieve the desired sprayability as with other pfs these exhibited shear thinning behaviour fig 5 based on the above results it is clear that the addition of increasing amounts of a viscosity modifier to the pf increased its overall viscosity and except at low gl levels showed shear thinning behaviour shear thinning typically occurs when a thickening agent is added to water generating non newtonian fluid behaviour newman 2008 this means that the pf viscosity will decrease as shear rate increases moreover reduced viscosity of the pf due to shear thinning was found to have a linear correlation with an increasing amount of thickener added for example a pf with a small amount of viscosity modifier exhibited only slight shear thinning while at higher vm levels more pronounced shear thinning effects were observed this is an important finding as in polymer systems it is typically related to the alignment of anisotropic chains which give rise to viscosity decreases and thus provides some insight into pf film formation its adhesion on the soil surface and wicking effects based on the above results pf alg 50 2 pf alg 5 8 pf xan 9 2 and pf pam 5 2 were selected for further evaluation as preformed membranes 3 3 morphology differential scanning calorimetry dsc was carried out on the above selected pf alg 50 2 pf alg 5 8 pf xan 9 2 and pf pam 5 2 formulations to study the effect of vms on polymer morphology all tests were performed using preformed membranes prepared by the solvent cast method as shown in fig 6 pf showed a low temperature glass transition temperature due to the pu soft segment polycaprolactone pcl around 50 c and broad melting endotherms above 200 c associated with the ordering of hard segments addition of viscosity modifiers in pf showed broadening of melting endotherms and little effect on soft segment tg pf alg 50 2 showed a broad melting endotherm around 208 c and the combined heat of fusion δh for hard segment melting endotherms increased to 4 13 jg 1 compared to 3 24 jg 1 in pf alg 5 8 which showed a broad melting endotherm peak at 210 c with δh 7 70 jg 1 pf xan 2 and pf pam 2 also showed similar morphology with a broad melting endotherm around 197 and 201 c with δh 5 57 and 9 85 jg 1 respectively in summary the dsc results suggest that viscosity modifiers contributed to some phase mixing between hard and soft segments and caused no considerable change in the polymer tg and hard segment ordering attributed to their different chemical structures 3 4 mechanical properties the preliminary tensile properties of formulations pf alg 50 2 pf alg 5 8 pf pam 5 2 and pf xan 9 2 are summarized in table 2 the original pf showed soft and elastic properties as do the vm modified pfs the elasticity which is critical to membrane behaviour on soil surfaces is typified by a low young s modulus and high elongation which remained largely unchanged in all formulations while the addition of a viscosity modifier lowered the young s modulus of all four pfs and did not significantly change the tensile strength except in pf alg 50 2 where it increased and pf alg 5 8 where it decreased these changes are in general not significant pf alg 50 2 showed the highest tensile strength 14 29 mpa and young s modulus 2 52 mpa compared to pf pam 5 2 which had the second lowest tensile strength 8 19 2 1 and lowest young s modulus 1 27 0 24 pf pam 5 2 and pf xan 9 2 showed little difference in their properties and of the four pf s tested pf alg 5 8 showed the lowest tensile strength 4 39 1 3 mpa and a young s modulus of 1 31 0 23 mpa table 2 any effects on mechanical properties at low concentrations of the vms is attributed to changes in hydrogen bonding and will be somewhat dependent on individual vm structural and chemical character 3 5 contact angle contact angle measurements are a quick test to determine the effect of viscosity modifiers on surface hydrophobicity the effect of viscosity modifiers on hydrophobicity and wettability of the four selected formulations pf alg 50 2 pf alg 5 8 pf xan 9 2 and pf pam 5 2 were determined using water contact angle measurements for the first 10 s of contact fig 7 the pf without viscosity modifiers was hydrophobic 104 3 the pfs with viscosity modifiers showed reduced hydrophobicity except for pf pam 5 2 θ 101 66 which was comparable to the original pf the reduced hydrophobicity in pf containing vm is attributed to the hydrophilicity of the vm and appeared dependent on the vm weight fraction concentration the contact angle did not change for up to 60 s in all the pfs tested 3 6 soil core trials the soil core trials were carried out using standard brass core rings under controlled laboratory conditions 30 c and 40 relative humidity for a minimum of 3 days the cumulative soil water evaporation results of control bare soil with the original pf and the four selected pf s pf alg 50 2 pf alg 5 8 pf xan 9 2 and pf pam 5 2 are provided in figs 8 and 9 using a constant pf of 27 wt polymer solid a range of different pf application loadings was applied to the surface of the soil cores and results are shown in fig 8 the pf without any viscosity modifier required high polymer loadings to achieve a significant reduction in soil water evaporation the highest pf loading 1 74 kg m2 showed the greatest reduction in soil water evaporation 75 reduction the soil core trial results of pfs with viscosity modifiers fig 9 showed a significant reduction in soil water evaporation with only 0 58 kg m2 polymer loading in the case of alg pf alg 5 8 showed a greater reduction in soil water evaporation than pf alg 50 2 similar behaviours were observed with pf xan 9 2 which showed the highest reduction in soil water evaporation 66 fig 9 the reduction in soil water evaporation by pf pam 5 2 was essentially the same as the xan formulation both pfs showed improved reduction in soil evaporation compared with bare soil with significant less polymer loading of only 0 58 kg m2 and were comparable to preformed commercial polyolefin mulch films performance 3 7 biodegradation of the above formulations polymer formulation pf alg 50 2 was evaluated by the aerobic biodegradation test method astm 5988 under laboratory conditions for 180 days the rate of biodegradation was monitored by measuring carbon dioxide generated and compared to control cellulose film over the same time period fig 10 after 180 days pf alg 50 2 achieved 55 biodegradation compared to the 75 biodegradation of the cellulose control cellulose film increased degradation is attributed to its hydrophilic nature which enable quick water absorption and hydrolytic degradation compared to relatively hydrophobic urethane pf alg 50 2 film the gradual increase in pf alg 50 2 degradation after 150 days is attributed to reduced polymer molecular weight 3 8 preliminary small plot field trials to test the efficacy of the viscosity modified formulation in field conditions one of the pf alg formulation was tested at a csiro experimental field site in griffith nsw within the murrumbidgee irrigation ltd site adhikari et al 2015a we used melons as the crop in these trials the treatment with the polymer membrane showed 28 less irrigation water requirement with a recorded crop yield of 306 kg compared to the control full irrigation average of 320 kg the trial showed that the polymer treatment was able to maintain approximately the same yield compared to the control but with 28 less applied irrigation water water use productivity was 0 455 kg 100 l higher in the polymer treatment compared to the control table 3 4 conclusions results of our studies show that the viscosity of the original polymer formulation pf was low 8 mpa s this resulted in excessive wicking and thus poor membrane formation and little reduction in soil water evaporation to minimize wicking we tested four different viscosity modifier gl alg xan and pam concentrates between 2 8 wt in the pf the results obtained showed that the viscosity modified original pf i reduced the wicking of the pf into soil ii improved membrane formation on the soil surface iii significantly reduced soil water evaporation with a relatively low pf loading 0 58 kg m2 compared to unmodified control 1 74 kg m 2 and iv had little effect on membrane morphology and mechanical properties the reduction in soil water evaporation using pf xan 9 2 and pf pam 5 2 was close to the performance of preformed commercial plastic mulch film of the four viscosity modifiers tested pf xan 9 2 was found to be the best viscosity modifier in terms of combining good sprayability minimal wicking and reduced soil water evaporation up to 66 the viscosity and sprayability of the pfs was found to be dependent on the concentration and weight fraction of the viscosity modifiers with some exhibiting shear thinning properties that resulted in poor performance the reduction in soil evaporation was less in the field trial than the pot trial but the crop yield achieved with the preferred polymer membrane pf alg 5 8 was comparable to that of the control treatment but it used 28 less water the mechanical integrity of the polymer membrane was maintained throughout the crop season with some disintegration biodegradation starting to occur 3 months after it was applied the above results clearly showed that use of appropriate viscosity modifiers can improve performance of our sprayable polymer membrane and reduce soil water evaporation with less polymer and without compromising the inherent mechanical properties of the polymer membrane acknowledgements we thank csiro agriculture and food and csiro manufacturing for their support and for funding this study

test the membrane formation test was performed by spraying the pf onto the soil surface fig 1c plastic petri dishes d 8 5 cm and h 1 5 cm were filled with soil and approximately 5 0 g of pf containing a particular vm was sprayed onto the soil to obtain a uniform thickness as in the wicking test the soil surface was first wetted with a few light mist sprays of water before applying the polymer mixture the treated soil surface was then left to dry overnight once the near surface soil dried the membrane that had formed on top of the soil was clearly visible 2 5 sample preparation for mechanical testing routine mechanical tests were performed using dumbbells of the polyurethane membrane 0 5 1 mm thickness the membrane was prepared by casting the pf 27 wt solids into teflon trays and drying at ambient temperature dumbbell specimens l 35 mm w 8 mm gauge length 12 5 mm gauge width 3 mm were punched and stored under ambient conditions for at least 24 h prior to testing and results reported are those of four replicates in table 2 2 6 membrane property characterisation the thermal transitions of the materials were measured by differential scanning calorimetry dsc using a mettler dsc 30 approximately 8 mg of polymer was encapsulated in a pierced 40 μl aluminium pan the sample was heated under nitrogen 25 ml min 1 from 25 to 60 c at a rate of 10 c min 1 held at 60 c for 1 min cooled to 50 c 10 c min 1 and held for 1 min to remove the thermal history of the materials finally the samples were heated from 50 to 200 c at a rate of 10 c min 1 the crystallisation temperature t c was identified in the cooling cycle while the glass transition temperature and melting temperatures t g and t m respectively were measured in the final heating cycle fig 6 tensile testing was performed on dry films using an instron model 4468 universal testing machine following the astm d 882 02 test method at ambient temperature 23 c with a 54 relative humidity a 1000 n load cell was used with a crosshead speed of 200 mm min the tensile strength yield stress elongation at break and young s modulus were calculated using bluehill v 2 5 the contact angles on preformed films were measured in static mode using a tensiometer cam 200 ksv instruments ltd finland connected to a high resolution digital camera basler a602i germany the results are expressed as the mean contact angles of one experiment se n 4 and summarised in fig 7 2 7 soil water evaporation tests the soil water evaporation tests of the pf with and without viscosity modifiers were performed on soil cores using an in house standard test method the soil used was a sandy clay loam with a surface bulk density of 1500 kg m3 particle size distribution was 22 clay 6 silt 62 fine sand and 10 coarse sand in the 0 0 1 m depth range soil 400 500 g was packed into an open metal cylinder diameter 10 5 cm x height 5 cm with a wire mesh bottom fig 1d the pf was sprayed onto the surface of the soil at an application loading of 0 58 kg m2 and left to dry overnight to form a membrane the soil cores were subsequently infused with water from the bottom up until the soil surface was wet and glistened the soil cores were then placed on individual balances located in a temperature controlled room 30 c and 40 relative humidity for a minimum of 3 days during this time soil water evaporation was determined by measuring the cumulative weight loss of each soil core at regular time intervals this allowed us to identify the polymer formulation that performed best at reducing soil water evaporation relative to bare soil the results reported are an average of three replicates with error bars showing one standard deviation from the mean figs 8 and 9 2 8 biodegradation the biodegradation of a preformed film and control was evaluated by the aerobic biodegradation test method astm 5988 under laboratory conditions for 180 days fig 10 2 9 preliminary small plot field trials to test the efficacy of the viscosity modified formulation in field conditions one of the reformed formulations was tested at a csiro experimental field site in griffith nsw within the murrumbidgee irrigation ltd site table 3 3 results and discussion the sprayable polyurethane membrane was developed to reduce soil water evaporation we noted that due to its low viscosity it wicked into soil and required a large amount of polymer to produce an effective membrane barrier the objective of this research study was to identify a suitable viscosity modifier and optimise its concentrations to achieve minimal wicking without compromising polymer sprayability viscosity and membrane mechanical properties four different viscosity modifiers gl alg xan and pam were used in concentrations between 2 8 wt and weight fractions between 1 50 this range of concentrations provided a reasonable fluid viscosity that blended well with the pf for soil wicking and sprayability tests the wt fraction amount of the required viscosity modifier concentration was drawn from the appropriate stock solution and blended with the pf solution by stirring for 30 min at ambient temperature 3 1 wicking and sprayability tests the wicking and sprayability of the pf containing various weight fractions of 2 3 or 8 concentrations of four vms were initially evaluated to assess their sprayability and wicking behaviour the results are summarized in table 1 under the given test conditions the control polymer formulation pf 0 showed the greatest degree of wicking 2 5 cm in general wicking reduced with increasing weight fractions but at higher weight fractions sprayability was compromised and no wicking value could be determined the least wicking without sprayability being compromised was observed with pf xan 9 2 8 of control and pf pam 5 2 9 of control and pf alg 5 8 20 of control while the gl modified pfs showed only slight reductions in wicking 80 of control except for pf gl 50 2 it may be attributed to the fact that these specific compositions showed better thixotropic behaviour and recovery to normal viscosity was faster and caused minimum wicking post spray the alg series was the only series where both weight fraction and vm concentration were systematically varied in these cases an increasing weight fraction and vm concentration reduced wicking but beyond moderate increases sprayability was compromised both the xan and pam pfs behaved similarly of the three xan formulations pf xan 5 2 and pf xan 9 2 showed good sprayability and wicking 1 cm 8 40 of control cured membranes on the soil surface showed good strength and appeared to be glossy on the surface the pf xan 50 2 formulation was very viscous was poorly miscible with the pf and had unacceptable sprayability pam based formulations pf pam 1 2 and pf pam 5 2 showed good sprayability and wicking 1 cm 12 40 of control but as weight fractions increased sprayability was compromised sprayability of the pf is an important feature and if the polymer can be delivered as a mist spray to avoid reduce excess delivery then theoretically less polymer should be required to form the membrane the above results table 1 suggest that the sprayability non sprayability of the pf is strongly influenced by viscosity with a more viscous material such as alg the resistance of the fluid to flow through the sprayer would be higher than a less viscous material however despite having low viscosity two pam based formulations pf pam 9 2 and pf pam 50 2 did not achieve acceptable sprayability it was difficult to control the pam viscosity at concentrations less than 400 ppm which meant it behaved like a newtonian fluid and compromised the sprayability bjorneberg 1998 in this study we used a hand held trigger spray commonly available in supermarkets fig 1b it should however be noted that the sprayability of the pf will be influenced by the choice of sprayer and the way it is operated there are a multitude of commercially available sprayers that have different nozzles fan patterns and operating pressures that influence the spray pattern and coverage of the soil surface consequently it is likely that some of the non sprayable pfs reported in table 1 may well be sprayable in commercial systems and that the results reported above should be viewed only in the context of the current study 3 2 viscosity measurements based on sprayability and wicking experiments a further series of sprayable pfs were selected for analysis of their viscosity figs 2 5 the viscosity profile of a series of pfs containing different weight fractions of 2 wt concentration of gl is shown in fig 2 the original pf which serves as a control showed very low viscosity 8 mpa s and provided inconsistent results so its viscosity measurement is not plotted this observation was also consistent in other pfs containing low concentrations of viscosity modifiers the viscosity values of the pf with gl increased significantly from 7 925 mpa s as the weight fraction of gl increased from 1 to 33 with the highest weight fraction exhibiting shear thinning behaviour a decrease in viscosity as the spindle s rotation speed increased the viscosity of a series of pfs containing alg also increased significantly from 521 to 2340 mpa s depending on weight fraction and concentration with all exhibiting some shear thinning behaviour the viscosity profiles of these pf alg formulations are shown in fig 3 the xan feedstock solution was highly viscous and difficult to blend with the pf it was found that in order to achieve a viscosity suitable for good sprayability using the hand held trigger sprayer small weight fractions were required so only 2 wt xan concentrations were used the pf xan formulation also showed increased viscosity 88 311 mpa s at rpm 10 with increasing weight fraction and shear thinning behaviour as shown in fig 4 pam feedstock solution had a very high viscosity and resulted in a stringy polymer mixture after mixing with the pf this required small weight fractions of 2 wt concentration to achieve the desired sprayability as with other pfs these exhibited shear thinning behaviour fig 5 based on the above results it is clear that the addition of increasing amounts of a viscosity modifier to the pf increased its overall viscosity and except at low gl levels showed shear thinning behaviour shear thinning typically occurs when a thickening agent is added to water generating non newtonian fluid behaviour newman 2008 this means that the pf viscosity will decrease as shear rate increases moreover reduced viscosity of the pf due to shear thinning was found to have a linear correlation with an increasing amount of thickener added for example a pf with a small amount of viscosity modifier exhibited only slight shear thinning while at higher vm levels more pronounced shear thinning effects were observed this is an important finding as in polymer systems it is typically related to the alignment of anisotropic chains which give rise to viscosity decreases and thus provides some insight into pf film formation its adhesion on the soil surface and wicking effects based on the above results pf alg 50 2 pf alg 5 8 pf xan 9 2 and pf pam 5 2 were selected for further evaluation as preformed membranes 3 3 morphology differential scanning calorimetry dsc was carried out on the above selected pf alg 50 2 pf alg 5 8 pf xan 9 2 and pf pam 5 2 formulations to study the effect of vms on polymer morphology all tests were performed using preformed membranes prepared by the solvent cast method as shown in fig 6 pf showed a low temperature glass transition temperature due to the pu soft segment polycaprolactone pcl around 50 c and broad melting endotherms above 200 c associated with the ordering of hard segments addition of viscosity modifiers in pf showed broadening of melting endotherms and little effect on soft segment tg pf alg 50 2 showed a broad melting endotherm around 208 c and the combined heat of fusion δh for hard segment melting endotherms increased to 4 13 jg 1 compared to 3 24 jg 1 in pf alg 5 8 which showed a broad melting endotherm peak at 210 c with δh 7 70 jg 1 pf xan 2 and pf pam 2 also showed similar morphology with a broad melting endotherm around 197 and 201 c with δh 5 57 and 9 85 jg 1 respectively in summary the dsc results suggest that viscosity modifiers contributed to some phase mixing between hard and soft segments and caused no considerable change in the polymer tg and hard segment ordering attributed to their different chemical structures 3 4 mechanical properties the preliminary tensile properties of formulations pf alg 50 2 pf alg 5 8 pf pam 5 2 and pf xan 9 2 are summarized in table 2 the original pf showed soft and elastic properties as do the vm modified pfs the elasticity which is critical to membrane behaviour on soil surfaces is typified by a low young s modulus and high elongation which remained largely unchanged in all formulations while the addition of a viscosity modifier lowered the young s modulus of all four pfs and did not significantly change the tensile strength except in pf alg 50 2 where it increased and pf alg 5 8 where it decreased these changes are in general not significant pf alg 50 2 showed the highest tensile strength 14 29 mpa and young s modulus 2 52 mpa compared to pf pam 5 2 which had the second lowest tensile strength 8 19 2 1 and lowest young s modulus 1 27 0 24 pf pam 5 2 and pf xan 9 2 showed little difference in their properties and of the four pf s tested pf alg 5 8 showed the lowest tensile strength 4 39 1 3 mpa and a young s modulus of 1 31 0 23 mpa table 2 any effects on mechanical properties at low concentrations of the vms is attributed to changes in hydrogen bonding and will be somewhat dependent on individual vm structural and chemical character 3 5 contact angle contact angle measurements are a quick test to determine the effect of viscosity modifiers on surface hydrophobicity the effect of viscosity modifiers on hydrophobicity and wettability of the four selected formulations pf alg 50 2 pf alg 5 8 pf xan 9 2 and pf pam 5 2 were determined using water contact angle measurements for the first 10 s of contact fig 7 the pf without viscosity modifiers was hydrophobic 104 3 the pfs with viscosity modifiers showed reduced hydrophobicity except for pf pam 5 2 θ 101 66 which was comparable to the original pf the reduced hydrophobicity in pf containing vm is attributed to the hydrophilicity of the vm and appeared dependent on the vm weight fraction concentration the contact angle did not change for up to 60 s in all the pfs tested 3 6 soil core trials the soil core trials were carried out using standard brass core rings under controlled laboratory conditions 30 c and 40 relative humidity for a minimum of 3 days the cumulative soil water evaporation results of control bare soil with the original pf and the four selected pf s pf alg 50 2 pf alg 5 8 pf xan 9 2 and pf pam 5 2 are provided in figs 8 and 9 using a constant pf of 27 wt polymer solid a range of different pf application loadings was applied to the surface of the soil cores and results are shown in fig 8 the pf without any viscosity modifier required high polymer loadings to achieve a significant reduction in soil water evaporation the highest pf loading 1 74 kg m2 showed the greatest reduction in soil water evaporation 75 reduction the soil core trial results of pfs with viscosity modifiers fig 9 showed a significant reduction in soil water evaporation with only 0 58 kg m2 polymer loading in the case of alg pf alg 5 8 showed a greater reduction in soil water evaporation than pf alg 50 2 similar behaviours were observed with pf xan 9 2 which showed the highest reduction in soil water evaporation 66 fig 9 the reduction in soil water evaporation by pf pam 5 2 was essentially the same as the xan formulation both pfs showed improved reduction in soil evaporation compared with bare soil with significant less polymer loading of only 0 58 kg m2 and were comparable to preformed commercial polyolefin mulch films performance 3 7 biodegradation of the above formulations polymer formulation pf alg 50 2 was evaluated by the aerobic biodegradation test method astm 5988 under laboratory conditions for 180 days the rate of biodegradation was monitored by measuring carbon dioxide generated and compared to control cellulose film over the same time period fig 10 after 180 days pf alg 50 2 achieved 55 biodegradation compared to the 75 biodegradation of the cellulose control cellulose film increased degradation is attributed to its hydrophilic nature which enable quick water absorption and hydrolytic degradation compared to relatively hydrophobic urethane pf alg 50 2 film the gradual increase in pf alg 50 2 degradation after 150 days is attributed to reduced polymer molecular weight 3 8 preliminary small plot field trials to test the efficacy of the viscosity modified formulation in field conditions one of the pf alg formulation was tested at a csiro experimental field site in griffith nsw within the murrumbidgee irrigation ltd site adhikari et al 2015a we used melons as the crop in these trials the treatment with the polymer membrane showed 28 less irrigation water requirement with a recorded crop yield of 306 kg compared to the control full irrigation average of 320 kg the trial showed that the polymer treatment was able to maintain approximately the same yield compared to the control but with 28 less applied irrigation water water use productivity was 0 455 kg 100 l higher in the polymer treatment compared to the control table 3 4 conclusions results of our studies show that the viscosity of the original polymer formulation pf was low 8 mpa s this resulted in excessive wicking and thus poor membrane formation and little reduction in soil water evaporation to minimize wicking we tested four different viscosity modifier gl alg xan and pam concentrates between 2 8 wt in the pf the results obtained showed that the viscosity modified original pf i reduced the wicking of the pf into soil ii improved membrane formation on the soil surface iii significantly reduced soil water evaporation with a relatively low pf loading 0 58 kg m2 compared to unmodified control 1 74 kg m 2 and iv had little effect on membrane morphology and mechanical properties the reduction in soil water evaporation using pf xan 9 2 and pf pam 5 2 was close to the performance of preformed commercial plastic mulch film of the four viscosity modifiers tested pf xan 9 2 was found to be the best viscosity modifier in terms of combining good sprayability minimal wicking and reduced soil water evaporation up to 66 the viscosity and sprayability of the pfs was found to be dependent on the concentration and weight fraction of the viscosity modifiers with some exhibiting shear thinning properties that resulted in poor performance the reduction in soil evaporation was less in the field trial than the pot trial but the crop yield achieved with the preferred polymer membrane pf alg 5 8 was comparable to that of the control treatment but it used 28 less water the mechanical integrity of the polymer membrane was maintained throughout the crop season with some disintegration biodegradation starting to occur 3 months after it was applied the above results clearly showed that use of appropriate viscosity modifiers can improve performance of our sprayable polymer membrane and reduce soil water evaporation with less polymer and without compromising the inherent mechanical properties of the polymer membrane acknowledgements we thank csiro agriculture and food and csiro manufacturing for their support and for funding this study 
10972,gravel mulching has long been used to conserve water and enhance crop yield in the loess plateau of china the climate change and water scarcity in the loess plateau of china may have an impact on the phenological changes of plants thus affecting the growth process biomass yield energy input output and economics of crops however focuses on the effects of gravel mulching on energy input output and agricultural economics are less therefore a 3 year field study of winter wheat was conducted with different gravel mulching practices in the loess plateau china the five treatments are zero mulch ck 25 surface gravel mulch m1 50 surface gravel mulch m2 75 surface gravel mulch m3 and 100 surface gravel mulch m4 respectively in addition a set of indicator systems based on energy economics and crop growth were proposed to better understand the effects of gravel mulching compared with the ck treatment the gravel mulching treatments significantly prolonged the thermal time required for the plant growth and biomass accumulation and increased the growth rate of the leaf area index lai and ultimately improved the winter wheat yield this effect was particularly evident during the jointing period of winter wheat the results also showed that gravel mulching significantly increased energy use efficiency and net returns in economics the four gravel mulching treatments significantly increased the biomass yield 4 9 17 3 higher than the ck net returns 12 1 53 8 higher than the ck and net returns water use efficiency wuenre 12 0 53 4 higher than the ck accordingly the energy productivity net energy and net energy water use efficiency wueene were 2 2 8 2 5 7 19 8 and 7 1 20 9 respectively higher than the ck under m1 m4 overall gravel mulching exerted positive influences on the economic returns and the energy use vs their water use efficiency thus gravel mulching is not only an effective way to improve crop growth and yield but it also has the potential to improve economic benefits and energy efficiency within the context of climate change and water crises in the loess plateau china keywords energy economic water use efficiency gravel mulching 1 introduction food security is a major issue related to climate change and the water crisis and ultimately affects the national economic and social stability in the arid regions of northwest china with arid regions covering approximately 30 of the land in china dryland farming systems may exert a long term effect and are therefore indispensable for food production limited water resources are the major constraints in crop production rockström et al 2007 especially when combined with low temperatures and declining precipitation the biological processes in arid and semiarid regions are mainly controlled by water and its scarcity fließbach et al 1994 so the spatial and temporal distributions of water have important effects one of the objectives for innovating agricultural practices is to increase the crop production with less water gong et al 2017 i e improve water use efficiency in different growth stages or throughout the entire growing period a chinese proverb states although there are several buckets of jade it is not as good as a millet the shortage of water resources and energy have become the crisis faced by the world the challenge of food security is particularly serious in the loess plateau of northwest china it is worth of further study to ensure the biomass productivity through optimizing field management measures within the context of energy and water crises parihar et al 2018 in an attempt to offset the influence of water scarcity and low temperature gravel mulching acting as one of the most important traditional techniques has been used over for 300 years by

xue et al 2017 hartmann et al 2014 providing food rations to more than 120 million peoples with the demand of wheat expected to steadily grow however poor precipitation and a deteriorated ecological environment are likely to reduce the yield of crops and threaten the food supply in arid and semiarid regions li et al 2004 lobell et al 2008 to meet the rising demand continuing to improve dryland agriculture with different mulching practices may be an optimized method of guaranteeing food security gravel mulching technology has been widely verified by numerous researchers as a promising and effective solution to reduce evaporation and improve crop production in the loess plateau of china the applications of gravel mulching will possibly reclaim not only the benefits of the mulching practice in terms of altering the soil s water heat balance and increasing the biomass yield but also both the potential to increase the economic returns and energy use efficiency however it is regrettable that surface gravel are easy to mix with soil and hard to removed therefore so it is not recommended in the non gravel mulched areas the value of this traditional technology did not lie in its direct application or suitability for the rest of the world gale et al 1993 the development of field management technologies with the maximum crop productivity and a higher use efficiency of water and energy is needed for the current focus on sustainable agriculture pratibha et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 published studies have shown that zero tillage could maintain and improve the soil s physical properties bergamaschi et al 2010 parihar et al 2016 and the adoption of conservation agriculture based practices requires the least amount of energy in farm operation and enhances the biomass productivity with lower production costs and less use of natural resources compared to other systems lichter et al 2008 no till with gravel mulching is conducive to the aggregation of the soil structure where the surface gravel acts as a protector reducing evaporation and enhancing the system s ability to conserve water thus improving the crop growth and biomass yield which may result in a higher biomass water use efficiency an enhanced biomass yield and multilevel water use efficiency have been observed in wheat and maize gong et al 2017 wang et al 2018a 2018b however knowledge about the effects of different mulching practices on energy use and economics is lacking accompanying the fast increase of agriculture the consumption of chemical fertilizers electricity the total power of agricultural machinery diesel oil and pesticides have risen greatly zhang et al 2015 according to bureau of statistics of china these agricultural supplies consume significant amounts of energy and induce a rapid increase in the energy crisis saad et al 2016 along with a growing use of fertilizers and agro chemicals and irrigation though these practices help crops fight pests reduce competition from weeds and improve the productivity and economic benefit ratio of farmland huang et al 2016 huang and zou 2018 the intensification of agricultural practices has also led to an excessive consumption of energy energy plays an important role for a nation as it is required in industries agriculture and all aspects of social development it is therefore common sense that enhancing the energy and environmental efficiency is a crucial and scientiﬁc way for the world to combat the energy challenge fei and lin 2017 moreover an increasing economy also means a shift in energy arabatzis and malesios 2011 hosier and dowd 1987 gyamﬁ et al 2018 the economic analyses of gravel mulch which are characterized by a high crop productivity ali et al 2017 chaudhary et al 2017 mousavi avval et al 2011 therefore need to be demonstrated hence a scientific evaluation that including both the energy use efficiency and economics is needed which is of great importance globally however few advanced studies are focused on the energy consumption and the economic input output analysis of wheat cropping systems in the study region as affected by gravel mulching this study therefore investigated the water use crop growth economic input output and energy use of rain fed wheat in the arid and semiarid region of northwest china with five different gravel mulching practices the aim of this study was to determine whether dry land farmers can expect to receive a satisfactory income from their investment and to identify different aspects of the production system that can contribute to changes in the economic and energy performances of using this mulching management therefore the objectives of this study were i to calculate the values of eigenvalues of the richard equation and make an anova for the leaf are index lai plant height h and biomass bio during the entire winter wheat growing seasons ii to evaluate the economics of winter wheat production and water use efficiency under different gravel mulching practices compared with the non mulched practice and iii to quantify the influence of continuous gravel mulching on energy input output and energy use efficiency in wheat production

of water saving irrigation of northwest a f university which is located in the yangling district of northwest china 34 20 n 108 24 e 521 m a s l the site is a typical rainfed area in the loess plateau of china the local climate is classified as semiarid temperate continental monsoon it is prone to drought in the early stages of wheat growth song et al 2017 the mean annual rainfall is approximately 578 mm the average annual temperature is 13 0 c the mean annual pan evaporation exceeds 990 mm and the mean annual sunshine duration is 2100 2200 h due to an uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation the winter is cold and experiences drought the data of air temperature and daily precipitation were collected from a nearby weather station fig 1 that is close to the experimental field wang et al 2018a 2018b the total precipitations were 291 2 mm 253 4 mm and 203 4 mm for the rotation cycle of 2013 2014 cycle 1 2014 2015 cycle 2 and 2015 2016 cycle 3 respectively the soil is

available k of 187 0 mg kg 1 2 2 experimental details and crop management the treatments were set up in the field where the soil samples were taken the experiment was laid out in a randomized complete plot design with five treatments including zero mulch ck zero mulch ck 25 surface gravel mulching m1 50 surface gravel mulching m2 75 surface gravel mulching m3 and 100 surface gravel mulching m4 respectively the gravel used was the same size but differed in weight the 5 treatment combinations with a subplot size of 15 m2 5 m length 3 m width were replicated thrice for all three years of study before the start of the experiment the experimental area was plowed and paved each plot was wrapped with an 8 μm thick polyethylene plastic film 1 m deep along a vertical profile of the ridge edge preventing lateral infiltration of the soil moisture the individual plots were separated by 0 3 m spacing for the four gravel mulched fields gravel 2 4 cm in size passing through a 4 cm sieve was evenly laid by hand after planting the wheat and the mulch was not disturbed throughout the study periods since it is easy to mix with soil gale et al 1993 the gravel was removed once the crop harvest was completed the fields were completely rain fed with no irrigation so the plants relied entirely on precipitation and soil water the same tillage cultivation were done in the control plots as we did in the mulched plots throughout the study periods during the 3 year experimental period three replicate ﬁelds were planted with winter wheat cv xiaoyan 22 at a seeding density of 187 5 kg ha 1 the seasons for the winter wheat were october 19 2013 june 7 2014 october 17 2014 june 5 2015 and october 21 2015 june 7 2016 referring to the local farmers cultivation habits a uniform dose of fertilizers was applied at a rate of 150 kg n and 100 kg p2o5 ha 1 yr 1 with a urea source as an n fertilizer and calcium superphosphate as p for all treatments to manage weeds and insects agricultural chemicals herbicide glyphosate and pesticide were sprayed at 14 8 kg ha 1 in the plots throughout the entire growing periods in addition one hand weeding was also performed moreover maize was planted at intervals between the two wheat planting seasons wheat and maize straw were removed after harvest and then the soil was tilled using manual rotary tillage to a depth of 15 cm 2 3 measurements and calculations 2 3 1 biomass productivity and wheat growth eigenvalues during the wheat growing periods we monitored the plant height h using a scale ruler and the leaf area index lai in rows of wheat using a canopy analysis instrument sunscan 2000 delta t co uk the above ground biomass was estimated at the main growing periods of winter wheat ten sampled plants total leaves and stover were heated at 105 c for 30 min and then dried at a constant temperature 75 c the measured weight was then determined to be the biomass productivity at harvest the total biomass productivity and wheat yield t ha 1 were estimated from a 1 m2 area marked with coil beforehand in the middle of each plot using the oven drying method and do the threshing by hand the eigenvalues of the richard equation were quantified and an anova was implemented for the plant height h and biomass during the three winter wheat growing seasons the accumulated temperature of each sampling period was calculated by using the following formula as suggested by wang et al 2015 and johnen et al 2012 the richard equation is a four parameter nonlinear equation that includes a series of s curves in this study the independent variable x is the accumulated temperature which is expressed by the growing degree day gdd and the dependent variable is the plant height or biomass expressed as 1 y a 1 e b c x 1 d where a b c and d are the constant parameters and a is the upper limit value of the plant height hmax or biomass bmax deriving eq 2 the growth rate gr of the plant height and biomass accumulation are 2 g r d y d x a c e b c x d e b c x 1 d 1 d y c 1 y a d d deriving eq 2 and letting it be 0 the accumulated temperature at the maximum growth rate xinf is obtained thus the maximum gr and the accumulated temperature when the plant height or biomass accumulation entered the fast growing period x1 are obtained detailed descriptions can be found in li et al 2017 darro and baker 1990 who reported that the plant growth ends when the plant height and biomass reached 95 of the maximum values thus the accumulated temperature was obtained when the growth process ended xmax hmax hxmax hrmax hxinf and hx1 are the maximum h the accumulated temperature when h reached the maximum value the maximum growth rate the accumulated temperature when the growth rate reached the maximum value and the accumulated temperature when entering the fast growing period respectively the same interpretation applies for bmax bxmax brmax bxinf and bx1 the leaf area index lai of crops gradually increases with time which is in accordance with the logistic model in the early growing periods but decreases due to the leaf senescence in the late period the measured lai and accumulated temperature data were fitted with the modified logistic curve reported by wang 1986 expressed as 3 y a 1 e x p b x 2 c x d where y is the lai x is the gdd a b c d are the parameters and a no longer has the meaning of the

approximately once every 7 d during the entirety of the crop growth seasons in addition we also additionally monitored the soil moisture content when rainfall occurred fig 2 shows the soil moisture content at the top 20 cm 40 cm and 80 cm layer respectively under different mulching treatments during the winter wheat growth periods from 2013 to 2016 the soil moisture in the 0 100 cm soil profile in each plot was calculated as the total soil water storage w during the wheat growing seasons then et could be determined using the field water balance equation as follows allen et al 1998 sun et al 2010 pradhan et al 2014 5 e t p i c r d δ w where et is the evapo transpiration mm p is the effective precipitation mm i is the irrigation mm c is the capillary rise mm r is the runoff mm d is the deep percolation mm and δw is the change of water storage in the profile mm there was no runoff r from the experimental plots as they were bunded up to a sufficient height 40 cm height and no cases of bound overflow were observed during the study period as the groundwater level was relatively low 8 10 m in depth the soil moisture at the 0 200 cm depth were monitored in this study deep percolation below a 200 cm profile d was assumed to be negligible chen et al 2010 muniandy et al 2016 parihar et al 2017 2 3 3 energy and economic analysis the energy analysis presented in this study compared the energy input output and its efficiency between the five different mulching treatments the primary data collected on various inputs the energy requirements and the management practice in each of the winter wheat production stages from sowing to maturity were used to determine and quantify the energy consumption generally the input items referred to direct energy use and indirect energy use the direct energy use was comprised of the diesel water and human labor required to perform arable farming related to crop production processes such as land preparation irrigation and spraying pesticides the indirect energy use included energy embedded in the production processes of farm machinery fertilizers pesticides and seeds zhang et al 2015 the energy output consisted of the biomass grain economic yield and wheat straw moreover the loss or waste resulting from natural calamities and pests was negligible the energy equivalents used to estimate the energy inputs and outputs were referred to in the published studies reported by yuan and peng 2017 and zhang et al 2015 the energy use indices including the net energy energy productivity energy efficiency and energy water use efficiency wueene were calculated by using the following formula as suggested by mittal and dhawan 1988 and parihar et al 2013 6 n e t e n e r g y m j h a 1 e n e r g y o u t p u t m j h a 1 e n e r g y i n p u

fertilizer and chemicals diesel use and irrigation over the entire whole wheat growing seasons the combination of the benefits of biomass productivity and grain yield represents the economic outputs financial statistics were performed by considering all aspects of the production costs however it did not include the value of the land the market price for different key inputs was 3 2 kg 1 of the wheat seed and the cost of fertilizer n 2 15 kg 1 k 1 4 kg 1 the cost of human labor involved in the production was 25 unit 1 day 1 based on man days ha 1 referred to from the local minimum support

matlab 7 0 the logistic and richard curves fitting process was performed in origin 9 0 a one way annova analysis was performed to compare the effects of different mulching treatments on the crop growth and biomass productivity an additional principal component analysis pca was applied in r version 3 3 2 to determine the gravel mulching effects on the biomass water use efficiency and indices related to the four main growth periods the data on the biomass and biomass yields energy use and economics for the 3 yr experiment 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 were analyzed to determine the optimal practice from the five experimental treatments in order to obtain higher economic benefits and energy efficiency not only origin r spss 20 0 were also used to conduct the statistical analyses in this study the main effects of different treatments were compared to the least significant difference lsd at the 5 level 3 results 3 1 soil moisture the seasonal dynamics of the soil water content is similar to the change in air and soil temperature and fluctuates greatly after rainfall events a soil volume water content of 20 cm depth will increase with varying degrees depending on the amount of rainfall before then gradually weakening with time it also changed depending on varying gravel mulching practices as shown in fig 2 the gravel mulching practices had a significant impact on the soil volume water content in all stages of the wheat during the entire growing periods the average of the volume water content significantly increased along with an increase in the mulching weight we also compared the mulching effects on the soil volume water content at different depths 20 cm 40 cm and 80 cm since the wheat root absorbs soil moisture mainly in the 0 40 cm depth it can be determined that the soil volume water content at 20 and 40 cm changed greatly whereas at 80 cm it changed little this also provided premise data for computing the water storage change δw and the evapo transpiration et table 1 3 2 crop growth and biomass water use efficiency the eigenvalues of the richard equation were quantified and an anova was implemented for the plant height lai and biomass during the three wheat growing seasons 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 the data used for the analysis are the three year average values of these factors during the entirety of the wheat growing seasons gravel mulching had a significant effect on hxinf and hx1 but had no significant effect on the other parameters of the plant height table 2 h was 4 cm higher under m4 than under ck and hxinf and hx1 under m3 were much lower than for the other four treatments under the five mulching treatments lrmax significantly increased and reached the maximum value under m4 table 3 and lai was 1 6 larger under m4 than under ck similar to the gravel mulching practices the years also had a significant impact on lrmax bxinf significantly decreased under the gravel mulching and reached the minimum value under m4 whereas brmax and bx1 significantly increased table 4 overall the gravel mulching practices significantly shortened the thermal time required for the entire plant height biomass accumulation process and the growth rate of lai gravel mulching had an impact on the thermal time and thus affected the days for different growth stages therefore we calculated the biomass water use efficiency table 1 at the jointing heading filling and harvesting stages and a principal component analysis was performed by considering the variables related to soil properties and crop growth at the four major stages of wheat axis 1 43 19 and axis 2 21 86 accounted for 65 05 57 71 71 78 and 73 78 of the variation at the jointing heading filling and harvesting stages respectively as can be seen in fig 3 a the distributions of the soil water sustainability e w rainfall use ability ep biomass water use efficiency δbio and the three crop growth indices h lai and bio are very close to the m4 treatment followed by m3 m2 m1 while they are farthest to ck gravel mulching makes a positive contribution to the variables induced by soil moisture and crop growth at jointing whereas it did not have a significant impact in the heading and filling stages fig 3b and c due to the abundant rainfall at harvest the favorable variables except for δbio and wue fitted better with the gravel mulching practices particularly under m4 fig 3d the above mentioned indicates that gravel mulching exerted greater impacts on the soil water sustainability crop growth and biomass productivity at the jointing stage rather than at the heading filling and harvesting stages this beneficial effect was more pronounced as the amount of gravel mulched increased 3 3 biomass yield and energy analysis the biomass yield comprised of the biomass production above the ground and grain yield was estimated to range from 12 7 t ha 1 to 15 7 t ha 1 during the 3 yr study of wheat table 5 the pooled average biomass yield in m4 was found to be 2 2 t ha 1 higher than the non mulched treatment ck the results also showed that the larger the amount of the gravel use the greater the increase in the biomass yield compared with the ck the biomass yield were 17 13 4 8 7 and 4 9 higher under the m4 m3 m2 and m1 respectively the additional grain produced effect of gravel mulching resulted in an increase in the net agricultural income and energy output for each year of the evaluation in fig 4 the fertilizer use is the major contributor to the total energy input of the wheat cultivation comprising 52 56 in the five treatments the second largest contributor to the total energy input is chemicals pesticides and herbicides accounting for 20 22 the proportion of human labor was not large 4 11 because there was no irrigation or tillage in this rain fed study the results also showed that the machinery was the least energy demanding input for wheat production due to lower mechanization levels in these treatments during the wheat production process spraying mulching and harvesting were manually operated the grain yield and total energy output are reported in fig 5 the grain yield 5 50 t ha 1 8 36 t ha 1 produced by wheat significant increased by 52 37 64 22 54 and 12 18 under m4 m3 m2 and m1 compared to ck respectively the total output of energy the emerged from both the wheat biomass and grain yield also had significant differences ranging from 16 97 104 mj ha 1 to 20 14 104 mj ha 1 for the five treatments the relevant indices for the energy analysis including the energy productivity energy efficiency net energy and net energy water use efficiency wueene were evaluated and presented in table 5 the energy productivity and energy efficiency in different treatments had a similar trend to the biomass yield productivity the four gravel mulching treatments all significantly increased the pooled average energy productivity compared to ck and the maximum value 0 76 kg mj 1 was recorded in m4 however the difference between the four was small the energy efficiency in the production of wheat was found to range from 9 3 to 10 2 in a 3 yr average showing that the energy output is approximately 10 times greater than the total energy input and in m4 it was 9 3 higher than in the ck treatment the gravel mulching effect on the net energy and its water use efficiency was significant p 0 05 the net energy increased by 19 8 17 5 16 7 and 5 7 under m4 m3 m2 and m1 compared to ck respectively among the five experimental treatments the pooled average maximum wueene 6 8 102 mj ha 1 mm 1 for wheat production was recorded in m4 and wueene was 20 9 14 3 10 2 and 7 1 higher under m4 m3 m2 and m1 compared to ck respectively 3 4 economic analysis the gravel mulching practices has significant p 0 05 effects on the economic behavior of agriculture the net agricultural returns and its water use efficiency in this 3 yr study table 6 the significant difference in the pooled average economic input for the 3 yr wheat planting and field management mainly depended on human labor and the amount of gravel use in the experimental fields however the proportions of human labor machinery and fertilizer in the total economic input in ck were much higher than the other four gravel mulching treatments fig 6 in table 6 the m4 treatment registered the maximum pooled average economic output us 4323 ha 1 net returns us 2607 ha 1 wuenre 9 77 us ha 1 mm 1 and benefit cost bc ratio 1 61 the 3 yr average economic output was improved by 52 21 37 87 22 8 and 12 23 under m4 m3 m2 and m1 compared to ck respectively which was very close to the 53 8 38 20 21 45 and 12 1 improvements for the 3 yr average net returns due to there being no significant differences in the economic inputs gravel mulching significant decreased the evapo transpiration et along with an increase in the amount of gravel use particularly in m4 which received the least water use 277 mm on average the main effects of the gravel mulching practices were significant p 0 05 on the net returns of the water use efficiency wuenre in fig 7 a sharp increase was found for both wuenre and wueene in 2015 2016 for all the treatments due to the drastic decrease et in during that time however for this 3 yr study wueene and wuenre were both significantly affected by gravel mulching with different usage amounts the larger amount of gravel mulching the higher both kinds of water use efficiencies in our 3 yr length study the pooled average wuenre ranged from 6 37 to 9 77 us ha 1 mm 1 and was significantly higher by 53 4 35 2 19 9 and 12 0 under m4 m3 m2 and m1 compared to ck respectively a significant increase in the bc ratio as affected by gravel mulching was recorded in the m4 treatment 1 61 followed by m3 1 58 m1 1 57 and ck 1 57 whereas the minimum value was found in m2 a for pooled 3 yr average 4 discussion 4 1 gravel mulching provides adequate soil moisture and promotes wheat growth the results of this 3 yr study showed the positive effects of gravel mulching on soil moisture and wheat growth which are in agreement with fairbourn 1973 li et al 2004 and schmithals and kühn 2017 it has been proven in numerous studies that gravel mulching acts as a layer with a water holding capacity thus decreasing evaporation and conserving soil moisture gale et al 1993 nachtergaele et al 1998 particularly in a dryland farming system where water limitation is the main constraint affecting crop growth doolittle 1998 li 2003 xie et al 2006 yuan et al 2009 wang et al 2011 lü et al 2013 during the periods of crop growth the soil can stably and evenly supply the water needed for the crop which is conducive to the improvement of crop quality during the different growth stages zhang et al 2009 wang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 these stages are correlated with sunlight capture and conversion evaporation interception and moisture infiltration yuan et al 2009 cerdà 2001 kemper et al 1994 mukherjee et al 2010 in this paper the gravel mulching effects on the plant height h leaf area index lai and biomass productivity varied at different growth stages and were significant in the early stage of wheat growth this was much more likely due to the heavy rainfall that occurred during the late stages of wheat and the mulching effects were weakened with time the wheat biomass productivity was the highest in m4 compared to ck which was dependent on the higher water capacity caused by the larger amount of gravel use the same results were reported by li et al 2018 lü et al 2013 and qiu et al 2015 in our findings the biomass water use efficiency at jointing increased along with an increase in the gravel coverage whereas the results were complex at the other stages as affected by seasonal precipitation and soil evaporation table 1 heavy rainfall at harvesting even caused there to be a negative value of wueδ hence the effective period of gravel mulching referred to in yan et al 2015 needs to be further considered an eigenvalues analysis table 2 4 indicated that gravel mulching shortened the thermal time required by wheat growth and the pca plot fig 3 shows that gravel mulching exerted greater effects on the crop growth mainly at jointing than at the other three stages the above mentioned results indicated that a beneficial mulching effect was more pronounced as the amount of gravel mulch increased additionally the application of gravel mulching can alter the soil moisture and promote nutrients absorption thereby improving the crop growth related indices and ultimately affecting the yield production this is normally a long term process johnston 1986 poesen and lavee 1994 christensen 2001 li et al 2009 qiu et al 2015 however it is not recommended in the non mulched and non arid areas due to the complexity of gravel mulching before the emergence of new technologies that could replace the gravel mulching we only concerned its scientific value and conducted some subplot trails thus more work is required to understand the perennial impact of gravel mulching on soil moisture and wheat growth in dry areas 4 2 gravel mulching improves the biomass yield and energy efficiency the positive effects of gravel mulching on the biomass yield and energy efficiency were evaluated in the present study fig 4 and table 6 it is acknowledged that improving the biomass productivity and enhancing the energy use efficiency is a crucial and scientific way for agriculture to combat the energy crisis and ensure the sustainability of crop production fei and lin 2017 gyamﬁ et al 2018 hence accurate evaluations of the energy inputs outputs and energy use efficiency are of great importance for agriculture in our findings the gravel mulching practices resulted in higher biomass yield compared to ck which agree with many studies bu et al 2013 schmithals and kühn 2017 parihar et al 2017 the energy use in crop production could be affected by different field management practices aghaalikhani et al 2013 in our findings the average energy output produced by the biomass and grain production was much higher in gravel mulching practices than the control treatment and the energy productivity showed a same trend a substantial consumption of anthropogenic resources such as fertilizer and diesel in agriculture affects the financial return to farmers alluvione et al 2011 guo et al 2010 peng et al 2010 in agreement with the results reported by freedman 1980 khan et al 2009 and mandal et al 2002 fertilizer use is the major contributor to the total energy input of crop production followed by chemicals as shown in fig 4 the lower energy input resulted in a higher energy productivity and energy efficiency gravel mulching did not have a significant effect on reducing the energy inputs which were lower than the results of parihar et al 2017 and yuan and peng 2017 however the net energy and energy efficiency recorded in this 3 yr study were higher which was in agreement with chaudhary et al 2017 due to the higher energy output energy efficiency is one of the best indices for the input output energy analysis in crop production for indicating the efficient use of energy gyamﬁ et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 in our study the energy efficiency in m4 was much higher than that in ck which indicated that gravel mulching is an energy efficient field management practice a higher net energy water use efficiency wueene was observed under the gravel mulching practices than under ck a lower water use for wheat production resulted in a higher wueene with the maximum wueene recorded in m4 the aforementioned results suggest that the energy use efficiency per unit water use under gravel mulching could be largely increased in northwest china in fact the role of gravel mulching in saving the energy consumption in our study was inferior to that of film plastic mulching feng et al 2017 or straw biochar additions parihar et al 2017 wang et al 2018a 2018b kannah et al 2018 the higher energy productivity energy efficiency and wueene were primarily attributed to the large increase in energy output rather than a decrease in energy input these discrepancies were presumably due to a higher biomass yield and energy output in our study in comparison to traditional dry farming technology the application of gravel mulching proposed an effective method to achieve a higher energy use efficiency and consume less energy in the arid areas 4 3 gravel mulching improves the economic returns and bc ratio a higher economic returns and the benefit ratio was observed by the application of gravel mulching compared to ck which was mainly due to the higher biomass yield from the optimum supply of water as a crop demand the economic input output and benefit ratio analysis is generally used to evaluate almost all agriculture systems since it is crucial for farmers to obtain greater economic benefits with limited investment which is also great of importance globally lu et al 2010 there are several studies that determine the economic benefits of various agricultural products such as maize by basso et al 2011 and parihar et al 2017 and rice by lu et al 2010 chitawo et al 2017 and ali et al 2017 the aforementioned empirical results of wang et al 2018a 2018b reported that gravel mulching had a significant ecological effect e g mitigation of co2 emissions however de barros et al 2009 have shown that the better the environmental performance of the cropping system is the worse its economic performance is arguments about the relationships that exist among environment resistant energy analysis and economic evaluation are still unsettled huang and odum 1991 brown and herendeen 1996 castellini et al 2006 bastianoni et al 2001 franzese et al 2009 hence more evaluations on the economics aspects are needed considering all aspects of agriculture investment benefits ecological impact etc in our study the economic output consistently and significantly increased with gravel mulching treatments as did the net returns the economic input varied significantly in the various agriculture systems the largest economic input was human labor over 49 of the total followed by machinery over 15 fig 6 whereas chemical fertilizer occupied the largest proportion in rice lu et al 2010 chitawo et al 2017 are in agreement with our results where the labor costs incurred in straw mulching or biochar amended in rice soils occupied the greater portion in our study the differences among the five treatments on the proportions of the economic input were also large which are mainly due to gravel use however the maximum pooled average economic output us 4323 ha 1 in m4 was much higher than the others among the 3 yr study which was mainly dependent on the highest biomass yield although a higher economic input incurred in m4 in addition the proposed maximum economic returns us 2607 ha 1 and bc ratio 1 613 are also indicated in m4 according to the above mentioned results the applications of gravel mulching exerted greater effects on the induced economic input output coefficients and the bc ratio moreover we found a higher net return water use efficiency wuenre under the gravel mulching practices compared to ck that is gravel mulching is an effective way to achieve higher economic benefits with a lower water use in fact there is a constant relationship between the economic cost and energy shift hosier and dowd 1987 both the economic analysis and energy analysis were included in this study to give a better understanding of the gravel mulching effects on energy use efficiency and economic benefits in wheat production the results showed that they both have a consistent upward tendency with an increase in the amount of gravel use among the consecutive 3 yr wheat study this is the first study of this kind conducted in the arid and semi arid region of northwest china hence a further study is required to elucidate the effects of gravel mulching on energy savings and economic feasibility in the areas with similar environment and climate conditions such as gansu province or qinghai province of china 5 conclusions this 3 yr longitudinal study considers the effects of gravel mulching on crop growth the biomass yield economic returns and the energy input output vs their water use efficiency for winter wheat production in the arid area of northwest china we found that the applications of gravel mulching practices in a dryland farming system caused a significant increase in the soil moisture crop growth and biomass yield during the jointing stage the biomass water use efficiency was significantly affected whereas it was not significant during the other stages the net energy energy efficiency and related coefficients were significantly enhanced with an increasing amount of gravel amendments on the soil with the same results identified in the economic analysis including the economic output net returns bc ratio etc in addition both the net energy and net returns vs their water use efficiency showed a consistent upward tendency with an increasing amount of gravel amendments these findings are beneficial for understanding the various aspects of the wheat production system that contributes to changes in the energy and economic performances by applying the gravel mulching practices the presented results indicated that using gravel mulching in the dryland wheat farming system was profitable and energy saving in comparison to ck overall this study provides an effective way to improve the economic returns and enhance the energy efficiency while achieving higher biomass yields of wheat production in the context of water scarcity and the energy crisis in the loess plateau of china however the long term effects of gravel mulching need to be further studied in the studied area acknowledgements this work was jointly supported by the national 863 research program 2013aa102904 the

10972,gravel mulching has long been used to conserve water and enhance crop yield in the loess plateau of china the climate change and water scarcity in the loess plateau of china may have an impact on the phenological changes of plants thus affecting the growth process biomass yield energy input output and economics of crops however focuses on the effects of gravel mulching on energy input output and agricultural economics are less therefore a 3 year field study of winter wheat was conducted with different gravel mulching practices in the loess plateau china the five treatments are zero mulch ck 25 surface gravel mulch m1 50 surface gravel mulch m2 75 surface gravel mulch m3 and 100 surface gravel mulch m4 respectively in addition a set of indicator systems based on energy economics and crop growth were proposed to better understand the effects of gravel mulching compared with the ck treatment the gravel mulching treatments significantly prolonged the thermal time required for the plant growth and biomass accumulation and increased the growth rate of the leaf area index lai and ultimately improved the winter wheat yield this effect was particularly evident during the jointing period of winter wheat the results also showed that gravel mulching significantly increased energy use efficiency and net returns in economics the four gravel mulching treatments significantly increased the biomass yield 4 9 17 3 higher than the ck net returns 12 1 53 8 higher than the ck and net returns water use efficiency wuenre 12 0 53 4 higher than the ck accordingly the energy productivity net energy and net energy water use efficiency wueene were 2 2 8 2 5 7 19 8 and 7 1 20 9 respectively higher than the ck under m1 m4 overall gravel mulching exerted positive influences on the economic returns and the energy use vs their water use efficiency thus gravel mulching is not only an effective way to improve crop growth and yield but it also has the potential to improve economic benefits and energy efficiency within the context of climate change and water crises in the loess plateau china keywords energy economic water use efficiency gravel mulching 1 introduction food security is a major issue related to climate change and the water crisis and ultimately affects the national economic and social stability in the arid regions of northwest china with arid regions covering approximately 30 of the land in china dryland farming systems may exert a long term effect and are therefore indispensable for food production limited water resources are the major constraints in crop production rockström et al 2007 especially when combined with low temperatures and declining precipitation the biological processes in arid and semiarid regions are mainly controlled by water and its scarcity fließbach et al 1994 so the spatial and temporal distributions of water have important effects one of the objectives for innovating agricultural practices is to increase the crop production with less water gong et al 2017 i e improve water use efficiency in different growth stages or throughout the entire growing period a chinese proverb states although there are several buckets of jade it is not as good as a millet the shortage of water resources and energy have become the crisis faced by the world the challenge of food security is particularly serious in the loess plateau of northwest china it is worth of further study to ensure the biomass productivity through optimizing field management measures within the context of energy and water crises parihar et al 2018 in an attempt to offset the influence of water scarcity and low temperature gravel mulching acting as one of the most important traditional techniques has been used over for 300 years by farmers in the dry farmlands of northwest china li 2003 the benefits of surface gravel mulching are a result of improving the soil water heat status such as increasing the topsoil water storage li et al 2000 lü et al 2013 li et al 2018 crop growth nachtergaele et al 1998 xie et al 2006 doolittle 1998 and yield related indices including the leaf area index lai plant height total biomass productivity crop yield and water use efficiency wue bu et al 2013 wang et al 2018a 2018b in northwest china the productivity of intensive wheat cropping systems plays an important role in agriculture xue et al 2017 hartmann et al 2014 providing food rations to more than 120 million peoples with the demand of wheat expected to steadily grow however poor precipitation and a deteriorated ecological environment are likely to reduce the yield of crops and threaten the food supply in arid and semiarid regions li et al 2004 lobell et al 2008 to meet the rising demand continuing to improve dryland agriculture with different mulching practices may be an optimized method of guaranteeing food security gravel mulching technology has been widely verified by numerous researchers as a promising and effective solution to reduce evaporation and improve crop production in the loess plateau of china the applications of gravel mulching will possibly reclaim not only the benefits of the mulching practice in terms of altering the soil s water heat balance and increasing the biomass yield but also both the potential to increase the economic returns and energy use efficiency however it is regrettable that surface gravel are easy to mix with soil and hard to removed therefore so it is not recommended in the non gravel mulched areas the value of this traditional technology did not lie in its direct application or suitability for the rest of the world gale et al 1993 the development of field management technologies with the maximum crop productivity and a higher use efficiency of water and energy is needed for the current focus on sustainable agriculture pratibha et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 published studies have shown that zero tillage could maintain and improve the soil s physical properties bergamaschi et al 2010 parihar et al 2016 and the adoption of conservation agriculture based practices requires the least amount of energy in farm operation and enhances the biomass productivity with lower production costs and less use of natural resources compared to other systems lichter et al 2008 no till with gravel mulching is conducive to the aggregation of the soil structure where the surface gravel acts as a protector reducing evaporation and enhancing the system s ability to conserve water thus improving the crop growth and biomass yield which may result in a higher biomass water use efficiency an enhanced biomass yield and multilevel water use efficiency have been observed in wheat and maize gong et al 2017 wang et al 2018a 2018b however knowledge about the effects of different mulching practices on energy use and economics is lacking accompanying the fast increase of agriculture the consumption of chemical fertilizers electricity the total power of agricultural machinery diesel oil and pesticides have risen greatly zhang et al 2015 according to bureau of statistics of china these agricultural supplies consume significant amounts of energy and induce a rapid increase in the energy crisis saad et al 2016 along with a growing use of fertilizers and agro chemicals and irrigation though these practices help crops fight pests reduce competition from weeds and improve the productivity and economic benefit ratio of farmland huang et al 2016 huang and zou 2018 the intensification of agricultural practices has also led to an excessive consumption of energy energy plays an important role for a nation as it is required in industries agriculture and all aspects of social development it is therefore common sense that enhancing the energy and environmental efficiency is a crucial and scientiﬁc way for the world to combat the energy challenge fei and lin 2017 moreover an increasing economy also means a shift in energy arabatzis and malesios 2011 hosier and dowd 1987 gyamﬁ et al 2018 the economic analyses of gravel mulch which are characterized by a high crop productivity ali et al 2017 chaudhary et al 2017 mousavi avval et al 2011 therefore need to be demonstrated hence a scientific evaluation that including both the energy use efficiency and economics is needed which is of great importance globally however few advanced studies are focused on the energy consumption and the economic input output analysis of wheat cropping systems in the study region as affected by gravel mulching this study therefore investigated the water use crop growth economic input output and energy use of rain fed wheat in the arid and semiarid region of northwest china with five different gravel mulching practices the aim of this study was to determine whether dry land farmers can expect to receive a satisfactory income from their investment and to identify different aspects of the production system that can contribute to changes in the economic and energy performances of using this mulching management therefore the objectives of this study were i to calculate the values of eigenvalues of the richard equation and make an anova for the leaf are index lai plant height h and biomass bio during the entire winter wheat growing seasons ii to evaluate the economics of winter wheat production and water use efficiency under different

systems in the loess plateau of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and soil the field experiment was conducted during the period of oct 2013 to june 2016 at the experimental station of water saving irrigation of northwest a f university which is located in the yangling district of northwest china 34 20 n 108 24 e 521 m a s l the site is a typical rainfed area in the loess plateau of china the local climate is classified as semiarid temperate continental monsoon it is prone to drought in the early stages of wheat growth song et al 2017 the mean annual rainfall is approximately 578 mm the average annual temperature is 13 0 c the mean annual pan evaporation exceeds 990 mm and the mean annual sunshine duration is 2100 2200 h due to an uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation the winter is cold and experiences drought the data of air temperature and daily precipitation were collected from a nearby weather station fig 1 that is close to the experimental field wang et al 2018a 2018b the total precipitations were 291 2 mm 253 4 mm and 203 4 mm for the rotation cycle of 2013 2014 cycle 1 2014 2015 cycle 2 and 2015 2016 cycle 3 respectively the soil is earth cumuli orthic anthrosols with 8 sand 74 silt and 18 clay a bulk density of 1 45 g cm 3 a ph h2o of 8 3 organic matter of 8 1 g kg 1 a total n of 1 0 g kg 1 an olsen p of 20 9 mg kg 1 and an available k of 187 0 mg kg 1 2 2 experimental details and crop management the treatments were set up in the field where the soil samples were taken the experiment was laid out in a randomized complete plot design with five treatments including zero mulch ck zero mulch ck 25 surface gravel mulching m1 50 surface gravel mulching m2 75 surface gravel mulching m3 and 100 surface gravel mulching m4 respectively the gravel used was the same size but differed in weight the 5 treatment combinations with a subplot size of 15 m2 5 m length 3 m width were replicated thrice for all three years of study before the start of the experiment the experimental area was plowed and paved each plot was wrapped with an 8 μm thick polyethylene plastic film 1 m deep along a vertical profile of the ridge edge preventing lateral infiltration of the soil moisture the individual plots were separated by 0 3 m spacing for the four gravel mulched fields gravel 2 4 cm in size passing through a 4 cm sieve was evenly laid by hand after planting the wheat and the mulch was not disturbed throughout the study periods since it is easy to mix with soil gale et al 1993 the gravel was removed once the crop harvest was completed the fields were completely rain fed with no irrigation so the plants relied entirely on precipitation and soil water the same tillage cultivation were done in the control plots as we did in the mulched plots throughout the study periods during the 3 year experimental period three replicate ﬁelds were planted with winter wheat cv xiaoyan 22 at a seeding density of 187 5 kg ha 1 the seasons for the winter wheat were october 19 2013 june 7 2014 october 17 2014 june 5 2015 and october 21 2015 june 7 2016 referring to the local farmers cultivation habits a uniform dose of fertilizers was applied at a rate of 150 kg n and 100 kg p2o5 ha 1 yr 1 with a urea source as an n fertilizer and calcium superphosphate as p for all treatments to manage weeds and insects agricultural chemicals herbicide glyphosate and pesticide were sprayed at 14 8 kg ha 1 in the plots throughout the entire growing periods in addition one hand weeding was also performed moreover maize was planted at intervals between the two wheat planting seasons wheat and maize straw were removed after harvest and then the soil was tilled using manual rotary tillage to a depth of 15 cm 2 3 measurements and calculations 2 3 1 biomass productivity and wheat growth eigenvalues during the wheat growing periods we monitored the plant height h using a scale ruler and the leaf area index lai in rows of wheat using a canopy analysis instrument sunscan 2000 delta t co uk the above ground biomass was estimated at the main growing periods of winter wheat ten sampled plants total leaves and stover were heated at 105 c for 30 min and then dried at a constant temperature 75 c the measured weight was then determined to be the biomass productivity at harvest the total biomass productivity and wheat yield t ha 1 were estimated from a 1 m2 area marked with coil beforehand in the middle of each plot using the oven drying method and do the threshing by hand the eigenvalues of the richard equation were quantified and an anova was implemented for the plant height h and biomass during the three winter wheat growing seasons the accumulated temperature of each sampling period was calculated by using the following formula as suggested by wang et al 2015 and johnen et al 2012 the richard equation is a four parameter nonlinear equation that includes a series of s curves in this study the independent variable x is the accumulated temperature which is expressed by the growing degree day gdd and the dependent variable is the plant height or biomass expressed as 1 y a 1 e b c x 1 d where a b c and d are the constant parameters and a is the upper limit value of the plant height hmax or biomass bmax deriving eq 2 the growth rate gr of the plant height and biomass accumulation are 2 g r d y d x a c e b c x d e b c x 1 d 1 d y c 1 y a d d deriving eq 2 and letting it be 0 the accumulated temperature at the maximum growth rate xinf is obtained thus the maximum gr and the accumulated temperature when the plant height or biomass accumulation entered the fast growing period x1 are obtained detailed descriptions can be found in li et al 2017 darro and baker 1990 who reported that the plant growth ends when the plant height and biomass reached 95 of the maximum values thus the accumulated temperature was obtained when the growth process ended xmax hmax hxmax hrmax hxinf and hx1 are the maximum h the accumulated temperature when h reached the maximum value the maximum growth rate the accumulated temperature when the growth rate reached the maximum value and the accumulated temperature when entering the fast growing period respectively the same interpretation applies for bmax bxmax brmax bxinf and bx1 the leaf area index lai of crops gradually increases with time which is in accordance with the logistic model in the early growing periods but decreases due to the leaf senescence in the late period the measured lai and accumulated temperature data were fitted with the modified logistic curve reported by wang 1986 expressed as 3 y a 1 e x p b x 2 c x d where y is the lai x is the gdd a b c d are the parameters and a no longer has the meaning of the maximum lai derived eq 3 and the rate equation of the change of the lai was obtained li et al 2017 4 y a exp b x 2 c x d c 2 b x exp b x 2 c x d 1 2 for the eigenvalues of the lai growth process laimax lxmax laiavg lrmax and lxinf are the maximum lai the accumulated temperature when lai reached the maximum value the average lai the growth rate when lai reached the maximum value and the accumulated temperature when entering the fast growing period respectively 2 3 2 soil moisture and evapotranspiration the soil moisture content was determined using a trime tdr device trime pico iph approximately once every 7 d during the entirety of the crop growth seasons in addition we also additionally monitored the soil moisture content when rainfall occurred fig 2 shows the soil moisture content at the top 20 cm 40 cm and 80 cm layer respectively under different mulching treatments during the winter wheat growth periods from 2013 to 2016 the soil moisture in the 0 100 cm soil profile in each plot was calculated as the total soil water storage w during the wheat growing seasons then et could be determined using the field water balance equation as follows allen et al 1998 sun et al 2010 pradhan et al 2014 5 e t p i c r d δ w where et is the evapo transpiration mm p is the effective precipitation mm i is the irrigation mm c is the capillary rise mm r is the runoff mm d is the deep percolation mm and δw is the change of water storage in the profile mm there was no runoff r from the experimental plots as they were bunded up to a sufficient height 40 cm height and no cases of bound overflow were observed during the study period as the groundwater level was relatively low 8 10 m in depth the soil moisture at the 0 200 cm depth were monitored in this study deep percolation below a 200 cm profile d was assumed to be negligible chen et al 2010 muniandy et al 2016 parihar et al 2017 2 3 3 energy and economic analysis the energy analysis presented in this study compared the energy input output and its efficiency between the five different mulching treatments the primary data collected on various inputs the energy requirements and the management practice in each of the winter wheat production stages from sowing to maturity were used to determine and quantify the energy consumption generally the input items referred to direct energy use and indirect energy use the direct energy use was comprised of the diesel water and human labor required to perform arable farming related to crop production processes such as land preparation irrigation and spraying pesticides the indirect energy use included energy embedded in the production processes of farm machinery fertilizers pesticides and seeds zhang et al 2015 the energy output consisted of the biomass grain economic yield and wheat straw moreover the loss or waste resulting from natural calamities and pests was negligible the energy equivalents used to estimate the energy inputs and outputs were referred to in the published studies reported by yuan and peng 2017 and zhang et al 2015 the energy use indices including the net energy energy productivity energy efficiency and energy water use efficiency wueene were calculated by using the following formula as suggested by mittal and dhawan 1988 and parihar et al 2013 6 n e t e n e r g y m j h a 1 e n e r g y o u t p u t m j h a 1 e n e r g y i n p u

fertilizer and chemicals diesel use and irrigation over the entire whole wheat growing seasons the combination of the benefits of biomass productivity and grain yield represents the economic outputs financial statistics were performed by considering all aspects of the production costs however it did not include the value of the land the market price for different key inputs was 3 2 kg 1 of the wheat seed and the cost of fertilizer n 2 15 kg 1 k 1 4 kg 1 the cost of human labor involved in the production was 25 unit 1 day 1 based on man days ha 1 referred to from the local minimum support price the wheat purchase price 4 72 kg 1 supported by the agriculture related policy fixed by the chinese government was used to calculate the net economic returns bc ratio and wuenre expressed as

matlab 7 0 the logistic and richard curves fitting process was performed in origin 9 0 a one way annova analysis was performed to compare the effects of different mulching treatments on the crop growth and biomass productivity an additional principal component analysis pca was applied in r version 3 3 2 to determine the gravel mulching effects on the biomass water use efficiency and indices related to the four main growth periods the data on the biomass and biomass yields energy use and economics for the 3 yr experiment 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 were analyzed to determine the optimal practice from the five experimental treatments in order to obtain higher economic benefits and energy efficiency not only origin r spss 20 0 were also used to conduct the statistical analyses in this study the main effects of different treatments were compared to the least significant difference lsd at the 5 level 3 results 3 1 soil moisture the seasonal dynamics of the soil water content is similar to the change in air and soil temperature and fluctuates greatly after rainfall events a soil volume water content of 20 cm depth will increase with varying degrees depending on the amount of rainfall before then gradually weakening with time it also changed depending on varying gravel mulching practices as shown in fig 2 the gravel mulching practices had a significant impact on the soil volume water content in all stages of the wheat during the entire growing periods the average of the volume water content significantly increased along with an increase in the mulching weight we also compared the mulching effects on the soil volume water content at different depths 20 cm 40 cm and 80 cm since the wheat root absorbs soil moisture mainly in the 0 40 cm depth it can be determined that the soil volume water content at 20 and 40 cm changed greatly whereas at 80 cm it changed little this also provided premise data for computing the water storage change δw and the evapo transpiration et table 1 3 2 crop growth and biomass water use efficiency the eigenvalues of the richard equation were quantified and an anova was implemented for the plant height lai and biomass during the three wheat growing seasons 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 the data used for the analysis are the three year average values of these factors during the entirety of the wheat growing seasons gravel mulching had a significant effect on hxinf and hx1 but had no significant effect on the other parameters of the plant height table 2 h was 4 cm higher under m4 than under ck and hxinf and hx1 under m3 were much lower than for the other four treatments under the five mulching treatments lrmax significantly increased and reached the maximum value under m4 table 3 and lai was 1 6 larger under m4 than under ck similar to the gravel mulching practices the years also had a significant impact on lrmax bxinf significantly decreased under the gravel mulching and reached the minimum value under m4 whereas brmax and bx1 significantly increased table 4 overall the gravel mulching practices significantly shortened the thermal time required for the entire plant height biomass accumulation process and the growth rate of lai gravel mulching had an impact on the thermal time and thus affected the days for different growth stages therefore we calculated the biomass water use efficiency table 1 at the jointing heading filling and harvesting stages and a principal component analysis was performed by considering the variables related to soil properties and crop growth at the four major stages of wheat axis 1 43 19 and axis 2 21 86 accounted for 65 05 57 71 71 78 and 73 78 of the variation at the jointing heading filling and harvesting stages respectively as can be seen in fig 3 a the distributions of the soil water sustainability e w rainfall use ability ep biomass water use efficiency δbio and the three crop growth indices h lai and bio are very close to the m4 treatment followed by m3 m2 m1 while they are farthest to ck gravel mulching makes a positive contribution to the variables induced by soil moisture and crop growth at jointing whereas it did not have a significant impact in the heading and filling stages fig 3b and c due to the abundant rainfall at harvest the favorable variables except for δbio and wue fitted better with the gravel mulching practices particularly under m4 fig 3d the above mentioned indicates that gravel mulching exerted greater impacts on the soil water sustainability crop growth and biomass productivity at the jointing stage rather than at the heading filling and harvesting stages this beneficial effect was more pronounced as the amount of gravel mulched increased 3 3 biomass yield and energy analysis the biomass yield comprised of the biomass production above the ground and grain yield was estimated to range from 12 7 t ha 1 to 15 7 t ha 1 during the 3 yr study of wheat table 5 the pooled average biomass yield in m4 was found to be 2 2 t ha 1 higher than the non mulched treatment ck the results also showed that the larger the amount of the gravel use the greater the increase in the biomass yield compared with the ck the biomass yield were 17 13 4 8 7 and 4 9 higher under the m4 m3 m2 and m1 respectively the additional grain produced effect of gravel mulching resulted in an increase in the net agricultural income and energy output for each year of the evaluation in fig 4 the fertilizer use is the major contributor to the total energy input of the wheat cultivation comprising 52 56 in the five treatments the second largest contributor to the total energy input is chemicals pesticides and herbicides accounting for 20 22 the proportion of human labor was not large 4 11 because there was no irrigation or tillage in this rain fed study the results also showed that the machinery was the least energy demanding input for wheat production due to lower mechanization levels in these treatments during the wheat production process spraying mulching and harvesting were manually operated the grain yield and total energy output are reported in fig 5 the grain yield 5 50 t ha 1 8 36 t ha 1 produced by wheat significant increased by 52 37 64 22 54 and 12 18 under m4 m3 m2 and m1 compared to ck respectively the total output of energy the emerged from both the wheat biomass and grain yield also had significant differences ranging from 16 97 104 mj ha 1 to 20 14 104 mj ha 1 for the five treatments the relevant indices for the energy analysis including the energy productivity energy efficiency net energy and net energy water use efficiency wueene were evaluated and presented in table 5 the energy productivity and energy efficiency in different treatments had a similar trend to the biomass yield productivity the four gravel mulching treatments all significantly increased the pooled average energy productivity compared to ck and the maximum value 0 76 kg mj 1 was recorded in m4 however the difference between the four was small the energy efficiency in the production of wheat was found to range from 9 3 to 10 2 in a 3 yr average showing that the energy output is approximately 10 times greater than the total energy input and in m4 it was 9 3 higher than in the ck treatment the gravel mulching effect on the net energy and its water use efficiency was significant p 0 05 the net energy increased by 19 8 17 5 16 7 and 5 7 under m4 m3 m2 and m1 compared to ck respectively among the five experimental treatments the pooled average maximum wueene 6 8 102 mj ha 1 mm 1 for wheat production was recorded in m4 and wueene was 20 9 14 3 10 2 and 7 1 higher under m4 m3 m2 and m1 compared to ck respectively 3 4 economic analysis the gravel mulching practices has significant p 0 05 effects on the economic behavior of agriculture the net agricultural returns and its water use efficiency in this 3 yr study table 6 the significant difference in the pooled average economic input for the 3 yr wheat planting and field management mainly depended on human labor and the amount of gravel use in the experimental fields however the proportions of human labor machinery and fertilizer in the total economic input in ck were much higher than the other four gravel mulching treatments fig 6 in table 6 the m4 treatment registered the maximum pooled average economic output us 4323 ha 1 net returns us 2607 ha 1 wuenre 9 77 us ha 1 mm 1 and benefit cost bc ratio 1 61 the 3 yr average economic output was improved by 52 21 37 87 22 8 and 12 23 under m4 m3 m2 and m1 compared to ck respectively which was very close to the 53 8 38 20 21 45 and 12 1 improvements for the 3 yr average net returns due to there being no significant differences in the economic inputs gravel mulching significant decreased the evapo transpiration et along with an increase in the amount of gravel use particularly in m4 which received the least water use 277 mm on average the main effects of the gravel mulching practices were significant p 0 05 on the net returns of the water use efficiency wuenre in fig 7 a sharp increase was found for both wuenre and wueene in 2015 2016 for all the treatments due to the drastic decrease et in during that time however for this 3 yr study wueene and wuenre were both significantly affected by gravel mulching with different usage amounts the larger amount of gravel mulching the higher both kinds of water use efficiencies in our 3 yr length study the pooled average wuenre ranged from 6 37 to 9 77 us ha 1 mm 1 and was significantly higher by 53 4 35 2 19 9 and 12 0 under m4 m3 m2 and m1 compared to ck respectively a significant increase in the bc ratio as affected by gravel mulching was recorded in the m4 treatment 1 61 followed by m3 1 58 m1 1 57 and ck 1 57 whereas the minimum value was found in m2 a for pooled 3 yr average 4 discussion 4 1 gravel mulching provides adequate soil moisture and promotes wheat growth the results of this 3 yr study showed the positive effects of gravel mulching on soil moisture and wheat growth which are in agreement with fairbourn 1973 li et al 2004 and schmithals and kühn 2017 it has been proven in numerous studies that gravel mulching acts as a layer with a water holding capacity thus decreasing evaporation and conserving soil moisture gale et al 1993 nachtergaele et al 1998 particularly in a dryland farming system where water limitation is the main constraint affecting crop growth doolittle 1998 li 2003 xie et al 2006 yuan et al 2009 wang et al 2011 lü et al 2013 during the periods of crop growth the soil can stably and evenly supply the water needed for the crop which is conducive to the improvement of crop quality during the different growth stages zhang et al 2009 wang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 these stages are correlated with sunlight capture and conversion evaporation interception and moisture infiltration yuan et al 2009 cerdà 2001 kemper et al 1994 mukherjee et al 2010 in this paper the gravel mulching effects on the plant height h leaf area index lai and biomass productivity varied at different growth stages and were significant in the early stage of wheat growth this was much more likely due to the heavy rainfall that occurred during the late stages of wheat and the mulching effects were weakened with time the wheat biomass productivity was the highest in m4 compared to ck which was dependent on the higher water capacity caused by the larger amount of gravel use the same results were reported by li et al 2018 lü et al 2013 and qiu et al 2015 in our findings the biomass water use efficiency at jointing increased along with an increase in the gravel coverage whereas the results were complex at the other stages as affected by seasonal precipitation and soil evaporation table 1 heavy rainfall at harvesting even caused there to be a negative value of wueδ hence the effective period of gravel mulching referred to in yan et al 2015 needs to be further considered an eigenvalues analysis table 2 4 indicated that gravel mulching shortened the thermal time required by wheat growth and the pca plot fig 3 shows that gravel mulching exerted greater effects on the crop growth mainly at jointing than at the other three stages the above mentioned results indicated that a beneficial mulching effect was more pronounced as the amount of gravel mulch increased additionally the application of gravel mulching can alter the soil moisture and promote nutrients absorption thereby improving the crop growth related indices and ultimately affecting the yield production this is normally a long term process johnston 1986 poesen and lavee 1994 christensen 2001 li et al 2009 qiu et al 2015 however it is not recommended in the non mulched and non arid areas due to the complexity of gravel mulching before the emergence of new technologies that could replace the gravel mulching we only concerned its scientific value and conducted some subplot trails thus more work is required to understand the perennial impact of gravel mulching on soil moisture and wheat growth in dry areas 4 2 gravel mulching improves the biomass yield and energy efficiency the positive effects of gravel mulching on the biomass yield and energy efficiency were evaluated in the present study fig 4 and table 6 it is acknowledged that improving the biomass productivity and enhancing the energy use efficiency is a crucial and scientific way for agriculture to combat the energy crisis and ensure the sustainability of crop production fei and lin 2017 gyamﬁ et al 2018 hence accurate evaluations of the energy inputs outputs and energy use efficiency are of great importance for agriculture in our findings the gravel mulching practices resulted in higher biomass yield compared to ck which agree with many studies bu et al 2013 schmithals and kühn 2017 parihar et al 2017 the energy use in crop production could be affected by different field management practices aghaalikhani et al 2013 in our findings the average energy output produced by the biomass and grain production was much higher in gravel mulching practices than the control treatment and the energy productivity showed a same trend a substantial consumption of anthropogenic resources such as fertilizer and diesel in agriculture affects the financial return to farmers alluvione et al 2011 guo et al 2010 peng et al 2010 in agreement with the results reported by freedman 1980 khan et al 2009 and mandal et al 2002 fertilizer use is the major contributor to the total energy input of crop production followed by chemicals as shown in fig 4 the lower energy input resulted in a higher energy productivity and energy efficiency gravel mulching did not have a significant effect on reducing the energy inputs which were lower than the results of parihar et al 2017 and yuan and peng 2017 however the net energy and energy efficiency recorded in this 3 yr study were higher which was in agreement with chaudhary et al 2017 due to the higher energy output energy efficiency is one of the best indices for the input output energy analysis in crop production for indicating the efficient use of energy gyamﬁ et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 in our study the energy efficiency in m4 was much higher than that in ck which indicated that gravel mulching is an energy efficient field management practice a higher net energy water use efficiency wueene was observed under the gravel mulching practices than under ck a lower water use for wheat production resulted in a higher wueene with the maximum wueene recorded in m4 the aforementioned results suggest that the energy use efficiency per unit water use under gravel mulching could be largely increased in northwest china in fact the role of gravel mulching in saving the energy consumption in our study was inferior to that of film plastic mulching feng et al 2017 or straw biochar additions parihar et al 2017 wang et al 2018a 2018b kannah et al 2018 the higher energy productivity energy efficiency and wueene were primarily attributed to the large increase in energy output rather than a decrease in energy input these discrepancies were presumably due to a higher biomass yield and energy output in our study in comparison to traditional dry farming technology the application of gravel mulching proposed an effective method to achieve a higher energy use efficiency and consume less energy in the arid areas 4 3 gravel mulching improves the economic returns and bc ratio a higher economic returns and the benefit ratio was observed by the application of gravel mulching compared to ck which was mainly due to the higher biomass yield from the optimum supply of water as a crop demand the economic input output and benefit ratio analysis is generally used to evaluate almost all agriculture systems since it is crucial for farmers to obtain greater economic benefits with limited investment which is also great of importance globally lu et al 2010 there are several studies that determine the economic benefits of various agricultural products such as maize by basso et al 2011 and parihar et al 2017 and rice by lu et al 2010 chitawo et al 2017 and ali et al 2017 the aforementioned empirical results of wang et al 2018a 2018b reported that gravel mulching had a significant ecological effect e g mitigation of co2 emissions however de barros et al 2009 have shown that the better the environmental performance of the cropping system is the worse its economic performance is arguments about the relationships that exist among environment resistant energy analysis and economic evaluation are still unsettled huang and odum 1991 brown and herendeen 1996 castellini et al 2006 bastianoni et al 2001 franzese et al 2009 hence more evaluations on the economics aspects are needed considering all aspects of agriculture investment benefits ecological impact etc in our study the economic output consistently and significantly increased with gravel mulching treatments as did the net returns the economic input varied significantly in the various agriculture systems the largest economic input was human labor over 49 of the total followed by machinery over 15 fig 6 whereas chemical fertilizer occupied the largest proportion in rice lu et al 2010 chitawo et al 2017 are in agreement with our results where the labor costs incurred in straw mulching or biochar amended in rice soils occupied the greater portion in our study the differences among the five treatments on the proportions of the economic input were also large which are mainly due to gravel use however the maximum pooled average economic output us 4323 ha 1 in m4 was much higher than the others among the 3 yr study which was mainly dependent on the highest biomass yield although a higher economic input incurred in m4 in addition the proposed maximum economic returns us 2607 ha 1 and bc ratio 1 613 are also indicated in m4 according to the above mentioned results the applications of gravel mulching exerted greater effects on the induced economic input output coefficients and the bc ratio moreover we found a higher net return water use efficiency wuenre under the gravel mulching practices compared to ck that is gravel mulching is an effective way to achieve higher economic benefits with a lower water use in fact there is a constant relationship between the economic cost and energy shift hosier and dowd 1987 both the economic analysis and energy analysis were included in this study to give a better understanding of the gravel mulching effects on energy use efficiency and economic benefits in wheat production the results showed that they both have a consistent upward tendency with an increase in the amount of gravel use among the consecutive 3 yr wheat study this is the first study of this kind conducted in the arid and semi arid region of northwest china hence a further study is required to elucidate the effects of gravel mulching on energy savings and economic feasibility in the areas with similar environment and climate conditions such as gansu province or qinghai province of china 5 conclusions this 3 yr longitudinal study considers the effects of gravel mulching on crop growth the biomass yield economic returns and the energy input output vs their water use efficiency for winter wheat production in the arid area of northwest china we found that the applications of gravel mulching practices in a dryland farming system caused a significant increase in the soil moisture crop growth and biomass yield during the jointing stage the biomass water use efficiency was significantly affected whereas it was not significant during the other stages the net energy energy efficiency and related coefficients were significantly enhanced with an increasing amount of gravel amendments on the soil with the same results identified in the economic analysis including the economic output net returns bc ratio etc in addition both the net energy and net returns vs their water use efficiency showed a consistent upward tendency with an increasing amount of gravel amendments these findings are beneficial for understanding the various aspects of the wheat production system that contributes to changes in the energy and economic performances by applying the gravel mulching practices the presented results indicated that using gravel mulching in the dryland wheat farming system was profitable and energy saving in comparison to ck overall this study provides an effective way to improve the economic returns and enhance the energy efficiency while achieving higher biomass yields of wheat production in the context of water scarcity and the energy crisis in the loess plateau of china however the long term effects of gravel mulching need to be further studied in the studied area acknowledgements this work was jointly supported by the national 863 research program 2013aa102904 the

precipitation during two growing seasons based on the analysis of rainfall data in the last 67 years 1951 2018 the 2016 2017 winter wheat season was considered as relatively dry whereas the 2017 2018 season considered normal rainfall was observed to play a key role in regulating the irrigation scheduling and total amount of irrigation water used therefore in the 2018 winter wheat season s and d have one irrigation schedule whereas f has two less irrigation schedules compared with the 2017 winter wheat season table 2 at the same irrigation level 3 2 effects of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods on n2o emission n2o emission showed a clear seasonal trend in all irrigation treatments in both seasons the trend of the effect of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods on the n2o flux in response to fertilization was identical in the entire study fig 2 fertilizer application was carried out on jd 98 in 2017 and jd 104 in 2018 followed by irrigation the highest daily average n2o pulse in response to fertilization accompanied by irrigation was obtained in the f at 70 fc treatment 330 2 3 94 and 332 7 1 2 μg n2o m 2 h 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively while the lowest peak flux was measured in d at 50 fc in both growing seasons 168 1 1 45 154 1 6 99 μg n2o m 2 h 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively in response to fertilization in 2017 at 50 fc the n2o peak flux is significantly lower fig 2a compared with 60 fc fig 2b and 70 fc fig 2c while d d1 d2 and d3 had substantially lower n2o peak flux compared with s s1 s2 and s3 and f f1 f2 and f3 similarly in 2018 50 fc fig 2d had notably lower n2o peak flux in response to fertilization compared with 60 fc fig 2e and 70 fc fig 2f moreover d d1 d2 and d3 had substantially lower n2o peak flux in 2018 compared with s s1 s2 and s3 and f f1 f2 and f3 in this study apart from the fertilization effect irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods also influenced the n2o peak pulse significantly the cumulative n2o amount ranged from 0 49 d1 to 1 10 f3 kg ha 1 and 0 63 d1 f1 to 1 4 f3 kg ha 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively table 3 the cumulative n2o emissions measured were lowest in the d followed by the s and f treatments corresponding to their irrigation scheduling except in 2018 at 50 fc where no significant difference was measured in all irrigation methods the trend was similar in the entire study cumulative n2o emissions were highest in f followed by s and d the results illustrated that as the irrigation scheduling level increased higher cumulative n2o emissions were produced and the emissions were minimum at the least irrigation scheduling 50 fc level treatment moreover rainfall also contributed to the higher cumulative n2o emissions in the 2018 winter wheat season the current results showed that adopting d at 50 60 or 70 fc remarkably mitigates the n2o emissions compared with s and f from winter wheat fields in the ncp variance analysis on irrigation scheduling irrigation methods and interaction of irrigation scheduling irrigation methods showed a remarkable p 0 001 effect on cumulative n2o emissions in the entire study repeated measures analysis of variance of different sampling dates the interaction between different sampling dates irrigation scheduling and sampling dates irrigation methods all highly significantly p 0 001 affected the n2o emissions in the entire study 3 3 grain yield the grain yield in the study varied from 8 29 t ha 1 f1 to 9 67 t ha 1 d2 and 7 12 t ha 1 f1 to 9 72 t ha 1 d2 in 2017 and 2018 respectively table 4 the maximum grain yield was recorded in the d followed by s and f in entire study duration whereas the grain yield decreased at lowest irrigation scheduling 50 fc and highest irrigation scheduling 70 fc treatments the optimum grain yield was obtained by irrigating d at 60 fc treatment in this study the grain yield of d compared with s and f and grain yield at 60 fc compared with 50 and 70 fc was significantly higher in the entire study irrigation scheduling irrigation methods and the interaction of irrigation scheduling irrigation methods substantially p 0 001 influence the grain yield in both wheat seasons 3 4 water use efficiency nearly all highest wue values were observed at medium irrigation scheduling level 60 fc and the lowest values at higher level 70 fc under all irrigation methods table 5 the maximum wue was measured in d2 2 0 and 1 92 kg m 3 in 2017 and 2018 respectively and minimum wue was obtained in f3 1 78 and 1 65 kg m 3 in 2017 and 2018 respectively in the entire study in 2017 there was no notable difference measured in the wue of d and s at 50 and 60 fc and between s and f at 70 fc in 2018 there was no significant higher wue measured in s and f at all irrigation levels and this can be attributed to the no substantial difference in the grain yield at 60 and 70 fc while at 50 fc s received a higher amount of water 30 mm compared with f table 2 in 2017 the wue of d and s and irrigation scheduling of 50 and 60 fc there was no significant difference while in 2018 the wue of s and f was identical the wue of s d and f was approximately 11 7 and 6 lower in 2018 respectively compared with 2017 likewise at 50 60 and 70 scheduling levels wue was approximately 11 5 and 9 lower in 2018 respectively compared with 2017 ascribed by the higher crop evapotranspiration and lower grain yield irrigation scheduling irrigation methods and the interaction of irrigation scheduling irrigation methods significantly p 0 01 influenced the wue in this study d has a higher yield as well as wue compared with s and f malash et al 2008 in this study 50 fc irrigation level received a minimum amount of irrigation water due to which grain yield reduced intensely ultimately decreased wue lv et al 2013 the results revealed that both d and s had a significant benefit of enhancing wue however d showed higher wue over s under increasing irrigation scheduling wang et al 2012 the current study results illustrated that adopting a high efficiency irrigation method i e d over the f can significantly increase the wue and lower the cumulative n2o emissions 3 5 global warming potential of n2o emission gwpn2o the gwpn2o during the winter wheat growing season varied from 195 2 d1 to 447 f3 and 260 f1 to 584 f3 kg co2 eq ha 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 3 at all irrigation scheduling levels f has significantly higher gwpn2o followed by s and d in 2017 in 2018 under 70 and 60 fc level f has the noticeably higher gwpn2o compared with s and d whereas f at 50 fc has slightly lower gwpn2o compared with s and d in 2017 50 and 60 fc has no substantial difference gwpn2o while in 2018 all irrigation scheduling was significantly different from each other irrigation scheduling irrigation methods and interaction of irrigation scheduling irrigation methods markedly p 0 001 influenced the gwpn2o in the entire study 4 discussion 4 1 factors regulating the n2o fluxes the soil n2o fluxes were measured in a fertilized and irrigated winter wheat field throughout two growing seasons in this experiment we observed a high n2o emission after n fertilization application and subsequent irrigation which lasted for approximately one month due to an accelerated rate of hydrolysis and nitrification process or after the n fertilization application liu et al 2003 and the higher soil moisture expedited the denitrification process ju et al 2011 both the processes accelerated the n2o emissions the lower values of n2o emissions from the d system was in line with the study of sanchez martín et al 2010 lower n2o emission from the d system is due to partial soil wetting kallenbach et al 2010 and the soil pore volume filled with water just adjacent to the emitters therefore denitrification takes place under a smaller area compared with the f we found reduced n2o emission in s compared with f at all irrigation scheduling levels similar results were observed by nelson and terry 1996 in their study where s had lower n2o emissions compared with furrow flood irrigation apart from the high emission period after fertilization with subsequent irrigation events we did not measure any other substantial high emission events in both seasons this may be due to relatively low nitrate n no3 n level which reduced the soil microbial nitrification and denitrification process schellenberg et al 2012 therefore this confirms that fertilization accompanied by irrigation induced higher n2o emission rather than irrigation only our results agreed with the findings of schellenberg et al 2012 that n2o emissions caused by irrigation were virtually lower than those provoked by fertilization our results are in line with the wang et al 2016 who measured the 14 6 reduction of n2o emission in a wheat field in the ncp under d compared with f tian et al 2017 reported the 13 8 decrease of cumulative n2o emission in d compared with f the cumulative n2o flux was in good agreement with the values reported by bista et al 2017 the higher n2o emissions in 2018 compared with 2017 were mainly attributed to the irrigation and rain events of considerable intensity just after the fertilization event up to one month 4 2 global warming potential of n2o emission gwpn2o our results showed that the environmental costs of f at 70 fc treatment in the form of n2o emission is the highest in all the treatments and yield penalties were also higher d at 50 fc produced lower cumulative n2o flux 15 17 and gwpn2o 15 20 however the yield penalties were significantly higher 12 16 compared with d at 60 fc therefore it is not economically viable for the local farmers in the ncp over the d at 60 fc the treatments that maintained the ability to reduce the n2o emission and sustained the grain yield in the entire study were in the order of d2 s2 d3 s3 f2 f3 d1 s1 f1 f at 70 and 60 fc produced the maximum cumulative n2o emissions and gwpn2o in the study therefore it is less environmentally friendly and is usually not recommended d in deficit irrigation schedule is preferred over s and f with higher grain yield and least environmental costs in the ncp 5 conclusions the two years study in the winter wheat fields validated that irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods extensively affect the n2o emission grain yield wue and gwpn2o considerable reduction 9 17 in grain yield took place at higher water stress treatment 50 fc the optimum winter wheat grain yield could be achieved by d at 60 fc while irrigating winter wheat at 60 fc by any one of three irrigation methods d s and f produced adequate grain yield higher wue and lower cumulative n2o emissions d was found to be more suitable compared with s or f due to higher grain yield enhanced wue and lower cumulative n2o emissions among different irrigation scheduling treatments d and s at 60 fc and 50 fc respectively were most persuasive in reducing the seasonal accumulated n2o amount and significantly reduced the gwpn2o consequently the current study inferred that d at 60 fc in winter wheat field could be a possible choice for sustaining grain yield and mitigating n2o emission with lower gwpn2o in the ncp more studies are therefore required to determine the appropriate irrigation management practices in winter wheat fields as well as various other crops for reducing the gwpn2o disclosure

determine the effect of irrigation scheduling irrigation methods and the interaction of irrigation scheduling irrigation methods on cumulative n2o emission grain yield wue and gwpn2o to explore the

precipitation during two growing seasons based on the analysis of rainfall data in the last 67 years 1951 2018 the 2016 2017 winter wheat season was considered as relatively dry whereas the 2017 2018 season considered normal rainfall was observed to play a key role in regulating the irrigation scheduling and total amount of irrigation water used therefore in the 2018 winter wheat season s and d have one irrigation schedule whereas f has two less irrigation schedules compared with the 2017 winter wheat season table 2 at the same irrigation level 3 2 effects of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods on n2o emission n2o emission showed a clear seasonal trend in all irrigation treatments in both seasons the trend of the effect of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods on the n2o flux in response to fertilization was identical in the entire study fig 2 fertilizer application was carried out on jd 98 in 2017 and jd 104 in 2018 followed by irrigation the highest daily average n2o pulse in response to fertilization accompanied by irrigation was obtained in the f at 70 fc treatment 330 2 3 94 and 332 7 1 2 μg n2o m 2 h 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively while the lowest peak flux was measured in d at 50 fc in both growing seasons 168 1 1 45 154 1 6 99 μg n2o m 2 h 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively in response to fertilization in 2017 at 50 fc the n2o peak flux is significantly lower fig 2a compared with 60 fc fig 2b and 70 fc fig 2c while d d1 d2 and d3 had substantially lower n2o peak flux compared with s s1 s2 and s3 and f f1 f2 and f3 similarly in 2018 50 fc fig 2d had notably lower n2o peak flux in response to fertilization compared with 60 fc fig 2e and 70 fc fig 2f moreover d d1 d2 and d3 had substantially lower n2o peak flux in 2018 compared with s s1 s2 and s3 and f f1 f2 and f3 in this study apart from the fertilization effect irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods also influenced the n2o peak pulse significantly the cumulative n2o amount ranged from 0 49 d1 to 1 10 f3 kg ha 1 and 0 63 d1 f1 to 1 4 f3 kg ha 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively table 3 the cumulative n2o emissions measured were lowest in the d followed by the s and f treatments corresponding to their irrigation scheduling except in 2018 at 50 fc where no significant difference was measured in all irrigation methods the trend was similar in the entire study cumulative n2o emissions were highest in f followed by s and d the results illustrated that as the irrigation scheduling level increased higher cumulative n2o emissions were produced and the emissions were minimum at the least irrigation scheduling 50 fc level treatment moreover rainfall also contributed to the higher cumulative n2o emissions in the 2018 winter wheat season the current results showed that adopting d at 50 60 or 70 fc remarkably mitigates the n2o emissions compared with s and f from winter wheat fields in the ncp variance analysis on irrigation scheduling irrigation methods and interaction of irrigation scheduling irrigation methods showed a remarkable p 0 001 effect on cumulative n2o emissions in the entire study repeated measures analysis of variance of different sampling dates the interaction between different sampling dates irrigation scheduling and sampling dates irrigation methods all highly significantly p 0 001 affected the n2o emissions in the entire study 3 3 grain yield the grain yield in the study varied from 8 29 t ha 1 f1 to 9 67 t ha 1 d2 and 7 12 t ha 1 f1 to 9 72 t ha 1 d2 in 2017 and 2018 respectively table 4 the maximum grain yield was recorded in the d followed by s and f in entire study duration whereas the grain yield decreased at lowest irrigation scheduling 50 fc and highest irrigation scheduling 70 fc treatments the optimum grain yield was obtained by irrigating d at 60 fc treatment in this study the grain yield of d compared with s and f and grain yield at 60 fc compared with 50 and 70 fc was significantly higher in the entire study irrigation scheduling irrigation methods and the interaction of irrigation scheduling irrigation methods substantially p 0 001 influence the grain yield in both wheat seasons 3 4 water use efficiency nearly all highest wue values were observed at medium irrigation scheduling level 60 fc and the lowest values at higher level 70 fc under all irrigation methods table 5 the maximum wue was measured in d2 2 0 and 1 92 kg m 3 in 2017 and 2018 respectively and minimum wue was obtained in f3 1 78 and 1 65 kg m 3 in 2017 and 2018 respectively in the entire study in 2017 there was no notable difference measured in the wue of d and s at 50 and 60 fc and between s and f at 70 fc in 2018 there was no significant higher wue measured in s and f at all irrigation levels and this can be attributed to the no substantial difference in the grain yield at 60 and 70 fc while at 50 fc s received a higher amount of water 30 mm compared with f table 2 in 2017 the wue of d and s and irrigation scheduling of 50 and 60 fc there was no significant difference while in 2018 the wue of s and f was identical the wue of s d and f was approximately 11 7 and 6 lower in 2018 respectively compared with 2017 likewise at 50 60 and 70 scheduling levels wue was approximately 11 5 and 9 lower in 2018 respectively compared with 2017 ascribed by the higher crop evapotranspiration and lower grain yield irrigation scheduling irrigation methods and the interaction of irrigation scheduling irrigation methods significantly p 0 01 influenced the wue in this study d has a higher yield as well as wue compared with s and f malash et al 2008 in this study 50 fc irrigation level received a minimum amount of irrigation water due to which grain yield reduced intensely ultimately decreased wue lv et al 2013 the results revealed that both d and s had a significant benefit of enhancing wue however d showed higher wue over s under increasing irrigation scheduling wang et al 2012 the current study results illustrated that adopting a high efficiency irrigation method i e d over the f can significantly increase the wue and lower the cumulative n2o emissions 3 5 global warming potential of n2o emission gwpn2o the gwpn2o during the winter wheat growing season varied from 195 2 d1 to 447 f3 and 260 f1 to 584 f3 kg co2 eq ha 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 3 at all irrigation scheduling levels f has significantly higher gwpn2o followed by s and d in 2017 in 2018 under 70 and 60 fc level f has the noticeably higher gwpn2o compared with s and d whereas f at 50 fc has slightly lower gwpn2o compared with s and d in 2017 50 and 60 fc has no substantial difference gwpn2o while in 2018 all irrigation scheduling was significantly different from each other irrigation scheduling irrigation methods and interaction of irrigation scheduling irrigation methods markedly p 0 001 influenced the gwpn2o in the entire study 4 discussion 4 1 factors regulating the n2o fluxes the soil n2o fluxes were measured in a fertilized and irrigated winter wheat field throughout two growing seasons in this experiment we observed a high n2o emission after n fertilization application and subsequent irrigation which lasted for approximately one month due to an accelerated rate of hydrolysis and nitrification process or after the n fertilization application liu et al 2003 and the higher soil moisture expedited the denitrification process ju et al 2011 both the processes accelerated the n2o emissions the lower values of n2o emissions from the d system was in line with the study of sanchez martín et al 2010 lower n2o emission from the d system is due to partial soil wetting kallenbach et al 2010 and the soil pore volume filled with water just adjacent to the emitters therefore denitrification takes place under a smaller area compared with the f we found reduced n2o emission in s compared with f at all irrigation scheduling levels similar results were observed by nelson and terry 1996 in their study where s had lower n2o emissions compared with furrow flood irrigation apart from the high emission period after fertilization with subsequent irrigation events we did not measure any other substantial high emission events in both seasons this may be due to relatively low nitrate n no3 n level which reduced the soil microbial nitrification and denitrification process schellenberg et al 2012 therefore this confirms that fertilization accompanied by irrigation induced higher n2o emission rather than irrigation only our results agreed with the findings of schellenberg et al 2012 that n2o emissions caused by irrigation were virtually lower than those provoked by fertilization our results are in line with the wang et al 2016 who measured the 14 6 reduction of n2o emission in a wheat field in the ncp under d compared with f tian et al 2017 reported the 13 8 decrease of cumulative n2o emission in d compared with f the cumulative n2o flux was in good agreement with the values reported by bista et al 2017 the higher n2o emissions in 2018 compared with 2017 were mainly attributed to the irrigation and rain events of considerable intensity just after the fertilization event up to one month 4 2 global warming potential of n2o emission gwpn2o our results showed that the environmental costs of f at 70 fc treatment in the form of n2o emission is the highest in all the treatments and yield penalties were also higher d at 50 fc produced lower cumulative n2o flux 15 17 and gwpn2o 15 20 however the yield penalties were significantly higher 12 16 compared with d at 60 fc therefore it is not economically viable for the local farmers in the ncp over the d at 60 fc the treatments that maintained the ability to reduce the n2o emission and sustained the grain yield in the entire study were in the order of d2 s2 d3 s3 f2 f3 d1 s1 f1 f at 70 and 60 fc produced the maximum cumulative n2o emissions and gwpn2o in the study therefore it is less environmentally friendly and is usually not recommended d in deficit irrigation schedule is preferred over s and f with higher grain yield and least environmental costs in the ncp 5 conclusions the two years study in the winter wheat fields validated that irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods extensively affect the n2o emission grain yield wue and gwpn2o considerable reduction 9 17 in grain yield took place at higher water stress treatment 50 fc the optimum winter wheat grain yield could be achieved by d at 60 fc while irrigating winter wheat at 60 fc by any one of three irrigation methods d s and f produced adequate grain yield higher wue and lower cumulative n2o emissions d was found to be more suitable compared with s or f due to higher grain yield enhanced wue and lower cumulative n2o emissions among different irrigation scheduling treatments d and s at 60 fc and 50 fc respectively were most persuasive in reducing the seasonal accumulated n2o amount and significantly reduced the gwpn2o consequently the current study inferred that d at 60 fc in winter wheat field could be a possible choice for sustaining grain yield and mitigating n2o emission with lower gwpn2o in the ncp more studies are therefore required to determine the appropriate irrigation management practices in winter wheat fields as well as various other crops for reducing the gwpn2o disclosure

10974,treated wastewater also called as recycled water is a reliable source of water for various non potable purposes one of the most common uses of recycled water has been for irrigation a soil column study was carried out for a period of one year the objective of this study was to determine the effect of irrigation using two different types of treated wastewaters on kikuyu grass pennisetum clandestinum production in the absence of any kind of chemical fertilisers soil irrigated with secondary treated wastewater mbr membrane bioreactor resulted in highest annual grass production 16 241 kg of dry matter per hectare kg dm ha compared to advanced treated wastewater idal intermittently decanted aerated lagoon and tap water tw with annual yields of 7028 and 14 216 kg dm ha respectively irrigation waters soil extracted waters and soil samples from different depths of the columns were analysed sodium adsorption ratio sar exchangeable cations electrical conductivity ec and ph changed in each experimental column due to different characteristics of applied irrigation waters the results indicate that high contents of nitrogen and phosphorous in mbr water compensated for the presence of moderate salinity level that contributed to the higher production of grass compared to other two types of irrigation waters the increase in ph from initial amount of 5 9 to 7 3 in top part of idal irrigated soil may have resulted in low grass yield this ph increase can be attributed to the high concentrations of cations in the irrigation water in the lack of sufficient amount of nitrogen overall the study demonstrated that a relatively higher grass yield in the absence of any types of fertilisers is possible with recycled water irrigation using secondary treated wastewater further the recycled water irrigation with advanced treatment of wastewater while costs more does not result in increased yield benefits keywords treated wastewater water reuse membrane bioreactor intermittently decanted aerated lagoon kikuyu grass yield irrigation 1 introduction it has been proven that treated wastewater is a reliable water source which can constitute a noteworthy component of integrated water resources management and produce an effective solution to deal with chronic water shortages stathatou et al 2015 the benefits of using recycled water include saving water resources preventing natural water resources from being contaminated recovering nutrients for agriculture augmentation of river flow saving in wastewater treatment groundwater recharge and sustainable management of water resources angelakis and bontoux 2001 rahman et al 2016 pursuing beneficial achievements various communities local governments and policy makers are making concerted effort to use recycled water for urban irrigation rather than disposing it into the natural water body rahman et al 2016 wastewaters often contain a large amount of constituents of organic and inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus the potential for using these nutrients instead of commercial fertiliser makes recycled water even more valuable for agriculture worldwide many researchers have evaluated the effect of treated and untreated wastewaters in various agricultural systems aiello et al 2007 castro et al 2009 chakrabarti 1995 costa et al 2011 da fonseca et al 2007 gori et al 2000 herpin et al 2007 lubello

of plant growth to the use of recycled water for irrigation depends on the chemical characteristics of the recycled water and the type of plant species the treatment level of wastewater can result in different categories of recycled water in terms of concentration of various chemical components mbr membrane bioreactor is a secondary treatment of wastewater process combining a membrane process like microfiltration or ultrafiltration with a biological process and is now widely used for municipal and industrial wastewater purposes judd 2010 idal intermittently decanted aerated lagoon is an advanced treatment of wastewater aiming at removing nutrient from wastewater particularly nitrogen that performs the functions of sedimentation biological treatment and clarification processes in one reactor ngo and vigneswaran 2007 the current study compared these two types of treated wastewaters in terms of their effect on kikuyu grass pennisetum clandestinum production kikuyu grass is a c4

kikuyu grass production mostly have been accompanied by using fertiliser awad et al 1976 botha et al 2008 fulkerson et al 1999 gherbin et al 2007 hacker and evans 1992 kemp 1976 pearson et al 1985 radhakrishnan et al 2006 use of treated wastewater for turf grass has been reported in a number of studies including various types of turf grasses and soil structures which mostly have focussed on changes in soil and plant properties candela et al 2007 castro et al 2011 gwenzi and munondo 2008 hayes et al 1990 mancino and pepper 1992 however comparison of mbr secondary and idal advanced treated wastewaters in terms of kikuyu grass production has not been reported in the literature salinity for both of these waters is considered as moderate level for kikuyu grass however whether or not this condition affects the availability of nutrients for plant growth in the absence of chemical fertiliser is of question and needs more research in the current study no fertiliser was used for the duration of the study the overall aim of this study is to investigate the use of secondary and advanced treated wastewater for turf irrigation in urban context specific objectives of this study were to determine the yield of kikuyu grass due to irrigation using secondary and advance treated wastewater without addition of chemical fertiliser to evaluate the role of medium level of salinity in recycled water on the nutrient availability to kikuyu grass 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the soil column tests were carried out using three identical stainless steel columns located at the surrounded field inside the werrington south campus of western sydney university 33 46 13 3 s 150 44 30 6 e the columns as shown in fig 1 were 450 mm in diameter and 600 mm in height the size of the columns used in this study is considerably bigger than the common lysimeters used in lab scale studies in fact the size of the columns used in this study is in between the lab scale and field scale which makes it possible to monitor the columns with the help of monitoring tools and taking multiple samples from various parts of the columns this helps to minimise experimental errors such as wall effects in addition the columns were uniformly packed to minimise experimental errors similar columns have been used in some other studies for variety of purposes such as determination of soil hydraulic conductivity duong et al 2012 and monitoring bacterial transport and water flow in soil profile jiang et al 2010 2008 a perforated plate of 2 mm thickness and pore size of 800 μm was placed at the bottom of the column to allow the free drainage of excess water in the columns these columns were filled with the pre prepared soil collected from d21 paddock 33 37 29 9 s 150 45 43 4 e which is located within the hawkesbury campus of the western sydney university at richmond nsw approximately 80 km northwest of sydney using open pit method the soil was collected between 0 and 200 mm depth collected soil after soil texture analysis was categorised as loamy sand the soil was air dried after removing roots and worms and passed through a sieve 2 36 mm to obtain uniform particle size and bulk density table 1 lists the physical and chemical properties of the soil 2 2 experimental design the columns were equipped with three gs3 sensors at top middle and bottom the schematic set up of the columns is shown in fig 1 the gs3 sensors measure bulk electrical conductivity volumetric water content and temperature of the soil the sensor works on the principal of measurement of bulk electrical permittivity and is related to the volumetric content by a calibration equation the sensor consists of three prongs which are 55 and 3 26 mm in length and diameter respectively and are placed 25 4 mm apart from each other all these gs3 sensors were connected to a data logger campbell scientific cr800series for continuous data collection from the sensors at one minute intervals the software and the communication device in the data logger allowed for telemetric data collection kikuyu grass obtained from nursery was placed on the top of the three columns and was watered with the respective irrigation water to make sure that the whole grass survived and established 2 3 irrigation waters two different types of treated wastewater and a potable water source were chosen for experimental trials namely mbr idal and tw mbr water used for this research was collected from pennant hills golf club s wastewater treatment plant in sydney fig 2 illustrates the process of wastewater treatment at pennant hills golf club wastewater plant owing to the mbr system installed in 2008 pennant hills golf club saves 94 600 m3 of municipal potable water per year which used to be consumed for irrigation purposes water 2008 idal water to be used in this research was collected from sydney water s richmond stp sewage treatment plant idal process is summarised in fig 3 effectively nutrient removal from wastewater particularly nitrogen through idal process compared to mbr can be considered as the most significant difference between the two treatments idal plant at richmond stp achieves phosphorus removal via alum dosing effluent from richmond stp is supplied as irrigation water for dairy pasture horticultural crops and playing fields of hawkesbury campus of western sydney university booth et al 2003 potable water was provided by the tap water placed at the experimental zone having the characteristics of drinking water of sydney from now on stww secondary treated wastewater atww advanced treated wastewater and tw tap water will be referred to mbr idal and control water used in the current work respectively 2 4 irrigation scheduling and climatic condition the seasons in sydney australia which is occupied by the temperate zone take place in the following sequence summer december to february autumn march to may winter june to august and spring september to november a weather station was installed at the study area to collect a wide range of climatic data irrigation interval and water amount were identified based on data from gs3 sensors in conjunction with the information from weather station loamy sand has been reported to have maximum field capacity fc and available water content awc of 19 and 9 respectively in an effort to avoid water stress to the grass and excess amount of water application soil moisture content was maintained between 15 and 20 over the period of the study fig 4 illustrates the irrigation water application for the columns and climatic condition in the area within the study period autumn 2016 summer 2017 due to changes in climatic conditions and water uptake of various grasses the amount and interval of irrigation varied over the seasons daily et evapotranspiration for kikuyu grass was calculated as allen et al 1998 e t k c e t 0 where et is kikuyu grass daily evapotranspiration mm day kc is monthly crop coefficient for kikuyu grass connellan 2013 and et0 is daily reference crop evapotranspiration mm day from weather station davis instruments 2006 irrigation waters were applied manually using three identical sprinklers monthly real crop evapotranspiration for each treatment can be calculated as e t r i l v w c where et is monthly grass evapotranspiration mm r is monthly rainfall recorded from weather station installed at the study area i is the amount of irrigation water applied monthly for different columns mm l is the amount of water leached out from the column within the month mm and vwc is column s soil moisture content difference for a selected month mm soil moisture content vwc for each column is the average of data recorded by gs3 sensors located in 100 300 and 500 mm depth of the column table 2 compares monthly real crop et for different treatments throughout the study fig 4 shows a good agreement between et recorded from weather station and average real crop et for autumn winter and spring however in the summer time the average real crop et stands noticeably higher than that of recorded from weather station the higher average real crop et in summer time can be attributed to the high grass production in summer compared to the other seasons particularly from the columns irrigated with stww and tw which may not be fully represented by the et from the weather station while calculating table 2 the following assumptions were made to obtain missing data points due to an extensive rainfall event on 4th and 5th june 2016 164 8 mm the collected leachate amount was not reliable to minimise the error et for june 2016 was taken as an average value between may and july 2016 due to some technical issue with the data logger there were some missing data for soil moisture content between 21st november and 25th december 2016 and also between 25th january and 5th february 2017 these data points were obtained through interpolation 2 5 kikuyu grass dry matter production grass from each column was harvested regularly every month and transferred to the laboratory for analyses after weighing and rinsing the fresh grass with distilled water it was spread into the metal trays and left at the room temperature for 48 h in a dust free environment before being placed into an oven of 70 c for almost 48 h until the weight of dried grass stays constant dried matter after weighing was ground and passed through the sieve of 0 5 mm for further analyses 2 6 soil water analysis for soil water analysis the columns were equipped with three ports at 10 30 50 cm depths fig 1 and soil water extractors adjacent to their gs3 sensors soil water samples were collected by the help of suction pumps from every depth once extracted samples were transferred to the laboratory for measuring the main characteristics ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured using the respective meters and then samples were prepared for total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and cation analysis persulfate method was used for simultaneous determination of tn and tp using k2s208 and naoh digestion at the end of the digestion tn and tp were analysed using the discrete analyser gallery thermoscientific in the form of nox n no2 and no3 and po4 3 respectively cations including calcium ca potassium k magnesium mg and sodium na were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent technology 700 series 2 7 soil analysis at the end of the experiment columns were dismantled by carefully separating the whole turf stem from the top soil and collecting the soils from different depths of the columns soils from depths of the columns were collected and transferred to the soil lab for the chemical analyses ec ph tn tp and soluble and exchangeable cations were the main parameters which were determined for soil samples soil analysis methods proposed by rayment and lyons 2011 were used to determine soluble and exchangeable cations ec in saturated extract ecse and ph in saturated extract phse 3 results and discussions 3 1 characteristics of irrigation waters table 3 lists the mean values of selected parameters for irrigation waters it can be seen that tn and tp values for stww due to the treatment type stand far higher than the two other waters sodium content for both treated wastewaters was similar however much higher than that of tw main cations concentrations vary from water to water and sodium adsorption ratio sar which indicates the ratio of na and two other main cations ca and mg is significantly higher in the treated wastewaters than that of tw due to considerably higher na concentration in treated wastewaters according to ayers and westcot 1985 with those ec and sar values the soil sodification risk is slight to moderate 3 2 applied irrigation water and nutrients cations loads on an average 70 18 and 45 l of various types of irrigation waters were applied for the columns throughout the autumn winter and spring respectively fig 5 however due to the differences in the yield of grass during the summer the amount of water applied to the columns varied from column to column with application of roughly 90 70 and 80 l for stww atww and tw columns respectively water applied was proportional to the yield rate from each column overall annually 229 208 and 219 l of stww atww and tw were applied to their respective columns total amount of tn tp and main cations applied via irrigation waters can be calculated using their average concentration and the amount of waters fig 5 applied to the columns throughout the seasons table 4 compares the annual amount of tn tp and main cations added to the columns via irrigation waters the column irrigated with stww received the highest amounts of tn and tp compared to two other irrigation waters due to presence of relatively high concentrations of these nutrients in stww kikuyu grass has been reported to grow well in soils fertilised with higher amounts of nitrogen and generally p present in the soil sufficient for its growth to achieve closer to its potential yield recommended annual application rate of 300 500 kg n ha needs to be supplied marais 2001 in the current study maximum application of n occurred via stww water with an annual amount of 235 kg n ha while for atww and tw waters this number was mere 12 and 9 kg n ha respectively in terms of total phosphorus annual application of 25 250 kg ha has been reported in various studies depending on the condition of the soil and purpose of the study fulkerson et al 1999 kemp 1976 1975 murtagh 1978 in the current study annual amounts of 71 5 18 and 5 kg ha were added to the columns irrigated with stww atww and tw respectively regarding cations it can be seen that soils irrigated with treated wastewaters received higher level of k and na compared to those of tw atww column has received the least amount of ca over the seasons on the other hand atww column received the highest amount of mg compared to the other two waters 3 3 observed kikuyu grass yield in spite of no fertiliser application in the current study annual yield of 16 241 7028 and 14 216 kg dm ha was achieved from the columns irrigated with stww atww and tw respectively reported dry matter yields for kikuyu grass vary amongst the studies and this has been attributed to various factors kemp 1975 reported kikuyu grass yield of 11 430 kg dm ha year which was substantially less than 30 000 kg dm ha year reported by colman 1971 kemp 1975 attributed this reduction to the reduced nitrogen application rate while colman 1971 applied 1120 kg of n ha year kemp 1975 used only 680 kg of n ha year hence nitrogen availability for kikuyu grass can impact on its growth quite significantly less yield achieved in the current study when compared to reported data from colman 1971 highlights the necessity of nitrogen application for higher production of kikuyu grass further the presence of moderate level of salinity can be listed as a limiting factor for achieving higher grass production evaporative demand day and night temperature salinity and defoliation interval have also been reported as some factors which can affect kikuyu grass production fulkerson et al 1999 ivory and whiteman 1978 murtagh 1978 muscolo et al 2003 monthly grass yields are given in fig 6 as seen in the figure the column irrigated with stww water had the highest grass yield particularly in summer compared to the two other columns the yield from the column irrigated with tw stood very close to the stww and the column irrigated with atww water resulted in the lowest yield close observation of fig 6 indicates that the grass yield from the atww column started to grow in a similar trend as two other columns within months march to october but failed to follow the increasing trend of two other columns leaving a big gap of dry matter yield amongst the treatments in summer time obtaining comparable grass yield from the column irrigated with tw despite the lack of sufficient nutrient level can highlight the limiting effect of na present in treated wastewaters for instance in case of stww in spite of containing noticeable nitrogen due to the level of salinity it could not help kikuyu to grow to its potential level similar scenario applies to atww with the coincidence of high salinity level and lack of nutrient which resulted in very low grass production however it should be noted that the growth rate of kikuyu can be significantly affected by various other factors such as temperature irrigation rainfall rate and soil fertility van der colf 2010 due to the same climatic conditions being applied to all columns in this study the significant differences between the yields can be attributed to the irrigation waters characteristics and the changes occurred in soil properties which will be discussed later in more details fig 7 compares seasonal grass yield from the current study and some previous studies allan et al 1997 ashwood et al 1992 fulkerson 2007 kemp 1975 an average actual yield of 12 000 kg dm ha has been reported from previous studies for kikuyu grass garcía et al 2014 3 4 extracted soil water ph soil waters ph from 10 cm depth of soil high root concentration area is shown in fig 8 ph for atww stands higher than the other two waters making the ambient conditions neutral to slightly alkaline the two other soil waters indicating a slightly acidic ambient high ph ambient of soil water in the column irrigated with atww can be attributed to the slightly high ph of irrigation water atww compared to others high concentration of main cations specially mg and lower level of nitrogen in the same soil can also be addressed for higher level of ph this feature of soil can be a limiting factor for kikuyu grass growth as ph 5 to 7 has been reported as the best range for kikuyu production clark 2007 dickenson et al 2004 3 5 extracted soil water ec an average seasonal value of soil water ec extracted from 10 cm depth of the soil is shown in fig 9 higher values of ec recorded for waters extracted from wastewater irrigated soils particularly from stww column due to its high concentration of na and this has happened mostly in summer time as a result of more water application soil irrigated with fresh water showed less change over the period of running the experiment obviously due to its lower amount of na in summer the top layer of soils where the concentration of root is high irrigated with stww and atww experienced an average ec amount of 3 25 and 2 ds m respectively these values are considered as slightly to moderate salinity level for soil seelig 2000 and kikuyu is classified as a grass type tolerant to this range of salinity havilah et al 2005 due to low content of nitrogen in atww water this level of salinity can impact the grass growth as a preventing factor to hinder the nutrient uptake of the plant 3 6 possible parameters impacting the grass yield 3 6 1 soil ph plant growth can be affected with soil ph in various ways break down and release of nitrogen by bacteria can be processed properly in the optimum ph range of 5 5 7 ph values below 5 5 can cause plant nutrients to be leached faster than those available in the soils within the 5 5 7 0 range soil structure also can be impacted with ph where the intensive acid or alkaline clay soils are tempted to become tight making the cultivation difficult ward 2015 ph values higher than 7 can cause reduction in plant production by limiting the availability of some plant nutrients for instance highest availability of phosphates to the plant takes place at a ph between 6 and 7 similarly some other nutrients such as iron manganese zinc copper and cobalt micro nutrients are in their minimum availability at a ph greater than 7 seelig 2000 over the time of study period soil saturated extract ph phse changed in different levels fig 10 shows the variation of phse among different soils and columns depths compared to the soil initial phse 5 9 column irrigated with stww did not change noticeably while tw column with a slightly decrease in phse experienced a moderate acidic conditions soil irrigated with atww witnessed a considerable increase in phse resulting in neutral to moderately alkaline ambient the increase in soil ph irrigated with atww water can be attributed to atww s slightly higher ph in availability of higher contents of cations as well as lack of nitrogen low rate of nitrification process compared to other sort of treated wastewater mohammad and mazahreh 2003 rusan et al 2007 schipper et al 1996 this range of ph as mentioned before is considered as a limiting factor for achieving high production of kikuyu grass as it is known to grow well in soil with moderate acidity where ph is in the range of 5 7 clark 2007 dickenson et al 2004 researchers have reported an inconsistency of soil ph when irrigated with wastewater gwenzi and munondo 2008 reported a 23 42 increase of ph in sandy soil irrigated with effluent for a period of 26 years they attributed this increase to the neutralising effect of effluent with near neutral ph 7 2 sparling et al 2006 reported an increase of up to 1 ph unit in the soil ph irrigated with secondary treated wastewater according to schipper et al 1996 soil ph experienced an increase as a result of irrigation with wastewater for a long time and the authors related this increase to the high level of cations such as na ca and mg in the wastewater used for irrigation purpose on the other hand some other researchers reported soil ph decrease as a result of wastewater application and they attributed this to the oxidation of organic compounds and nitrification of ammonium rusan et al 2007 mohammad and mazahreh 2003 found that ph decreased in the soil irrigated with wastewater and they attributed this to the process of nitrification due to the availability of high amount of ammonium in the wastewater which resulted of serving hydrogen ions in the soil rattan et al 2005 reported also an average 0 4 drop of ph in the soil irrigated with sewage due to the acidic characteristics of sewage effluents khan et al 2008 recorded no significant effect on soil ph irrigated with wastewater 3 6 2 soil ec saline soils due to including high levels of soluble salts can cause growth reduction and in some cases plant death soluble salts by affecting the osmotic potential of soil water can result in dehydration of plant cell seelig 2000 conventionally soils having a saturated extract electrical conductivity ecse over 4 ds m are defined ass saline soils however the criteria of the plant in terms of salinity tolerance play a key role where sensitive and highly tolerant plants can be affected at half and twice this salinity respectively bernstein 1975 kikuyu grass is categorised amongst plants moderately tolerant to salinity up to 4 ds m havilah et al 2005 in this study ecse although varied from column to column stood relatively below 2 5 ds m as seen in fig 11 a noticeable increase in ecse occurred in the top part of wastewater irrigated soils where ecse went up almost 5 times compared to the soil initial value 0 55 ds m although this level of salinity has not been reported as a limiting factor for kikuyu grass when it coincides with the lack of main nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous seems to play a limiting role for grass growth similar trend for ec behaviour in soil depth reported by lado and ben hur 2009 when they used treated domestic sewage as an irrigation source for sandy soil in contrast no considerable change occurred for the soil irrigated with fresh water tap water irrigated soil except a slight increase in the top 5 cm of the column dropped smoothly from the initial value and followed a flat trend 3 6 3 soil exchangeable cations exchangeable cations of soil are defined as those cations that can be exchanged by added cations thomas 1982 many of the nutrients used by plants are in the form of cations havilah et al 2005 the concentration of available cations in the soil and the balance between them can cause imbalances deficiency or toxicities there is a strong relationship between soil cation exchange capacity cec and physical structural stability chemical nutrient availability and biological microbial population characteristics of the soil khaledian et al 2017 therefore determination of exchangeable cations and the ratios between them can be of crucial importance in terms of crop production and soil suitability to achieve a proper yield results compared to the initial values table 1 showed a noticeable increase of exchangeable cations in all three columns soils in case of na the changes in soils from various depths were significantly higher in soils irrigated with wastewaters fig 12 depicts the variability of exchangeable ca k mg and na in top 10 cm soil despite the values the trends for exchangeable cations were very similar to soluble ones exchangeable ca and mg were the dominants amongst the other cations while na had the lowest level the highest amounts of elements were determined in top 10 cm soil which has been similarly reported by some other researchers when they used wastewater for irrigation purposes nyamangara and mzezewa 2001 rusan et al 2007 in terms of ca k and mg stww and tw followed very similar trends exchangeable k and mg for atww column stood far higher than the two other columns adequate amount of exchangeable ca k and mg has been reported as 5 10 0 3 0 6 and 1 6 me 100 g respectively havilah et al 2005 however sandy soils due to their specific texture normally have very low level of exchangeable cations exchangeable na for tw column was the lowest while stww column appeared to have the highest content of exchangeable na and atww column fall slightly behind that desirable percentage of exchange cations has been reported as 65 80 ca 10 15 mg 1 5 k and 0 1 na havilah et al 2005 percentage of different exchangeable cations in 10 cm soil depth is shown in fig 13 it can be seen that ca and mg for atww irrigated soil and na for soils irrigated with any types of treated waters stand far beyond the advised percentage 4 statistical analysis in this study due to the level of instrumentation involved experiments using a single column for each experimental treatment without replications condition was carried out as the columns used were of larger size and the study was carried out for a considerable length of time over one year period the data collected from single column here still provided time series data that can be analysed for statistical significance of findings from the study similar to current single column study there are single lysimeter studies reported in literature to understand water flow water use and crop growth for example jiang et al 2010 2008 used six lysimeters which were different in terms of soil physico chemical parameters to determine the water flow and bacterial transport in soil profile they equipped their lysimeters with tensiometers water content and temperature probes at various depths they reported their results based on the individual columns comparing various parameters between all six columns other studies with the similar size of the columns have been carried out to determine the soil hydraulic conductivity without any repetitions and the lysimeters were equipped with monitoring sensors at different depths choo and yanful 2000 duong et al 2012 gonçalves et al 2006 some other studies with larger size lysimeters were conducted with no repetitions basso and ritchie 2005 rasse et al 2000 since this was a non replicated study statistical analyses only could be presented carrying out simple t test to provide statistical significance of the observations made in this study between the columns over the time period table 5 statistically compares the differences between the selected two treatments and identifies whether it is extremely significant p 0 001 significant p 0 05 or insignificant p 0 05 as shown in table 5 grass dm yield monthly data when compared between stww and atww and between tw and atww showed significant differences as evidenced by the p values of below 0 05 over 12 months of study period also the t test analysis showed no significant difference between the yields achieved between stww and tw these results support the conclusions made in section 3 3 sar ec and na concentration in the soil which received treated wastewater appear to be significantly different from that of tap water p 0 05 this is expected as the treated water consists of high salts particularly sodium salts also as expected there are no significant differences in the values for sar ec and na concentration in the soil which received the treated wastewaters namely stww and atww p 0 05 this means that wastewater as irrigation water would contribute to the increase in the salinity of the soil in addition when similar test is carried out for soil ph values from 7 different depths of three columns it can be seen that all three columns are extremely significantly or significantly different from each other with p values 0 001 and 0 05 variation in soil ph under wastewater application and its impact on grass production has been discussed in section 3 6 1 thus the statistical analysis clearly indicates that the differences observed between the three treatments namely atww stww and tw are extremely significant or significant thereby highlighting that the conclusions drawn from this study are statistically significant 5 economic implications this study indicates that it is beneficial to supply recycled water just after secondary treatment rather than after advanced treatment this will yield savings in the capital and operating costs of the treatment plant in addition use of secondary wastewater can yield better crop production without the input of inorganic fertiliser thus there are several economic benefits of using secondary treated wastewater for irrigation petala et al 2006 reported an estimated cost of aus 0 60 m3 for the operation of advanced treatment for the reclamation of secondary municipal effluents sydney water s richmond stp supplies a daily average of 1770 m3 of atww for irrigation of parks farms and sports fields sydney water 2018 therefore irrigation water supplied from stww can save aus 1 062 day aus 387 630 yr this amount only includes the savings in operating cost and does not include savings in the capital and other expenditures such as fertilisers again the above saving is for the year 2006 current savings will be 20 to 25 higher due to inflation over the years the economic benefit estimated here is an approximate saving more rigorous analysis is required to estimate the true benefits of using secondary treated wastewater for irrigation 6 conclusions use of treated wastewater recycled water for irrigation purpose provides plants with continuous supply of nutrients in low concentrations compared to common fertiliser application which usually happens in seasonal intervals with addition of intensive nitrogen and phosphorus to the soil while some researchers have indicated that using secondary treated wastewater stww should be accompanied by fertiliser to avoid any adverse effect on several types of crops kikuyu grass appears to have grown well with stww as irrigation water without the use of inorganic fertilisers on the other hand kikuyu grass did not grow well when advance treated wastewater atww was applied nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in treated wastewaters can be considered to be the major factors for the difference in the yields observed with different types of water used for irrigation the high yield rate observed in the column irrigated with tap water tw highlighted the possibility of some other factors impacting on the yield rate one such factor could be the presence of low levels of cations particularly sodium in other words availability of an adequate amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in stww may have compensated for the moderate levels of sodium in the recycled water as kikuyu is known for its moderate tolerance for salinity some other factors can also affect the growth of kikuyu grass form the soil irrigated with atww one such factor is high soil ph particularly in the top soil layer of atww irrigated column this high ph could be due to slightly high ph of atww and high concentration of magnesium and low concertation of nitrogen the ph observed for atww irrigated column was outside the optimum ph range for kikuyu grass growth which has been reported to be in the range of 5 7 the observed results were shown to be statistically significant therefore it can be concluded that the use of secondary treated wastewater for turf grass irrigation in urban areas and recreational facilities can yield several benefits mainly there are four benefits i savings in both capital and operating costs associated with the wastewater treatment ii savings in the inorganic fertilisers that is normally applied on the open fields iii savings in the precious town water and iv prevention of nutrient rich wastewater effluent and fertiliser laden urban runoff joining the natural water courses approximate saving in operating cost for sydney s richmond sewage treatment plant was estimated as aus 387 630 yr it must be emphasised that further research with appropriate replication of treatments is required to quantify all the benefits in detail acknowledgements the authors wish to acknowledge the pennant hills golf club operators in particular kurt dahl and richard kirkby of permeate partners pty ltd for

10974,treated wastewater also called as recycled water is a reliable source of water for various non potable purposes one of the most common uses of recycled water has been for irrigation a soil column study was carried out for a period of one year the objective of this study was to determine the effect of irrigation using two different types of treated wastewaters on kikuyu grass pennisetum clandestinum production in the absence of any kind of chemical fertilisers soil irrigated with secondary treated wastewater mbr membrane bioreactor resulted in highest annual grass production 16 241 kg of dry matter per hectare kg dm ha compared to advanced treated wastewater idal intermittently decanted aerated lagoon and tap water tw with annual yields of 7028 and 14 216 kg dm ha respectively irrigation waters soil extracted waters and soil samples from different depths of the columns were analysed sodium adsorption ratio sar exchangeable cations electrical conductivity ec and ph changed in each experimental column due to different characteristics of applied irrigation waters the results indicate that high contents of nitrogen and phosphorous in mbr water compensated for the presence of moderate salinity level that contributed to the higher production of grass compared to other two types of irrigation waters the increase in ph from initial amount of 5 9 to 7 3 in top part of idal irrigated soil may have resulted in low grass yield this ph increase can be attributed to the high concentrations of cations in the irrigation water in the lack of sufficient amount of nitrogen overall the study demonstrated that a relatively higher grass yield in the absence of any types of fertilisers is possible with recycled water irrigation using secondary treated wastewater further the recycled water irrigation with advanced treatment of wastewater while costs more does not result in increased yield benefits keywords treated wastewater water reuse membrane bioreactor intermittently decanted aerated lagoon kikuyu grass yield irrigation 1 introduction it has been proven that treated wastewater is a reliable water source which can constitute a noteworthy component of integrated water resources management and produce an effective solution to deal with chronic water shortages stathatou et al 2015 the benefits of using recycled water include saving water resources preventing natural water resources from being contaminated recovering nutrients for agriculture augmentation of river flow saving in wastewater treatment groundwater recharge and sustainable management of water resources angelakis and bontoux 2001 rahman et al 2016 pursuing beneficial achievements various communities local governments and policy makers are making concerted effort to use recycled water for urban irrigation rather than disposing it into the natural water body rahman et al 2016 wastewaters often contain a large amount of constituents of organic and inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus the potential for using these nutrients instead of commercial fertiliser makes recycled water even more valuable for agriculture worldwide many researchers have evaluated the effect of treated and untreated wastewaters in various agricultural systems aiello et al 2007 castro et al 2009 chakrabarti 1995 costa et al 2011 da fonseca et al 2007 gori et al 2000 herpin et al 2007 lubello et al 2004 manios et al 2006 minhas and yadav 2015 mohammad and ayadi 2004 pedrero et al 2012 pettygrove and asano 1984 raya et al 2004 sheikh et al 1987 vazquez montiel et al 1996 evidently response of plant growth to the use of recycled water for irrigation depends on the chemical characteristics of the recycled water and the type of plant species the treatment level of wastewater can result in different categories of recycled water in terms of concentration of various chemical components mbr membrane bioreactor is a secondary treatment of wastewater process combining a membrane process like microfiltration or ultrafiltration with a biological process and is now widely used for municipal and industrial wastewater purposes judd 2010 idal intermittently decanted aerated lagoon is an advanced treatment of wastewater aiming at removing nutrient from wastewater particularly nitrogen that performs the functions of sedimentation biological treatment and clarification processes in one reactor ngo and vigneswaran 2007 the current study compared these two types of treated wastewaters in terms of their effect on kikuyu grass pennisetum clandestinum production kikuyu grass is a c4 tropical grass which is a very popular and commonly used grass in sports fields as well as pastures public areas and golf course fairways brede 2000 fulkerson 2007 for the vast majority of urban green space turf irrigation may become unsustainable particularly for sporting clubs and home lawns that are smaller for these urban environments kikuyu is a very good choice and its flexibility for adjusting with physical stress tolerance compared to other species can save it from climatic extreme changes while satisfying urban requirements and expectations fraser et al 2017 investigations on kikuyu grass production mostly have been accompanied by using fertiliser awad et al 1976 botha et al 2008 fulkerson et al 1999 gherbin et al 2007 hacker and evans 1992 kemp 1976 pearson et al 1985 radhakrishnan et al 2006 use of treated wastewater for turf grass has been reported in a number of studies including various types of turf grasses and soil structures which mostly have focussed on changes in soil and plant properties candela et al 2007 castro et al 2011 gwenzi and munondo 2008 hayes et al 1990 mancino and pepper 1992 however comparison of mbr secondary and idal advanced treated wastewaters in terms of kikuyu grass production has not been reported in the literature salinity for both of these waters is considered as moderate level for kikuyu grass however whether or not this condition affects the availability of nutrients for plant growth in the absence of chemical fertiliser is of question and needs more research in the current study no fertiliser was used for the duration of the study the overall aim of this study is to investigate the use of secondary and advanced treated wastewater for turf irrigation in urban context specific objectives of this study were to determine the yield of kikuyu grass due to irrigation using secondary and advance treated wastewater without addition of chemical fertiliser to evaluate the role of medium level of salinity in recycled water on the nutrient availability to kikuyu grass 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the soil column tests were carried out using three identical stainless steel columns located at the surrounded field inside the werrington south campus of western sydney university 33 46 13 3 s 150 44 30 6 e the columns as shown in fig 1 were 450 mm in diameter and 600 mm in height the size of the columns used in this study is considerably bigger than the common lysimeters used in lab scale studies in fact the size of the columns used in this study is in between the lab scale and field scale which makes it possible to monitor the columns with the help of monitoring tools and taking multiple samples from various parts of the columns this helps to minimise experimental errors such as wall effects in addition the columns were uniformly packed to minimise experimental errors similar columns have been used in some other studies for variety of purposes such as determination of soil hydraulic conductivity duong et al 2012 and monitoring bacterial transport and water flow in soil profile jiang et al 2010 2008 a perforated plate of 2 mm thickness and pore size of 800 μm was placed at the bottom of the column to allow the free drainage of excess water in the columns these columns were filled with the pre prepared soil collected from d21 paddock 33 37 29 9 s 150 45 43 4 e which is located within the hawkesbury campus of the western sydney university at richmond nsw approximately 80 km northwest of sydney using open pit method the soil was collected between 0 and 200 mm depth collected soil after soil texture analysis was categorised as loamy sand the soil was air dried after removing roots and worms and passed through a sieve 2 36 mm to obtain uniform particle size and bulk density table 1 lists the physical and chemical properties of the soil 2 2 experimental design the columns were equipped with three gs3 sensors at top middle and bottom the schematic set up of the columns is shown in fig 1 the gs3 sensors measure bulk electrical conductivity volumetric water content and temperature of the soil the sensor works on the principal of measurement of bulk electrical permittivity and is related to the volumetric content by a calibration equation the sensor consists of three prongs which are 55 and 3 26 mm in length and diameter respectively and are placed 25 4 mm apart from each other all these gs3 sensors were connected to a data logger campbell scientific cr800series for continuous data collection from the sensors at one minute intervals the software and the communication device in the data logger allowed for telemetric data collection kikuyu grass obtained from nursery was placed on the top of the three columns and was watered with the respective irrigation water to make sure that the whole grass survived and established 2 3 irrigation waters two different types of treated wastewater and a potable water source were chosen for experimental trials namely mbr idal and tw mbr water used for this research was collected from pennant hills golf club s wastewater treatment plant in sydney fig 2 illustrates the process of wastewater treatment at pennant hills golf club wastewater plant owing to the mbr system installed in 2008 pennant hills golf club saves 94 600 m3 of municipal potable water per year which used to be consumed for irrigation purposes water 2008 idal water to be used in this research was collected from sydney water s richmond stp sewage treatment plant idal process is summarised in fig 3 effectively nutrient removal from wastewater particularly nitrogen through idal process compared to mbr can be considered as the most significant difference between the two treatments idal plant at richmond stp achieves phosphorus removal via alum dosing effluent from richmond stp is supplied as irrigation water for dairy pasture horticultural crops and playing fields of hawkesbury campus of western sydney university booth et al 2003 potable water was provided by the tap water placed at the experimental zone having the characteristics of drinking water of sydney from now on stww secondary treated wastewater atww advanced treated wastewater and tw tap water will be referred to mbr idal and control water used in the current work respectively 2 4 irrigation scheduling and climatic condition the seasons in sydney australia which is occupied by the temperate zone take place in the following sequence summer december to february autumn march to may winter june to august and spring september to november a weather station was installed at the study area to collect a wide range of climatic data irrigation interval and water amount were identified based on data from gs3 sensors in conjunction with the information from weather station loamy sand has been reported to have maximum field capacity fc and available water content awc of 19 and 9 respectively in an effort to avoid water stress to the grass and excess amount of water application soil moisture content was maintained between 15 and 20 over the period of the study fig 4 illustrates the irrigation water application for the columns and climatic condition in the area within the study period autumn 2016 summer 2017 due to changes in climatic conditions and water uptake of various grasses the amount and interval of irrigation varied over the seasons daily et evapotranspiration for kikuyu grass was calculated as allen et al 1998 e t k c e t 0 where et is kikuyu grass daily evapotranspiration mm day kc is monthly crop coefficient for kikuyu grass connellan 2013 and et0 is daily reference crop evapotranspiration mm day from weather station davis instruments 2006 irrigation waters were applied manually using three identical sprinklers monthly real crop evapotranspiration for each treatment can be calculated as e t r i l v w c where et is monthly grass evapotranspiration mm r is monthly rainfall recorded from weather station installed at the study area i is the amount of irrigation water applied monthly for different columns mm l is the amount of water leached out from the column within the month mm and vwc is column s soil moisture content difference for a selected month mm soil moisture content vwc for each column is the average of data recorded by gs3 sensors located in 100 300 and 500 mm depth of the column table 2 compares monthly real crop et for different treatments throughout the study fig 4 shows a good agreement between et recorded from weather station and average real crop et for autumn winter and spring however in the summer time the average real crop et stands noticeably higher than that of recorded from weather station the higher average real crop et in summer time can be attributed to the high grass production in summer compared to the other seasons particularly from the columns irrigated with stww and tw which may not be fully represented by the et from the weather station while calculating table 2 the following assumptions were made to obtain missing data points due to an extensive rainfall event on 4th and 5th june 2016 164 8 mm the collected leachate amount was not reliable to minimise the error et for june 2016 was taken as an average value between may and july 2016 due to some technical issue with the data logger there were some missing data for soil moisture content between 21st november and 25th december 2016 and also between 25th january and 5th february 2017 these data points were obtained through interpolation 2 5 kikuyu grass dry matter production grass from each column was harvested regularly every month and transferred to the laboratory for analyses after weighing and rinsing the fresh grass with distilled water it was spread into the metal trays and left at the room temperature for 48 h in a dust free environment before being placed into an oven of 70 c for almost 48 h until the weight of dried grass stays constant dried matter after weighing was ground and passed through the sieve of 0 5 mm for further analyses 2 6 soil water analysis for soil water analysis the columns were equipped with three ports at 10 30 50 cm depths fig 1 and soil water extractors adjacent to their gs3 sensors soil water samples were collected by the help of suction pumps from every depth once extracted samples were transferred to the laboratory for measuring the main characteristics ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured using the respective meters and then samples were prepared for total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and cation analysis persulfate method was used for simultaneous determination of tn and tp using k2s208 and naoh digestion at the end of the digestion tn and tp were analysed using the discrete analyser gallery thermoscientific in the form of nox n no2 and no3 and po4 3 respectively cations including calcium ca potassium k magnesium mg and sodium na were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent technology 700 series 2 7 soil analysis at the end of the experiment columns were dismantled by carefully separating the whole turf stem from the top soil and collecting the soils from different depths of the columns soils from depths of the columns were collected and transferred to the soil lab for the chemical analyses ec ph tn tp and soluble and exchangeable cations were the main parameters which were determined for soil samples soil analysis methods proposed by rayment and lyons 2011 were used to determine soluble and exchangeable cations ec in saturated extract ecse and ph in saturated extract phse 3 results and discussions 3 1 characteristics of irrigation waters table 3 lists the mean values of selected parameters for irrigation waters it can be seen that tn and tp values for stww due to the treatment type stand far higher than the two other waters sodium content for both treated wastewaters was similar however much higher than that of tw main cations concentrations vary from water to water and sodium adsorption ratio sar which indicates the ratio of na and two other main cations ca and mg is significantly higher in the treated wastewaters than that of tw due to considerably higher na concentration in treated wastewaters according to ayers and westcot 1985 with those ec and sar values the soil sodification risk is slight to moderate 3 2 applied irrigation water and nutrients cations loads on an average 70 18 and 45 l of various types of irrigation waters were applied for the columns throughout the autumn winter and spring respectively fig 5 however due to the differences in the yield of grass during the summer the amount of water applied to the columns varied from column to column with application of roughly 90 70 and 80 l for stww atww and tw columns respectively water applied was proportional to the yield rate from each column overall annually 229 208 and 219 l of stww atww and tw were applied to their respective columns total amount of tn tp and main cations applied via irrigation waters can be calculated using their average concentration and the amount of waters fig 5 applied to the columns throughout the seasons table 4 compares the annual amount of tn tp and main cations added to the columns via irrigation waters the column irrigated with stww received the highest amounts of tn and tp compared to two other irrigation waters due to presence of relatively high concentrations of these nutrients in stww kikuyu grass has been reported to grow well in soils fertilised with higher amounts of nitrogen and generally p present in the soil sufficient for its growth to achieve closer to its potential yield recommended annual application rate of 300 500 kg n ha needs to be supplied marais 2001 in the current study maximum application of n occurred via stww water with an annual amount of 235 kg n ha while for atww and tw waters this number was mere 12 and 9 kg n ha respectively in terms of total phosphorus annual application of 25 250 kg ha has been reported in various studies depending on the condition of the soil and purpose of the study fulkerson et al 1999 kemp 1976 1975 murtagh 1978 in the current study annual amounts of 71 5 18 and 5 kg ha were added to the columns irrigated with stww atww and tw respectively regarding cations it can be seen that soils irrigated with treated wastewaters received higher level of k and na compared to those of tw atww column has received the least amount of ca over the seasons on the other hand atww column received the highest amount of mg compared to the other two waters 3 3 observed kikuyu grass yield in spite of no fertiliser application in the current study annual yield of 16 241 7028 and 14 216 kg dm ha was achieved from the columns irrigated with stww atww and tw respectively reported dry matter yields for kikuyu grass vary amongst the studies and this has been attributed to various factors kemp 1975 reported kikuyu grass yield of 11 430 kg dm ha year which was substantially less than 30 000 kg dm ha year reported by colman 1971 kemp 1975 attributed this reduction to the reduced nitrogen application rate while colman 1971 applied 1120 kg of n ha year kemp 1975 used only 680 kg of n ha year hence nitrogen availability for kikuyu grass can impact on its growth quite significantly less yield achieved in the current study when compared to reported data from colman 1971 highlights the necessity of nitrogen application for higher production of kikuyu grass further the presence of moderate level of salinity can be listed as a limiting factor for achieving higher grass production evaporative demand day and night temperature salinity and defoliation interval have also been reported as some factors which can affect kikuyu grass production fulkerson et al 1999 ivory and whiteman 1978 murtagh 1978 muscolo et al 2003 monthly grass yields are given in fig 6 as seen in the figure the column irrigated with stww water had the highest grass yield particularly in summer compared to the two other columns the yield from the column irrigated with tw stood very close to the stww and the column irrigated with atww water resulted in the lowest yield close observation of fig 6 indicates that the grass yield from the atww column started to grow in a similar trend as two other columns within months march to october but failed to follow the increasing trend of two other columns leaving a big gap of dry matter yield amongst the treatments in summer time obtaining comparable grass yield from the column irrigated with tw despite the lack of sufficient nutrient level can highlight the limiting effect of na present in treated wastewaters for instance in case of stww in spite of containing noticeable nitrogen due to the level of salinity it could not help kikuyu to grow to its potential level similar scenario applies to atww with the coincidence of high salinity level and lack of nutrient which resulted in very low grass production however it should be noted that the growth rate of kikuyu can be significantly affected by various other factors such as temperature irrigation rainfall rate and soil fertility van der colf 2010 due to the same climatic conditions being applied to all columns in this study the significant differences between the yields can be attributed to the irrigation waters characteristics and the changes occurred in soil properties which will be discussed later in more details fig 7 compares seasonal grass yield from the current study and some previous studies allan et al 1997 ashwood et al 1992 fulkerson 2007 kemp 1975 an average actual yield of 12 000 kg dm ha has been reported from previous studies for kikuyu grass garcía et al 2014 3 4 extracted soil water ph soil waters ph from 10 cm depth of soil high root concentration area is shown in fig 8 ph for atww stands higher than the other two waters making the ambient conditions neutral to slightly alkaline the two other soil waters indicating a slightly acidic ambient high ph ambient of soil water in the column irrigated with atww can be attributed to the slightly high ph of irrigation water atww compared to others high concentration of main cations specially mg and lower level of nitrogen in the same soil can also be addressed for higher level of ph this feature of soil can be a limiting factor for kikuyu grass growth as ph 5 to 7 has been reported as the best range for kikuyu production clark 2007 dickenson et al 2004 3 5 extracted soil water ec an average seasonal value of soil water ec extracted from 10 cm depth of the soil is shown in fig 9 higher values of ec recorded for waters extracted from wastewater irrigated soils particularly from stww column due to its high concentration of na and this has happened mostly in summer time as a result of more water application soil irrigated with fresh water showed less change over the period of running the experiment obviously due to its lower amount of na in summer the top layer of soils where the concentration of root is high irrigated with stww and atww experienced an average ec amount of 3 25 and 2 ds m respectively these values are considered as slightly to moderate salinity level for soil seelig 2000 and kikuyu is classified as a grass type tolerant to this range of salinity havilah et al 2005 due to low content of nitrogen in atww water this level of salinity can impact the grass growth as a preventing factor to hinder the nutrient uptake of the plant 3 6 possible parameters impacting the grass yield 3 6 1 soil ph plant growth can be affected with soil ph in various ways break down and release of nitrogen by bacteria can be processed properly in the optimum ph range of 5 5 7 ph values below 5 5 can cause plant nutrients to be leached faster than those available in the soils within the 5 5 7 0 range soil structure also can be impacted with ph where the intensive acid or alkaline clay soils are tempted to become tight making the cultivation difficult ward 2015 ph values higher than 7 can cause reduction in plant production by limiting the availability of some plant nutrients for instance highest availability of phosphates to the plant takes place at a ph between 6 and 7 similarly some other nutrients such as iron manganese zinc copper and cobalt micro nutrients are in their minimum availability at a ph greater than 7 seelig 2000 over the time of study period soil saturated extract ph phse changed in different levels fig 10 shows the variation of phse among different soils and columns depths compared to the soil initial phse 5 9 column irrigated with stww did not change noticeably while tw column with a slightly decrease in phse experienced a moderate acidic conditions soil irrigated with atww witnessed a considerable increase in phse resulting in neutral to moderately alkaline ambient the increase in soil ph irrigated with atww water can be attributed to atww s slightly higher ph in availability of higher contents of cations as well as lack of nitrogen low rate of nitrification process compared to other sort of treated wastewater mohammad and mazahreh 2003 rusan et al 2007 schipper et al 1996 this range of ph as mentioned before is considered as a limiting factor for achieving high production of kikuyu grass as it is known to grow well in soil with moderate acidity where ph is in the range of 5 7 clark 2007 dickenson et al 2004 researchers have reported an inconsistency of soil ph when irrigated with wastewater gwenzi and munondo 2008 reported a 23 42 increase of ph in sandy soil irrigated with effluent for a period of 26 years they attributed this increase to the neutralising effect of effluent with near neutral ph 7 2 sparling et al 2006 reported an increase of up to 1 ph unit in the soil ph irrigated with secondary treated wastewater according to schipper et al 1996 soil ph experienced an increase as a result of irrigation with wastewater for a long time and the authors related this increase to the high level of cations such as na ca and mg in the wastewater used for irrigation purpose on the other hand some other researchers reported soil ph decrease as a result of wastewater application and they attributed this to the oxidation of organic compounds and nitrification of ammonium rusan et al 2007 mohammad and mazahreh 2003 found that ph decreased in the soil irrigated with wastewater and they attributed this to the process of nitrification due to the availability of high amount of ammonium in the wastewater which resulted of serving hydrogen ions in the soil rattan et al 2005 reported also an average 0 4 drop of ph in the soil irrigated with sewage due to the acidic characteristics of sewage effluents khan et al 2008 recorded no significant effect on soil ph irrigated with wastewater 3 6 2 soil ec saline soils due to including high levels of soluble salts can cause growth reduction and in some cases plant death soluble salts by affecting the osmotic potential of soil water can result in dehydration of plant cell seelig 2000 conventionally soils having a saturated extract electrical conductivity ecse over 4 ds m are defined ass saline soils however the criteria of the plant in terms of salinity tolerance play a key role where sensitive and highly tolerant plants can be affected at half and twice this salinity respectively bernstein 1975 kikuyu grass is categorised amongst plants moderately tolerant to salinity up to 4 ds m havilah et al 2005 in this study ecse although varied from column to column stood relatively below 2 5 ds m as seen in fig 11 a noticeable increase in ecse occurred in the top part of wastewater irrigated soils where ecse went up almost 5 times compared to the soil initial value 0 55 ds m although this level of salinity has not been reported as a limiting factor for kikuyu grass when it coincides with the lack of main nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous seems to play a limiting role for grass growth similar trend for ec behaviour in soil depth reported by lado and ben hur 2009 when they used treated domestic sewage as an irrigation source for sandy soil in contrast no considerable change occurred for the soil irrigated with fresh water tap water irrigated soil except a slight increase in the top 5 cm of the column dropped smoothly from the initial value and followed a flat trend 3 6 3 soil exchangeable cations exchangeable cations of soil are defined as those cations that can be exchanged by added cations thomas 1982 many of the nutrients used by plants are in the form of cations havilah et al 2005 the concentration of available cations in the soil and the balance between them can cause imbalances deficiency or toxicities there is a strong relationship between soil cation exchange capacity cec and physical structural stability chemical nutrient availability and biological microbial population characteristics of the soil khaledian et al 2017 therefore determination of exchangeable cations and the ratios between them can be of crucial importance in terms of crop production and soil suitability to achieve a proper yield results compared to the initial values table 1 showed a noticeable increase of exchangeable cations in all three columns soils in case of na the changes in soils from various depths were significantly higher in soils irrigated with wastewaters fig 12 depicts the variability of exchangeable ca k mg and na in top 10 cm soil despite the values the trends for exchangeable cations were very similar to soluble ones exchangeable ca and mg were the dominants amongst the other cations while na had the lowest level the highest amounts of elements were determined in top 10 cm soil which has been similarly reported by some other researchers when they used wastewater for irrigation purposes nyamangara and mzezewa 2001 rusan et al 2007 in terms of ca k and mg stww and tw followed very similar trends exchangeable k and mg for atww column stood far higher than the two other columns adequate amount of exchangeable ca k and mg has been reported as 5 10 0 3 0 6 and 1 6 me 100 g respectively havilah et al 2005 however sandy soils due to their specific texture normally have very low level of exchangeable cations exchangeable na for tw column was the lowest while stww column appeared to have the highest content of exchangeable na and atww column fall slightly behind that desirable percentage of exchange cations has been reported as 65 80 ca 10 15 mg 1 5 k and 0 1 na havilah et al 2005 percentage of different exchangeable cations in 10 cm soil depth is shown in fig 13 it can be seen that ca and mg for atww irrigated soil and na for soils irrigated with any types of treated waters stand far beyond the advised percentage 4 statistical analysis in this study due to the level of instrumentation involved experiments using a single column for each experimental treatment without replications condition was carried out as the columns used were of larger size and the study was carried out for a considerable length of time over one year period the data collected from single column here still provided time series data that can be analysed for statistical significance of findings from the study similar to current single column study there are single lysimeter studies reported in literature to understand water flow water use and crop growth for example jiang et al 2010 2008 used six lysimeters which were different in terms of soil physico chemical parameters to determine the water flow and bacterial transport in soil profile they equipped their lysimeters with tensiometers water content and temperature probes at various depths they reported their results based on the individual columns comparing various parameters between all six columns other studies with the similar size of the columns have been carried out to determine the soil hydraulic conductivity without any repetitions and the lysimeters were equipped with monitoring sensors at different depths choo and yanful 2000 duong et al 2012 gonçalves et al 2006 some other studies with larger size lysimeters were conducted with no repetitions basso and ritchie 2005 rasse et al 2000 since this was a non replicated study statistical analyses only could be presented carrying out simple t test to provide statistical significance of the observations made in this study between the columns over the time period table 5 statistically compares the differences between the selected two treatments and identifies whether it is extremely significant p 0 001 significant p 0 05 or insignificant p 0 05 as shown in table 5 grass dm yield monthly data when compared between stww and atww and between tw and atww showed significant differences as evidenced by the p values of below 0 05 over 12 months of study period also the t test analysis showed no significant difference between the yields achieved between stww and tw these results support the conclusions made in section 3 3 sar ec and na concentration in the soil which received treated wastewater appear to be significantly different from that of tap water p 0 05 this is expected as the treated water consists of high salts particularly sodium salts also as expected there are no significant differences in the values for sar ec and na concentration in the soil which received the treated wastewaters namely stww and atww p 0 05 this means that wastewater as irrigation water would contribute to the increase in the salinity of the soil in addition when similar test is carried out for soil ph values from 7 different depths of three columns it can be seen that all three columns are extremely significantly or significantly different from each other with p values 0 001 and 0 05 variation in soil ph under wastewater application and its impact on grass production has been discussed in section 3 6 1 thus the statistical analysis clearly indicates that the differences observed between the three treatments namely atww stww and tw are extremely significant or significant thereby highlighting that the conclusions drawn from this study are statistically significant 5 economic implications this study indicates that it is beneficial to supply recycled water just after secondary treatment rather than after advanced treatment this will yield savings in the capital and operating costs of the treatment plant in addition use of secondary wastewater can yield better crop production without the input of inorganic fertiliser thus there are several economic benefits of using secondary treated wastewater for irrigation petala et al 2006 reported an estimated cost of aus 0 60 m3 for the operation of advanced treatment for the reclamation of secondary municipal effluents sydney water s richmond stp supplies a daily average of 1770 m3 of atww for irrigation of parks farms and sports fields sydney water 2018 therefore irrigation water supplied from stww can save aus 1 062 day aus 387 630 yr this amount only includes the savings in operating cost and does not include savings in the capital and other expenditures such as fertilisers again the above saving is for the year 2006 current savings will be 20 to 25 higher due to inflation over the years the economic benefit estimated here is an approximate saving more rigorous analysis is required to estimate the true benefits of using secondary treated wastewater for irrigation 6 conclusions use of treated wastewater recycled water for irrigation purpose provides plants with continuous supply of nutrients in low concentrations compared to common fertiliser application which usually happens in seasonal intervals with addition of intensive nitrogen and phosphorus to the soil while some researchers have indicated that using secondary treated wastewater stww should be accompanied by fertiliser to avoid any adverse effect on several types of crops kikuyu grass appears to have grown well with stww as irrigation water without the use of inorganic fertilisers on the other hand kikuyu grass did not grow well when advance treated wastewater atww was applied nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in treated wastewaters can be considered to be the major factors for the difference in the yields observed with different types of water used for irrigation the high yield rate observed in the column irrigated with tap water tw highlighted the possibility of some other factors impacting on the yield rate one such factor could be the presence of low levels of cations particularly sodium in other words availability of an adequate amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in stww may have compensated for the moderate levels of sodium in the recycled water as kikuyu is known for its moderate tolerance for salinity some other factors can also affect the growth of kikuyu grass form the soil irrigated with atww one such factor is high soil ph particularly in the top soil layer of atww irrigated column this high ph could be due to slightly high ph of atww and high concentration of magnesium and low concertation of nitrogen the ph observed for atww irrigated column was outside the optimum ph range for kikuyu grass growth which has been reported to be in the range of 5 7 the observed results were shown to be statistically significant therefore it can be concluded that the use of secondary treated wastewater for turf grass irrigation in urban areas and recreational facilities can yield several benefits mainly there are four benefits i savings in both capital and operating costs associated with the wastewater treatment ii savings in the inorganic fertilisers that is normally applied on the open fields iii savings in the precious town water and iv prevention of nutrient rich wastewater effluent and fertiliser laden urban runoff joining the natural water courses approximate saving in operating cost for sydney s richmond sewage treatment plant was estimated as aus 387 630 yr it must be emphasised that further research with appropriate replication of treatments is required to quantify all the benefits in detail acknowledgements the authors wish to acknowledge the pennant hills golf club operators in particular kurt dahl and richard kirkby of permeate partners pty ltd for
