3020,selenium se sorption behaviors have been widely studied for evaluating radionuclide reactive transport in fractured granite however with disparate mineral compositions the impact of fracture filling materials ffms is often ignored in characterizing radionuclide sorption and migration this study aims to investigate the contribution of ffms to the sorption of radionuclide by conducting flow through experiments with granite ffms and their mixtures gfms separately the relative contribution of major minerals in these materials is further identified by column experiments with pure minerals taking the granite core samples collected from a potentialrepositorysite as an example the se iv sorption and migration is mainly influenced by biotite and albite in granite samples and is controlled by smectite and illite in ffms the sorption distribution coefficient k d estimated from the individual mineral experiments decreased in the following order smectite illite biotite k feldspar albite quartz calcite when all minerals were mixed the sorption ability increased with the mass fraction of ffms the component additivity model cam was further tested by predicting k d in different mineral mixtures the calculated k d values were lower than those obtained from experimental fitting results the largest discrepancy occurred when the mass fractions of the granite and ffms were equal this implies that cam has certain limitations in upscaling k d directly from individual minerals to mineral mixtures especially when the mass fraction of ffms is larger than 0 2 the results from this study provide valuable insights for understanding the sorption behaviors of radionuclides in fractured granite keywords granite minerals fracture fillings se iv sorption mineral mixtures data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction deep geological repositories are facilities constructed to dispose of spent nuclear fuel at depths of hundreds of meters ewing 2015 they can perpetually isolate the high level radioactive waste hlw from the biosphere and surface environment with passive barriers dai et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 as a kind of igneous rock with extremely low matrix porosity granite has been verified as a stable natural barrier that prevents radionuclide release from repositories muuri et al 2016 samper et al 2006 however natural granite usually develops connected fractures during long term geological processes which are highly permeable as major potential radionuclide transport pathways wels et al 1996 in fractures secondary minerals are often formed by weathering due to groundwater chen et al 2020 the fracture filling materials ffms with these secondary minerals have different chemical properties compared to the granite minerals and play an essential role in radionuclides sorption and transport in fractured rock tickenor and vandergraaf 1989 in view of mineral compositions granite mainly consists of k feldspar albite mica and quartz while ffms are primarily composed of clay minerals carbonates or metal oxides chen et al 2021 dittrich and reimus 2016 drake et al 2012 due to the differences in mineral compositions ffms have a strong cation exchange capacity and perform a significant sorption capacity for radionuclides compared to granite baik et al 2009 samper et al 2016 in particular the contents of clay minerals hydroxyl ferric oxide or pyrite in ffms are higher than those in granite missana et al 2009 previous studies showed that laumonite had a positive retention effect on the sorption of u iv baik et al 2004 dittrich et al 2015 found that u iv had a long desorption tails behavior on ffms at the grimsel test site however there are few reports about the influence and degree of ffms on the sorption ability of radionuclides in granite fractures therefore understanding the sorption behaviors of radionuclides in granite ffms is vital for the long term safety assessment of hlw repository hu et al 2022 soltanian et al 2015a 2017 theradionuclideselenium 79 a fission product of spent nuclear fuel is a key contributor to the long term hazards of hlw repositories it has great potential to be released into the biosphere with a final exposure does that over the maximum contamination level due to its long half life 3 77 105 y and high mobility ervanne et al 2016 ma et al 2014 hence 79se iv was utilized to reveal the sorption of radionuclides on the granite matrix and ffms on the fracture surface the mobility of se in the subsurface is primarily determined by its oxidation states including ii i 0 iv and vi lehto and hou 2011 in highly reducing conditions oxidation states i and ii dominate and usually exist in low mobility solids such as fese2 and fese yang et al 2018 under oxidized geochemical environment the se generally exists in the oxidation state of iv and vi its chemical state is mainly selenite seo3 2 or selenate seo4 2 with higher solubility scheinost and charlet 2008 several reports have shown that selenate has a very weak sorption behavior for geological materials geng et al 2020 missana et al 2009 to observe the sorption behavior of selenium on the minerals more easily during our experiment processes we select the oxidation state se iv as chemical species to analyze the se sorption behaviors of granite and ffms previous researchers have studied 79se iv sorption behaviors based on batch sorption experiments with various minerals he et al 2019 hou et al 2015 li et al 2018 2020 missana et al 2009 granite geng et al 2020 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2018 and sediments ma et al 2021a sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 under different physiochemical conditions the results demonstrate that the sorption of se iv dramatically relies on the types of reactive media and related geochemical properties he et al 2017 for example ticknor et al 1996 showed that the sorption behavior of se iv decreases in the order of granite smectite biotite goethite hematite li et al 2018 found that the sorption distribution coefficient k d values of se iv on the minerals or rocks in the grimsel test site switzerland ascends in the order of quartz k feldspar grimsel granodiorite plagioclase biotite to explore the sorption behavior from minerals to rocks it is necessary to introduce a reactive mineral facies based conceptual model rmfs conceived by deng et al 2013 as described in fig 1 taking the host rock granite in geological disposal as an example the rmfs assumed that the granite has different characterizations in different spatial scales from the large to small scale the host rock represents reactive mineral facies and is composed of reactive mineral assemblages in the middle scale furthermore the mineral assemblages consist the single reactive minerals the k d of nuclides on the multi scale reactive mineral facies differed by several orders of magnitude and had a certain relationship on the spatial scale the upscaling of k d from minerals to mineral assemblage is influenced by many factors including the type of various minerals mass fractions and interactions between adsorbing minerals dai et al 2012 soltanian et al 2015b however few studies have quantitatively examined the relationship between the k d of nuclides on mineral assemblages and the k d of nuclides on single minerals that composed of the mineral assemblage the study aims to 1 investigate the contribution of single minerals that composed of granite and ffms on the sorption of 79se iv 2 explore the effect of ffms on the 79se iv sorption behavior in granite fractures and 3 discuss whether the k d of integral granite and ffms can be described from the k d of their composed minerals as the single minerals are powdery we choose mineral mixtures that composed of these single minerals to represent mineral assemblages in our experiments taking the fractured granite rock from beishan potential repository site in china as a sample paralleled column transport experiments of 79se iv were conducted with crushed minerals and mineral mixtures three types of the mixture were designed respectively with component minerals in granite ffms and combined materials of these two then the two site sorption model is used to quantitatively describe the sorption experimental data and model the sorption parameters inversely finally the component additivity model cam is introduced to determine the relationship between the k d of mineral mixtures and the k d of minerals that constitute the mineral mixture our results will provide essential insights into evaluating the sorption and migration behavior of se iv in fractured granite systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 geological materials the fractured granite was collected from a drill hole at approximately 530 m depth in china s western potential repository site to determine the mineral compositions of granite matrix and ffms within the fracture the materials were first finely ground into about 200 mesh with a mortar and then assessed by the powder x ray diffraction xrd rigaku d max 2700 the xrd results are shown in fig 2 and table 1 albite quartz k feldspar and biotite are the main minerals of granite while ffms are mainly composed of calcite smectite illite k feldspar albite and quartz since the minerals in granite and ffms are not easily separated the minerals used in the experiment were pure minerals purchased the sorption of these minerals was tested with particle sizes of 0 15 0 178 mm in the sorption experiment specific surface area ssa of different minerals and granite was characterized by the n2 bet method the ssa data of albite quartz k feldspar biotite and granite measured by experiments were 0 537 0 052 0 542 2 905 and 0 497 m2g 1 respectively the ssa data of illite and smectite obtained in previous studies were 97 m2g 1 and 33 m2g 1 respectively huertas et al 2000 as the volume of ffms in granite core is limited the ffms used in the experiment were synthesized by pure minerals based on the mass fraction of each mineral in addition four different mass ratios mixtures 10 1 5 1 3 1 and 1 1 between the granite and ffms were also prepared to investigate the impact of filling materials on sorption behavior in granite fracture 2 2 synthetic groundwater and selenium to simulate field conditions a synthetic groundwater was prepared in the experiment the groundwater composition was consistent with that from the same drill hole at a depth of approximately 550 m chen et al 2020 the anionic and cationic concentrations of the composition were determined by ion chromatography ic and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes separately table 2 na2seo3 in 2 mol l hno3 was used for column transport experiments by mixing synthetic groundwater with na2seo3 solution a 1 26 10 4 m se solution was prepared as initial injecting solution icp oes standard the nabr solution 2 50 mm br was co injected as a conservative tracer to determine the residence time and dispersivity in the column experiments ic standard a relative low concentration of se was set to simulate a potential se leakage scenario from the repository 2 3 column transport experiments all column transport experiments were performed under aerobic condition at room temperature 23 1 c the polyethylene columns were devised as 6 cm lengths with 1 cm diameter the columns were packed with 1 0 g of minerals or mineral mixtures the top and bottom of each column were covered with quartz sand as a non adsorbent filler material in particle sizes of 0 38 0 55 mm the used particle size was considered to ensure uniform flow in the column and to prevent the loss of minerals powder from the bottom meanwhile our pre experiments showed that the quartz sand of selected particle size was barely adsorb se iv thirteen parallel column transport experiments were conducted including seven groups of minerals albite quartz k feldspar biotite calcite smectite and illite and six groups of mineral mixtures granite ffms and four kinds of granite fracture fillings mixtures with mass ratios of 10 1 5 1 3 1 and 1 1 named g10 f g5 f g3 f and g1 f respectively the setting of column experiments is shown in fig 3 the se bearing and se free groundwater solutions were driven by the peristaltic pump into the reaction column at a rate of 1 0 ml h to shrink the potential air bubbles gathering in the column the column effluent samples were collected by automatic fraction collector sbs 100 filled with 10 100 mm polystyrene tubes the schematic of all column transport experiments was exhibited in fig 4 before the experiment the columns were rinsed with se free groundwater solution of ph 7 34 for two days to ensure that the ph in the effluent was stable then the influent solution was switched to se bearing groundwater solution with ph 7 28 containing 1 26 10 4 m se and 2 50 10 3 m br after five hours the influent solution was replaced again with se free groundwater solution to flush the fracture until the end of the experiment each experiment lasted for 24 h and the mass of the collected samples was weighed with a digital balance to ensure the actual flow rate 2 4 transport modeling approach the two site sorption model selim et al 1987 van genuchten and wagenet 1989 šimůnek and hopmans 2002 implemented in hydrus 1d was used to interpret the column experiments data cao et al 2021 florido et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 the model assumes that the adsorbent solute is affected by sorption kinetics during the process of transport and the sorption behavior takes place at two types of sorption sites one is the instantaneous sorption sites type 1 sites e described by the equilibrium sorption model the other is the non instantaneous sorption sites type 2 sites k limited by the first order kinetic rate the total sorption concentration of the adsorbent solute s can be described as 1 s s e s k 2 s e f s 3 s k 1 f s where s e and s k are the solute concentration adsorbed at the type 1 and type 2 sites mol l respectively f is the fraction of exchange sites assumed to be in equilibrium with the solute concentration the governing equations in the column experiment model were the following eq 4 for the mobile aqueous phase with eqs 5 and 6 for surface sorption 4 c t d 2 c x 2 v c x ρ b θ s e t s k t 5 s e t f k d β c β 1 1 η c β 2 c t 6 s k t α 1 f k d c β 1 η c β s k where c is the concentration in the aqueous phase mol l t is the time h d is the dispersion coefficient cm2 h v is the mean pore velocity cm h x is the distance cm pb is the bulk density of solids g cm3 θ is the water content k d is the distribution coefficient cm3 g βis the freundlich exponent n is the langmuir coefficient cm3 g and α is the first order rate constant h 1 when relevant symbols appear again in the result and discussion sections their meanings are consistent with those in this section the model approach attempted to use a few reaction parameters and two sorption sites to match column experiments data based on the inverse module in hydrus 1d šimůnek and hopmans 2002 the transport parameters d and v are obtained by fitting the bromine ion breakthrough curves the reaction parameters kd α β n and the proportion of sorption type 1 sites f are obtained by matching the experimental data of se the resulting parameters obtained from different minerals and mineral mixtures were compared to gain additional insights into quantitatively describing the contribution of mainly adsorbed minerals and parameters scaling 2 5 calculation of the adsorbed se iv amount during the 5 hour pulse period of the column experiment the amount of adsorbed se iv on minerals and mineral mixtures as can be expressed as follows wang et al 2021a 7 a 0 c 0 v 1 8 a t 1 0 v 1 c t dv and a t 2 v 1 v 2 c t dv 9 a s a 0 a t 1 a n d a r a s a t 2 where a 0 refers to the total se iv amount flowing into the column during the experiment mg a t 1 corresponds to the amount of se iv flowing out from the experimental column during the pulse period mg a t 2 is the amount of se iv flowing out from the experimental column during the elution period named desorption amount mg c 0 and c t are se iv concentrations in the influent and effluent mol l respectively v 1 and v 2 refer to the total volume of liquid flowing out from the column at the end of the pulse period and elution period l respectively ar is the amount of se iv remaining in the column at the end of the experiment and is referred to as the residual amount mg r 1 is defined as the se iv sorption ratio in the column at the end of the pulse period r 1 a s a 0 r 2 is defined as the se iv residual ratio in the column at the end of the experiment r 2 a s a r 3 result and discussion 3 1 se iv sorption on minerals the sorption behaviors of individual minerals that formed granite and ffms were firstly determined in experiments the se iv experimental data of minerals and best fit are shown in fig 5 transport parameters d and v were obtained by fitting the br breakthrough data the reactive parameters correlating with se iv breakthrough curves btcs are listed in table 3 as shown in fig 5 the btcs of se iv in various minerals display different trends indicating that different minerals have diverse sorption abilities for se iv compared to minerals a g the peak of btc for smectite fig 5f was the lowest and that for calcite fig 5g was the highest in addition a significant delay and tailing in the pulse and elution periods were observed in the btc for smectite while the btc for calcite almost had no delay or tailing result such phenomena indicated that smectite has the largest retention ability for se iv while calcite has the smallest in the 5 hour pulse period when the c c0 peak for the mineral reaches more than 0 95 it means that the sorption capacity of the mineral for se iv reaches the maximum zang et al 2019 among all minerals only the c c0 peak for calcite and quartz reached 0 95 at 1 h and 4 h respectively the c c0 peak of smectite and illite only reached about 0 80 the results showed that the sorption ability of the minerals for se iv is as follows smectite illite biotite k feldspar albite quartz calcite which is consistent with previous studies wang et al 2021a missana et al 2009 the reason for this result may be that the number of sorption sites controlled the se iv sorption behaviors on minerals the greater the number of sorption sites on the mineral are the stronger the sorption ability fan et al 2014 dzene et al 2015 the number of sorption sites of minerals can be characterized by the cation exchange capacity it is reported the exchange capacity of smectite illite biotite feldspar granite and quartz is about 102 22 5 10 7 5 0 4 1 and 0 01 meq 100 g respectively baeyens and bradbury 2004 huertas et al 2000 li et al 2018 missana et al 2009 hence the order of se iv sorption ability on minerals is considered reasonable before the end of the 5 hour pulse period all btcs included a dramatically increase stage within the first 2 h and a slow increase stage in the period of 2 5 h fig 5 this trend suggested that it is reasonable to use the two site sorption model theory to explain the se iv sorption migration behavior on various minerals as shown in fig 5h the sequence of the adsorbed se iv amount a s on different minerals under the 5 h pulse period is consistent with the results obtained from the c c0 peak of the btcs in fig 5a fig 5g the a s of smectite 3 99 10 2 mg is almost one order of magnitude greater than that of calcite 0 58 10 2 mg the se iv sorption ratio r 1 in all minerals ranged from 11 66 to 79 85 the desorption amount of biotite a t 2 1 92 10 2 mg was larger than that of illite 1 77 10 2 mg while the a s of biotite 2 09 10 2 mg was less than that of illite 2 11 10 2 mg the phenomena indicated that minerals with strong sorption ability might not have a strong desorption ability one reasonable explanation is that biotite has more proportion of instantaneous sorption sites than illite table 3 which promotes the elution of se iv adsorbed on biotite at a faster rate in the se free elution period compared among minerals fig 5h the residual ratio of albite r 2 was the highest at the end of the experiment which implied that albite played a crucial role in the retention for se iv in addition the residual ratios of se iv on quartz and calcite were almost zero which suggested that the sorption process of se iv on quartz and calcite was reversible as shown in table 3 the d of clay minerals such as smectite illite were smaller than that of other minerals which meant that they had more remarkable immobilization ability for se iv the model fitting results for smectite exhibited the largest k d 5 80 cm3g 1 the largest f 0 75 and a minimum α 0 04 h 1 smectite has the highest sorption ability for se iv the order of k d obtained from the two site model was smectite illite biotite k feldspar albite quartz calcite which maintained a similar level with the results obtained from the c c0 peak of minerals in addition the ssq ranged from 0 003 to 0 038 implying the two site sorption model matched the se iv breakthrough results in minerals column experiments well 3 2 se iv sorption on mineral mixtures 3 2 1 granite and ffms to understand the se iv sorption ability on mineral mixtures column transport experiments of se iv on granite and ffms were conducted as shown in fig 6 the c c0 peak of the btc for granite reached 0 92 at 2 5 h while the c c0 peak of the btc for ffms reached 0 90 at 5 h it meant that ffms have a stronger retardation ability for se iv this conclusion was further supported by table 4 where the k d of ffms was roughly three times that of granite in addition the amount of se iv adsorbed on ffms was nearly twice that of granite after the 5 hour pulse period fig 6 however the desorption amount of ffms was about three times that of granite at the end of the elution period resulting in the residual rate of granite being larger than that of ffms in the whole transport process it implied that ffms have stronger sorption and desorption abilities compared to granite the deeper reason is the difference in mineral compositions between granite and ffms unlike granite ffms contain smectite and illite with stronger sorption ability fig 5h accounting for about 40 simultaneously ffms have a larger proportion of the instantaneous sorption sites f 0 47 in comparison with granite table 4 the ssq ranged from 0 006 to 0 043 indicated that the two site sorption model could successfully match the experimental data for se iv on granite and ffms well 3 2 2 granite fracture fillings mixtures to evaluate the effects of ffms on se iv sorption in granite it is crucial to investigate the se iv sorption behavior in granite fracture filling mixtures gfms columns with different mass ratios gfms with the mass ratios of granite to ffms of 10 1 5 1 3 1 and 1 1 were named g10 f g5 f g3 f and g1 f respectively for the four btcs the c c0 peak significantly decreased from 0 95 g10 f 0 92 g5 f 0 91 g3 f to 0 85 g1 f corresponding to the time reached the c c0 peak was 3 3 3 5 and 5 h respectively fig 7 in addition the time required to reach the c c0 peak for the four btcs was always longer than that for pure granite fig 6a 2 5 h for granite the c c0 peak for g1 f was smaller than that obtained from the btc of pure ffms fig 6b 0 9 for ffms which indicated that ffms clearly enhance the retardation ability of se iv to granite when the mass ratio of ffms to granite was 1 1 the retardation ability for se iv reached the maximum and was stronger than that of pure ffms two reasons may contribute to such phenomena 1 there is an interaction between granite and ffms 2 the surface of each mineral has changed after minerals mixing and co equilibration at the end of the 5 hour pulse period the adsorbed se iv amount was 1 33 10 2 mg on g10 f 1 34 10 2 mg on g5 f 1 77 10 2 mg on g3 f and 2 02 10 2 mg on g1 f corresponding to the sorption ratio of 26 56 26 93 35 43 and 40 36 respectively fig 7e compared with pure granite and ffms in fig 6c the adsorbed se iv amounts and sorption ratios of all gfms were between the two at the end of the elution period the se iv desorption amount was 1 33 10 2 mg on g10 f 1 34 10 2 mg on g5 f 1 69 10 2 mg on g3 f and 1 74 10 2 mg on g1 f corresponding to the residual ratio of 0 0 51 4 62 and 13 97 respectively fig 7e the phenomenon indicated that the sorption and desorption abilities of the mineral mixtures for se iv were enhanced with the increase of ffms content however the difference was not noticeable when the content of ffms was small compared to pure granite fig 6c the residual ratios for the mineral mixtures of granite fracture filling materials have a lower residual ratio for se iv one possible reason was that the surface structure of the granite changed after adding some ffms and the degree becomes more significant with the content increase stronger sorption ability of ffms causes most of se iv to concentrate on the ffms with lower residual ratio for g1 f the k d was roughly three times that of g10 f which verified that the se iv sorption ability for gfms is greatly enhanced with the increase of ffms content table 5 in addition the k d observed on g1 f was significantly larger compared to that on pure ffms table 4 3 16 cm3g 1 for pure ffms the possible reason for this phenomenon was that pure ffms contained a large number of clay minerals such as illite and smectite which could gather together to form a larger polymer in the experimental process these polymers may reduce the number of sorption sites exposed to the mineral surface and further hinder the sorption of se iv on pure ffms hence more sorption sites will appear when the mass ratio of granite to ffms is 1 1 resulting in a larger k d 3 3 contribution of minerals to the se iv sorption on mineral mixtures for a mineral mixture composed of i minerals the contribution of each mineral to the amount of se iv adsorbed on the mineral assemblage is defined as the fractional contribution rate fsei which is calculated as follows wang et al 2014 10 f se i a i a tot 11 a i a t o t f i k d i i 1 n f i k d i where a tot is the total amount of se iv adsorbed on the mineral mixture mg a i is the amount of adsorbed se iv contributed by mineral i k d i is the se iv sorption k d on mineral i and f i is its mass fraction due to the mass fractions of minerals were different to facilitate the comparison between them the contribution rate per unit mass fraction f se i u is defined as the ratio between the fractional contribution rate and its mass fraction expressed as f se i u f se i f i by comparing it with 1 0 if f se i u 1 0 the contribution of mineral i to the amount of se iv adsorbed on the mineral mixture exceeds the average level the greater the value of f se i u is the stronger the contribution of the mineral taking granite as an example it contains four minerals when f se i u 1 0 the contribution of albite to the adsorbed se iv on granite is greater than 1 4 the contribution of each mineral to the amount of se iv adsorbed on different mineral mixtures is shown in fig 8 and table 6 in granite the f se i was 26 38 on k feldspar 43 72 on albite 12 86 on quartz and 17 05 on biotite corresponding to the f se i u of 1 15 1 09 0 48 and 1 70 respectively fig 8a the sorption ability of granite was closer to that of albite because the f se i of albite was the largest in granite the result suggested that albite may make an outstanding contribution to the amount of se iv adsorbed on granite due to its high content kikuchi et al 2015 meanwhile the f se i u of biotite was the largest on granite indicating that biotite also played a significant role in se iv sorption behavior table 6 this was followed by k feldspar albite and quartz which stayed in step with the ranking results of the sorption ability of each mineral for se iv as shown in fig 8b the f se i of k feldspar albite quartz illite smectite and calcite on ffms were 8 77 6 96 2 12 28 85 47 98 and 5 31 respectively except for calcite and quartz the order of f se i u of minerals was consistent with that of the f se i in ffms table 6 the results indicated that smectite and illite significantly affect the sorption of se iv on ffms in addition the f se i u of calcite was the smallest and nearly one order of magnitude lower than that of smectite which implied that the contribution of calcite to se iv sorption in ffms was feeble as shown in fig 8c the f se i of ffms in gfms exhibited progressively smaller increases with the increase of the mass fraction of ffms f ffms the f se i of ffms and granite in gfms were the same and up to 50 when f ffms 0 33 the f se i of granite was larger than that of the ffms when f ffms 0 33 on the contrary the f se i of ffms was greater among the four gfms albite occupied the largest mass fraction followed by quartz fig 8d moreover the mineral with the largest f se i was converted from albite to smectite with the increase of ffms content indicating that albite and smectite jointly controlled se iv sorption in gfms the f se i u in the four gfms were smecite illite biotite k feldspar albite quartz and calcite in order from large to small table 6 it was identical with the sequence of the sorption ability of minerals for se iv table 3 however albite had the largest contribution to the adsorbed se iv on g10 f at which the f se i of albite was 38 73 the result meant that the contribution of each mineral to the adsorbed se iv in the mineral mixture was not only related to its sorption ability but also depended on its mass fraction 3 4 parameter upscaling the component additivity model cam is introduced to determine whether the k d of mineral mixtures can be calculated from the k d of minerals that constitute the mineral mixture this method has been widely applied to interpret the sorption of nuclides or metal ions on mineral mixtures especially binary mineral mixtures jacquier et al 2001 tao and dong 2003 detailed calculated process for cam is shown in the following equations wang et al 2014 wang et al 2021b 12 k d m i x t u r e a f granite k d g r a n i t e f ffms k d f f m s 13 k d m i x t u r e b i 1 7 f i k d i where k d mixture a and k d mixture b are the se iv sorption distribution coefficients of mineral mixtures k d granite k d ffms and k d i are the se iv sorption k d on granite ffms and mineral i and f granite f ffms and f i are the respective mass fractions for a mineral mixture composed of seven minerals two calculation forms are obtained by cam named models a and b respectively equation 12 shows that model a uses granite and ffms as adsorbents in the mineral mixture while model b considers seven minerals as adsorbents in eq 13 as shown in fig 9 the k d mixture a and k d mixture b calculated by models a and b had a linear functional relationship with the mass fraction of ffms and the k d mixture a was always higher than k d mixture b in addition the k d of the mineral mixture calculated by cam whether k d mixture a or k d mixture b was lower than that from the experimental fitting results when the mass fraction of ffms was less than 0 20 the discrepancy between them was slight the discrepancy increased along with the mass fraction of ffms and reached the maximum when the mass ratio of granite to ffms was 1 1 such phenomena suggested that the cam has limitations in quantitatively modeling the k d of se iv sorption on mineral mixtures the deviation indicated that the se iv sorption ability of mineral mixtures is not simply superimposed by the sorption ability of minerals under different mass fractions to further discuss the performance of the cam on similar positively charged radionuclides the calculated k d of u iv sorption on quartz chlorite mineral mixtures was adopted in wang et al 2014 it was found the deviation of the cam from measurements as well observed and a similar largest deviation was appeared when the mass ratio of quartz to chlorite is 1 1 the difference from our results was that the k d calculated by cam were larger than the k d obtained by the experiment this was explained by that the trace amounts of brucite layer on chlorite can dissolve and release positively charged metal ions such as mg2 fe3 fe2 and al3 some of them may occupy the surface sites that would otherwise be used for uranyl sorption in the form of uo2 2 and uo2 oh at neutral ph especially those sites on negatively charged quartz in addition the loss of positively charged cation sites on chlorite also reduced the sorption of u vi on chlorite moreover wang et al 2021a verified that the sorption of cs followed the additivity rule on granite feldspar mixtures but had a certain deviation on granite biotite mixtures in the granite fracture fillings mixtures studied here the k d calculated by cam was smaller than that measured by the experiment it can be inferred that the k d has upscaling facts from minerals to mineral assemblages dai et al 2009 deng et al 2010 wolfsberg et al 2017 a few factors may be speculated to cause the noted effects 1 unlike the u iv though the se iv is positively charged it generally exists in the form of negatively charged seo3 2 in an aqueous solution at different ph values the charged reactions including protonation and hydroxylation of surface sites on the mineral surface can lead to different charged states of mineral surface sites he et al 2017 therefore the sorption mechanisms on the mineral surfaces are varied for cation and anion 2 particle particle interactions in the mixtures including dissolution reprecipitation sorption and heterocoagulation lead to changes in particle size distribution surface sites distribution and surface charge anderson and benjamin 1990a 1990b certain minerals contain metal elements e g mg fe al and ca especially for fe which can form fe iii oxyhydroxide adsorbed on the mineral surface under aerobic conditions the formed fe iii oxyhydroxide coatings have a strong sorption capacity for se iv through the formation of inner sphere complexes he et al 2017 fernandez martinez and charlet 2009 previous works have proved that a larger amount of fe iii o compounds on some minerals surfaces have a stronger sorption effect on se iv jan et al 2007 su and suarez 2000 these iron containing minerals may stem from the in situ granite powder of beishan drilling bs28 and minerals purchased from minerals companies the corresponding granite leaching experiment showed that the content of fe in the natural granite was 4 44 and mainly entered the aqueous solution in the form of fe2 at ph 7 chen et al 2020 3 the k d has strong chemical heterogeneity due to the heterogeneity of the spatial structure after mixing of different minerals ma et al 2021b zhang et al 2021 this phenomenon can be observed when the mass fractions of ffms in the mixtures were 0 and 1 for pure granite and ffms the calculated k d mixture b based on minerals were 1 85 and 2 90 cm3 g 1 while the k d based on experimental fitting results were 1 60 and 3 16 cm3 g 1 respectively 4 conclusions the se iv sorption and transport behaviors in granite and its fracture filling materials were discussed in the terms of column experiments and numerical simulations the impact of minerals and the contribution of filling materials were our concerns in this study the experimental results showed that the order of the se iv sorption ability of the minerals was smectite illite biotite k feldspar albite quartz calcite the quantitative contribution of single minerals in the mineral mixtures revealed that the se iv sorption ability of granite is similar to that of albite however the largest contributing mineral in granite is biotite smectite and illite were the main minerals that controlled se iv transport in ffms for the mineral mixtures composed of granite and ffms the sorption ability of se iv was non linear increased with increasing ffms contents among the four mixed granite filling materials the main contributing minerals were smectite and albite the additivity model based on sorption characteristics and various mass ratios of minerals has limitations in evaluating se iv sorption coefficients of mineral mixtures this method had a better performance when the mass fraction of ffms was less than 0 2 in the study case the results illustrated the importance of filling materials on the radionuclide sorption in granite fractures and lead to a deep understanding of se iv transport and sorption behaviors in multi scale fractured rocks credit authorship contribution statement xiaoying zhang

3020,selenium se sorption behaviors have been widely studied for evaluating radionuclide reactive transport in fractured granite however with disparate mineral compositions the impact of fracture filling materials ffms is often ignored in characterizing radionuclide sorption and migration this study aims to investigate the contribution of ffms to the sorption of radionuclide by conducting flow through experiments with granite ffms and their mixtures gfms separately the relative contribution of major minerals in these materials is further identified by column experiments with pure minerals taking the granite core samples collected from a potentialrepositorysite as an example the se iv sorption and migration is mainly influenced by biotite and albite in granite samples and is controlled by smectite and illite in ffms the sorption distribution coefficient k d estimated from the individual mineral experiments decreased in the following order smectite illite biotite k feldspar albite quartz calcite when all minerals were mixed the sorption ability increased with the mass fraction of ffms the component additivity model cam was further tested by predicting k d in different mineral mixtures the calculated k d values were lower than those obtained from experimental fitting results the largest discrepancy occurred when the mass fractions of the granite and ffms were equal this implies that cam has certain limitations in upscaling k d directly from individual minerals to mineral mixtures especially when the mass fraction of ffms is larger than 0 2 the results from this study provide valuable insights for understanding the sorption behaviors of radionuclides in fractured granite keywords granite minerals fracture fillings se iv sorption mineral mixtures data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction deep geological repositories are facilities constructed to dispose of spent nuclear fuel at depths of hundreds of meters ewing 2015 they can perpetually isolate the high level radioactive waste hlw from the biosphere and surface environment with passive barriers dai et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 as a kind of igneous rock with extremely low matrix porosity granite has been verified as a stable natural barrier that prevents radionuclide release from repositories muuri et al 2016 samper et al 2006 however natural granite usually develops connected fractures during long term geological processes which are highly permeable as major potential radionuclide transport pathways wels et al 1996 in fractures secondary minerals are often formed by weathering due to groundwater chen et al 2020 the fracture filling materials ffms with these secondary minerals have different chemical properties compared to the granite minerals and play an essential role in radionuclides sorption and transport in fractured rock tickenor and vandergraaf 1989 in view of mineral compositions granite mainly consists of k feldspar albite mica and quartz while ffms are primarily composed of clay minerals carbonates or metal oxides chen et al 2021 dittrich and reimus 2016 drake et al 2012 due to the differences in mineral compositions ffms have a strong cation exchange capacity and perform a significant sorption capacity for radionuclides compared to granite baik et al 2009 samper et al 2016 in particular the contents of clay minerals hydroxyl ferric oxide or pyrite in ffms are higher than those in granite missana et al 2009 previous studies showed that laumonite had a positive retention effect on the sorption of u iv baik et al 2004 dittrich et al 2015 found that u iv had a long desorption tails behavior on ffms at the grimsel test site however there are few reports about the influence and degree of ffms on the sorption ability of radionuclides in granite fractures therefore understanding the sorption behaviors of radionuclides in granite ffms is vital for the long term safety assessment of hlw repository hu et al 2022 soltanian et al 2015a 2017 theradionuclideselenium 79 a fission product of spent nuclear fuel is a key contributor to the long term hazards of hlw repositories it has great potential to be released into the biosphere with a final exposure does that over the maximum contamination level due to its long half life 3 77 105 y and high mobility ervanne et al 2016 ma et al 2014 hence 79se iv was utilized to reveal the sorption of radionuclides on the granite matrix and ffms on the fracture surface the mobility of se in the subsurface is primarily determined by its oxidation states including ii i 0 iv and vi lehto and hou 2011 in highly reducing conditions oxidation states i and ii dominate and usually exist in low mobility solids such as fese2 and fese yang et al 2018 under oxidized geochemical environment the se generally exists in the oxidation state of iv and vi its chemical state is mainly selenite seo3 2 or selenate seo4 2 with higher solubility scheinost and charlet 2008 several reports have shown that selenate has a very weak sorption behavior for geological materials geng et al 2020 missana et al 2009 to observe the sorption behavior of selenium on the minerals more easily during our experiment processes we select the oxidation state se iv as chemical species to analyze the se sorption behaviors of granite and ffms previous researchers have studied 79se iv sorption behaviors based on batch sorption experiments with various minerals he et al 2019 hou et al 2015 li et al 2018 2020 missana et al 2009 granite geng et al 2020 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2018 and sediments ma et al 2021a sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 under different physiochemical conditions the results demonstrate that the sorption of se iv dramatically relies on the types of reactive media and related geochemical properties he et al 2017 for example ticknor et al 1996 showed that the sorption behavior of se iv decreases in the order of granite smectite biotite goethite hematite li et al 2018 found that the sorption distribution coefficient k d values of se iv on the minerals or rocks in the grimsel test site switzerland ascends in the order of quartz k feldspar grimsel granodiorite plagioclase biotite to explore the sorption behavior from minerals to rocks it is necessary to introduce a reactive mineral facies based conceptual model rmfs conceived by deng et al 2013 as described in fig 1 taking the host rock granite in geological disposal as an example the rmfs assumed that the granite has different characterizations in different spatial scales from the large to small scale the host rock represents reactive mineral facies and is composed of reactive mineral assemblages in the middle scale furthermore the mineral assemblages consist the single reactive minerals the k d of nuclides on the multi scale reactive mineral facies differed by several orders of magnitude and had a certain relationship on the spatial scale the upscaling of k d from minerals to mineral assemblage is influenced by many factors including the type of various minerals mass fractions and interactions between adsorbing minerals dai et al 2012 soltanian et al 2015b however few studies have quantitatively examined the relationship between the k d of nuclides on mineral assemblages and the k d of nuclides on single minerals that composed of the mineral assemblage the study aims to 1 investigate the contribution of single minerals that composed of granite and ffms on the sorption of 79se iv 2 explore the effect of ffms on the 79se iv sorption behavior in granite fractures and 3 discuss whether the k d of integral granite and ffms can be described from the k d of their composed minerals as the single minerals are powdery we choose mineral mixtures that composed of these single minerals to represent mineral assemblages in our experiments taking the fractured granite rock from beishan potential repository site in china as a sample paralleled column transport experiments of 79se iv were conducted with crushed minerals and mineral mixtures three types of the mixture were designed respectively with component minerals in granite ffms and combined materials of these two then the two site sorption model is used to quantitatively describe the sorption experimental data and model the sorption parameters inversely finally the component additivity model cam is introduced to determine the relationship between the k d of mineral mixtures and the k d of minerals that constitute the mineral mixture our results will provide essential insights into evaluating the sorption and migration behavior of se iv in fractured granite systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 geological materials the fractured granite was collected from a drill hole at approximately 530 m depth in china s western potential repository site to determine the mineral compositions of granite matrix and ffms within the fracture the materials were first finely ground into about 200 mesh with a mortar and then assessed by the powder x ray diffraction xrd rigaku d max 2700 the xrd results are shown in fig 2 and table 1 albite quartz k feldspar and biotite are the main minerals of granite while ffms are mainly composed of calcite smectite illite k feldspar albite and quartz since the minerals in granite and ffms are not easily separated the minerals used in the experiment were pure minerals purchased the sorption of these minerals was tested with particle sizes of 0 15 0 178 mm in the sorption experiment specific surface area ssa of different minerals and granite was characterized by the n2 bet method the ssa data of albite quartz k feldspar biotite and granite measured by experiments were 0 537 0 052 0 542 2 905 and 0 497 m2g 1 respectively the ssa data of illite and smectite obtained in previous studies were 97 m2g 1 and 33 m2g 1 respectively huertas et al 2000 as the volume of ffms in granite core is limited the ffms used in the experiment were synthesized by pure minerals based on the mass fraction of each mineral in addition four different mass ratios mixtures 10 1 5 1 3 1 and 1 1 between the granite and ffms were also prepared to investigate the impact of filling materials on sorption behavior in granite fracture 2 2 synthetic groundwater and selenium to simulate field conditions a synthetic groundwater was prepared in the experiment the groundwater composition was consistent with that from the same drill hole at a depth of approximately 550 m chen et al 2020 the anionic and cationic concentrations of the composition were determined by ion chromatography ic and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes separately table 2 na2seo3 in 2 mol l hno3 was used for column transport experiments by mixing synthetic groundwater with na2seo3 solution a 1 26 10 4 m se solution was prepared as initial injecting solution icp oes standard the nabr solution 2 50 mm br was co injected as a conservative tracer to determine the residence time and dispersivity in the column experiments ic standard a relative low concentration of se was set to simulate a potential se leakage scenario from the repository 2 3 column transport experiments all column transport experiments were performed under aerobic condition at room temperature 23 1 c the polyethylene columns were devised as 6 cm lengths with 1 cm diameter the columns were packed with 1 0 g of minerals or mineral mixtures the top and bottom of each column were covered with quartz sand as a non adsorbent filler material in particle sizes of 0 38 0 55 mm the used particle size was considered to ensure uniform flow in the column and to prevent the loss of minerals powder from the bottom meanwhile our pre experiments showed that the quartz sand of selected particle size was barely adsorb se iv thirteen parallel column transport experiments were conducted including seven groups of minerals albite quartz k feldspar biotite calcite smectite and illite and six groups of mineral mixtures granite ffms and four kinds of granite fracture fillings mixtures with mass ratios of 10 1 5 1 3 1 and 1 1 named g10 f g5 f g3 f and g1 f respectively the setting of column experiments is shown in fig 3 the se bearing and se free groundwater solutions were driven by the peristaltic pump into the reaction column at a rate of 1 0 ml h to shrink the potential air bubbles gathering in the column the column effluent samples were collected by automatic fraction collector sbs 100 filled with 10 100 mm polystyrene tubes the schematic of all column transport experiments was exhibited in fig 4 before the experiment the columns were rinsed with se free groundwater solution of ph 7 34 for two days to ensure that the ph in the effluent was stable then the influent solution was switched to se bearing groundwater solution with ph 7 28 containing 1 26 10 4 m se and 2 50 10 3 m br after five hours the influent solution was replaced again with se free groundwater solution to flush the fracture until the end of the experiment each experiment lasted for 24 h and the mass of the collected samples was weighed with a digital balance to ensure the actual flow rate 2 4 transport modeling approach the two site sorption model selim et al 1987 van genuchten and wagenet 1989 šimůnek and hopmans 2002 implemented in hydrus 1d was used to interpret the column experiments data cao et al 2021 florido et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 the model assumes that the adsorbent solute is affected by sorption kinetics during the process of transport and the sorption behavior takes place at two types of sorption sites one is the instantaneous sorption sites type 1 sites e described by the equilibrium sorption model the other is the non instantaneous sorption sites type 2 sites k limited by the first order kinetic rate the total sorption concentration of the adsorbent solute s can be described as 1 s s e s k 2 s e f s 3 s k 1 f s where s e and s k are the solute concentration adsorbed at the type 1 and type 2 sites mol l respectively f is the fraction of exchange sites assumed to be in equilibrium with the solute concentration the governing equations in the column experiment model were the following eq 4 for the mobile aqueous phase with eqs 5 and 6 for surface sorption 4 c t d 2 c x 2 v c x ρ b θ s e t s k t 5 s e t f k d β c β 1 1 η c β 2 c t 6 s k t α 1 f k d c β 1 η c β s k where c is the concentration in the aqueous phase mol l t is the time h d is the dispersion coefficient cm2 h v is the mean pore velocity cm h x is the distance cm pb is the bulk density of solids g cm3 θ is the water content k d is the distribution coefficient cm3 g βis the freundlich exponent n is the langmuir coefficient cm3 g and α is the first order rate constant h 1 when relevant symbols appear again in the result and discussion sections their meanings are consistent with those in this section the model approach attempted to use a few reaction parameters and two sorption sites to match column experiments data based on the inverse module in hydrus 1d šimůnek and hopmans 2002 the transport parameters d and v are obtained by fitting the bromine ion breakthrough curves the reaction parameters kd α β n and the proportion of sorption type 1 sites f are obtained by matching the experimental data of se the resulting parameters obtained from different minerals and mineral mixtures were compared to gain additional insights into quantitatively describing the contribution of mainly adsorbed minerals and parameters scaling 2 5 calculation of the adsorbed se iv amount during the 5 hour pulse period of the column experiment the amount of adsorbed se iv on minerals and mineral mixtures as can be expressed as follows wang et al 2021a 7 a 0 c 0 v 1 8 a t 1 0 v 1 c t dv and a t 2 v 1 v 2 c t dv 9 a s a 0 a t 1 a n d a r a s a t 2 where a 0 refers to the total se iv amount flowing into the column during the experiment mg a t 1 corresponds to the amount of se iv flowing out from the experimental column during the pulse period mg a t 2 is the amount of se iv flowing out from the experimental column during the elution period named desorption amount mg c 0 and c t are se iv concentrations in the influent and effluent mol l respectively v 1 and v 2 refer to the total volume of liquid flowing out from the column at the end of the pulse period and elution period l respectively ar is the amount of se iv remaining in the column at the end of the experiment and is referred to as the residual amount mg r 1 is defined as the se iv sorption ratio in the column at the end of the pulse period r 1 a s a 0 r 2 is defined as the se iv residual ratio in the column at the end of the experiment r 2 a s a r 3 result and discussion 3 1 se iv sorption on minerals the sorption behaviors of individual minerals that formed granite and ffms were firstly determined in experiments the se iv experimental data of minerals and best fit are shown in fig 5 transport parameters d and v were obtained by fitting the br breakthrough data the reactive parameters correlating with se iv breakthrough curves btcs are listed in table 3 as shown in fig 5 the btcs of se iv in various minerals display different trends indicating that different minerals have diverse sorption abilities for se iv compared to minerals a g the peak of btc for smectite fig 5f was the lowest and that for calcite fig 5g was the highest in addition a significant delay and tailing in the pulse and elution periods were observed in the btc for smectite while the btc for calcite almost had no delay or tailing result such phenomena indicated that smectite has the largest retention ability for se iv while calcite has the smallest in the 5 hour pulse period when the c c0 peak for the mineral reaches more than 0 95 it means that the sorption capacity of the mineral for se iv reaches the maximum zang et al 2019 among all minerals only the c c0 peak for calcite and quartz reached 0 95 at 1 h and 4 h respectively the c c0 peak of smectite and illite only reached about 0 80 the results showed that the sorption ability of the minerals for se iv is as follows smectite illite biotite k feldspar albite quartz calcite which is consistent with previous studies wang et al 2021a missana et al 2009 the reason for this result may be that the number of sorption sites controlled the se iv sorption behaviors on minerals the greater the number of sorption sites on the mineral are the stronger the sorption ability fan et al 2014 dzene et al 2015 the number of sorption sites of minerals can be characterized by the cation exchange capacity it is reported the exchange capacity of smectite illite biotite feldspar granite and quartz is about 102 22 5 10 7 5 0 4 1 and 0 01 meq 100 g respectively baeyens and bradbury 2004 huertas et al 2000 li et al 2018 missana et al 2009 hence the order of se iv sorption ability on minerals is considered reasonable before the end of the 5 hour pulse period all btcs included a dramatically increase stage within the first 2 h and a slow increase stage in the period of 2 5 h fig 5 this trend suggested that it is reasonable to use the two site sorption model theory to explain the se iv sorption migration behavior on various minerals as shown in fig 5h the sequence of the adsorbed se iv amount a s on different minerals under the 5 h pulse period is consistent with the results obtained from the c c0 peak of the btcs in fig 5a fig 5g the a s of smectite 3 99 10 2 mg is almost one order of magnitude greater than that of calcite 0 58 10 2 mg the se iv sorption ratio r 1 in all minerals ranged from 11 66 to 79 85 the desorption amount of biotite a t 2 1 92 10 2 mg was larger than that of illite 1 77 10 2 mg while the a s of biotite 2 09 10 2 mg was less than that of illite 2 11 10 2 mg the phenomena indicated that minerals with strong sorption ability might not have a strong desorption ability one reasonable explanation is that biotite has more proportion of instantaneous sorption sites than illite table 3 which promotes the elution of se iv adsorbed on biotite at a faster rate in the se free elution period compared among minerals fig 5h the residual ratio of albite r 2 was the highest at the end of the experiment which implied that albite played a crucial role in the retention for se iv in addition the residual ratios of se iv on quartz and calcite were almost zero which suggested that the sorption process of se iv on quartz and calcite was reversible as shown in table 3 the d of clay minerals such as smectite illite were smaller than that of other minerals which meant that they had more remarkable immobilization ability for se iv the model fitting results for smectite exhibited the largest k d 5 80 cm3g 1 the largest f 0 75 and a minimum α 0 04 h 1 smectite has the highest sorption ability for se iv the order of k d obtained from the two site model was smectite illite biotite k feldspar albite quartz calcite which maintained a similar level with the results obtained from the c c0 peak of minerals in addition the ssq ranged from 0 003 to 0 038 implying the two site sorption model matched the se iv breakthrough results in minerals column experiments well 3 2 se iv sorption on mineral mixtures 3 2 1 granite and ffms to understand the se iv sorption ability on mineral mixtures column transport experiments of se iv on granite and ffms were conducted as shown in fig 6 the c c0 peak of the btc for granite reached 0 92 at 2 5 h while the c c0 peak of the btc for ffms reached 0 90 at 5 h it meant that ffms have a stronger retardation ability for se iv this conclusion was further supported by table 4 where the k d of ffms was roughly three times that of granite in addition the amount of se iv adsorbed on ffms was nearly twice that of granite after the 5 hour pulse period fig 6 however the desorption amount of ffms was about three times that of granite at the end of the elution period resulting in the residual rate of granite being larger than that of ffms in the whole transport process it implied that ffms have stronger sorption and desorption abilities compared to granite the deeper reason is the difference in mineral compositions between granite and ffms unlike granite ffms contain smectite and illite with stronger sorption ability fig 5h accounting for about 40 simultaneously ffms have a larger proportion of the instantaneous sorption sites f 0 47 in comparison with granite table 4 the ssq ranged from 0 006 to 0 043 indicated that the two site sorption model could successfully match the experimental data for se iv on granite and ffms well 3 2 2 granite fracture fillings mixtures to evaluate the effects of ffms on se iv sorption in granite it is crucial to investigate the se iv sorption behavior in granite fracture filling mixtures gfms columns with different mass ratios gfms with the mass ratios of granite to ffms of 10 1 5 1 3 1 and 1 1 were named g10 f g5 f g3 f and g1 f respectively for the four btcs the c c0 peak significantly decreased from 0 95 g10 f 0 92 g5 f 0 91 g3 f to 0 85 g1 f corresponding to the time reached the c c0 peak was 3 3 3 5 and 5 h respectively fig 7 in addition the time required to reach the c c0 peak for the four btcs was always longer than that for pure granite fig 6a 2 5 h for granite the c c0 peak for g1 f was smaller than that obtained from the btc of pure ffms fig 6b 0 9 for ffms which indicated that ffms clearly enhance the retardation ability of se iv to granite when the mass ratio of ffms to granite was 1 1 the retardation ability for se iv reached the maximum and was stronger than that of pure ffms two reasons may contribute to such phenomena 1 there is an interaction between granite and ffms 2 the surface of each mineral has changed after minerals mixing and co equilibration at the end of the 5 hour pulse period the adsorbed se iv amount was 1 33 10 2 mg on g10 f 1 34 10 2 mg on g5 f 1 77 10 2 mg on g3 f and 2 02 10 2 mg on g1 f corresponding to the sorption ratio of 26 56 26 93 35 43 and 40 36 respectively fig 7e compared with pure granite and ffms in fig 6c the adsorbed se iv amounts and sorption ratios of all gfms were between the two at the end of the elution period the se iv desorption amount was 1 33 10 2 mg on g10 f 1 34 10 2 mg on g5 f 1 69 10 2 mg on g3 f and 1 74 10 2 mg on g1 f corresponding to the residual ratio of 0 0 51 4 62 and 13 97 respectively fig 7e the phenomenon indicated that the sorption and desorption abilities of the mineral mixtures for se iv were enhanced with the increase of ffms content however the difference was not noticeable when the content of ffms was small compared to pure granite fig 6c the residual ratios for the mineral mixtures of granite fracture filling materials have a lower residual ratio for se iv one possible reason was that the surface structure of the granite changed after adding some ffms and the degree becomes more significant with the content increase stronger sorption ability of ffms causes most of se iv to concentrate on the ffms with lower residual ratio for g1 f the k d was roughly three times that of g10 f which verified that the se iv sorption ability for gfms is greatly enhanced with the increase of ffms content table 5 in addition the k d observed on g1 f was significantly larger compared to that on pure ffms table 4 3 16 cm3g 1 for pure ffms the possible reason for this phenomenon was that pure ffms contained a large number of clay minerals such as illite and smectite which could gather together to form a larger polymer in the experimental process these polymers may reduce the number of sorption sites exposed to the mineral surface and further hinder the sorption of se iv on pure ffms hence more sorption sites will appear when the mass ratio of granite to ffms is 1 1 resulting in a larger k d 3 3 contribution of minerals to the se iv sorption on mineral mixtures for a mineral mixture composed of i minerals the contribution of each mineral to the amount of se iv adsorbed on the mineral assemblage is defined as the fractional contribution rate fsei which is calculated as follows wang et al 2014 10 f se i a i a tot 11 a i a t o t f i k d i i 1 n f i k d i where a tot is the total amount of se iv adsorbed on the mineral mixture mg a i is the amount of adsorbed se iv contributed by mineral i k d i is the se iv sorption k d on mineral i and f i is its mass fraction due to the mass fractions of minerals were different to facilitate the comparison between them the contribution rate per unit mass fraction f se i u is defined as the ratio between the fractional contribution rate and its mass fraction expressed as f se i u f se i f i by comparing it with 1 0 if f se i u 1 0 the contribution of mineral i to the amount of se iv adsorbed on the mineral mixture exceeds the average level the greater the value of f se i u is the stronger the contribution of the mineral taking granite as an example it contains four minerals when f se i u 1 0 the contribution of albite to the adsorbed se iv on granite is greater than 1 4 the contribution of each mineral to the amount of se iv adsorbed on different mineral mixtures is shown in fig 8 and table 6 in granite the f se i was 26 38 on k feldspar 43 72 on albite 12 86 on quartz and 17 05 on biotite corresponding to the f se i u of 1 15 1 09 0 48 and 1 70 respectively fig 8a the sorption ability of granite was closer to that of albite because the f se i of albite was the largest in granite the result suggested that albite may make an outstanding contribution to the amount of se iv adsorbed on granite due to its high content kikuchi et al 2015 meanwhile the f se i u of biotite was the largest on granite indicating that biotite also played a significant role in se iv sorption behavior table 6 this was followed by k feldspar albite and quartz which stayed in step with the ranking results of the sorption ability of each mineral for se iv as shown in fig 8b the f se i of k feldspar albite quartz illite smectite and calcite on ffms were 8 77 6 96 2 12 28 85 47 98 and 5 31 respectively except for calcite and quartz the order of f se i u of minerals was consistent with that of the f se i in ffms table 6 the results indicated that smectite and illite significantly affect the sorption of se iv on ffms in addition the f se i u of calcite was the smallest and nearly one order of magnitude lower than that of smectite which implied that the contribution of calcite to se iv sorption in ffms was feeble as shown in fig 8c the f se i of ffms in gfms exhibited progressively smaller increases with the increase of the mass fraction of ffms f ffms the f se i of ffms and granite in gfms were the same and up to 50 when f ffms 0 33 the f se i of granite was larger than that of the ffms when f ffms 0 33 on the contrary the f se i of ffms was greater among the four gfms albite occupied the largest mass fraction followed by quartz fig 8d moreover the mineral with the largest f se i was converted from albite to smectite with the increase of ffms content indicating that albite and smectite jointly controlled se iv sorption in gfms the f se i u in the four gfms were smecite illite biotite k feldspar albite quartz and calcite in order from large to small table 6 it was identical with the sequence of the sorption ability of minerals for se iv table 3 however albite had the largest contribution to the adsorbed se iv on g10 f at which the f se i of albite was 38 73 the result meant that the contribution of each mineral to the adsorbed se iv in the mineral mixture was not only related to its sorption ability but also depended on its mass fraction 3 4 parameter upscaling the component additivity model cam is introduced to determine whether the k d of mineral mixtures can be calculated from the k d of minerals that constitute the mineral mixture this method has been widely applied to interpret the sorption of nuclides or metal ions on mineral mixtures especially binary mineral mixtures jacquier et al 2001 tao and dong 2003 detailed calculated process for cam is shown in the following equations wang et al 2014 wang et al 2021b 12 k d m i x t u r e a f granite k d g r a n i t e f ffms k d f f m s 13 k d m i x t u r e b i 1 7 f i k d i where k d mixture a and k d mixture b are the se iv sorption distribution coefficients of mineral mixtures k d granite k d ffms and k d i are the se iv sorption k d on granite ffms and mineral i and f granite f ffms and f i are the respective mass fractions for a mineral mixture composed of seven minerals two calculation forms are obtained by cam named models a and b respectively equation 12 shows that model a uses granite and ffms as adsorbents in the mineral mixture while model b considers seven minerals as adsorbents in eq 13 as shown in fig 9 the k d mixture a and k d mixture b calculated by models a and b had a linear functional relationship with the mass fraction of ffms and the k d mixture a was always higher than k d mixture b in addition the k d of the mineral mixture calculated by cam whether k d mixture a or k d mixture b was lower than that from the experimental fitting results when the mass fraction of ffms was less than 0 20 the discrepancy between them was slight the discrepancy increased along with the mass fraction of ffms and reached the maximum when the mass ratio of granite to ffms was 1 1 such phenomena suggested that the cam has limitations in quantitatively modeling the k d of se iv sorption on mineral mixtures the deviation indicated that the se iv sorption ability of mineral mixtures is not simply superimposed by the sorption ability of minerals under different mass fractions to further discuss the performance of the cam on similar positively charged radionuclides the calculated k d of u iv sorption on quartz chlorite mineral mixtures was adopted in wang et al 2014 it was found the deviation of the cam from measurements as well observed and a similar largest deviation was appeared when the mass ratio of quartz to chlorite is 1 1 the difference from our results was that the k d calculated by cam were larger than the k d obtained by the experiment this was explained by that the trace amounts of brucite layer on chlorite can dissolve and release positively charged metal ions such as mg2 fe3 fe2 and al3 some of them may occupy the surface sites that would otherwise be used for uranyl sorption in the form of uo2 2 and uo2 oh at neutral ph especially those sites on negatively charged quartz in addition the loss of positively charged cation sites on chlorite also reduced the sorption of u vi on chlorite moreover wang et al 2021a verified that the sorption of cs followed the additivity rule on granite feldspar mixtures but had a certain deviation on granite biotite mixtures in the granite fracture fillings mixtures studied here the k d calculated by cam was smaller than that measured by the experiment it can be inferred that the k d has upscaling facts from minerals to mineral assemblages dai et al 2009 deng et al 2010 wolfsberg et al 2017 a few factors may be speculated to cause the noted effects 1 unlike the u iv though the se iv is positively charged it generally exists in the form of negatively charged seo3 2 in an aqueous solution at different ph values the charged reactions including protonation and hydroxylation of surface sites on the mineral surface can lead to different charged states of mineral surface sites he et al 2017 therefore the sorption mechanisms on the mineral surfaces are varied for cation and anion 2 particle particle interactions in the mixtures including dissolution reprecipitation sorption and heterocoagulation lead to changes in particle size distribution surface sites distribution and surface charge anderson and benjamin 1990a 1990b certain minerals contain metal elements e g mg fe al and ca especially for fe which can form fe iii oxyhydroxide adsorbed on the mineral surface under aerobic conditions the formed fe iii oxyhydroxide coatings have a strong sorption capacity for se iv through the formation of inner sphere complexes he et al 2017 fernandez martinez and charlet 2009 previous works have proved that a larger amount of fe iii o compounds on some minerals surfaces have a stronger sorption effect on se iv jan et al 2007 su and suarez 2000 these iron containing minerals may stem from the in situ granite powder of beishan drilling bs28 and minerals purchased from minerals companies the corresponding granite leaching experiment showed that the content of fe in the natural granite was 4 44 and mainly entered the aqueous solution in the form of fe2 at ph 7 chen et al 2020 3 the k d has strong chemical heterogeneity due to the heterogeneity of the spatial structure after mixing of different minerals ma et al 2021b zhang et al 2021 this phenomenon can be observed when the mass fractions of ffms in the mixtures were 0 and 1 for pure granite and ffms the calculated k d mixture b based on minerals were 1 85 and 2 90 cm3 g 1 while the k d based on experimental fitting results were 1 60 and 3 16 cm3 g 1 respectively 4 conclusions the se iv sorption and transport behaviors in granite and its fracture filling materials were discussed in the terms of column experiments and numerical simulations the impact of minerals and the contribution of filling materials were our concerns in this study the experimental results showed that the order of the se iv sorption ability of the minerals was smectite illite biotite k feldspar albite quartz calcite the quantitative contribution of single minerals in the mineral mixtures revealed that the se iv sorption ability of granite is similar to that of albite however the largest contributing mineral in granite is biotite smectite and illite were the main minerals that controlled se iv transport in ffms for the mineral mixtures composed of granite and ffms the sorption ability of se iv was non linear increased with increasing ffms contents among the four mixed granite filling materials the main contributing minerals were smectite and albite the additivity model based on sorption characteristics and various mass ratios of minerals has limitations in evaluating se iv sorption coefficients of mineral mixtures this method had a better performance when the mass fraction of ffms was less than 0 2 in the study case the results illustrated the importance of filling materials on the radionuclide sorption in granite fractures and lead to a deep understanding of se iv transport and sorption behaviors in multi scale fractured rocks credit authorship contribution statement xiaoying zhang

3021,citizen science can fulfill the quest for high quality and sufficient environmental data such as rainfall however the factors affecting the quality of rainfall data collected by the citizen scientists are not well understood in this study we examined the effect of citizen scientists attributes on the quality of rainfall data for this purpose principal component analysis pca stepwise regression and multiple linear regressions mlr were used a quality control procedure was developed and applied for daily observed rainfall data collected in the summer rainy season of 2020 attributes of the citizen scientists were gathered for those who collected rainfall data in the urban and peri urban akaki catchment which is located in the upper awash sub basin ethiopia we found that easy to detect errors which were identified during the initial stage of quality control formed most of the errors in the rainfall data the pca and the stepwise regression results revealed that four dominant attributes education level gauge relative location use of smartphone app and supervisor s travel distance highly affected the rainfall data quality the mlr model using these four prominent dominant variables performed very well with r2 value of 0 98 the k fold cross validation result showed that the developed model can be used to predict the relationships between data quality and attributes of citizen scientists with high accuracy hence the pca technique stepwise regression and mlr model can provide useful information regarding the influence of citizen scientists attributes on rainfall data quality therefore future studies should carefully consider citizen scientists attributes when engaging and supervising citizen scientists with a comprehensive data quality control while monitoring rainfall keywords citizen science rainfall monitoring data quality principal component analysis variable selection multiple linear regression akaki data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction interest has emerged to explore the scope of citizen science cs for hydro meteorological monitoring zheng et al 2018 cs is the volunteered participation of the general public in scientific research buytaert 2014 it is initiated by the quest for high quality and sufficient environmental data to fill data gaps assumpção et al 2018 but it also constitutes for hydrologists an opportunity to integrate scientific social economic cultural political and administrative processes nardiet al 2022 moreover the data is used to force calibrate and validate hydrological models to simulate processes in environmental systems zheng et al 2018 starkey et al 2017 therefore cs rainfall monitoring can address the spatiotemporal sampling limitations wmo 2011 and fulfill the quest for high quality and sufficient hydro meteorological data starkey et al 2017 despite several advantages of cs there are valid concerns regarding the quality of the data collected by citizen scientists starkey et al 2017 downs et al 2021 bonney et al 2014 understanding the factors influencing the data quality is a prerequisite for their use in hydrological applications muller et al 2015 this concern raises a strong need for evidence about the quality of cs rainfall data and its usability despite the availability of various citizen science programs for rainfall monitoring limited research has been documented to assess data quality vos 2019 evaluated crowd sourced rainfall data from personal automatic weather stations attended by amateur backyard meteorologists the authors employed a quality control qc procedure with gauge adjusted radar data as a reference and employing spatial consistency checks using several indicators that include faulty zeroes high influx station outlier filter and bias correction similarly other researchers indicated the importance of proper set up of cs monitoring programs and frequent supervision to improve data quality walker et al 2016 shinbrot et al 2020 however there are only a few guidelines to support setting up cs programs and guide supervision of citizen scientists walker et al 2019 as a result the quality of the rainfall observations may be suffering and thus reducing confidence of the data users therefore concerted effort is required to build the confidence and trust of cs data users for example reputation system is a common approach in building trust between data users and the method has been explored in the context of crowdsourced rainfall data chen et al 2021 however such studies are rare and require further investigation in citizen science programs various rainfall data qc methods exist in literature for example neural networks were used for rainfall qc sciuto et al 2009 this method showed a slightly lower capability in recognizing incorrect data since it depends on the quality of the training dataset sciuto et al 2009 another qc method is the ground clutter echoes algorithm which was tested by golz et al 2006 for radar rainfall data quality control however this method cannot be used for conventional ground rain gauge networks since the algorithm is used to filter clutters and correct signal attenuations fehri et al 2020 used a statistical method for qc of cs rainfall data using data from national network as a reference they used several verification methods that are pearson correlation coefficient pcc mean error and student s t test comparing the means of two datasets examples of most used verifications metrics are pcc and bias systematic error walker et al 2016 fehri et al 2020 llabrés brustenga et al 2019 took advantage of progressive qc procedures for rainfall data progressive qc procedure involves gradually cleaning simple to detect errors most serious ones and then addressing the difficult or complex error types however they employed limited verification metrics to thoroughly assess the quality controlled data availability of reference data with adequate coverage is one of the constraints to conduct qc on cs data to overcome such constraints some qc studies employed secondary data source for validation of conventional and cs rainfall data golz et al 2006 de vos et al 2017 for instance walker et al 2016 adopted reanalysis and satellite rainfall estimates for validation since the conventional rain gauges were situated outside their study watershed reanalysis and satellite rainfall estimates have resolutions ranging from 5 km to 28 km that mismatches with the point scale of citizen science data this causes gauge representativeness error that makes it impossible to quantify the true error of the cs rainfall data tessema et al 2020 when reanalysis or satellite data are used as reference further satellite data are characterized by large systematic and random errors which indicates they are not appropriate reference data although not explored well in literature installation of multiple rain gauges at small separation distance in cs programs can serve qc check for cs data information on the nature of error and attributes of citizen science is needed to improve the quality of data collected by citizen scientists few studies were documented on the evaluation of error in the rainfall data from amateur citizen scientists and personal weather stations vos 2019 fehri et al 2020 those studies failed to address the nature of error in citizen science and inform efforts to improve data quality wiggins et al 2011 kosmala et al 2016 shinbrot et al 2020 additionally we hypothesized that a progressive qc method can be a key step to identify the dominant source of error in cs rainfall data and can provide useful input to the supervision of the citizen scientists however the effectiveness of this method has not been well explored furthermore the data quality can vary with volunteers attributes the volunteers motivation experience and demography are found to correlate with the quality of cs data lewandowski and specht 2015 although some authors reported inconsistent outcomes kosmala et al 2016 shinbrot et al 2020 however not much is known and documented about the effect of volunteers attributes on the quality of rainfall data collected by citizen scientists a different approach that monitors the scale of participation and volunteers skills can help to identify the type of supervision needed to ensure data quality there is a skepticism among professional scientists on the ability of citizen scientists to produce high quality datasets specht 2018 kosmala et al 2016 these concerns are highly related to the potential of the citizen scientists attributes to influence the quality of observed data crall et al 2011 lewandowsk and specht 2015 gunko et al 2022 for instance heigl and zaller 2016 indicated that volunteers educational level and long term commitment are key to data quality similarly a literature review by capdevila et al 2020 revealed that the knowledge and experience of the citizen scientists is one of the three factors determining the success of citizen science programs for water quality monitoring these attributes can be improved by training and ensuring long term engagement of citizen scientists studies used subjective evaluation or literature review and addressed citizen science programs designed for purposes other than rainfall monitoring quantitative evaluation can provide additional information on factors preventing citizen scientists from providing data that is fit for purpose an example of quantitative evaluation is the study by hunter et al 2013 who investigated trustworthiness to provide quality data through evaluation of various trust metrics hence there is a need for a more systematic investigation of the relationship between citizen scientists attributes and the quality of the rainfall data that they collect to our knowledge such efforts are rare in hydrology literature notwithstanding the helpful study conducted on filling critical rainfall data gaps using citizen science in mexico relevant to conservation policy design by shinbrot et al 2020 therefore this study applied data qc method and assessed the effect of citizen scientists attributes on the quality of citizen science rainfall data in akaki catchment ethiopia we applied a suite of methods including principal component analysis pca stepwise regression and multiple linear regression analysis mlr this study is new by its experiment in evaluating the scope of the cs approach in filling data gaps in a data scarce region the density of our rain gauge network in this study is greater than that of the ethiopian meteorology institute emi and most published cs rain gauge networks fehri et al 2020 walker et al 2016 the outcome of the study is expected to deepen our understanding on the quality of cs rainfall data and factors affecting it and its usability the study will also provide and inform efforts that are directed at meeting the data needs for sustainable development goals sdg 6 fritz et al 2019 urban drainage and flood risk management 2 study area this study was conducted in the akaki catchment the most developed and economically important part of the upper awash river basin fig 1 it is located in the central part of ethiopia along the western margin of the ethiopian rift valley between 8 46 9 14 n and 38 34 39 04 e the catchment is characterized with complex topography and elevation ranging between 2040 m and 3200 m above sea level a s l it drains an area of approximately 1500 km2 and terminates at the aba samuel reservoir the akaki is the principal source of water supply for the capital city addis ababa both fluvial and pluvial floods are common in the catchment bekele et al 2022 rainfall within akaki catchment is mainly modulated by the seasonal migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz seleshi 2004 about 70 of the annual rainfall occurs during the main rainy season in the summer kiremt from june to september the daily rainfall amount of the catchment has a moderate variation during kiremt and a higher variation during belg from february to april conway et al 2004 data from conventional meteorological stations in or near the catchments shows that its mean annual rainfall ranges from 900 mm to 1470 mm with the highest rainfall amounts occurring over the high elevation areas its monthly rainfall peaks in july and august with magnitudes between 250 mm and 300 mm low rainfall amounts occur from november to january the daily temperature ranges from 9 9 c to 24 5 c 3 materials and method in this study we set up a citizen science program for rainfall monitoring multiple methods were applied for quality control of the rainfall data from the cs program and factors affecting the data quality were evaluated this involved progressive approach for rainfall data quality control followed by principal component analysis pca stepwise regression and multiple linear regression analysis mlr pca and stepwise regression were employed to understand and select the most prominent explanatory variables attributes of citizen scientists influencing rainfall data quality respectively which were then used in mlr analysis further we employed polychoric correlation in the pca procedure to consider the ordinal variables effect in the analysis two main datasets were analyzed rainfall data collected by the citizen scientists and social and demographic attributes of the citizen scientists collected by the researchers ordinal scores were assigned to the rainfall data based on a quality control procedure 3 1 data sets 3 1 1 rainfall monitoring using the citizen science program volunteer community members as citizen scientists csts were recruited prior to the rainy season of 2020 a workshop was not organized to launch the program due to coronavirus disease covid 19 concerns during this study period however one to one meetings with safe distance and mobile phones were used to introduce the citizen science programme including equipment demonstration to the csts following guidelines for setting up a cs program see haile et al 2019 walker et al 2019 we considered the volunteers communication skills including writing listening and speaking the local language as the main criteria for recruitment availability of a cell phone was another criterion to allow supervision through telephone calls in addition to regular face to face supervision community members who met most of the criteria and lived within a few minutes walking distance from each gauging site were selected as csts equal opportunity was provided to men and women volunteers after identifying 32 candidate csts the benefits of rainfall data for water management and flood risk management were discussed with them then final selection of csts was made based on their willingness to participate in the rainfall data collection process education level above or equal to grade 4 age greater than 15 years old and residence relative location nearby the rain gauging station a total of 19 volunteered csts were finally selected among 32 candidates a monetary incentive and mobile airtime were transferred to the citizen scientists monthly the financial compensation for the time taken to conduct measurement and to cover costs of transmitting data was only one third of the monthly salary that the emi pays for its rainfall observers the financial incentive was considered necessary and right to motivate and prolong the cs program walker et al 2021 in this study citizen scientists were equipped with a low cost rain gauge that was fabricated using a graduated plastic cylinder the rain gauges were purchased from the emi of ethiopia the rain gauge has a 150 mm capacity an area of 400 cm2 and 0 25 mm increments in the graduated marks but the increments increase with the rainfall depth it is mainly designed for community based rainfall monitoring the analysis in this study covers the observation period from june to september 2020 with daily time step of data a standard recording sheet was used to record the measured rainfall on a daily basis at 9 00 am local time that is the same as the measurement time by emi the rain gauge was emptied after the measurement was conducted for each day the emi issues rainfall forecasts using the weather research and forecasting wrf model at a coarse resolution of 10 km by 10 km grid element over the study area for this reason we installed 19 rain gauges at the corners and center of the 10 km by 10 km grid element so that the rainfall data could be used to evaluate rainfall forecasts in the future fig 1 specifically the rain gauges were installed at key locations in the akaki catchment to capture the effect of elevation and land use urban and peri urban on the rainfall pattern hence a total of nineteen 19 low cost plastic rain gauges were installed in the akaki catchment 3 1 2 socio demographic and spatial datasets the socio demographic characteristics of the csts were collected through a structured questionnaire twelve variables of csts were collected which can be divided into individual variables and physical variables e g spatial variables the variables were selected based on prior experience and similar studies of citizen science monitoring programs west and pateman 2016 haile et al 2019 the individual variables included age gender marital status educational level employment status family size and period of residence the two physical variables were distance between the citizen scientist s house and the rain gauge station and ownership of the compound where the rain gauge was situated most of the individual variables are categorical variables therefore those attributes were transformed to ordinal variables based on their contribution to rainfall quality in this study the approach of zebardast 2009 was used for the attribute score transformation for example employment status has three classes which are employed partly employed and unemployed assuming the unemployed csts are less likely to miss the recording time a minimum value of 0 was assigned for employed 1 for partly employed and a maximum value of 2 for unemployed table1 shows the variables considered with score transformation rules zebardast 2009 3 2 data analysis 3 2 1 rainfall data quality control based on proximity nineteen cs rain gauges and one tipping bucket rain gauge tbr were categorized in to four with one group having five stations for the purpose of analysis we recognize that the elevation difference and spatial variations within the catchment influence the rainfall data quality but the categorization of stations can minimize such effects on the result the characteristics of the data and the objective of study dictate the qc method to be used in order to detect and remove errors objectively the current study used progressive qc start the evaluation with simple to detect errors and gradually evaluate the difficult to detect errors this progressive rainfall qc approach is vital to identify error sources at each stage to follow a systematic volunteer supervision and to provide quick feedbacks to the citizen scientists thus this study applied four stages of rainfall data quality control qc fig 2 for this purpose a method by llabrés brustenga et al 2019 was modified and employed to detect simple to complex rainfall observations errors a score is assigned at each stage based on the level of the rainfall data quality that was collected by the citizen scientists the modifications introduced to the previous methods include a series of additional initial quality control checks we increased the data quality assessment sub stages from two to six in the basic i quality control stage and from three to four for the overall quality control stages this helps to first identify easy to detect errors from hard copy of the data to the difficult errors that require relatively complex statistical analysis we hypothesized that the introduction of such progressive quality control methods helps to identify the source of the error e g untidy hand writing versus errors in reading the graduated marks of the rain gauge and to provide timely feedback to citizen scientists during supervision stages of citizen scientists in the first stage of quality control basic i gross rainfall observation errors that are easy to detect from the data recording sheet were checked table 2 those included checking the completeness of the record incorrect reading of graduated marks tidiness of the writing causes ambiguity to identify the written records readability of the records data entry errors and the like rainfall errors that are easy to detect through visual inspection of the digitized data and suspicious records were assessed in the second stage of qc basic ii for instance repeated records improbable zero the station recorded zero rainfall magnitude while the neighboring stations recorded at least 10 mm of rainfall and repetition or duplication of non zero values when a station records constant value for more than 3 days while the neighboring stations recorded different rainfall magnitudes high rainfall records outliers were detected by visually inspecting individual and group of station records in the basic ii qc stage suspicious rainfall records were identified and labeled as errors or outliers in the third stage relative qc the data of neighboring stations were compared with visual inspection using plots such as scatter daily cumulative rainfall totals and cumulative departure from the mean test temporal correlation of rainfall to identify presence of stations with suspicious records the suspicious station records scored low according to each scoring rule table 3 over the observation period in the final stage absolute qc statistical assessments were applied to check for the quality of the rainfall data table 4 these tests include spatial consistency check using pearson correlation coefficient pcc values of single station with spatial average rainfall using inverse distance weighting idw moreover taylor diagram was used to thoroughly understand and label station quality score against reference station in the taylor diagram method three complementary model performance indices pcc standard deviation sd and root mean square difference rmsd were used simultaneously to depict the quality of the target station against the reference station using taylor diagram higher score was assigned when data statistics of a station are within the clustered statistics of other stations and low score suspicious was assigned when the statistics of a stations are far from the cluster we also assigned high score when the rmsd and sd are near zero and pcc is near one since these values indicate similarity of data of paired stations tables 2 4 show the indicators their description and the rules that were used to assign scores for the rainfall data quality of each station for consistency the same minimum scoremin and maximum score scoremax were used for all indicators the scores were assigned at each stage of qc based on the quality indicators respective scoring rules for instance for an indicator from basic i qc stage error due to incorrect reading of graduated marks scoremin value was assigned when suspicious observation was detected in each of the observation months and scoremax was assigned when suspicious observation was not detected in any of the observation months a weighted score was calculated and assigned for the criteria that fall between the minimum and maximum i e between greater than 5 and less than 10 depending on the number of mismatches error magnitude a minimum score of 5 was used since we learned from the supervision of the citizen scientists that at least some of the data is not suspicious after assigning the scores an aggregated score was calculated for each quality stage applying arithmetic average of the scores of all indicators equal weight was assigned for each indicator the overall score of the rainfall accuracy was calculated as an arithmetic average of the scores of the four stages basic i qc basic ii qc relative qc and absolute qc note that only rules for the maximum and minimum scores are presented since intermediate scores were interpolated in this study we used various forms of verifications including visual inspection of both the hard and soft copies of the data graphical comparison of data from paired rain gauge stations and the use of a larger number of verification metrics than previously applied instead of using a secondary data for verification we performed an inter comparison between the primary data collected from a dense rain gauge network of the citizen science program the advantages of such thorough quality verification procedure are to assist in building confidence in the data quality assessment result and to distinguish between useable and unusable data from each station since the quality assessment is done with a step by step procedure citizen scientists do not need to wait for feedback until the entire data quality assessment has been performed 3 2 2 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca was applied to understand the dominant csts attributes that influenced the rainfall data quality pca is a statistical technique for a set of observed attributes variables to set the principal underlining dimensions li and weng 2007 hence it transforms a large number of variables into a small number of factors that are independent this is important in understanding key attributes that should be given due attention while designing a cs based rainfall data collection program pca does not explain the variability in the response variables rather it explains it in the independent variables and it reduces the dimensionality of the independent variables increasing interpretability and minimizing information loss previous studies showed that the dataset scale was sensitive to the outcome of the dominant attribute in the pca analysis in this study the attributes were transformed into a score of 0 10 according to their merit and contribution to rainfall data quality table 1 a minimum score of 0 was given for the lowest score whereas a maximum of 10 was adopted for the highest score zebardast 2009 it is assumed that the factors explain most of the variance among the large number of observed attributes in pca most of the variance in the data is explained with the first factor and each successive factor explains less of the variance tabachnick and fidell 1996 in this study percent of variance and eigenvalues were used to explain the selected factors factors were selected based on eigenvalues having greater than 1 kaiser 1960 tesfazghi et al 2010 and using scree plot the suitability of the data for factor analysis was checked according to kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s tests tesfazghi et al 2010 li and weng 2007 the kmo test is a measure of sampling adequacy that indicates the proportion of variance in the variables that might be caused by underlying factors in general kmo values between 0 8 and 1 indicate the sampling is adequate and less than 0 6 indicate the sampling is inadequate and that remedial action should be taken in contrast others set this cutoff value at 0 5 shrestha 2021 bartlett s test of homogeneity of variances is a test to identify whether there are equal variances of a continuous or interval level dependent variable across two or more groups of a categorical independent variable it tests the null hypothesis of no difference in variances between the groups cronbach s alpha is a measure of internal consistency that is how closely related a set of items are as a group it is a measure of scale reliability tavakol and dennick 2011 technically speaking cronbach s alpha is not a statistical test it is a coefficient of reliability or consistency the general rule of thumb is that a cronbach s alpha of 0 70 and above is good 0 80 and above is better and 0 90 is best in pca each factor was considered as one aspect of the attribute dimension those factor scores were used as factor associates in weighted index values an index of attribute ioa dimension is a composite of different aspects or attributes the pca was conducted with polychoric correlation instead of pearson correlation as the attribute values adopted are ordinal the pca analysis was carried out using an r programming library loading interpretation and ascribing their physical meaning in each factor was one of the challenges in the application of factor analysis li and weng 2007 excellent strength of relationship among the variable and the factor is given to a loading value greater than 0 7 the relationship is very good good fair and poor when the loading absolute values are between 0 63 and 0 70 0 55 0 62 0 45 0 54 and 0 32 0 44 respectively li and weng 2007 3 2 3 variable selection using stepwise regression a large number of variables in a model is one of the issues that affect model calibration results and their applicability if a model has few variables then it is relatively easy to calibrate and interpret the results it also requires less computational time as a result of reduced complexity notably important variables should not be excluded from the predictive model to provide balance between simplicity and fit for purpose heinze et al 2018 therefore variable selection should be performed with great care to minimize irrelevant or redundant information while still maintaining a very good model performance in this study we applied stepwise regression fsr for variable selection which is a combination of forward and backward selection techniques and multiple linear regression for model building fsr involves sequentially introducing the predictors into the model i e one at a time heinze et al 2018 haque et al 2018 it allows adding or removing variables at different steps starting with the null model depending on the significance level eventually it stops when there are no variables to remove or add a significant level of p values p 0 05 and akaike information criterion aic were used as stopping criteria in the fsr variable selection technique for this purpose we employed the r programming for statistical computing olsrr package hebbali 2018 multicollinearity correlation among the predictors in the mlr model was tested by calculating the variance inflation factor vif kim 2019 a value of vif greater than 5 indicates high multicollinearity kim 2019 we checked the multicollinearity test using car package with r programing 3 2 4 multiple linear regression analysis a multiple linear regression mlr model was used to estimate the dependent variables y data quality from a set of descriptive explanatory variables x attributes of citizen scientists in the mlr model the coefficients of the descriptive variables were estimated by minimizing the residual square sum in the dataset the mlr model was formulated by the following equation y β o β 1 x 1 β n x n ε where y the dependent variable quality score of the observed rainfall data x independent variable dominant attributes of the csts as identified using stepwise regression variable selection βi coefficients associated with explanatory variables parameters and ε is residual in the current study mlr model was applied to evaluate the relationship between the dominant attributes of the citizen scientists and the quality of the cs data the dominant attributes were identified using the stepwise regression variable selection due to limited number of samples n 19 care was taken not to over fit the predictive model by identifying important variables in the model feature selection using stepwise regression and employing the cross validation technique the key assumptions of mlr linearity independence of explanatory variables normal distribution of residuals and homoscedasticity were tested in the current study the mlr was mainly employed to understand and predict rainfall data quality in relation to the dominant csts attributes with no intercepts in the analyses all the mlr analyses were conducted in r programming packages libraries 3 2 5 cross validation cross validation cv is frequently used to understand the stability and the generalization capability of a mlr model here the k fold cross validation k fold cv was used to evaluate the performance of the developed regression model with sample size of 19 the k fold cv unlike leave one out cross validation loocv has the possibility of reducing model instability pessimistic bias and the estimation of accurate error rate james et al 2013 4 results 4 1 rainfall quality control first the summary of the score of the four quality control stages is presented in table 5 and 6 the quality score of the citizen science rainfall data was found relatively low in the initial stages of the data quality assessment i e basic qc i and ii whereas the accuracy was high when data of neighboring stations were compared i e the relative and absolute quality control stage as suspicious data for basic qc i and ii were removed the difference in mean score of the four qc stages was small 1 51 in terms of basic qc i none of the stations provided perfect quality data as the maximum score was only 8 82 ab02 with a minimum of 5 77 ko01 and mean score of 7 52 indicating a good quality of the citizens science rainfall data a perfect score of 10 was found for basic ii qc stage at ma01 station but only marginal difference was detected between the mean scores of basic i and basic ii this was due to prior screening of the suspicious data in basic qc i outliers improbable zero and constant values within the data the citizen science rainfall data of the stations have a very good quality mean score between 8 and 9 in terms of the relative and absolute qc a maximum standard deviation sd was found for basic qc i indicating higher dispersion of the scores from the mean it is still within 2 standard deviations from the mean score the lowest sd value was obtained for absolute qc indicating a lower spread of the individual score with in absolute qc hence the difference in data quality of the stations is smallest for absolute qc all the sd values in the qc stages were not significant as there is no 95 chance that the difference is due to discrimination scatter plots of data from neighboring rain gauge stations were used to assess the data quality the scatter plots were grouped in to four based on spatial proximity of the stations scatter plots were also used to compare the citizen scientists rainfall data from four rain gauge stations against data from the tipping bucket rain gauge tbr a moderately strong positive agreement between the rainfall amounts of the paired neighboring stations was observed the scatter plots of only the first group are shown here for the sake of brevity fig 3 this strong correlation between the rainfall data of the rain gauges depends on the distance and elevation difference between the locations of the stations station me01 recorded high rainfall of 65 mm while all neighboring stations recorded lower than 35 mm on 04 august suggesting the record of me01 is suspicious on this date on the other hand this station showed zero rainfall when all the neighboring stations observed above 10 mm rainfall on 09 september 2020 following similar evaluation of the scatter plots the rainfall data of stations ar01 ko01 se01 and ic01 have low scores scoremin because of suspicious record when compared with the neighboring stations no suspicious record was identified for thirteen stations out of nineteen stations based on the scatter plot the cumulative plots were also grouped in to four based on spatial proximity of stations the overall pattern of the cumulative plots of the data showed a very good agreement across the season the step changes and timing of increments in the cumulative plots have similar order of magnitude for most of the stations from group1 fig 4 in the study area only the cumulative plot of station me01 showed step changes that are larger than the step changes of the cumulative plot for the neighboring stations these changes occurred on 04 and 26 august 2020 as a result the score was low scoremin for rain gauge station me01 from group1 similarly the quality score of stations se01 ko01 ic01 ye01 and ar01 was low while that of stations ab01 ab02 and di01 was maximum when evaluated in terms of cumulative plots overall there is clear step change match for most of the station s daily rainfall data in all the groups showing a good data quality moreover the cumulative departure from the mean test resulted in trend over the observation period among the stations within the neighboring groups in the catchment fig 5 furthermore station ko01 showed a decreasing trend with above average rainfall from the neighboring mean rainfall station me01 indicated an increasing trend with substantial deviation from the mean and relatively constant trend were observed by stations ab01 and ab02 according to magnitude of departure from the mean data of stations ko01 and me01 scored low whereas stations ab01 and ab02 scored high likewise the data of stations ma01 ak01 and im01 scored high whereas that of stations ye01 ar01and se01 scored low based on cumulative departure from the mean test taylor diagram was used to assess the data quality based on the statistical relationship between rainfall data of multiple stations taylor 2001 it provides complimentary statistical information including correlation coefficient cc centered root mean squared difference rmsd and the amplitude of their variations using normalized standard deviations sd all 19 stations were considered in the quality assessment with the taylor diagram however for simplicity of understanding the rainfall data of all the stations compared to four reference stations me01 ko01 ab01 and ab02 was presented here fig 6 additionally data quality of all the rain gauge stations was assessed using taylor diagram keeping tbr as a reference station however we acknowledge that factors other than spatial distance e g natural rainfall variability can also affect the data statistics still the taylor diagram is useful for quality control from the taylor diagram the centered rmsd value for rainfall of most stations was found less than 10 when evaluated against the references fig 6 the centered rmsd value was between 5 and 10 for most stations a better performance was observed for stations ab01 me01 ko01 and kor01 centered rmsd less than 5 while low performance was observed for stations su01 and di01 centered rmsd are relatively high the assessment of taylor diagram showed an increase in centered rmsd as the stations are far from the reference station spatial proximity exists in the data the pcc value was used to understand the degree of association between rainfall data of the reference and the remaining stations the pcc of the data of reference station and that of other stations was mostly greater than 0 7 this indicates a significant or strong association between the reference data and that of the neighboring stations however the degree of association or correlation varies among the stations strong association pcc value higher than 0 8 was observed between data of the reference stations and stations kor01 ko01 ab01 ab02 and me01 the second strongest association was detected between data of stations ar01 ta02 and ma011 and the reference stations stations su01 di01 and im01 have shown a moderately weak relationship with the reference stations by having a pcc value less than or equal to 0 7 this could be due to the orographic nature of the rainfall in the watershed and the systematic error introduced by volunteers the su01 station data showed the weakest correlation pcc value less than 0 5 against the reference stations data the second and third weakest correlation was observed for stations di01 pcc value less than 0 7 and im01 pcc value is nearly 0 7 respectively standard deviation sd was used here to understand estimates of the degree of variability of the station data values around the sample mean measures of dispersion when compared to the reference station the smallest difference low variability in terms of sd value less than 10 was found for station ar02 against the reference station rain gauge stations ko01 and ar02 well captured the reference rainfall data when evaluated with the standard deviation stations kor01 ab01 ab02 and ta02 are among the second best performers in terms of sd the data of these stations have similar dispersion or variability with that of the reference stations poor performance was reported for stations la01 le01 and se01 those stations exhibited high sd values with different dispersion about the mean against the reference stations according to the taylor diagram analysis results fig 6 the rainfall data of station su01 scored low scoremin and station ko01 scored high scoremax as they are the stations with the highest and lowest number of low score counts respectively 4 2 rainfall characteristics the spatial mean daily seasonal rainfall distribution for the watershed was variable from june to september 2020 fig 7 the most upstream part of the watershed exhibited high rainfall magnitude whereas the downstream part of the watershed showed low rainfall magnitude the seasonal highest rainfall was observed over the north east part of the watershed the maximum mean monthly rainfall for the 2020 summer rainy season ranges between 535 mm in august and 460 mm in july the lowest rainfall distribution occurred in june mainly in the south east spatially we noted that the rainfall distribution did not follow a uniform pattern for each of the months in june rainfall is highest 225 270 mm over the north west part of the catchment and it is lowest 110 150 mm over the south and south east parts the area of the maximum rainfall then shifted to the north and north east side of the watershed the monthly rainfall has shown a similar spatial pattern in july and september except for the southern side overall the spatial rainfall distribution suggests topographic effect on variation in the rainfall amount of the catchment 4 3 principal component analysis 4 3 1 factor analysis and dimensions of attributes the socio demographic and spatial variables were assessed for their suitability for analysis before performing pca the bartlett s test of homogeneity of variance and kaiser meyer olkin test kmo values are 0 0000046 and 0 69 respectively since bartlett s test is less than 0 05 i e no difference in variances of the group and the kmo test is larger than 0 5 i e the sampling is adequate the socio demographic and spatial data are suitable for pca hence pca was applied to understand the relationship among the variables and dominant factors that influence the rainfall data quality twelve variables that reflect the socio demographic and spatial characteristic of the csts were scrutinized fig 8 shows the result of polychoric correlation between the citizen scientists attributes the blue shade indicates positive values and the red shade indicates negative values the color goes deeper as the absolute value of correlation gets higher the polychoric correlation suggested a medium to strong association among the variables having a similar pattern of colored patches attributes such as education and marital status education and prior experience education and community participation location and employment status location and period of residence are highly correlated the polychoric correlation suggests that those highly correlated variables can be used to explain their relationship against the response variable rainfall data quality with the assumption of the joint continuous distribution the resulted polychoric correlation coefficients measure the association of the ordinal variables 4 3 1 1 description of attribute dimensions table 7 shows the component analysis result after applying the polychoric correlation the first four eigenvalues which exceed 1 were obtained with the polychoric correlation of the factor analysis eigenvalue greater than 1 indicates more variance is accounted by the factors than one of the original variables a factor analysis was performed with maximum likelihood estimation the total number of factors extracted with eigenvalue criterion and scree plot are four with variance explained equal to 77 82 table 7 the first factor explained 32 30 of the variance while the second third and the fourth explained 23 15 11 21 and 11 16 respectively the variables included in the first factor are education level community participation marital status prior experience age and use of sms text and smartphone messaging app this could be interpreted as the factor related to the preference for education experience and technological applications age is negatively correlated with variables that have positive loadings in this factor and it is in the opposite direction of the factor the citizen scientists attributes such as gauge relative location period of residence and employment status are majorly responsible for the second factor the third and the fourth factors have the preference for supervisor s travel length distance from supervisor to the observer and socio demographic status such as head of family factors the high variance implied that those four factors or dimensions were vital to consider in preserving most of the important information contained within these twelve 12 attributes old variables even though attaching a physical meaning to each factor is a challenging task in pca the factors with eigenvalue greater than one were interpreted to understand the dominant attributes influencing the csts rainfall data quality first factor pc1 the high weighted variables found from pc1 were edu sma com and pre hence this factor indicates the importance of level of education technological applications ete and experience since it shows high loadings on the aforementioned variables the variables are positively correlated with the factor the higher the score in this factor the higher the demand for ete attributes second factor pc2 this factor was derived from a combination of variables from the gauge relative location loc employment status ems and period of residence it can be interpreted as the proximity employment and period of residence dimensions pep selection of the appropriate relative location of the rain gauge employment status and the period of residence of the citizen scientists highly influences this factor third factor pc3 this factor can be interpreted as travel distance and demographic dimension dd since it shows high loadings on the travel distance and the number of family members this factor is highly related to the length of travel distance to supervise citizen scientists and family size information fourth factor pc4 this factor is solely represented by the demographic dimension dd head of family status hof the relationship among the independent variables was investigated using pca we noticed that the variables were clustered in to three variable s gauge relative location employment status and head of family have positive correlation with each other period of residence age and distance have similar characteristics strong correlation was observed among the variables education use of sms and smartphone messaging app community participation period of residence years and marital status the relationship among independent variables against the response variable quality of the data with multiple regression analysis mlr was scrutinized it showed that distance community participation prior experience period of residence years and head of family impacted negatively quality decrease as the values increase whereas the other variables impacted positively quality increase as the values increase an increase in age education gauge relative location and use of sms and smartphone messaging app is associated with quality of the rainfall data as they have higher coefficients from the mlr 4 4 stepwise regression analysis the result of stepwise regression variable selection showed statistically significant value for a total of four out of the twelve predictor variables education and gauge relative location were found the first and the second most influential variables affecting the dependent variable data quality the use of sms and smartphone messaging application and distance to the citizen scientists house were the third and the fourth dominant variables the rest of the variables were not statistically significant in this stepwise regression variable selection analysis there is no multicollinearity among the independent predictor variables as the estimated variable inflation factor vif values were less than 5 the maximum vif value is equal to 2 73 which is less than 5 and the variables are not highly correlated fig 9 thus the predictor valuables can be used in the mlr model building for prediction 4 5 multiple linear regression analysis after the dominant attributes were identified using stepwise variable selection analysis multiple linear regression analysis mlr was applied to predict the quality indicator of the rainfall data as a function of the dominant preselected variables in this study four prominent variables with a statistically significance level 0 05 were used to regress with the quality indicator of the rainfall data education status edu gauge relative location loc use of sms and smartphone messaging app and distance variables were used in the mlr analysis homoscedasticity was checked before undertaking further analysis the mlr analysis was conducted with and without an intercept and the sample adequacy criteria was taken in to consideration the mlr equation developed is described as m l r i 0 42 x e d u i 0 28 x l o c i 0 2 x s m a i 0 17 x d i s i where mlr multiple linear regression is the predicted or response variable and the subscript i refers to the respective individual citizen scientist edu loc sma and dis are the independent variables the values 0 22 0 28 0 2 and 0 17 are the regression coefficients of the first second third and the fourth independent variables the result of multiple linear regression mlr analysis with intercept between the attributes and the response variable rainfall data quality score is shown on table 8 the estimated mlr showed a residual standard error of 1 184 on 15 degrees of freedom multiple r squared value of 0 98 adjusted r squared value of 0 97 f statistic 180 2 and a p value of 1 744e 12 moreover the mlr model with no intercept is shown on table 9 the estimated mra showed a residual standard error of 0 82 on 14 degrees of freedom multiple r squared value of 0 92 and adjusted r squared value of 0 90 f statistic 41 14 and a p value of 1 357e 07 the estimated mlr with and without intercept showed that the four independent variables have significant influence on the response variable in an increasing order of strong influence namely dis sma loc and edu table 8 and 9 4 6 k fold cross validation the prediction ability of the developed mlr model with the variable of interest was verified by k fold cross validation technique the estimation of true performance of the prediction data set with the k fold cv was found good in terms of the root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae and r squared values the k fold cv with 5 folds k 5 datasets resulted in a value of 1 56 1 34 and 0 83 in terms of rmse mae and r squared respectively fig 10 a perfect rmse and mae error values are 0 0 indicating the prediction and the observation expected value are exactly matched moreover ideal r squared value is 1 in this study r squared value is greater than 0 7 rmse 0 83 which indicates a good predictive model ability the rmse 1 56 value was found close to the line of predictive model best fit regardless of its dependence on the range of numerical observed values within the data set since the mae is low and r squared is high which indicates a good model to predict fig 10 the developed mlr model can be used to predict datta quality according to the k fold cross validation 5 discussion the usability of citizen science data can be increased through proper setting up of the citizen science program and rigorous supervision although they are few there are some guidelines on how to set up citizen science programs walker et al 2019 however guidelines on how to detect rainfall observation errors to inform supervision of cs science programs are rare this study contributes to filling such gap by developing and implementing a progressive quality control procedure on rainfall data collected by citizen scientists installation of multiple rain gauges in the study area by the cs program provided the opportunity for systematic data quality control it particularly avoided the need to use secondary data e g satellite rainfall product as a reference for quality control of the citizen science data according to the quality control procedure of this study most of the citizen scientists recorded very good quality data hence the citizen science data can be used for several hydrological purposes including accuracy assessment of rainfall forecasts satellite rainfall estimates and rainfall runoff modeling for flood forecasting in the akaki catchment however we still detected some errors within the data through our qc procedure our finding revealed a low score at the initial stage of quality control this suggests that most errors can be detected with simple and quick to apply procedures that are important for timely supervision of the citizen scientists in addition comparison of data from neighboring stations using graphical methods e g scatter plot was found useful to assess the data quality overall most of the suspicious records were easily detected and therefore can be communicated and corrected during supervision of the citizen scientists to increase the usability of the data similar to our findings shinbrot et al 2020 found that the initial stage of quality control detected a large percent of the error and indicated that this was due to misreading and missing records in sum our findings suggested that a good quality of citizen science rainfall data can be obtained that can complement the conventional rainfall data this finding agrees with that of vos 2019 and walker et al 2016 indicating the capability of csts to collect quality data for the purpose of hydro meteorological applications if quality controlled cs rainfall data from most gauging stations revealed good agreement in terms of cumulative rainfall plots cc rmsd and sd within the catchment with station to station comparison and against tbr this study showed that progressive qc can help to identify source of rainfall monitoring errors the relationship between the resulting quality control score and the indicators or stages showed station to station variability one of the indicator within the basic qc i stage can have higher influence on the aggregated quality score than the other indicators for instance station ab02 and ko01 scored highest 8 8 and lowest 5 7 during basic qc stage i the lowest quality score of station ko01 at this stage is mostly attributed to the indicator recording time shift or and accumulated rainfall data error on the other hand both stations behave differently when we observe the score of relative and absolute quality control stages this indicates that stations with certain citizen scientists attributes resulted in a low quality scores for some of the indicators while having high quality scores for other indicators thus receiving a low score on the basic quality control stage i negatively affects the aggregated average score of that station and vice versa values outside the expected range outliers check target station correlation and temporal consistency step change check using daily cumulative rainfall totals over the observation period were found to be responsible for low score of stations ko01 la01 and le01 at basic ii relative and absolute quality control stages respectively if one indicator is extremely high or low it directly influence the overall quality score since our study assumed equal weightage for each indicator score suitable indicator score aggregation technique should be identified in future studies one of the limitations of the cs rainfall program presented in this study is the daily observation interval that can be insufficient for some operational forecasting and long term flood prediction studies this limitation is common in citizen science programs in other study sites bárdossy et al 2021 mapiam et al 2022 the limitation is mostly resolved by the disaggregation of the daily time step rainfall data in to an hour using the temporal distribution patter of tipping bucket rain gauge networks however further research is needed to engage citizen scientists in collection of rainfall data at finer temporal scale sub daily to hourly for instance they can record the start and end time of the rainfall events in addition to the rainfall magnitude from our results the mlr model coefficients suggested that education level has the highest influence on the quality of the collected data hence training and supervision of citizen scientists must consider their educational level the rain gauge relative location highly influenced the data quality the closer the observer s residence is to the rain gauge site the higher the data quality there is also a strong relation between the use of sms and smartphone messaging application by the citizen scientists and data quality the relationships of the rainfall data quality and attributes based on the multiple linear regressions suggested that education observers living close to the rain gauge and use of sms and smartphone messaging app can be generalizable to other locations that is because the relationship is direct nevertheless the supervision distance between the scientists relative location and the observers living compound may not be strongly influencing the data quality which could be due to the high access to transport in urban and peri urban setting the model can be used to inform citizen science efforts and trainings with due prioritization on citizen scientists education status rain gauge relative location and the use of sms and smartphone messaging application similar studies showed that learning was found to impact the quality of cs rainfall data quality shinbrot et al 2020 according to the current study csts engagement must consider their education level properly the use of smartphone app provided better quality data the rainfall data quality is high when the rain gauge was located within the vicinity or living compound of the citizen scientists however cs should strive to involve diverse categories of citizens in the rainfall data collection the aim of the study is not to exclude csts but to explore which attribute affects the data quality and suggest future research to recognize the influence of those attributes citizen science is an opportunity to involve a range of participants and demographics to truly democratize science and empower communities walker et al 2021 similar assessment should be implemented in multiple catchments with more attributes large number of csts and rain gauges to test our hypothesis the result could be changed due to scaling and the aforementioned factors moreover learning through frequent trainings combined with csts level of motivation may further improve the quality of cs rainfall data future studies should explore the contribution of mobile apps for data transfer and quality assessment during variable selection stage the numbers of variables are commonly reduced to improve the performance of statistical analysis when the variables are correlated using stepwise regression stepwise regression is one of the most commonly used variable selection methods that follow sequentially introducing the predictors into the model one at a time heinze et al 2018 this technique has shown the capability to understand the effect of csts attributes on the quality of collected rainfall data in terms of variable selection and reduction methods stepwise regression and pca a close similarity among the selected influencing attributes was noticed these methods revealed that the three attributes edu loc and dis are highly dominant this close similarity of the methods were also verified on the work of haque et al 2018 who used pca and stepwise regression method for urban water demand forecasting in this study the results of stepwise regression method suggested incorporating the use of smartphone application during rainfall data collection to improve data quality the number of variables affecting rainfall data quality and the scale of the monitoring campaign are among the limitations of this study while recording rainfall some citizen scientists were not recording exactly at 9 00 am due to school time and working hours resulting in one to two hours shift in time however this is expected to have minimal effect since most of the rain in ethiopia falls in the afternoon or evening haile et al 2009 the findings of our study indicated that identifying the dominant attributes of citizen scientists and their associated explanatory variables can enhance the quality of rainfall data then we found out that education gauge relative location the use of smartphone and distance to gauging site highly affected the quality of the rainfall data future research studies should scale up the study to relatively large catchments and consider additional variables affecting rainfall data quality to thoroughly understand the factors 6 conclusions there is a growing interest in the use of citizen science for engaging the community in hydro meteorological monitoring this study explored the effect of factors affecting the quality of citizen science rainfall data in the akaki catchment in ethiopia we conclude that data quality control has the potential to inform supervision of citizen scientists and improve the quality of rainfall data in addition the following conclusions are drawn the initial stages of quality control which can be done quickly by inspecting the data recording sheet can help to identify most of the rainfall data quality issues hence results of the initial stages of quality control can be used to regularly train and provide timely feedback to the citizen scientists to improve the quality of the rainfall data overall our results indicate that cs rainfall monitoring can complement the conventional data monitoring system by providing reliable spatial and temporal rainfall data if quality controlled certain attributes of the citizen scientists significantly affected the quality of the rainfall data for this study the quality of the data was heavily affected by education level indicating increased follow up of citizen scientists with low education level i e frequent feedback and training is needed with citizen scientists who have a low level of education future citizen science programs can explore the required incentives for volunteers who live far from the gauging sites and who are using smartphone apps this study demonstrated the importance of establishing a dense rain gauge network in citizen science programs to better control the quality of citizen science data studies should carefully consider citizen scientist s attributes with a comprehensive rainfall data quality control standard while monitoring rainfall future studies can explore how citizen science data from such dense rain gauges can be applied for validation of rainfall forecasts from numerical weather predictions nwp and for flood forecasting purposes declaration of competing interest the authors declare

3021,citizen science can fulfill the quest for high quality and sufficient environmental data such as rainfall however the factors affecting the quality of rainfall data collected by the citizen scientists are not well understood in this study we examined the effect of citizen scientists attributes on the quality of rainfall data for this purpose principal component analysis pca stepwise regression and multiple linear regressions mlr were used a quality control procedure was developed and applied for daily observed rainfall data collected in the summer rainy season of 2020 attributes of the citizen scientists were gathered for those who collected rainfall data in the urban and peri urban akaki catchment which is located in the upper awash sub basin ethiopia we found that easy to detect errors which were identified during the initial stage of quality control formed most of the errors in the rainfall data the pca and the stepwise regression results revealed that four dominant attributes education level gauge relative location use of smartphone app and supervisor s travel distance highly affected the rainfall data quality the mlr model using these four prominent dominant variables performed very well with r2 value of 0 98 the k fold cross validation result showed that the developed model can be used to predict the relationships between data quality and attributes of citizen scientists with high accuracy hence the pca technique stepwise regression and mlr model can provide useful information regarding the influence of citizen scientists attributes on rainfall data quality therefore future studies should carefully consider citizen scientists attributes when engaging and supervising citizen scientists with a comprehensive data quality control while monitoring rainfall keywords citizen science rainfall monitoring data quality principal component analysis variable selection multiple linear regression akaki data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction interest has emerged to explore the scope of citizen science cs for hydro meteorological monitoring zheng et al 2018 cs is the volunteered participation of the general public in scientific research buytaert 2014 it is initiated by the quest for high quality and sufficient environmental data to fill data gaps assumpção et al 2018 but it also constitutes for hydrologists an opportunity to integrate scientific social economic cultural political and administrative processes nardiet al 2022 moreover the data is used to force calibrate and validate hydrological models to simulate processes in environmental systems zheng et al 2018 starkey et al 2017 therefore cs rainfall monitoring can address the spatiotemporal sampling limitations wmo 2011 and fulfill the quest for high quality and sufficient hydro meteorological data starkey et al 2017 despite several advantages of cs there are valid concerns regarding the quality of the data collected by citizen scientists starkey et al 2017 downs et al 2021 bonney et al 2014 understanding the factors influencing the data quality is a prerequisite for their use in hydrological applications muller et al 2015 this concern raises a strong need for evidence about the quality of cs rainfall data and its usability despite the availability of various citizen science programs for rainfall monitoring limited research has been documented to assess data quality vos 2019 evaluated crowd sourced rainfall data from personal automatic weather stations attended by amateur backyard meteorologists the authors employed a quality control qc procedure with gauge adjusted radar data as a reference and employing spatial consistency checks using several indicators that include faulty zeroes high influx station outlier filter and bias correction similarly other researchers indicated the importance of proper set up of cs monitoring programs and frequent supervision to improve data quality walker et al 2016 shinbrot et al 2020 however there are only a few guidelines to support setting up cs programs and guide supervision of citizen scientists walker et al 2019 as a result the quality of the rainfall observations may be suffering and thus reducing confidence of the data users therefore concerted effort is required to build the confidence and trust of cs data users for example reputation system is a common approach in building trust between data users and the method has been explored in the context of crowdsourced rainfall data chen et al 2021 however such studies are rare and require further investigation in citizen science programs various rainfall data qc methods exist in literature for example neural networks were used for rainfall qc sciuto et al 2009 this method showed a slightly lower capability in recognizing incorrect data since it depends on the quality of the training dataset sciuto et al 2009 another qc method is the ground clutter echoes algorithm which was tested by golz et al 2006 for radar rainfall data quality control however this method cannot be used for conventional ground rain gauge networks since the algorithm is used to filter clutters and correct signal attenuations fehri et al 2020 used a statistical method for qc of cs rainfall data using data from national network as a reference they used several verification methods that are pearson correlation coefficient pcc mean error and student s t test comparing the means of two datasets examples of most used verifications metrics are pcc and bias systematic error walker et al 2016 fehri et al 2020 llabrés brustenga et al 2019 took advantage of progressive qc procedures for rainfall data progressive qc procedure involves gradually cleaning simple to detect errors most serious ones and then addressing the difficult or complex error types however they employed limited verification metrics to thoroughly assess the quality controlled data availability of reference data with adequate coverage is one of the constraints to conduct qc on cs data to overcome such constraints some qc studies employed secondary data source for validation of conventional and cs rainfall data golz et al 2006 de vos et al 2017 for instance walker et al 2016 adopted reanalysis and satellite rainfall estimates for validation since the conventional rain gauges were situated outside their study watershed reanalysis and satellite rainfall estimates have resolutions ranging from 5 km to 28 km that mismatches with the point scale of citizen science data this causes gauge representativeness error that makes it impossible to quantify the true error of the cs rainfall data tessema et al 2020 when reanalysis or satellite data are used as reference further satellite data are characterized by large systematic and random errors which indicates they are not appropriate reference data although not explored well in literature installation of multiple rain gauges at small separation distance in cs programs can serve qc check for cs data information on the nature of error and attributes of citizen science is needed to improve the quality of data collected by citizen scientists few studies were documented on the evaluation of error in the rainfall data from amateur citizen scientists and personal weather stations vos 2019 fehri et al 2020 those studies failed to address the nature of error in citizen science and inform efforts to improve data quality wiggins et al 2011 kosmala et al 2016 shinbrot et al 2020 additionally we hypothesized that a progressive qc method can be a key step to identify the dominant source of error in cs rainfall data and can provide useful input to the supervision of the citizen scientists however the effectiveness of this method has not been well explored furthermore the data quality can vary with volunteers attributes the volunteers motivation experience and demography are found to correlate with the quality of cs data lewandowski and specht 2015 although some authors reported inconsistent outcomes kosmala et al 2016 shinbrot et al 2020 however not much is known and documented about the effect of volunteers attributes on the quality of rainfall data collected by citizen scientists a different approach that monitors the scale of participation and volunteers skills can help to identify the type of supervision needed to ensure data quality there is a skepticism among professional scientists on the ability of citizen scientists to produce high quality datasets specht 2018 kosmala et al 2016 these concerns are highly related to the potential of the citizen scientists attributes to influence the quality of observed data crall et al 2011 lewandowsk and specht 2015 gunko et al 2022 for instance heigl and zaller 2016 indicated that volunteers educational level and long term commitment are key to data quality similarly a literature review by capdevila et al 2020 revealed that the knowledge and experience of the citizen scientists is one of the three factors determining the success of citizen science programs for water quality monitoring these attributes can be improved by training and ensuring long term engagement of citizen scientists studies used subjective evaluation or literature review and addressed citizen science programs designed for purposes other than rainfall monitoring quantitative evaluation can provide additional information on factors preventing citizen scientists from providing data that is fit for purpose an example of quantitative evaluation is the study by hunter et al 2013 who investigated trustworthiness to provide quality data through evaluation of various trust metrics hence there is a need for a more systematic investigation of the relationship between citizen scientists attributes and the quality of the rainfall data that they collect to our knowledge such efforts are rare in hydrology literature notwithstanding the helpful study conducted on filling critical rainfall data gaps using citizen science in mexico relevant to conservation policy design by shinbrot et al 2020 therefore this study applied data qc method and assessed the effect of citizen scientists attributes on the quality of citizen science rainfall data in akaki catchment ethiopia we applied a suite of methods including principal component analysis pca stepwise regression and multiple linear regression analysis mlr this study is new by its experiment in evaluating the scope of the cs approach in filling data gaps in a data scarce region the density of our rain gauge network in this study is greater than that of the ethiopian meteorology institute emi and most published cs rain gauge networks fehri et al 2020 walker et al 2016 the outcome of the study is expected to deepen our understanding on the quality of cs rainfall data and factors affecting it and its usability the study will also provide and inform efforts that are directed at meeting the data needs for sustainable development goals sdg 6 fritz et al 2019 urban drainage and flood risk management 2 study area this study was conducted in the akaki catchment the most developed and economically important part of the upper awash river basin fig 1 it is located in the central part of ethiopia along the western margin of the ethiopian rift valley between 8 46 9 14 n and 38 34 39 04 e the catchment is characterized with complex topography and elevation ranging between 2040 m and 3200 m above sea level a s l it drains an area of approximately 1500 km2 and terminates at the aba samuel reservoir the akaki is the principal source of water supply for the capital city addis ababa both fluvial and pluvial floods are common in the catchment bekele et al 2022 rainfall within akaki catchment is mainly modulated by the seasonal migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz seleshi 2004 about 70 of the annual rainfall occurs during the main rainy season in the summer kiremt from june to september the daily rainfall amount of the catchment has a moderate variation during kiremt and a higher variation during belg from february to april conway et al 2004 data from conventional meteorological stations in or near the catchments shows that its mean annual rainfall ranges from 900 mm to 1470 mm with the highest rainfall amounts occurring over the high elevation areas its monthly rainfall peaks in july and august with magnitudes between 250 mm and 300 mm low rainfall amounts occur from november to january the daily temperature ranges from 9 9 c to 24 5 c 3 materials and method in this study we set up a citizen science program for rainfall monitoring multiple methods were applied for quality control of the rainfall data from the cs program and factors affecting the data quality were evaluated this involved progressive approach for rainfall data quality control followed by principal component analysis pca stepwise regression and multiple linear regression analysis mlr pca and stepwise regression were employed to understand and select the most prominent explanatory variables attributes of citizen scientists influencing rainfall data quality respectively which were then used in mlr analysis further we employed polychoric correlation in the pca procedure to consider the ordinal variables effect in the analysis two main datasets were analyzed rainfall data collected by the citizen scientists and social and demographic attributes of the citizen scientists collected by the researchers ordinal scores were assigned to the rainfall data based on a quality control procedure 3 1 data sets 3 1 1 rainfall monitoring using the citizen science program volunteer community members as citizen scientists csts were recruited prior to the rainy season of 2020 a workshop was not organized to launch the program due to coronavirus disease covid 19 concerns during this study period however one to one meetings with safe distance and mobile phones were used to introduce the citizen science programme including equipment demonstration to the csts following guidelines for setting up a cs program see haile et al 2019 walker et al 2019 we considered the volunteers communication skills including writing listening and speaking the local language as the main criteria for recruitment availability of a cell phone was another criterion to allow supervision through telephone calls in addition to regular face to face supervision community members who met most of the criteria and lived within a few minutes walking distance from each gauging site were selected as csts equal opportunity was provided to men and women volunteers after identifying 32 candidate csts the benefits of rainfall data for water management and flood risk management were discussed with them then final selection of csts was made based on their willingness to participate in the rainfall data collection process education level above or equal to grade 4 age greater than 15 years old and residence relative location nearby the rain gauging station a total of 19 volunteered csts were finally selected among 32 candidates a monetary incentive and mobile airtime were transferred to the citizen scientists monthly the financial compensation for the time taken to conduct measurement and to cover costs of transmitting data was only one third of the monthly salary that the emi pays for its rainfall observers the financial incentive was considered necessary and right to motivate and prolong the cs program walker et al 2021 in this study citizen scientists were equipped with a low cost rain gauge that was fabricated using a graduated plastic cylinder the rain gauges were purchased from the emi of ethiopia the rain gauge has a 150 mm capacity an area of 400 cm2 and 0 25 mm increments in the graduated marks but the increments increase with the rainfall depth it is mainly designed for community based rainfall monitoring the analysis in this study covers the observation period from june to september 2020 with daily time step of data a standard recording sheet was used to record the measured rainfall on a daily basis at 9 00 am local time that is the same as the measurement time by emi the rain gauge was emptied after the measurement was conducted for each day the emi issues rainfall forecasts using the weather research and forecasting wrf model at a coarse resolution of 10 km by 10 km grid element over the study area for this reason we installed 19 rain gauges at the corners and center of the 10 km by 10 km grid element so that the rainfall data could be used to evaluate rainfall forecasts in the future fig 1 specifically the rain gauges were installed at key locations in the akaki catchment to capture the effect of elevation and land use urban and peri urban on the rainfall pattern hence a total of nineteen 19 low cost plastic rain gauges were installed in the akaki catchment 3 1 2 socio demographic and spatial datasets the socio demographic characteristics of the csts were collected through a structured questionnaire twelve variables of csts were collected which can be divided into individual variables and physical variables e g spatial variables the variables were selected based on prior experience and similar studies of citizen science monitoring programs west and pateman 2016 haile et al 2019 the individual variables included age gender marital status educational level employment status family size and period of residence the two physical variables were distance between the citizen scientist s house and the rain gauge station and ownership of the compound where the rain gauge was situated most of the individual variables are categorical variables therefore those attributes were transformed to ordinal variables based on their contribution to rainfall quality in this study the approach of zebardast 2009 was used for the attribute score transformation for example employment status has three classes which are employed partly employed and unemployed assuming the unemployed csts are less likely to miss the recording time a minimum value of 0 was assigned for employed 1 for partly employed and a maximum value of 2 for unemployed table1 shows the variables considered with score transformation rules zebardast 2009 3 2 data analysis 3 2 1 rainfall data quality control based on proximity nineteen cs rain gauges and one tipping bucket rain gauge tbr were categorized in to four with one group having five stations for the purpose of analysis we recognize that the elevation difference and spatial variations within the catchment influence the rainfall data quality but the categorization of stations can minimize such effects on the result the characteristics of the data and the objective of study dictate the qc method to be used in order to detect and remove errors objectively the current study used progressive qc start the evaluation with simple to detect errors and gradually evaluate the difficult to detect errors this progressive rainfall qc approach is vital to identify error sources at each stage to follow a systematic volunteer supervision and to provide quick feedbacks to the citizen scientists thus this study applied four stages of rainfall data quality control qc fig 2 for this purpose a method by llabrés brustenga et al 2019 was modified and employed to detect simple to complex rainfall observations errors a score is assigned at each stage based on the level of the rainfall data quality that was collected by the citizen scientists the modifications introduced to the previous methods include a series of additional initial quality control checks we increased the data quality assessment sub stages from two to six in the basic i quality control stage and from three to four for the overall quality control stages this helps to first identify easy to detect errors from hard copy of the data to the difficult errors that require relatively complex statistical analysis we hypothesized that the introduction of such progressive quality control methods helps to identify the source of the error e g untidy hand writing versus errors in reading the graduated marks of the rain gauge and to provide timely feedback to citizen scientists during supervision stages of citizen scientists in the first stage of quality control basic i gross rainfall observation errors that are easy to detect from the data recording sheet were checked table 2 those included checking the completeness of the record incorrect reading of graduated marks tidiness of the writing causes ambiguity to identify the written records readability of the records data entry errors and the like rainfall errors that are easy to detect through visual inspection of the digitized data and suspicious records were assessed in the second stage of qc basic ii for instance repeated records improbable zero the station recorded zero rainfall magnitude while the neighboring stations recorded at least 10 mm of rainfall and repetition or duplication of non zero values when a station records constant value for more than 3 days while the neighboring stations recorded different rainfall magnitudes high rainfall records outliers were detected by visually inspecting individual and group of station records in the basic ii qc stage suspicious rainfall records were identified and labeled as errors or outliers in the third stage relative qc the data of neighboring stations were compared with visual inspection using plots such as scatter daily cumulative rainfall totals and cumulative departure from the mean test temporal correlation of rainfall to identify presence of stations with suspicious records the suspicious station records scored low according to each scoring rule table 3 over the observation period in the final stage absolute qc statistical assessments were applied to check for the quality of the rainfall data table 4 these tests include spatial consistency check using pearson correlation coefficient pcc values of single station with spatial average rainfall using inverse distance weighting idw moreover taylor diagram was used to thoroughly understand and label station quality score against reference station in the taylor diagram method three complementary model performance indices pcc standard deviation sd and root mean square difference rmsd were used simultaneously to depict the quality of the target station against the reference station using taylor diagram higher score was assigned when data statistics of a station are within the clustered statistics of other stations and low score suspicious was assigned when the statistics of a stations are far from the cluster we also assigned high score when the rmsd and sd are near zero and pcc is near one since these values indicate similarity of data of paired stations tables 2 4 show the indicators their description and the rules that were used to assign scores for the rainfall data quality of each station for consistency the same minimum scoremin and maximum score scoremax were used for all indicators the scores were assigned at each stage of qc based on the quality indicators respective scoring rules for instance for an indicator from basic i qc stage error due to incorrect reading of graduated marks scoremin value was assigned when suspicious observation was detected in each of the observation months and scoremax was assigned when suspicious observation was not detected in any of the observation months a weighted score was calculated and assigned for the criteria that fall between the minimum and maximum i e between greater than 5 and less than 10 depending on the number of mismatches error magnitude a minimum score of 5 was used since we learned from the supervision of the citizen scientists that at least some of the data is not suspicious after assigning the scores an aggregated score was calculated for each quality stage applying arithmetic average of the scores of all indicators equal weight was assigned for each indicator the overall score of the rainfall accuracy was calculated as an arithmetic average of the scores of the four stages basic i qc basic ii qc relative qc and absolute qc note that only rules for the maximum and minimum scores are presented since intermediate scores were interpolated in this study we used various forms of verifications including visual inspection of both the hard and soft copies of the data graphical comparison of data from paired rain gauge stations and the use of a larger number of verification metrics than previously applied instead of using a secondary data for verification we performed an inter comparison between the primary data collected from a dense rain gauge network of the citizen science program the advantages of such thorough quality verification procedure are to assist in building confidence in the data quality assessment result and to distinguish between useable and unusable data from each station since the quality assessment is done with a step by step procedure citizen scientists do not need to wait for feedback until the entire data quality assessment has been performed 3 2 2 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca was applied to understand the dominant csts attributes that influenced the rainfall data quality pca is a statistical technique for a set of observed attributes variables to set the principal underlining dimensions li and weng 2007 hence it transforms a large number of variables into a small number of factors that are independent this is important in understanding key attributes that should be given due attention while designing a cs based rainfall data collection program pca does not explain the variability in the response variables rather it explains it in the independent variables and it reduces the dimensionality of the independent variables increasing interpretability and minimizing information loss previous studies showed that the dataset scale was sensitive to the outcome of the dominant attribute in the pca analysis in this study the attributes were transformed into a score of 0 10 according to their merit and contribution to rainfall data quality table 1 a minimum score of 0 was given for the lowest score whereas a maximum of 10 was adopted for the highest score zebardast 2009 it is assumed that the factors explain most of the variance among the large number of observed attributes in pca most of the variance in the data is explained with the first factor and each successive factor explains less of the variance tabachnick and fidell 1996 in this study percent of variance and eigenvalues were used to explain the selected factors factors were selected based on eigenvalues having greater than 1 kaiser 1960 tesfazghi et al 2010 and using scree plot the suitability of the data for factor analysis was checked according to kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s tests tesfazghi et al 2010 li and weng 2007 the kmo test is a measure of sampling adequacy that indicates the proportion of variance in the variables that might be caused by underlying factors in general kmo values between 0 8 and 1 indicate the sampling is adequate and less than 0 6 indicate the sampling is inadequate and that remedial action should be taken in contrast others set this cutoff value at 0 5 shrestha 2021 bartlett s test of homogeneity of variances is a test to identify whether there are equal variances of a continuous or interval level dependent variable across two or more groups of a categorical independent variable it tests the null hypothesis of no difference in variances between the groups cronbach s alpha is a measure of internal consistency that is how closely related a set of items are as a group it is a measure of scale reliability tavakol and dennick 2011 technically speaking cronbach s alpha is not a statistical test it is a coefficient of reliability or consistency the general rule of thumb is that a cronbach s alpha of 0 70 and above is good 0 80 and above is better and 0 90 is best in pca each factor was considered as one aspect of the attribute dimension those factor scores were used as factor associates in weighted index values an index of attribute ioa dimension is a composite of different aspects or attributes the pca was conducted with polychoric correlation instead of pearson correlation as the attribute values adopted are ordinal the pca analysis was carried out using an r programming library loading interpretation and ascribing their physical meaning in each factor was one of the challenges in the application of factor analysis li and weng 2007 excellent strength of relationship among the variable and the factor is given to a loading value greater than 0 7 the relationship is very good good fair and poor when the loading absolute values are between 0 63 and 0 70 0 55 0 62 0 45 0 54 and 0 32 0 44 respectively li and weng 2007 3 2 3 variable selection using stepwise regression a large number of variables in a model is one of the issues that affect model calibration results and their applicability if a model has few variables then it is relatively easy to calibrate and interpret the results it also requires less computational time as a result of reduced complexity notably important variables should not be excluded from the predictive model to provide balance between simplicity and fit for purpose heinze et al 2018 therefore variable selection should be performed with great care to minimize irrelevant or redundant information while still maintaining a very good model performance in this study we applied stepwise regression fsr for variable selection which is a combination of forward and backward selection techniques and multiple linear regression for model building fsr involves sequentially introducing the predictors into the model i e one at a time heinze et al 2018 haque et al 2018 it allows adding or removing variables at different steps starting with the null model depending on the significance level eventually it stops when there are no variables to remove or add a significant level of p values p 0 05 and akaike information criterion aic were used as stopping criteria in the fsr variable selection technique for this purpose we employed the r programming for statistical computing olsrr package hebbali 2018 multicollinearity correlation among the predictors in the mlr model was tested by calculating the variance inflation factor vif kim 2019 a value of vif greater than 5 indicates high multicollinearity kim 2019 we checked the multicollinearity test using car package with r programing 3 2 4 multiple linear regression analysis a multiple linear regression mlr model was used to estimate the dependent variables y data quality from a set of descriptive explanatory variables x attributes of citizen scientists in the mlr model the coefficients of the descriptive variables were estimated by minimizing the residual square sum in the dataset the mlr model was formulated by the following equation y β o β 1 x 1 β n x n ε where y the dependent variable quality score of the observed rainfall data x independent variable dominant attributes of the csts as identified using stepwise regression variable selection βi coefficients associated with explanatory variables parameters and ε is residual in the current study mlr model was applied to evaluate the relationship between the dominant attributes of the citizen scientists and the quality of the cs data the dominant attributes were identified using the stepwise regression variable selection due to limited number of samples n 19 care was taken not to over fit the predictive model by identifying important variables in the model feature selection using stepwise regression and employing the cross validation technique the key assumptions of mlr linearity independence of explanatory variables normal distribution of residuals and homoscedasticity were tested in the current study the mlr was mainly employed to understand and predict rainfall data quality in relation to the dominant csts attributes with no intercepts in the analyses all the mlr analyses were conducted in r programming packages libraries 3 2 5 cross validation cross validation cv is frequently used to understand the stability and the generalization capability of a mlr model here the k fold cross validation k fold cv was used to evaluate the performance of the developed regression model with sample size of 19 the k fold cv unlike leave one out cross validation loocv has the possibility of reducing model instability pessimistic bias and the estimation of accurate error rate james et al 2013 4 results 4 1 rainfall quality control first the summary of the score of the four quality control stages is presented in table 5 and 6 the quality score of the citizen science rainfall data was found relatively low in the initial stages of the data quality assessment i e basic qc i and ii whereas the accuracy was high when data of neighboring stations were compared i e the relative and absolute quality control stage as suspicious data for basic qc i and ii were removed the difference in mean score of the four qc stages was small 1 51 in terms of basic qc i none of the stations provided perfect quality data as the maximum score was only 8 82 ab02 with a minimum of 5 77 ko01 and mean score of 7 52 indicating a good quality of the citizens science rainfall data a perfect score of 10 was found for basic ii qc stage at ma01 station but only marginal difference was detected between the mean scores of basic i and basic ii this was due to prior screening of the suspicious data in basic qc i outliers improbable zero and constant values within the data the citizen science rainfall data of the stations have a very good quality mean score between 8 and 9 in terms of the relative and absolute qc a maximum standard deviation sd was found for basic qc i indicating higher dispersion of the scores from the mean it is still within 2 standard deviations from the mean score the lowest sd value was obtained for absolute qc indicating a lower spread of the individual score with in absolute qc hence the difference in data quality of the stations is smallest for absolute qc all the sd values in the qc stages were not significant as there is no 95 chance that the difference is due to discrimination scatter plots of data from neighboring rain gauge stations were used to assess the data quality the scatter plots were grouped in to four based on spatial proximity of the stations scatter plots were also used to compare the citizen scientists rainfall data from four rain gauge stations against data from the tipping bucket rain gauge tbr a moderately strong positive agreement between the rainfall amounts of the paired neighboring stations was observed the scatter plots of only the first group are shown here for the sake of brevity fig 3 this strong correlation between the rainfall data of the rain gauges depends on the distance and elevation difference between the locations of the stations station me01 recorded high rainfall of 65 mm while all neighboring stations recorded lower than 35 mm on 04 august suggesting the record of me01 is suspicious on this date on the other hand this station showed zero rainfall when all the neighboring stations observed above 10 mm rainfall on 09 september 2020 following similar evaluation of the scatter plots the rainfall data of stations ar01 ko01 se01 and ic01 have low scores scoremin because of suspicious record when compared with the neighboring stations no suspicious record was identified for thirteen stations out of nineteen stations based on the scatter plot the cumulative plots were also grouped in to four based on spatial proximity of stations the overall pattern of the cumulative plots of the data showed a very good agreement across the season the step changes and timing of increments in the cumulative plots have similar order of magnitude for most of the stations from group1 fig 4 in the study area only the cumulative plot of station me01 showed step changes that are larger than the step changes of the cumulative plot for the neighboring stations these changes occurred on 04 and 26 august 2020 as a result the score was low scoremin for rain gauge station me01 from group1 similarly the quality score of stations se01 ko01 ic01 ye01 and ar01 was low while that of stations ab01 ab02 and di01 was maximum when evaluated in terms of cumulative plots overall there is clear step change match for most of the station s daily rainfall data in all the groups showing a good data quality moreover the cumulative departure from the mean test resulted in trend over the observation period among the stations within the neighboring groups in the catchment fig 5 furthermore station ko01 showed a decreasing trend with above average rainfall from the neighboring mean rainfall station me01 indicated an increasing trend with substantial deviation from the mean and relatively constant trend were observed by stations ab01 and ab02 according to magnitude of departure from the mean data of stations ko01 and me01 scored low whereas stations ab01 and ab02 scored high likewise the data of stations ma01 ak01 and im01 scored high whereas that of stations ye01 ar01and se01 scored low based on cumulative departure from the mean test taylor diagram was used to assess the data quality based on the statistical relationship between rainfall data of multiple stations taylor 2001 it provides complimentary statistical information including correlation coefficient cc centered root mean squared difference rmsd and the amplitude of their variations using normalized standard deviations sd all 19 stations were considered in the quality assessment with the taylor diagram however for simplicity of understanding the rainfall data of all the stations compared to four reference stations me01 ko01 ab01 and ab02 was presented here fig 6 additionally data quality of all the rain gauge stations was assessed using taylor diagram keeping tbr as a reference station however we acknowledge that factors other than spatial distance e g natural rainfall variability can also affect the data statistics still the taylor diagram is useful for quality control from the taylor diagram the centered rmsd value for rainfall of most stations was found less than 10 when evaluated against the references fig 6 the centered rmsd value was between 5 and 10 for most stations a better performance was observed for stations ab01 me01 ko01 and kor01 centered rmsd less than 5 while low performance was observed for stations su01 and di01 centered rmsd are relatively high the assessment of taylor diagram showed an increase in centered rmsd as the stations are far from the reference station spatial proximity exists in the data the pcc value was used to understand the degree of association between rainfall data of the reference and the remaining stations the pcc of the data of reference station and that of other stations was mostly greater than 0 7 this indicates a significant or strong association between the reference data and that of the neighboring stations however the degree of association or correlation varies among the stations strong association pcc value higher than 0 8 was observed between data of the reference stations and stations kor01 ko01 ab01 ab02 and me01 the second strongest association was detected between data of stations ar01 ta02 and ma011 and the reference stations stations su01 di01 and im01 have shown a moderately weak relationship with the reference stations by having a pcc value less than or equal to 0 7 this could be due to the orographic nature of the rainfall in the watershed and the systematic error introduced by volunteers the su01 station data showed the weakest correlation pcc value less than 0 5 against the reference stations data the second and third weakest correlation was observed for stations di01 pcc value less than 0 7 and im01 pcc value is nearly 0 7 respectively standard deviation sd was used here to understand estimates of the degree of variability of the station data values around the sample mean measures of dispersion when compared to the reference station the smallest difference low variability in terms of sd value less than 10 was found for station ar02 against the reference station rain gauge stations ko01 and ar02 well captured the reference rainfall data when evaluated with the standard deviation stations kor01 ab01 ab02 and ta02 are among the second best performers in terms of sd the data of these stations have similar dispersion or variability with that of the reference stations poor performance was reported for stations la01 le01 and se01 those stations exhibited high sd values with different dispersion about the mean against the reference stations according to the taylor diagram analysis results fig 6 the rainfall data of station su01 scored low scoremin and station ko01 scored high scoremax as they are the stations with the highest and lowest number of low score counts respectively 4 2 rainfall characteristics the spatial mean daily seasonal rainfall distribution for the watershed was variable from june to september 2020 fig 7 the most upstream part of the watershed exhibited high rainfall magnitude whereas the downstream part of the watershed showed low rainfall magnitude the seasonal highest rainfall was observed over the north east part of the watershed the maximum mean monthly rainfall for the 2020 summer rainy season ranges between 535 mm in august and 460 mm in july the lowest rainfall distribution occurred in june mainly in the south east spatially we noted that the rainfall distribution did not follow a uniform pattern for each of the months in june rainfall is highest 225 270 mm over the north west part of the catchment and it is lowest 110 150 mm over the south and south east parts the area of the maximum rainfall then shifted to the north and north east side of the watershed the monthly rainfall has shown a similar spatial pattern in july and september except for the southern side overall the spatial rainfall distribution suggests topographic effect on variation in the rainfall amount of the catchment 4 3 principal component analysis 4 3 1 factor analysis and dimensions of attributes the socio demographic and spatial variables were assessed for their suitability for analysis before performing pca the bartlett s test of homogeneity of variance and kaiser meyer olkin test kmo values are 0 0000046 and 0 69 respectively since bartlett s test is less than 0 05 i e no difference in variances of the group and the kmo test is larger than 0 5 i e the sampling is adequate the socio demographic and spatial data are suitable for pca hence pca was applied to understand the relationship among the variables and dominant factors that influence the rainfall data quality twelve variables that reflect the socio demographic and spatial characteristic of the csts were scrutinized fig 8 shows the result of polychoric correlation between the citizen scientists attributes the blue shade indicates positive values and the red shade indicates negative values the color goes deeper as the absolute value of correlation gets higher the polychoric correlation suggested a medium to strong association among the variables having a similar pattern of colored patches attributes such as education and marital status education and prior experience education and community participation location and employment status location and period of residence are highly correlated the polychoric correlation suggests that those highly correlated variables can be used to explain their relationship against the response variable rainfall data quality with the assumption of the joint continuous distribution the resulted polychoric correlation coefficients measure the association of the ordinal variables 4 3 1 1 description of attribute dimensions table 7 shows the component analysis result after applying the polychoric correlation the first four eigenvalues which exceed 1 were obtained with the polychoric correlation of the factor analysis eigenvalue greater than 1 indicates more variance is accounted by the factors than one of the original variables a factor analysis was performed with maximum likelihood estimation the total number of factors extracted with eigenvalue criterion and scree plot are four with variance explained equal to 77 82 table 7 the first factor explained 32 30 of the variance while the second third and the fourth explained 23 15 11 21 and 11 16 respectively the variables included in the first factor are education level community participation marital status prior experience age and use of sms text and smartphone messaging app this could be interpreted as the factor related to the preference for education experience and technological applications age is negatively correlated with variables that have positive loadings in this factor and it is in the opposite direction of the factor the citizen scientists attributes such as gauge relative location period of residence and employment status are majorly responsible for the second factor the third and the fourth factors have the preference for supervisor s travel length distance from supervisor to the observer and socio demographic status such as head of family factors the high variance implied that those four factors or dimensions were vital to consider in preserving most of the important information contained within these twelve 12 attributes old variables even though attaching a physical meaning to each factor is a challenging task in pca the factors with eigenvalue greater than one were interpreted to understand the dominant attributes influencing the csts rainfall data quality first factor pc1 the high weighted variables found from pc1 were edu sma com and pre hence this factor indicates the importance of level of education technological applications ete and experience since it shows high loadings on the aforementioned variables the variables are positively correlated with the factor the higher the score in this factor the higher the demand for ete attributes second factor pc2 this factor was derived from a combination of variables from the gauge relative location loc employment status ems and period of residence it can be interpreted as the proximity employment and period of residence dimensions pep selection of the appropriate relative location of the rain gauge employment status and the period of residence of the citizen scientists highly influences this factor third factor pc3 this factor can be interpreted as travel distance and demographic dimension dd since it shows high loadings on the travel distance and the number of family members this factor is highly related to the length of travel distance to supervise citizen scientists and family size information fourth factor pc4 this factor is solely represented by the demographic dimension dd head of family status hof the relationship among the independent variables was investigated using pca we noticed that the variables were clustered in to three variable s gauge relative location employment status and head of family have positive correlation with each other period of residence age and distance have similar characteristics strong correlation was observed among the variables education use of sms and smartphone messaging app community participation period of residence years and marital status the relationship among independent variables against the response variable quality of the data with multiple regression analysis mlr was scrutinized it showed that distance community participation prior experience period of residence years and head of family impacted negatively quality decrease as the values increase whereas the other variables impacted positively quality increase as the values increase an increase in age education gauge relative location and use of sms and smartphone messaging app is associated with quality of the rainfall data as they have higher coefficients from the mlr 4 4 stepwise regression analysis the result of stepwise regression variable selection showed statistically significant value for a total of four out of the twelve predictor variables education and gauge relative location were found the first and the second most influential variables affecting the dependent variable data quality the use of sms and smartphone messaging application and distance to the citizen scientists house were the third and the fourth dominant variables the rest of the variables were not statistically significant in this stepwise regression variable selection analysis there is no multicollinearity among the independent predictor variables as the estimated variable inflation factor vif values were less than 5 the maximum vif value is equal to 2 73 which is less than 5 and the variables are not highly correlated fig 9 thus the predictor valuables can be used in the mlr model building for prediction 4 5 multiple linear regression analysis after the dominant attributes were identified using stepwise variable selection analysis multiple linear regression analysis mlr was applied to predict the quality indicator of the rainfall data as a function of the dominant preselected variables in this study four prominent variables with a statistically significance level 0 05 were used to regress with the quality indicator of the rainfall data education status edu gauge relative location loc use of sms and smartphone messaging app and distance variables were used in the mlr analysis homoscedasticity was checked before undertaking further analysis the mlr analysis was conducted with and without an intercept and the sample adequacy criteria was taken in to consideration the mlr equation developed is described as m l r i 0 42 x e d u i 0 28 x l o c i 0 2 x s m a i 0 17 x d i s i where mlr multiple linear regression is the predicted or response variable and the subscript i refers to the respective individual citizen scientist edu loc sma and dis are the independent variables the values 0 22 0 28 0 2 and 0 17 are the regression coefficients of the first second third and the fourth independent variables the result of multiple linear regression mlr analysis with intercept between the attributes and the response variable rainfall data quality score is shown on table 8 the estimated mlr showed a residual standard error of 1 184 on 15 degrees of freedom multiple r squared value of 0 98 adjusted r squared value of 0 97 f statistic 180 2 and a p value of 1 744e 12 moreover the mlr model with no intercept is shown on table 9 the estimated mra showed a residual standard error of 0 82 on 14 degrees of freedom multiple r squared value of 0 92 and adjusted r squared value of 0 90 f statistic 41 14 and a p value of 1 357e 07 the estimated mlr with and without intercept showed that the four independent variables have significant influence on the response variable in an increasing order of strong influence namely dis sma loc and edu table 8 and 9 4 6 k fold cross validation the prediction ability of the developed mlr model with the variable of interest was verified by k fold cross validation technique the estimation of true performance of the prediction data set with the k fold cv was found good in terms of the root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae and r squared values the k fold cv with 5 folds k 5 datasets resulted in a value of 1 56 1 34 and 0 83 in terms of rmse mae and r squared respectively fig 10 a perfect rmse and mae error values are 0 0 indicating the prediction and the observation expected value are exactly matched moreover ideal r squared value is 1 in this study r squared value is greater than 0 7 rmse 0 83 which indicates a good predictive model ability the rmse 1 56 value was found close to the line of predictive model best fit regardless of its dependence on the range of numerical observed values within the data set since the mae is low and r squared is high which indicates a good model to predict fig 10 the developed mlr model can be used to predict datta quality according to the k fold cross validation 5 discussion the usability of citizen science data can be increased through proper setting up of the citizen science program and rigorous supervision although they are few there are some guidelines on how to set up citizen science programs walker et al 2019 however guidelines on how to detect rainfall observation errors to inform supervision of cs science programs are rare this study contributes to filling such gap by developing and implementing a progressive quality control procedure on rainfall data collected by citizen scientists installation of multiple rain gauges in the study area by the cs program provided the opportunity for systematic data quality control it particularly avoided the need to use secondary data e g satellite rainfall product as a reference for quality control of the citizen science data according to the quality control procedure of this study most of the citizen scientists recorded very good quality data hence the citizen science data can be used for several hydrological purposes including accuracy assessment of rainfall forecasts satellite rainfall estimates and rainfall runoff modeling for flood forecasting in the akaki catchment however we still detected some errors within the data through our qc procedure our finding revealed a low score at the initial stage of quality control this suggests that most errors can be detected with simple and quick to apply procedures that are important for timely supervision of the citizen scientists in addition comparison of data from neighboring stations using graphical methods e g scatter plot was found useful to assess the data quality overall most of the suspicious records were easily detected and therefore can be communicated and corrected during supervision of the citizen scientists to increase the usability of the data similar to our findings shinbrot et al 2020 found that the initial stage of quality control detected a large percent of the error and indicated that this was due to misreading and missing records in sum our findings suggested that a good quality of citizen science rainfall data can be obtained that can complement the conventional rainfall data this finding agrees with that of vos 2019 and walker et al 2016 indicating the capability of csts to collect quality data for the purpose of hydro meteorological applications if quality controlled cs rainfall data from most gauging stations revealed good agreement in terms of cumulative rainfall plots cc rmsd and sd within the catchment with station to station comparison and against tbr this study showed that progressive qc can help to identify source of rainfall monitoring errors the relationship between the resulting quality control score and the indicators or stages showed station to station variability one of the indicator within the basic qc i stage can have higher influence on the aggregated quality score than the other indicators for instance station ab02 and ko01 scored highest 8 8 and lowest 5 7 during basic qc stage i the lowest quality score of station ko01 at this stage is mostly attributed to the indicator recording time shift or and accumulated rainfall data error on the other hand both stations behave differently when we observe the score of relative and absolute quality control stages this indicates that stations with certain citizen scientists attributes resulted in a low quality scores for some of the indicators while having high quality scores for other indicators thus receiving a low score on the basic quality control stage i negatively affects the aggregated average score of that station and vice versa values outside the expected range outliers check target station correlation and temporal consistency step change check using daily cumulative rainfall totals over the observation period were found to be responsible for low score of stations ko01 la01 and le01 at basic ii relative and absolute quality control stages respectively if one indicator is extremely high or low it directly influence the overall quality score since our study assumed equal weightage for each indicator score suitable indicator score aggregation technique should be identified in future studies one of the limitations of the cs rainfall program presented in this study is the daily observation interval that can be insufficient for some operational forecasting and long term flood prediction studies this limitation is common in citizen science programs in other study sites bárdossy et al 2021 mapiam et al 2022 the limitation is mostly resolved by the disaggregation of the daily time step rainfall data in to an hour using the temporal distribution patter of tipping bucket rain gauge networks however further research is needed to engage citizen scientists in collection of rainfall data at finer temporal scale sub daily to hourly for instance they can record the start and end time of the rainfall events in addition to the rainfall magnitude from our results the mlr model coefficients suggested that education level has the highest influence on the quality of the collected data hence training and supervision of citizen scientists must consider their educational level the rain gauge relative location highly influenced the data quality the closer the observer s residence is to the rain gauge site the higher the data quality there is also a strong relation between the use of sms and smartphone messaging application by the citizen scientists and data quality the relationships of the rainfall data quality and attributes based on the multiple linear regressions suggested that education observers living close to the rain gauge and use of sms and smartphone messaging app can be generalizable to other locations that is because the relationship is direct nevertheless the supervision distance between the scientists relative location and the observers living compound may not be strongly influencing the data quality which could be due to the high access to transport in urban and peri urban setting the model can be used to inform citizen science efforts and trainings with due prioritization on citizen scientists education status rain gauge relative location and the use of sms and smartphone messaging application similar studies showed that learning was found to impact the quality of cs rainfall data quality shinbrot et al 2020 according to the current study csts engagement must consider their education level properly the use of smartphone app provided better quality data the rainfall data quality is high when the rain gauge was located within the vicinity or living compound of the citizen scientists however cs should strive to involve diverse categories of citizens in the rainfall data collection the aim of the study is not to exclude csts but to explore which attribute affects the data quality and suggest future research to recognize the influence of those attributes citizen science is an opportunity to involve a range of participants and demographics to truly democratize science and empower communities walker et al 2021 similar assessment should be implemented in multiple catchments with more attributes large number of csts and rain gauges to test our hypothesis the result could be changed due to scaling and the aforementioned factors moreover learning through frequent trainings combined with csts level of motivation may further improve the quality of cs rainfall data future studies should explore the contribution of mobile apps for data transfer and quality assessment during variable selection stage the numbers of variables are commonly reduced to improve the performance of statistical analysis when the variables are correlated using stepwise regression stepwise regression is one of the most commonly used variable selection methods that follow sequentially introducing the predictors into the model one at a time heinze et al 2018 this technique has shown the capability to understand the effect of csts attributes on the quality of collected rainfall data in terms of variable selection and reduction methods stepwise regression and pca a close similarity among the selected influencing attributes was noticed these methods revealed that the three attributes edu loc and dis are highly dominant this close similarity of the methods were also verified on the work of haque et al 2018 who used pca and stepwise regression method for urban water demand forecasting in this study the results of stepwise regression method suggested incorporating the use of smartphone application during rainfall data collection to improve data quality the number of variables affecting rainfall data quality and the scale of the monitoring campaign are among the limitations of this study while recording rainfall some citizen scientists were not recording exactly at 9 00 am due to school time and working hours resulting in one to two hours shift in time however this is expected to have minimal effect since most of the rain in ethiopia falls in the afternoon or evening haile et al 2009 the findings of our study indicated that identifying the dominant attributes of citizen scientists and their associated explanatory variables can enhance the quality of rainfall data then we found out that education gauge relative location the use of smartphone and distance to gauging site highly affected the quality of the rainfall data future research studies should scale up the study to relatively large catchments and consider additional variables affecting rainfall data quality to thoroughly understand the factors 6 conclusions there is a growing interest in the use of citizen science for engaging the community in hydro meteorological monitoring this study explored the effect of factors affecting the quality of citizen science rainfall data in the akaki catchment in ethiopia we conclude that data quality control has the potential to inform supervision of citizen scientists and improve the quality of rainfall data in addition the following conclusions are drawn the initial stages of quality control which can be done quickly by inspecting the data recording sheet can help to identify most of the rainfall data quality issues hence results of the initial stages of quality control can be used to regularly train and provide timely feedback to the citizen scientists to improve the quality of the rainfall data overall our results indicate that cs rainfall monitoring can complement the conventional data monitoring system by providing reliable spatial and temporal rainfall data if quality controlled certain attributes of the citizen scientists significantly affected the quality of the rainfall data for this study the quality of the data was heavily affected by education level indicating increased follow up of citizen scientists with low education level i e frequent feedback and training is needed with citizen scientists who have a low level of education future citizen science programs can explore the required incentives for volunteers who live far from the gauging sites and who are using smartphone apps this study demonstrated the importance of establishing a dense rain gauge network in citizen science programs to better control the quality of citizen science data studies should carefully consider citizen scientist s attributes with a comprehensive rainfall data quality control standard while monitoring rainfall future studies can explore how citizen science data from such dense rain gauges can be applied for validation of rainfall forecasts from numerical weather predictions nwp and for flood forecasting purposes declaration of competing interest the authors declare

3022,the complicated phenomenon induced by inadequate precipitation is a drought that impacts water resources and human life traditional methods to assess groundwater drought events are hindered due to sparse groundwater observations on a spatio temporal scale these groundwater drought events are not well studied in the study area of the indus basin irrigation system ibis holistically this study applied four machine learning models to the training datasets of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace terrestrial water storage tws and groundwater storage gws data to improve resolution to 0 25 from 1 the extreme gradient boosting xgboost model outperformed the four models and results showed pearson correlation r 0 99 nash sutcliff efficiency nse 0 99 root mean square error rmse 5 22 mm and mean absolute error mae 2 75 mm the grace groundwater drought index ggdi was calculated by normalizing xgboost downscaled gws the trend characteristics the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of ggdi were analyzed across the ibis from 2003 to 2016 the wavelet coherence approach was used to evaluate the relationship between teleconnection factors and ggdi the xgboost downscaling model can accurately reproduce local groundwater behavior with the acceptable correlation of coefficient values for validation ranging from 0 02 to 0 84 the accumulated standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei with the time of 1 3 and 6 months and self calibrated palmer drought severity index sc pdsi were used to validate ggdi the findings have demonstrated that ggdi has comparable drought patterns to spei 3 and spei 6 and sc pdsi the teleconnection factors have a significant impact on the ggdi shown by the wavelet coherence technique the impact of the sea surface temperature index namely nino3 4 on ggdi was observed significantly high among other teleconnection factors in the ibis the proposed framework can serve as a useful tool for drought monitoring and a better understanding of extreme hydroclimatic conditions in the ibis and other similar climatic regions keywords grace tws gws machine learning models downscaling drought ggdi data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the most prevalent natural catastrophe is drought in the world with high frequency lengthy duration and a large impact range mishra and singh 2011 aghakouchak et al 2015 it usually exists in areas where long term precipitation is lower than normal generally months and years wilhite and buchanan 2005 similar to other regions in the world most regions of pakistan are facing extreme drought the prolonged drought could be fatal and is challenging for agriculture water management forestation livestock the health of humans and lifestyle food security and various others hazell et al 2006 the basic classification of pakistan is an arid region with an agricultural economy limited precipitation and high temperatures adnan et al 2015 2017 as per the land use survey the land area of 34 15 million hectares mha is agricultural whereas the land area of 23 60 mha is uncultivable 25 percent of the land area is rainfed and has an important role to play in the economy of the country adnan and khan 2009 kazmi et al 2015 pakistan has become more exposed to drought threats because of its high dependency on agriculture for the economy some research focused on the characterization of drought in pakistan xie et al 2013 adnan et al 2018 in recent times socioeconomic and environmental conditions have been severely affected by climate change in pakistan and surrounding areas of southwest asia abbas et al 2018 drought is one of the causes responsible for bad economic results in the country according to the pacific economic survey report akhtar 2014 the primary cause of the drought was the lack of rain in pakistan during the monsoon season drought must thus be carefully monitored and evaluated commonly there are four categories of droughts i e hydrological drought meteorological drought agricultural drought and socio economic drought mishra and singh 2010 guo et al 2019 the term groundwater drought refers to a different form of drought when a drought affects the groundwater system groundwater replenishment occurs first followed by a reduction in groundwater level and discharge these types of droughts are known as groundwater droughts van lanen and peters 2000 the consequences of anthropogenic impacts can be readily related to aggravating groundwater drought directly and indirectly tallaksen and van lanen 2004 groundwater extraction often meets the demand for water as groundwater storage ensures resilience in periods of hydrological and agricultural drought hughes et al 2012 therefore excessive groundwater withdrawal can thereby aggravate the apparent drought castle et al 2014 groundwater drought is crucial to detect particularly in dry areas where the interchange between groundwater abstraction and recharge causes different states of groundwater stress richey et al 2015 the characteristics of the drought signal at spatial and temporal scales change when they pass through the terrestrial water cycle when compared to meteorological droughts groundwater droughts are usually lagged van loon 2015 utilizing the grace data many studies have investigated drought characteristics throughout the globe these studies only verified the capabilities of drought using grace data but not the associations between grace based droughts and teleconnection factors it is clear from earlier studies that climate variables have a major effect on drought wang et al 2015 ren et al 2022 many worldwide attempts have been made over past years to establish the relationship between climate variability and grace tws changes with most studies focused on el niño southern oscillation enso to evaluate the associations between the multivariate enso index mei and grace mass anomalies phillips et al 2012 utilized the monthly grace tws huang et al 2016 concluded that hydrological drought over the columbia river basin was greatly influenced by enso and arctic oscillation ao over the entire globe ni and chen 2018 examined the links between enso and grace tws vissa et al 2019 evaluated the relationship between enso induced groundwater changes derived from grace and global land data assimilation system gldas over india liu et al 2020 explored the role of teleconnections over tws variations within the asian and eastern european regions in the same way there are few studies related to linkages between grace and teleconnections han et al 2019 wang et al 2020 thus climate variables influence the drought directly or indirectly which requires a detailed investigation between them generally droughts are monitored based on meteorological and hydrological data from station observed and interpolation technique is used to distribute drought at a spatial scale traditionally although the characteristics of distributed drought achieved by interpolation on a spatial basis are not very good due to the shortage of station observation data and spatial heterogeneity of the regional environment which is hard to represent drought information at a large scale long et al 2014 in addition only a single variable for example soil moisture precipitation or surface runoff is used to construct various drought indices that may not reflect properly and extensively the actual drought situation thomas et al 2014 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei is the standardized precipitation index spi extension by incorporating potential evapotranspiration pet in determining drought vicente serrano et al 2010 furthermore hydro climatic extreme event indices such as palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 self calibrated palmer drought severity index sc pdsi wells et al 2004 and multivariate standardized drought index msdi hao and aghakouchak 2014 are widely used indices a previous study has demonstrated that climate change causes more frequent and serious natural disasters liu et al 2016 huang et al 2019 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fifth assessment report indicates that the severity frequency and length of several climate severe events would rise by the end of the century oliver 2013 thus studies linked to understanding and predictions of groundwater drought are increasingly important monitoring local regional groundwater drought using low resolution grace data 350 km is not easy long et al 2014 the grace based estimation of groundwater drought might give helpful information but groundwater measurements at a higher resolution are necessary to detect the precise condition of groundwater drought geographically in recent times machine learning methods have been established to cope with these difficulties milewski et al 2019 seyoum et al 2019 chen et al 2019 combined six hydrological variables to downscale the resolution of tws and gws data using the random forest rf algorithm the highest nse was 0 68 and r was 0 83 yin et al 2018 used evapotranspiration et data to downscale gws in the north china plain but this method was applied only in areas exhibiting a strong relationship between grace derived gws and et data rahaman et al 2019 downscaled the gws derived from grace using the rf model and the nse reached from 0 58 to 0 84 in the northern high plains aquifer miro and famiglietti 2018 conducted downscaling of gws using an artificial neural network ann and generated maps of gws changes from 2002 to 2010 at a higher resolution the nse ranged from 0 0391 0 7511 ali et al 2021 used rf and ann to downscale grace tws and gws in the irrigated indus basin irrigation system and r reached 0 67 0 99 recently precipitation products were downscaled from 0 25 to fine resolution 0 01 using geographically weighted regression kriging and attention based deep convolution neural nets chen et al 2018 sun and tang 2020 arshad et al 2021 sun et al 2021 reconstructed grace tws data to fill the missing gap of almost one year between grace and grace fo follow on using an automated machine learning approach however there has not been an investigation of groundwater drought characteristics based on downscaled grace data performed in the ibis moreover as much as we know no investigations have been conducted in ibis to determine the relations between teleconnection factors and drought our research purpose is to fill this research gap using the grace groundwater drought index ggdi to explore the drought conditions in the ibis from 2003 to 2016 and disclose the relationship between teleconnection factors and ggdi this research concentrated mainly on using the downscaled gws toward constructing groundwater drought and produces a continuous monthly time series dataset of groundwater drought at spatial and temporal scales using the machine learning approach for the ibis to our knowledge this is the first study as a framework that comprises groundwater drought event identification over the ibis this frame comprises groundwater drought and other hydrological drought conditions therefore this novel study addresses this research gap by exploring the high resolution groundwater drought situation and evaluation over ibis using the ggdi and identifying the relationships between ggdi hydrological drought indices spei sc pdsi and teleconnection factors this study assessed the effect of four major teleconnection factors the sea surface temperature sst index namely nino3 4 southern oscillation index soi multivariate enso index mei and pacific decadal oscillation pdo on ggdi over the ibis moreover gridded monthly drought trends were evaluated using the mann kendall mk trend test the objectives of this study were 1 downscale grace tws and gws based on tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm precipitation data geospatial data and gldas variables data using the machine learning models 2 validation of the selected xgboost downscaled gws using in situ data 3 estimate ggdi and investigate the temporal evaluation and spatial distribution of drought using ggdi 4 evaluation of ggdi in comparison to multi time scale meteorological drought index spei and the hydrological drought index sc pdsi 5 to evaluate the trend characteristics of ggdi over ibis with the mk trend test and 6 apply wavelet coherence method to evaluate the relationships between ggdi and teleconnection factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 area of study and sources of data the irrigated indus basin irrigation system ibis of pakistan fig 1 was the study area the ibis is the main agricultural part of the indus basin consisting of four doabs named thal chaj rechna and bari all located in the punjab province of pakistan the term doab is referred to the floodplain area between two rivers which is a source of water for irrigation the indus river and five of its main tributaries the jhelum chenab ravi sutlej and bias flow through the ibis there were numerous waterways constructed in the ibis to irrigate agriculture including link canals which convey water from western rivers to eastern rivers and main canals and their tributaries wescoat jr et al 2000 seepage from waterways and farmland is an important source of recharging the groundwater table iqbal et al 2016 punjab pakistan is one of the most fertile and water rich regions in the ibis accounting for more than 80 of the country s groundwater resources the indus basin s aquifer is unconfined and mainly comprises alluvial formation the subsurface lithology of the alluvial plain comprises silt clay fine sand and gravel loamy and sandy were more prominent soil texture classes that occupied an area of 56 and 19 respectively of the study region umar et al 2022 the temperature in the study region varies from 3 to 45 c arshad et al 2020 and precipitation with an average value of 59 cm yr mowp 2012 specific capacities of tube wells vary between 50 120 gpm u s gallons per minute per foot of drawdown bennett et al 1967 the study area is very fertile and rich in groundwater groundwater systems in ibis are subjected to extensive pumping to meet the increasing demands of population growth agricultural expansion and food security which in return results in groundwater depletion and makes the aquifer unsustainable statistics reported that approximately 69 of the water used to irrigate crops in ibis is either drawn from groundwater or in conjunction with canal water pbs 2015 2016 groundwater extraction grew from 10 billion cubic meters in 1951 to 68 billion cubic meters in 2002 with private tube wells accounting for almost 80 of total groundwater extraction during the period from 1965 to 2002 bhutta and alam 2006 groundwater persists in the alluvial aquifer systems of punjab in sand and silt that exist up to depths of approximately 300 m in persistent drought the ibis gets less precipitation and affects water resource allocation and usage at the same time the lack of water resources became a significant issue in development given the fast expansion in agriculture industry and population growth in recent years the groundwater was overexploited in the region to meet the requirements of agricultural production and residents iqbal et al 2016 hence studying groundwater drought has important significance in the ibis the kharif season is the rainy season providing 70 of available water and rainfall is only 30 of the total water available during the dry rabi season habib 2004 crop water requirement and crop intensity have increased over the past decades and have not been fulfilled by the sum of rainfall and surface water withdrawals in the ibis ullah et al 2001 the surface water supply is unreliable and inadequate which forces the farmers to extract fresh groundwater the groundwater resources pumped in quantity vary from 52 to 61 km3 yr pbs 2014 watto and mugera 2016 the groundwater level is observed to decline in regions where fresh groundwater is abundant most particularly in the north eastern areas of punjab mekonnen et al 2015 primarily the east side of punjab is a hotspot of groundwater depletion where the transient effect of extensive groundwater pumping across the indo pak boundaries rises the likelihood of depletion of groundwater cheema et al 2014 iqbal et al 2017 while in sindh province the quality of groundwater is marginal to hazardous and groundwater extraction only constitutes 4 8 of the total water use qureshi et al 2008 young et al 2019 2 2 data source and processing 2 2 1 grace tws presently the gravity data of the grace satellite are primarily derived from three institutions including the jet propulsion laboratory jpl the german research center for geosciences gfz and the center for space research at the university of texas csr respectively wahr et al 1998 landerer and swenson 2012 these gridded grace rl05 level 3 data with a resolution of 1 are available here https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land the grace data has undergone pre processing like glacier isostatic adjustment gia gaussian smoothing and de striping filter chen et al 2019 to recover the actual signals that were lost during the processing of data each grace dataset was multiplied by scaling factors seyoum et al 2019 yang et al 2018 about scaling factors more explanations can be found here landerer and swenson 2012 the average of these datasets was used in this study the accuracy can be improved using averaged data of these datasets landerer and swenson 2012 seyoum and milewski 2017 to fill all the missing month data a linear interpolation method was used long et al 2015 table 1 summarize the data used in this study 2 2 2 trmm data the most widely used data on precipitation is trmm a key source for grid precipitation data and utilized in hydrological meteorological ecological and other fields of study huffman et al 2007 cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 the trmm provides precipitation data at 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution the trmm data was upscaled to 1 degree to match with grace data for the period from 2003 to 2016 the trmm data version 7 3b43 is available here http disc sci gsfc nasa gov precipitation 2 2 3 auxiliary data the global land data assimilation system gldas integrates ground observation and satellite data into a combined model through advanced data assimilation techniques including land surface models namely noah mosaic community land model clm and variable infiltration capacity vic rodell et al 2004 the gridded data of various land surface field information contained in these models for example temperature global precipitation surface runoff soil moisture evapotranspiration etc the noah model has been used in several studies and also its verification has been confirmed in deriving tws and validating it with grace tws wang et al 2020 zhu and zhu 2019 the noah model has also been used in deriving gws estimation using noah derived water storage components subtracted from grace derived tws rahaman et al 2019 chen et al 2019 ali et al 2021 these studies verify the validation for using noah model data the noah model of gldas 2 1 only has a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 therefore this study utilizes the gldas 2 1 noah model product from 2003 to 2016 and can be downloaded from http

level data of 3368 observations were collected from punjab irrigation and drainage authority pida https irrigation punjab gov pk on seasonal bases i e pre monsoon june and post monsoon october wells the raw groundwater level data was pre processed to eliminate outliers irregular jumps and gaps in data a subset of 398 groundwater level observations data was selected over the upper region of ibis from june 2003 to june 2014 for validation purposes the selected groundwater observational wells are well distributed over the upper region of the ibis fig 2 the changes in groundwater storage on a seasonal basis were assessed by multiplying averaged specific yield with groundwater anomalies strassberg et al 2007 1 gws a gwl a s y where gws a shows groundwater storage anomalies gwl a shows groundwater level anomalies and s y is averaged specific yield the range of specific yield s y varies from 0 01 to 0 4 in the upper region of the ibis greenman et al 1967 the averaged s y of 0 14 was used to calculate gws a greenman et al 1967 in this study 3 methodology 3 1 derivation of downscaled groundwater storage the grace tws data generally includes vertically integrated aquifer water storage components that account for the total of groundwater surface runoff soil moisture and canopy water equation 2 scanlon et al 2012 rahaman et al 2019 therefore the downscaled gws was estimated by isolating the tws components which are canopy water storage δcws runoff δqs and soil moisture storage δsms derived from gldas were isolated yielding δ gws rahaman et al 2019 as shown in equation 3

is represented by s 2004 2009 avg 3 2 grace groundwater drought index ggdi the identification of groundwater drought based on grace data has not been investigated in the ibis therefore to explore the characteristics of groundwater drought the dimensionless ggdi was implemented initially climatology for month ci is estimated as follows 5 ci 1 n i 1 n i gws i here ci is the monthly climatology i 1 2 12 n is the number of a month n 1 2 14 during the study period 2003 2016 and gws is groundwater storage for i month the monthly climatology was used to isolate the impact of seasonality on gws changes thomas et al 2017 the groundwater storage deviation gsd was derived by subtracting the monthly climatology from gws which denotes the net deviation of seasonal variation in the gws lastly gsd is standardized by eliminating the mean x gsd and the standard deviation s gsd 6 ggdi gsd t x gsd s gsd here ggdi is a standardized net variation in gws gsd t is the groundwater storage deviation for time t t 1 2 0 168 x gsd is the overall mean of gsd and s gsd is the overall standard deviation of gsd utilized to indicate the drought table 2 shows the categorization of ggdi 3 3 mann kendall trend test the mann kendall mann 1945 kendall 1975 test statistics are computed by applying the formula as shown s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i where xj and xi are the results of j and i j i in time series

represent the increasing and decreasing trends respectively the5 significance level was used in trend analysis and at this level the null hypothesis of no trend was rejected if zs 1 96 3 4 singular spectral analysis ssa this method focuses on empirical orthogonal function and the dynamic reconstruction of time series statistically ghil et al 2002 walwer et al 2016 the space structure strongly connected temporally has been decomposed and information of time series can be efficiently isolated with noise in addition the ssa may abstract oscillating or relevant sequence reconstruction components and detect the time series process and trend elements of change ssa is not over structured which is particularly well suited to analyzing changes in the nonlinear time series ssa was utilized in this analysis to represent variations in the time series of ggdi the complete process is given below depending on the size of the moving window m a sample time series of n is organized and the tracking matrix is determined x x 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 x m x m 1 x n m 1 x n m 2 x n where x the matrix track m movable window length a matrix xxt is established for singular value decomposition and decomposed the tracking matrix x x i j k 1 m a i k e j k where a i k is the principal component and e j k is the corresponding feature vector the sequence is reconstructed by selecting a collection of

wavelet coherence can be used to determine the relationship between the 2 time series data by estimating the correlation between them that varies between 0 and 1 in accordance with torrence and webster 1999 and grinsted et al 2004 the coefficient of wavelet coherence between the 2 sets of time series data can be denoted as follows r 2 s τ s s 1 w xy s τ 2 s s 1 w x s τ 2 s s 1 w y s τ 2 where r 2 s τ coherence coefficient minimum and maximum coherence at 0 and 1 and w xy s τ cross wavelet transforms between two series equation 6 resembles the coefficient of determination equation and thus the wavelet coherence varies between 0 and 1 liu 1994 smoothing operator s represented as given below chang et al 2019 s w s scale s time w s τ the smoothing along the wavelet axis is represented as s scale and s time in the present study the wavelet coherence was examined at a 5 significance level or the confidence interval 95 3 6 machine learning models extreme gradient boosting xgboost is an ensemble learning approach however based on the algorithm of the gradient boost tree gradient increase is a method through which new models anticipate the residues or mistakes of previous models and are added to form the final forecast chen and guestrin 2016 xgboost also needs to construct many decision trees but all the trees are dependent and each new tree is based on the newest residuals or errors of the prior tree the predicted value of each sample is the sum of the values of leaves in each tree similar to the random forest xgboost can deal with complex nonlinearity relationships and handle the multi collinearity effect with high accuracy and multi collinearity didn t matter in xgboost zhu and zhu 2019 chen et al 2020 we used the xgboost package in the r language 91 there were three main important parameters to develop the xgboost model which were 1 eta control the learning rate scale the contribution of each tree by a factor of 0 eta 1 when it is added to the current approximation used to prevent overfitting by making the boosting process more conservative the lower value for eta implies a larger value for nrounds a low eta value means the model is more robust to overfitting but slower to compute in this study we used eta was 0 05 2 nrounds max number of boosting iterations nrounds 540 and 3 gamma minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree the larger the more conservative the algorithm will be a value of 0 was used for gamma in the xgboost the random forest rf algorithm was implemented to predict the tws using chronology data as inputs the rf is an enhanced form of a decision tree method combining basic bagging principles with a random selection of features to offer extra variety to decision tree models breiman 2001 decision tree methods are robust modeling techniques that use a tree structure to create connections between the characteristics and results a decision tree is created on a whole dataset using all the characteristics of interest whereas the rf picks observations and particular characteristics at random to create many decision trees then averages the results to generate predictions each bootstrap sample from the training dataset which comprised the tws data and chronology data as input variables was grown in the construction of the rf models one third of the input variables were randomly picked up to increase the tree to minimize the correlation between the prediction errors in a pair of decision trees in the rf model the projected final value was derived by an average of all trees predictions there were two main parameters used in the rf model for the prediction of grace tws which were 1 ntree and the number of trees to grow ntree 540 this should not be set to too small a number to ensure that every input row gets predicted at least a few times and 2 mtry the number of variables randomly sampled as predictors at each split note that the mtry values are different for classification square root sqrt of number of predictors and regression number of predictors 3 in this study 9 predictors were used for the regression problem therefore we selected a number 3 for mtry the support vector machine svm model vapnik 1995 was first suggested as a method for classifying the machine learning approach which was later extended to regression techniques vapnik 1998 it has been used effectively in a variety of applications including soil moisture measurement ahmad et al 2010 and biophysical parameter estimation from remote sensing data mountrakis et al 2011 the specifics of the svm approach were published by jing et al jing et al 2016 svm can be used as a classification machine learning and regression machine learning this study used svm as regression machine learning therefore only one main parameter type eps regression was used in the svm model the empirical and non linear relations between the input variables and the output variable these interactions are quantitatively represented by a network of empirical equations fitted throughout the network learning process a neural network of two layer feed forward was employed there is one input layer two hidden layers and one output layer in the ann model each layer is composed of a set of neurons and is trained using a back propagation algorithm it is one of the most widely used algorithms for supervised training of multilayer neural networks zolfaghari and izadi 2019 gholami et al 2018 in our study we applied a trial and error technique to determine the optimal number of hyperparameters where the numbers were added gradually until the predicted and observed values start to match by evaluating the model performance using the root mean square error rmse the number of epochs is the number of times that the backpropagation algorithm works through the entire training dataset the range of hidden neurons 100 150 and 100 epochs were used in this study to minimize the value of the error comprehensive information about the neural network and training algorithm can be found here mohaghegi et al 2005 turban et al 2008 the evaluation metrics were used between machine learning models predicted and observed values using the training data to assess the accuracy of the developed machine learning models 3 7 model design in this study the xgboost model was selected among other models including rf svm and ann to improve the resolution of grace tws and gws to 0 25 from 1 to develop the xgboost model the basic idea was to develop a statistical relationship between the response variable and independent variables at coarse resolution 1 then applied the developed model to the fine resolution 0 25 independent variables to achieve predicted tws the process of the downscaling flow diagram is shown in fig 3 1 the independent variables are resampled to 1 by pixel averaging from january 2003 to december 2016 then developed the xgboost model between the response variable and independent variables at a low resolution of 1 to predict tws 2 computed the residuals at a resolution of 1 by subtracting the xgboost model predicted tws in step 1 from the grace derived tws data 3 the developed xgboost model is employed to the independent variables at the resolution of 0 25 to attain the estimated tws then the residual correction was carried out by adding back interpolated cubic convolution residuals 0 25 in the xgboost calculated tws 0 25 to obtain the downscaled tws data 4 the downscaled gws at the resolution of 0 25 was attained by isolating gldas derived water storage components sms cws and qs from downscaled tws the results of downscaled gws were compared with the in situ data to obtain the model accuracy 3 8 evaluation metrics the evaluation of different models was carried out using two metric indices to compare the predicted tws values with grace derived tws that include pearson correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse the r estimates how grace derived tws and models predicted tws values are correlated and rmse in mm measures how closely the amplitude of predicted tws matches the grace derived tws values the r and rmse are estimated as follows 7 r i 1 n y i y o i o i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n o i o 2 8 rmse i 1 n o i y i 2 n 9 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i o i 10 nse 1 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where y and o show predicted and grace derived tws values respectively n is the length of time series o and y are the mean values of o and y respectively 4 results and analysis 4 1 accuracy analysis of machine learning models the four machine learning models were trained and tested using input data the models were established to predict the tws using input independent variables a comparison between the predicted tws and grace derived tws is shown in fig 4 the x axis shows the tws derived from grace and the y axis shows the model s predicted tws from fig 4 the xgboost model has the highest r 0 99 nse 0 99 mae 2 75 mm and the lowest rmse 5 22 mm respectively followed by the random forest with an r 0 97 slightly lower than the xgboost model the results of svm and ann are much lower than the xgboost the xgboost is the best model that can comply with the variable prediction criteria 4 2 sensitivity analysis of the xgboost model the importance of the independent variables was further analyzed given by the regression model thereby evaluating the predictive ability of the independent variables in fig 5 we show the ranking of importance of independent variables given by the xgboost based model with the importance of independent variables given by the xgboost based model we can find three variables that predominantly influence the tws which are rainfall rf dem and sms undoubtedly precipitation plays an important role in replenishing the gws zhang et al 2020 and tws zhang et al 2019 as one of the important influencing factors dem determines the recharge and discharge areas of gws and is an important input component of the groundwater model brydsten 2006 li and wong 2010 mirosław swiatek et al 2017 the sms is another factor that influences the tws and has been widely used for the inversion of grace derived tws li et al 2018 zhen et al 2018 zhong et al 2018 4 3 performance analysis of the xgboost model 4 3 1 characteristics analysis of downscaled gws variation at spatio temporal scale fig 6 shows the grace derived and downscaled gws variation which is almost similar showing a sharped decreasing trend in the ibis the decreasing rate of gws derived from grace and downscaled gws is observed same 3 39 0 45 mm year the trend variations of gws are consistent r 0 99 before and after downscaling which shows that the xgboost model can be applied to downscale gws without losing significant information the comparison between the time series of grace derived and downscaled gws confirmed that the downscaled products maintained the accuracy of the original data irrigation largely depends on surface runoff for water qureshi et al 2009 though cropping intensities have strongly increased because the crop water requirement was not satisfied by the combination of rainfall and surface water withdrawals over the historical periods simons et al 2020 furthermore the evapotranspiration is increased in summer which amplifies the decrease in soil moisture and increases the water demand for crops consequently leads to drought by overexploitation of groundwater in the ibis average groundwater withdrawal consistently exceeds aquifer recharge and caused a significant depletion in groundwater storage during 2010 fig 6 iqbal et al 2016 also reported large depletion of groundwater during 2010 demonstrating that gws has been continuously declining after 2010 was recorded heavy rainfall of monsoon hit pakistan at the end of july 2010 fig 6 shows the rising trend in gws after august 2010 played a significant role in replenishment due to the massive flooding in august 2010 it can be observed from fig 6 that maximum groundwater depletion occurred in august 2010 144 78 m m m o n t h therefore we analyzed variations of downscaled tws and gws at a spatial scale for august 2010 fig 7 the spatial variations of downscaled tws and gws were observed in more detail the tws increased near the middle area in the ibis boundary due to a flood in august 2010 iqbal et al 2016 and reduced in the top left and east sides of the region although the gws declined all over the area particularly in the upper region of the ibis except near the middle in the ibis boundary and north west of the area the tws and gws spatial variation can be detected more effectively at high resolution after downscaling the downscaled gws efficiently also represents the variability of the sub grid heterogeneity which is the influence of geospatial and hydro climatic features at the local level on gws regarding the spatial distribution spatial images of grace based downscaled gws showed similar spatial patterns as grace based gws throughout the study area furthermore spatial climatology maps of variations in downscaled gws were generated from january 2003 to december 2016 on monthly basis to further observe spatial variability fig s1 the monthly climatology of downscaled gws reflects fluctuations in the abstraction of groundwater and recharges influenced by climatic changes and anthropogenic activities the changes in the gws are observed significantly from january to december from 2003 to 2016 in ibis spatial patterns of downscaled gws climatology have shown that the upper and intermediate regions of ibis have been severely depleted by groundwater depletion while groundwater depletion in the lower ibis regions varies from mild to severe in a further study of this region models with high resolution might be supplemented to aid in understanding the decline or increase of gws in specific locations the water management policymakers can regulate the abstraction of groundwater for the long term and some measures have been taken bhatti 2020 though rapid population growth and increased water demand coupled with the expansion of irrigated agriculture put more pressure on the sustainability of the gws when surface water withdrawal does not meet increasing demand leads to overexploitation of groundwater moreover the simulations derived from the global change analysis model gcam show that the demand for agricultural industrial and domestic water is projected to increase in this region calvin et al 2019 in general the ibis has significant problems in managing water resources particularly groundwater resources being a key agricultural producing and dwelling region of the indus basin we used downscaled tws and gws and sms from the gldas noah model to further explore the characteristics of the variations in each component as shown in fig s2 the regional gws display an obvious change trend consistent with the results reported by iqbal et al 2017 ali et al 2021 ali et al 2022 they showed that gws was the main component contributing to the regional change in tws sms is the key component of tws which is a necessary condition for the survival and growth of regional plants drought occurs when sms is unable to meet the needs of plant growth from 2009 to 2010 the ibis continued to experience a drought iqbal et al 2017 ali et al 2021 ali et al 2022 and the drought was the most severe in 2010 hydrologic condition analysis results in an understanding of the interrelationships between precipitation surface and groundwater storage and other water storage fluxes variables that influence water storage therefore the determination of hydrologic conditions focuses on the analysis of the variables that most directly influence water storage in a specific region as shown in fig s2 the extent to which the sms decreased during the period was large consequently we inferred that the drought during this period was mainly caused by insufficient soil moisture notably in the ibis drought in 2010 the reduction in tws was large while the sms did not fluctuate substantially this difference may have been caused by the lag effects of rainfall and et on sms according to zhang et al 2015a an increase in the surface temperature enhanced the regional et so the drought was strengthened during the period the persistent negative anomaly in tws after 2010 was the result of joint actions of natural and anthropogenic factors zhu et al 2021 fig s3 represents the time series variations in surface water storage compartments including precipitation sms qs and cws results indicated that sms is consistent with the precipitation pattern showing an upward and downward trend in addition the sms trend might be associated with increasing groundwater pumping and may be a contributing factor to the increase the soil moisture storage in irrigated areas of ibis however the condition was partly different in the rainy season a peaked pattern in sms was observed in august implying the dominance of monsoon precipitation though cws is fluctuating around the seasonal peaks without any significant changes overall contributions of sms and precipitation were higher in the study region zhu et al 2021 followed by qs while cws was found to be negligible therefore major deviation in tws variations might be associated with sms iqbal et al 2017 ali et al 2021 ali et al 2022 and precipitation changes zhu et al 2021 4 3 2 validation of downscaled groundwater storage at spatio temporal scale the non uniform distribution of specific yield in aquifer layers complicates the computation of groundwater storage the selected 398 observational wells gws data was used to validate the downscaled gws to evaluate the performance of downscaling model spatially and temporally the temporal variation in gws was illustrated by overlaying the observational wells on the downscaled gws the pixels having observation wells were only selected for validation analysis fig 2 the overall trend from 2003 to 2016 of the selected pixels of downscaled 3 36 mm year and observational wells 3 22 mm year gws show a decreasing trend temporally it is shown in fig 8 that the seasonal patterns in observational wells and the downscaled gws are compared for six differentpixels in the ibis between january 2003 and december 2014 the gws both as observed and downscaled showed a changing downward trend deterioration of groundwater storagein theibis is evidence of drought and groundwater extractions recent studies iqbal et al 2016 iqbal et al 2017 ali et al 2021 ali et al 2022 have shown that the ibis has undergone groundwater depletion and this downward trend is consistent with those studies furthermore the gws downscaling was in good correlation with the station data as can be shown from pearson correlations the xgboost downscaled gws exhibits a positive correlation with the monitoring wellsranging from 0 02 to 0 84 iqbal et al 2016 iqbal et al 2017 ali et al 2021 ali et al 2022 it proves a statistically substantial association between downscaled and observational wells gws observational data are only available twice a year june and october rather than 30 days mean monthly data which explains the fluctuation in amplitude in both time series grace on the other hand provides an average for each month therefore there is some ambiguity in the consistency of observational and grace data that s why grace data peaks are not perfectly aligned with observational data peaks ali et al 2021 ali et al 2022 akhtar et al 2022 5 ggdi identified drought characteristics 5 1 temporal evaluation of drought the ggdi has a declining pattern with various change characteristics suggesting that the drought recognized by the ggdi in the ibis exhibits an increasing tendency from 2003 to 2016 fig 9 depicts the ibis s drought temporal evolution features from 2003 to 2016 droughts are becoming increasingly common in recent years as seen in fig 9 the most severe drought occurred between january 2010 and february 2011 which corresponded to the effects of large groundwater depletion during 2010 reported by iqbal et al 2016 the average value of ggdi was observed 0 60 during the drought event january 2010 and february 2011 over the entire ibis a severe drought was observed by ggdi 1 81 in august 2010 the standardized drought indices used are spei sc pdsi and the grace derived index is ggdi these standardized indices are selected based on robustness to detect drought conditions in arid dominated regions such as the ibis the drought severity status was evaluated using scales table 2 that were reported in previous studies spei vicente serrano et al 2010 sc pdsi wu et al 2021 and ggdi wang et al 2020 ssa was also used to simulate ggdi time series variability features the deviations from the ssa and ggdi trends were quite consistent fig 9 with the pearson correlation coefficient r 0 94 below the significant p 0 01 threshold the time series from the ssa also shows that the ggdi trend was declining this also shows that between 2003 and 2016 the drought increased in the ibis 5 2 comparison with meteorological drought hydrological droughts spread through the soils soil moisture deficiency geographically and temporally diverse meteorological signals rainfall deficit and decreasing recharge leading to lower groundwater levels peters et al 2003 the spatial and temporal characteristics of the drought signal change over the water cycle resulting in groundwater drought lagging and attenuating against meteorological droughts van loon 2015 some variables affecting these fluctuations in drought signal are connected to watershed and aquifers which can impact the ultimate temporal and spatial appearance including the kind of soil covered thickness the hydraulic properties of the soil and the unsaturated areas that recharged tallaksen et al 2009 bloomfield et al 2015 the spei which is one of the meteorological drought indices with several accumulation periods 1 3 and 6 months and the sc pdsi one of the hydrological drought indices were used to validate ggdi this study has selected spei based on penman monteith fao 56 which has a potential evapotranspiration data of 0 5 0 5 for worldwide regions vicente serrano et al 2010 sc pdsi also has a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 globally osborn et al 2017 and the trmm precipitation anomalies to compare with the dimensionless ggdi fig s4 illustrates the ggdi spei and sc pdsi time series along with the trmm anomaly the results show that the trends of drought situations were almost similar temporally i e decreasing from 2010 01 to 2011 02 highlighted with a pink box in fig s4 the spei became smoother as evapotranspiration and precipitation durations increased the trmm anomaly also observed the deficit in rainfall earlier and during the drought period smoother variations in sc pdsi and a longer period of drought compared with spei and ggdi were observed 5 3 spatial distribution of drought the most severe drought was observed between 2010 01 and 2011 02 the spatial distribution of drought was monitored during this drought event indicating the beginning and end of the drought in fig 10 the average values of ggdi over the study area from 2010 01 to 2011 02 on a monthly scale were 0 22 0 19 0 56 0 70 0 64 1 09 0 54 1 81 1 21 0 73 0 76 0 22 0 14 and 0 05 respectively the greatest drought appears to have occurred in august 2010 with nearly the whole ibis being seriously affected and ggdi was 1 81 in february 2011 the drought relief was significant with a ggdi score maximum of 0 05 the study area should thus focus on suitable drought resilient strategies to decrease the influence of a drought disaster and increase the capacity for drought resistance 5 4 drought trend features on the grid level as shown in fig s5 the ibis exhibited monthly significant positive and negative trends from january to december at different significant levels 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 percentiles the highest significant negative downward trends were observed during all months from the middle to the upper region of ibis whereas the bottom region showed a downward and upward trend from january to december with no significance in the ibis from june to december significant downward trends at significant levels of 0 1 0 05 and no significant trends were observed in the upper region of the ibis the highest significant negative downward trends were seen from january to may 5 5 the correlation between ggdi and climate factors previous studies have shown that droughts were closely related to climate variables vissa et al 2019 liu et al 2020 in the present study sst nino3 4 soi mei and pdo were chosen to describe the influences of teleconnections over ggdi moreover wavelet coherence was employed to evaluate the link between teleconnection factors and ggdi over the ibis from 2003 to 2016 fig 11 illustrates the wavelet coherence between monthly ggdi and teleconnection factors the thin solid line is the cone of influence fig 11 and has effective spectral areas to prevent wavelet transform boundaries and high frequency erroneous information a strong black contour shows the 5 percent significance level the coherence at interannual variability was observed continuously between 2009 and 2016 on time scales of 32 40 months and intermittency was observed between 4 and 20 months at different years for nino for soi intermittency was reduced between 4 and 20 months at different years and interannual variability was observed between 2010 and 2016 periods on time scales varying from 32 to 40 months continuously in the case of mei coherence at interannual variability was reduced and observed between 2003 and 2005 and 2011 and 2016 periods on time scales varying from 8 to 10 and 32 to 38 months and intermittency increased between 4 and 20 months in different years compared to other teleconnections at different scales during different years the effect of pdo was weak the only intermittency was observed between 10 and 20 months at different years it has been observed that wavelet coherence may be used to identify the connections between ggdi and teleconnection variables in addition teleconnection variables have substantial effects on ggdi and the effect of nino3 4 is larger on ggdi than soi mei and pdo 6 discussion 6 1 influence factors of drought it is extremely important that in the context of intense climate change and human activity the effects of drought should be properly analyzed to develop acceptable strategies to ensure food security and preserve social stability liu et al 2018 concerning teleconnection variables individuals progressively understood that they play an important part in the formation of droughts dai 2011 furthermore the findings of wavelet coherence as observed in section 5 5 indicate that the teleconnection variables nino3 4 soi mei have intensive effects on drought moreover enso occurrences can significantly reduce walker circulation leading to reduce precipitation and frequent droughts tobias et al 2014 a single indicator that shows all the climate variability characteristics in large regions is probably not possible zhu et al 2017 the impact of anthropogenic influences on drought cannot be disregarded in addition to natural causes water resources with uneven geographical and temporal distributions in the ibis are scarce cheema et al 2014 during the crop season people use more groundwater for irrigation than normal leading to a clear conflict of water resources between supply and demand and eventually triggering the crisis of drought cheema et al 2014 iqbal et al 2017 the scarcity of groundwater supplies not only limits the sustainable development of the society and economy but also increases the frequency of drought devastations during the everyday lives of the people the continual rise in the population increases water consumption leading to over abstraction of water and augment of drought the worst drought during 2010 01 2011 02 fig 9 might be due to large groundwater depletion in 2010 as reported by iqbal et al 2016 this drought prompted the public to abstract more groundwater to reimburse for the scarcity of surface water in fig s4 the trmm anomaly was also observed deficit in rainfall during drought followed by other drought indices as well except for heavy rainfall in july and august because of the lag time between precipitation water infiltrate to recharge groundwater the groundwater continues to decline causing the groundwater drought up to august 2010 hence directed to the depletion of groundwater in general the major driver of drought is climate induced drought human activities are also a factor in the development of groundwater droughts in the ibis therefore the water management system should be strengthened in several ways and need to develop water saving irrigation techniques groundwater replenishment and carefully control groundwater abstraction fang et al 2010 as the rainfall is unevenly distributed in space and time surface and groundwater resources are scarce in the ibis cheema et al 2014 farmers excessively use electricity and fossil fuels to pump groundwater to compensate for the lack of rainfall excessive withdrawal of groundwater to save crops in drought conditions has drained groundwater in most parts of the world therefore ultimately triggering a drought crisis 6 2 uncertainty analysis in the present research many areas of uncertainty were encountered firstly to reduce the uncertainty among grace data we considered averaged solution of three gridded grace spherical harmonic coefficients datasets instead of a single product seyoum and milewski 2017 still the spherical harmonic coefficient solutions developed by various organizations have ambiguities due to diverse background models as well as data processing approaches in addition the spherical harmonic coefficient solutions considered different hydrological models to adjust the scale factor which eventually contributes to the presence of uncertainty second to minimize the gldas uncertainty the ensemble mean of gldas models vic noah mosaic and clm was suggested cao et al 2015 third to reduce the uncertainty among machine learning models predicted tws at fine resolution the ensemble based approach of machine learning models may be more appropriate sun et al 2021 however similar to xgboost based downscaled gws the only noah model has the same spatial resolution 0 25 thus we adopted the gldas 2 1 noah model outputs in the present study to reduce the uncertainty related to spatial resolution in evaluating water storage estimations finally using linear interpolation techniques the missing grace data were filled out this may have triggered some uncertainties however since the approach is prevalent easy and extensively used in the handling of missing data we followed similar techniques in filling the grace dataset gaps kumar et al 2020 sun et al 2018 6 3 advantages and limitations grace satellite plays a crucial part in identifying drought in places with limited water storage data yirdaw et al 2008 to reduce the influence of various errors in the gridded grace spherical harmonic coefficients data one can apply various filtering processes yet results suggest the possibility of weak signals in the derived product therefore scale factors are applied to restore signal leakage induced by the filtering process landerer and swenson 2012 in regions where hydro meteorological data are minimal grace data are an important means of estimating and managing the drought in this analysis the ggdi drought index was assessed to detect droughts the ggdi is a standardized index that compares spatio temporal drought objectively providing strong evidence for evaluating surplus and deficit groundwater availability thomas et al 2017 this study positively established the drought events between 2010 01 and 2011 02 which were considered to be because of groundwater depletion iqbal et al 2016 moreover the interaction of ggdi with teleconnection factors showed the fact that teleconnections had a substantial effect on ggdi across the ibis using the grace dataset can efficiently and expediently identify drought characteristics but there is still a certain limitation in this study the longer record of grace data is needed but the record extends more than a few years of data the results will therefore be more accurate thomas et al 2014 the grace is an essential technology for improving the accuracy and gravity monitoring of terrestrial hydrology in gravity satellite sensors with the accuracy of tens of millimeters of equal thickness grace offers realistic spatiotemporal changes in vertically integrated water storage components the new grace follow on grace fo satellite datasets will provide a valuable solution for the long term evaluation of tws variations and their associated studies resulting in significant improvements in our knowledge of grace related studies the coarse residuals of tws were resampled using cubic convolution interpolation and the inter pixel changes should be further considered due to the lack of accurate data on lakes rivers and reservoirs for all of ibis we ignored the contributions of water from these sources moreover the effect of anthropogenic activities groundwater extraction regional water division mining over mass changes in the earth s surface cannot be overlooked tang et al 2013 these effects influence of human activities are generally ignored due to the lack of observed datasets as well as difficulties in the collection and measurement of relevant information therefore analyzing the influence of anthropogenic activities on variations in water storage may provide a fresh insight into the future of science nevertheless our produced downscaled gws data can provide certain guidelines for detailed investigations of the regional gws and can help improve future hydrological research thereby enhancing the capability for sustainable water resources management 7 conclusions in this study the xgboost based downscaled gws was selected among other machine learning models to examine and evaluate drought characteristics from 2003 to 2016 the downscaled gws was compared with observed gws data on the seasonal scales showing correlation ranging from 0 02 to 0 84 the spatial downscaled gws helps in identifying precisely those regions that have the sparse density of groundwater level data the temporal evaluation trend characteristics and spatial distribution of drought were investigated utilizing ggdi from 2003 to 2016 over the ibis the wavelet coherence technique was used to evaluate the relationship between ggdi and teleconnection factors the downscaled gws dataset provides significant advantages in identifying droughts and revealing information about large scale groundwater depletion where hydrometeorological data are limited and data related to water storage variations are inadequate in this study the downscaled gws variations have provided reliable and robust quantitative results that provide a new method to explore droughts and the approach can be applied to any other region the key findings from this research are as follows i the distinct variations of tws were observed in the ibis on monthly basis the significant upward and downward trends of tws were observed on monthly basis with most of the negative trends detected between 2010 01 and 2011 02 representing severe droughts ii the drought events based on ggdi showed different temporal change characteristics in the ibis the most severe drought event was detected in the ibis between 2010 01 and 2011 02 the drought based on ggdi exhibited a downward trend from 2003 to 2016 with different temporal variation characteristics in the ibis the worst drought was observed in august 2010 with a value of ggdi 1 81 on a monthly scale iii the mk test was used to evaluate drought trends on a monthly scale the highest significant negative trends were observed from january to december from the middle to upper region of the ibis iv finally the influence of teleconnection factors on ggdi was effectively demonstrated using the wavelet coherence method nino3 4 had a significantly high influence on ggdi followed by soi and mei in the ibis 8 data availability statement the observed groundwater level data were obtained from the punjab irrigation and drainage

3022,the complicated phenomenon induced by inadequate precipitation is a drought that impacts water resources and human life traditional methods to assess groundwater drought events are hindered due to sparse groundwater observations on a spatio temporal scale these groundwater drought events are not well studied in the study area of the indus basin irrigation system ibis holistically this study applied four machine learning models to the training datasets of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace terrestrial water storage tws and groundwater storage gws data to improve resolution to 0 25 from 1 the extreme gradient boosting xgboost model outperformed the four models and results showed pearson correlation r 0 99 nash sutcliff efficiency nse 0 99 root mean square error rmse 5 22 mm and mean absolute error mae 2 75 mm the grace groundwater drought index ggdi was calculated by normalizing xgboost downscaled gws the trend characteristics the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of ggdi were analyzed across the ibis from 2003 to 2016 the wavelet coherence approach was used to evaluate the relationship between teleconnection factors and ggdi the xgboost downscaling model can accurately reproduce local groundwater behavior with the acceptable correlation of coefficient values for validation ranging from 0 02 to 0 84 the accumulated standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei with the time of 1 3 and 6 months and self calibrated palmer drought severity index sc pdsi were used to validate ggdi the findings have demonstrated that ggdi has comparable drought patterns to spei 3 and spei 6 and sc pdsi the teleconnection factors have a significant impact on the ggdi shown by the wavelet coherence technique the impact of the sea surface temperature index namely nino3 4 on ggdi was observed significantly high among other teleconnection factors in the ibis the proposed framework can serve as a useful tool for drought monitoring and a better understanding of extreme hydroclimatic conditions in the ibis and other similar climatic regions keywords grace tws gws machine learning models downscaling drought ggdi data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the most prevalent natural catastrophe is drought in the world with high frequency lengthy duration and a large impact range mishra and singh 2011 aghakouchak et al 2015 it usually exists in areas where long term precipitation is lower than normal generally months and years wilhite and buchanan 2005 similar to other regions in the world most regions of pakistan are facing extreme drought the prolonged drought could be fatal and is challenging for agriculture water management forestation livestock the health of humans and lifestyle food security and various others hazell et al 2006 the basic classification of pakistan is an arid region with an agricultural economy limited precipitation and high temperatures adnan et al 2015 2017 as per the land use survey the land area of 34 15 million hectares mha is agricultural whereas the land area of 23 60 mha is uncultivable 25 percent of the land area is rainfed and has an important role to play in the economy of the country adnan and khan 2009 kazmi et al 2015 pakistan has become more exposed to drought threats because of its high dependency on agriculture for the economy some research focused on the characterization of drought in pakistan xie et al 2013 adnan et al 2018 in recent times socioeconomic and environmental conditions have been severely affected by climate change in pakistan and surrounding areas of southwest asia abbas et al 2018 drought is one of the causes responsible for bad economic results in the country according to the pacific economic survey report akhtar 2014 the primary cause of the drought was the lack of rain in pakistan during the monsoon season drought must thus be carefully monitored and evaluated commonly there are four categories of droughts i e hydrological drought meteorological drought agricultural drought and socio economic drought mishra and singh 2010 guo et al 2019 the term groundwater drought refers to a different form of drought when a drought affects the groundwater system groundwater replenishment occurs first followed by a reduction in groundwater level and discharge these types of droughts are known as groundwater droughts van lanen and peters 2000 the consequences of anthropogenic impacts can be readily related to aggravating groundwater drought directly and indirectly tallaksen and van lanen 2004 groundwater extraction often meets the demand for water as groundwater storage ensures resilience in periods of hydrological and agricultural drought hughes et al 2012 therefore excessive groundwater withdrawal can thereby aggravate the apparent drought castle et al 2014 groundwater drought is crucial to detect particularly in dry areas where the interchange between groundwater abstraction and recharge causes different states of groundwater stress richey et al 2015 the characteristics of the drought signal at spatial and temporal scales change when they pass through the terrestrial water cycle when compared to meteorological droughts groundwater droughts are usually lagged van loon 2015 utilizing the grace data many studies have investigated drought characteristics throughout the globe these studies only verified the capabilities of drought using grace data but not the associations between grace based droughts and teleconnection factors it is clear from earlier studies that climate variables have a major effect on drought wang et al 2015 ren et al 2022 many worldwide attempts have been made over past years to establish the relationship between climate variability and grace tws changes with most studies focused on el niño southern oscillation enso to evaluate the associations between the multivariate enso index mei and grace mass anomalies phillips et al 2012 utilized the monthly grace tws huang et al 2016 concluded that hydrological drought over the columbia river basin was greatly influenced by enso and arctic oscillation ao over the entire globe ni and chen 2018 examined the links between enso and grace tws vissa et al 2019 evaluated the relationship between enso induced groundwater changes derived from grace and global land data assimilation system gldas over india liu et al 2020 explored the role of teleconnections over tws variations within the asian and eastern european regions in the same way there are few studies related to linkages between grace and teleconnections han et al 2019 wang et al 2020 thus climate variables influence the drought directly or indirectly which requires a detailed investigation between them generally droughts are monitored based on meteorological and hydrological data from station observed and interpolation technique is used to distribute drought at a spatial scale traditionally although the characteristics of distributed drought achieved by interpolation on a spatial basis are not very good due to the shortage of station observation data and spatial heterogeneity of the regional environment which is hard to represent drought information at a large scale long et al 2014 in addition only a single variable for example soil moisture precipitation or surface runoff is used to construct various drought indices that may not reflect properly and extensively the actual drought situation thomas et al 2014 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei is the standardized precipitation index spi extension by incorporating potential evapotranspiration pet in determining drought vicente serrano et al 2010 furthermore hydro climatic extreme event indices such as palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 self calibrated palmer drought severity index sc pdsi wells et al 2004 and multivariate standardized drought index msdi hao and aghakouchak 2014 are widely used indices a previous study has demonstrated that climate change causes more frequent and serious natural disasters liu et al 2016 huang et al 2019 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fifth assessment report indicates that the severity frequency and length of several climate severe events would rise by the end of the century oliver 2013 thus studies linked to understanding and predictions of groundwater drought are increasingly important monitoring local regional groundwater drought using low resolution grace data 350 km is not easy long et al 2014 the grace based estimation of groundwater drought might give helpful information but groundwater measurements at a higher resolution are necessary to detect the precise condition of groundwater drought geographically in recent times machine learning methods have been established to cope with these difficulties milewski et al 2019 seyoum et al 2019 chen et al 2019 combined six hydrological variables to downscale the resolution of tws and gws data using the random forest rf algorithm the highest nse was 0 68 and r was 0 83 yin et al 2018 used evapotranspiration et data to downscale gws in the north china plain but this method was applied only in areas exhibiting a strong relationship between grace derived gws and et data rahaman et al 2019 downscaled the gws derived from grace using the rf model and the nse reached from 0 58 to 0 84 in the northern high plains aquifer miro and famiglietti 2018 conducted downscaling of gws using an artificial neural network ann and generated maps of gws changes from 2002 to 2010 at a higher resolution the nse ranged from 0 0391 0 7511 ali et al 2021 used rf and ann to downscale grace tws and gws in the irrigated indus basin irrigation system and r reached 0 67 0 99 recently precipitation products were downscaled from 0 25 to fine resolution 0 01 using geographically weighted regression kriging and attention based deep convolution neural nets chen et al 2018 sun and tang 2020 arshad et al 2021 sun et al 2021 reconstructed grace tws data to fill the missing gap of almost one year between grace and grace fo follow on using an automated machine learning approach however there has not been an investigation of groundwater drought characteristics based on downscaled grace data performed in the ibis moreover as much as we know no investigations have been conducted in ibis to determine the relations between teleconnection factors and drought our research purpose is to fill this research gap using the grace groundwater drought index ggdi to explore the drought conditions in the ibis from 2003 to 2016 and disclose the relationship between teleconnection factors and ggdi this research concentrated mainly on using the downscaled gws toward constructing groundwater drought and produces a continuous monthly time series dataset of groundwater drought at spatial and temporal scales using the machine learning approach for the ibis to our knowledge this is the first study as a framework that comprises groundwater drought event identification over the ibis this frame comprises groundwater drought and other hydrological drought conditions therefore this novel study addresses this research gap by exploring the high resolution groundwater drought situation and evaluation over ibis using the ggdi and identifying the relationships between ggdi hydrological drought indices spei sc pdsi and teleconnection factors this study assessed the effect of four major teleconnection factors the sea surface temperature sst index namely nino3 4 southern oscillation index soi multivariate enso index mei and pacific decadal oscillation pdo on ggdi over the ibis moreover gridded monthly drought trends were evaluated using the mann kendall mk trend test the objectives of this study were 1 downscale grace tws and gws based on tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm precipitation data geospatial data and gldas variables data using the machine learning models 2 validation of the selected xgboost downscaled gws using in situ data 3 estimate ggdi and investigate the temporal evaluation and spatial distribution of drought using ggdi 4 evaluation of ggdi in comparison to multi time scale meteorological drought index spei and the hydrological drought index sc pdsi 5 to evaluate the trend characteristics of ggdi over ibis with the mk trend test and 6 apply wavelet coherence method to evaluate the relationships between ggdi and teleconnection factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 area of study and sources of data the irrigated indus basin irrigation system ibis of pakistan fig 1 was the study area the ibis is the main agricultural part of the indus basin consisting of four doabs named thal chaj rechna and bari all located in the punjab province of pakistan the term doab is referred to the floodplain area between two rivers which is a source of water for irrigation the indus river and five of its main tributaries the jhelum chenab ravi sutlej and bias flow through the ibis there were numerous waterways constructed in the ibis to irrigate agriculture including link canals which convey water from western rivers to eastern rivers and main canals and their tributaries wescoat jr et al 2000 seepage from waterways and farmland is an important source of recharging the groundwater table iqbal et al 2016 punjab pakistan is one of the most fertile and water rich regions in the ibis accounting for more than 80 of the country s groundwater resources the indus basin s aquifer is unconfined and mainly comprises alluvial formation the subsurface lithology of the alluvial plain comprises silt clay fine sand and gravel loamy and sandy were more prominent soil texture classes that occupied an area of 56 and 19 respectively of the study region umar et al 2022 the temperature in the study region varies from 3 to 45 c arshad et al 2020 and precipitation with an average value of 59 cm yr mowp 2012 specific capacities of tube wells vary between 50 120 gpm u s gallons per minute per foot of drawdown bennett et al 1967 the study area is very fertile and rich in groundwater groundwater systems in ibis are subjected to extensive pumping to meet the increasing demands of population growth agricultural expansion and food security which in return results in groundwater depletion and makes the aquifer unsustainable statistics reported that approximately 69 of the water used to irrigate crops in ibis is either drawn from groundwater or in conjunction with canal water pbs 2015 2016 groundwater extraction grew from 10 billion cubic meters in 1951 to 68 billion cubic meters in 2002 with private tube wells accounting for almost 80 of total groundwater extraction during the period from 1965 to 2002 bhutta and alam 2006 groundwater persists in the alluvial aquifer systems of punjab in sand and silt that exist up to depths of approximately 300 m in persistent drought the ibis gets less precipitation and affects water resource allocation and usage at the same time the lack of water resources became a significant issue in development given the fast expansion in agriculture industry and population growth in recent years the groundwater was overexploited in the region to meet the requirements of agricultural production and residents iqbal et al 2016 hence studying groundwater drought has important significance in the ibis the kharif season is the rainy season providing 70 of available water and rainfall is only 30 of the total water available during the dry rabi season habib 2004 crop water requirement and crop intensity have increased over the past decades and have not been fulfilled by the sum of rainfall and surface water withdrawals in the ibis ullah et al 2001 the surface water supply is unreliable and inadequate which forces the farmers to extract fresh groundwater the groundwater resources pumped in quantity vary from 52 to 61 km3 yr pbs 2014 watto and mugera 2016 the groundwater level is observed to decline in regions where fresh groundwater is abundant most particularly in the north eastern areas of punjab mekonnen et al 2015 primarily the east side of punjab is a hotspot of groundwater depletion where the transient effect of extensive groundwater pumping across the indo pak boundaries rises the likelihood of depletion of groundwater cheema et al 2014 iqbal et al 2017 while in sindh province the quality of groundwater is marginal to hazardous and groundwater extraction only constitutes 4 8 of the total water use qureshi et al 2008 young et al 2019 2 2 data source and processing 2 2 1 grace tws presently the gravity data of the grace satellite are primarily derived from three institutions including the jet propulsion laboratory jpl the german research center for geosciences gfz and the center for space research at the university of texas csr respectively wahr et al 1998 landerer and swenson 2012 these gridded grace rl05 level 3 data with a resolution of 1 are available here https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land the grace data has undergone pre processing like glacier isostatic adjustment gia gaussian smoothing and de striping filter chen et al 2019 to recover the actual signals that were lost during the processing of data each grace dataset was multiplied by scaling factors seyoum et al 2019 yang et al 2018 about scaling factors more explanations can be found here landerer and swenson 2012 the average of these datasets was used in this study the accuracy can be improved using averaged data of these datasets landerer and swenson 2012 seyoum and milewski 2017 to fill all the missing month data a linear interpolation method was used long et al 2015 table 1 summarize the data used in this study 2 2 2 trmm data the most widely used data on precipitation is trmm a key source for grid precipitation data and utilized in hydrological meteorological ecological and other fields of study huffman et al 2007 cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 the trmm provides precipitation data at 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution the trmm data was upscaled to 1 degree to match with grace data for the period from 2003 to 2016 the trmm data version 7 3b43 is available here http disc sci gsfc nasa gov precipitation 2 2 3 auxiliary data the global land data assimilation system gldas integrates ground observation and satellite data into a combined model through advanced data assimilation techniques including land surface models namely noah mosaic community land model clm and variable infiltration capacity vic rodell et al 2004 the gridded data of various land surface field information contained in these models for example temperature global precipitation surface runoff soil moisture evapotranspiration etc the noah model has been used in several studies and also its verification has been confirmed in deriving tws and validating it with grace tws wang et al 2020 zhu and zhu 2019 the noah model has also been used in deriving gws estimation using noah derived water storage components subtracted from grace derived tws rahaman et al 2019 chen et al 2019 ali et al 2021 these studies verify the validation for using noah model data the noah model of gldas 2 1 only has a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 therefore this study utilizes the gldas 2 1 noah model product from 2003 to 2016 and can be downloaded from http

level data of 3368 observations were collected from punjab irrigation and drainage authority pida https irrigation punjab gov pk on seasonal bases i e pre monsoon june and post monsoon october wells the raw groundwater level data was pre processed to eliminate outliers irregular jumps and gaps in data a subset of 398 groundwater level observations data was selected over the upper region of ibis from june 2003 to june 2014 for validation purposes the selected groundwater observational wells are well distributed over the upper region of the ibis fig 2 the changes in groundwater storage on a seasonal basis were assessed by multiplying averaged specific yield with groundwater anomalies strassberg et al 2007 1 gws a gwl a s y where gws a shows groundwater storage anomalies gwl a shows groundwater level anomalies and s y is averaged specific yield the range of specific yield s y varies from 0 01 to 0 4 in the upper region of the ibis greenman et al 1967 the averaged s y of 0 14 was used to calculate gws a greenman et al 1967 in this study 3 methodology 3 1 derivation of downscaled groundwater storage the grace tws data generally includes vertically integrated aquifer water storage components that account for the total of groundwater surface runoff soil moisture and canopy water equation 2 scanlon et al 2012 rahaman et al 2019 therefore the downscaled gws was estimated by isolating the tws components which are canopy water storage δcws runoff δqs and soil moisture storage δsms derived from gldas were isolated yielding δ gws rahaman et al 2019 as shown in equation 3

is represented by s 2004 2009 avg 3 2 grace groundwater drought index ggdi the identification of groundwater drought based on grace data has not been investigated in the ibis therefore to explore the characteristics of groundwater drought the dimensionless ggdi was implemented initially climatology for month ci is estimated as follows 5 ci 1 n i 1 n i gws i here ci is the monthly climatology i 1 2 12 n is the number of a month n 1 2 14 during the study period 2003 2016 and gws is groundwater storage for i month the monthly climatology was used to isolate the impact of seasonality on gws changes thomas et al 2017 the groundwater storage deviation gsd was derived by subtracting the monthly climatology from gws which denotes the net deviation of seasonal variation in the gws lastly gsd is standardized by eliminating the mean x gsd and the standard deviation s gsd 6 ggdi gsd t x gsd s gsd here ggdi is a standardized net variation in gws gsd t is the groundwater storage deviation for time t t 1 2 0 168 x gsd is the overall mean of gsd and s gsd is the overall standard deviation of gsd utilized to indicate the drought table 2 shows the categorization of ggdi 3 3 mann kendall trend test the mann kendall mann 1945 kendall 1975 test statistics are computed by applying the formula as shown s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i where xj and xi are the results of j and i j i in time series sgn xj xi is the symbol function the number of data points is shown by n and s g n x j x i 1 i f x j x i 0 0 i f x j x i 0 1 i f x j x i 0 if the size of sample n 10 the variance and mean are given by μ s 0 σ 2 s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 where ti number of ties of extent i and m number of tied groups a set of data encompassing the same values is called a tied group if tie values are absent between the observations then σ 2 s n n 1 2 n 5 18 the standard normal test statistic zs is computed as z s s 1 σ 2 s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 σ 2 s i f s 0 positive and negative values of zs represent the increasing and decreasing trends respectively the5 significance level was used in trend analysis and at this level the null hypothesis of no trend was rejected if zs 1 96 3 4 singular spectral analysis ssa this method focuses on empirical orthogonal function and the dynamic reconstruction of time series statistically ghil et al 2002 walwer et al 2016 the space structure strongly connected temporally has been decomposed and information of time series can be efficiently isolated with noise in addition the ssa may abstract oscillating or relevant sequence reconstruction components and detect the time series process and trend elements of change ssa is not over structured which is particularly well suited to analyzing changes in the nonlinear time series ssa was utilized in this analysis to represent variations in the time series of ggdi the complete process is given below depending on the size of the moving window m a sample time series of n is organized and the tracking matrix is determined x x 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 x m x m 1 x n m 1 x n m 2 x n where x the matrix track m movable window length a matrix xxt is established for singular value decomposition and decomposed the tracking matrix x x i j k 1 m a i k e j k where a i k is the principal component and e j k is the corresponding feature vector the sequence is reconstructed by selecting a collection of m length feature vectors m m x i k 1 m j 1 m a ij k e j k m i n m 1 1 i j 1 m a ij k e j k 1 i m 1 1 n t 1 j i n m m a ij k e j k n m 2 i n 3 5 wavelet coherence within the time frequency space wavelet coherence can be used to determine the relationship between the 2 time series data by estimating the correlation between them that varies between 0 and 1 in accordance with torrence and webster 1999 and grinsted et al 2004 the coefficient of wavelet coherence between the 2 sets of time series data can be denoted as follows r 2 s τ s s 1 w xy s τ 2 s s 1 w x s τ 2 s s 1 w y s τ 2 where r 2 s τ coherence coefficient minimum and maximum coherence at 0 and 1 and w xy s τ cross wavelet transforms between two series equation 6 resembles the coefficient of determination equation and thus the wavelet coherence varies between 0 and 1 liu 1994 smoothing operator s represented as given below chang et al 2019 s w s scale s time w s τ the smoothing along the wavelet axis is represented as s scale and s time in the present study the wavelet coherence was examined at a 5 significance level or the confidence interval 95 3 6 machine learning models extreme gradient boosting xgboost is an ensemble learning approach however based on the algorithm of the gradient boost tree gradient increase is a method through which new models anticipate the residues or mistakes of previous models and are added to form the final forecast chen and guestrin 2016 xgboost also needs to construct many decision trees but all the trees are dependent and each new tree is based on the newest residuals or errors of the prior tree the predicted value of each sample is the sum of the values of leaves in each tree similar to the random forest xgboost can deal with complex nonlinearity relationships and handle the multi collinearity effect with high accuracy and multi collinearity didn t matter in xgboost zhu and zhu 2019 chen et al 2020 we used the xgboost package in the r language 91 there were three main important parameters to develop the xgboost model which were 1 eta control the learning rate scale the contribution of each tree by a factor of 0 eta 1 when it is added to the current approximation used to prevent overfitting by making the boosting process more conservative the lower value for eta implies a larger value for nrounds a low eta value means the model is more robust to overfitting but slower to compute in this study we used eta was 0 05 2 nrounds max number of boosting iterations nrounds 540 and 3 gamma minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree the larger the more conservative the algorithm will be a value of 0 was used for gamma in the xgboost the random forest rf algorithm was implemented to predict the tws using chronology data as inputs the rf is an enhanced form of a decision tree method combining basic bagging principles with a random selection of features to offer extra variety to decision tree models breiman 2001 decision tree methods are robust modeling techniques that use a tree structure to create connections between the characteristics and results a decision tree is created on a whole dataset using all the characteristics of interest whereas the rf picks observations and particular characteristics at random to create many decision trees then averages the results to generate predictions each bootstrap sample from the training dataset which comprised the tws data and chronology data as input variables was grown in the construction of the rf models one third of the input variables were randomly picked up to increase the tree to minimize the correlation between the prediction errors in a pair of decision trees in the rf model the projected final value was derived by an average of all trees predictions there were two main parameters used in the rf model for the prediction of grace tws which were 1 ntree and the number of trees to grow ntree 540 this should not be set to too small a number to ensure that every input row gets predicted at least a few times and 2 mtry the number of variables randomly sampled as predictors at each split note that the mtry values are different for classification square root sqrt of number of predictors and regression number of predictors 3 in this study 9 predictors were used for the regression problem therefore we selected a number 3 for mtry the support vector machine svm model vapnik 1995 was first suggested as a method for classifying the machine learning approach which was later extended to regression techniques vapnik 1998 it has been used effectively in a variety of applications including soil moisture measurement ahmad et al 2010 and biophysical parameter estimation from remote sensing data mountrakis et al 2011 the specifics of the svm approach were published by jing et al jing et al 2016 svm can be used as a classification machine learning and regression machine learning this study used svm as regression machine learning therefore only one main parameter type eps regression was used in the svm model the empirical and non linear relations between the input variables and the output variable these interactions are quantitatively represented by a network of empirical equations fitted throughout the network learning process a neural network of two layer feed forward was employed there is one input layer two hidden layers and one output layer in the ann model each layer is composed of a set of neurons and is trained using a back propagation algorithm it is one of the most widely used algorithms for supervised training of multilayer neural networks zolfaghari and izadi 2019 gholami et al 2018 in our study we applied a trial and error technique to determine the optimal number of hyperparameters where the numbers were added gradually until the predicted and observed values start to match by evaluating the model performance using the root mean square error rmse the number of epochs is the number of times that the backpropagation algorithm works through the entire training dataset the range of hidden neurons 100 150 and 100 epochs were used in this study to minimize the value of the error comprehensive information about the neural network and training algorithm can be found here mohaghegi et al 2005 turban et al 2008 the evaluation metrics were used between machine learning models predicted and observed values using the training data to assess the accuracy of the developed machine learning models 3 7 model design in this study the xgboost model was selected among other models including rf svm and ann to improve the resolution of grace tws and gws to 0 25 from 1 to develop the xgboost model the basic idea was to develop a statistical relationship between the response variable and independent variables at coarse resolution 1 then applied the developed model to the fine resolution 0 25 independent variables to achieve predicted tws the process of the downscaling flow diagram is shown in fig 3 1 the independent variables are resampled to 1 by pixel averaging from january 2003 to december 2016 then developed the xgboost model between the response variable and independent variables at a low resolution of 1 to predict tws 2 computed the residuals at a resolution of 1 by subtracting the xgboost model predicted tws in step 1 from the grace derived tws data 3 the developed xgboost model is employed to the independent variables at the resolution of 0 25 to attain the estimated tws then the residual correction was carried out by adding back interpolated cubic convolution residuals 0 25 in the xgboost calculated tws 0 25 to obtain the downscaled tws data 4 the downscaled gws at the resolution of 0 25 was attained by isolating gldas derived water storage components sms cws and qs from downscaled tws the results of downscaled gws were compared with the in situ data to obtain the model accuracy 3 8 evaluation metrics the evaluation of different models was carried out using two metric indices to compare the predicted tws values with grace derived tws that include pearson correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse the r estimates how grace derived tws and models predicted tws values are correlated and rmse in mm measures how closely the amplitude of predicted tws matches the grace derived tws values the r and rmse are estimated as follows 7 r i 1 n y i y o i o i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n o i o 2 8 rmse i 1 n o i y i 2 n 9 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i o i 10 nse 1 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where y and o show predicted and grace derived tws values respectively n is the length of time series o and y are the mean values of o and y respectively 4 results and analysis 4 1 accuracy analysis of machine learning models the four machine learning models were trained and tested using input data the models were established to predict the tws using input independent variables a comparison between the predicted tws and grace derived tws is shown in fig 4 the x axis shows the tws derived from grace and the y axis shows the model s predicted tws from fig 4 the xgboost model has the highest r 0 99 nse 0 99 mae 2 75 mm and the lowest rmse 5 22 mm respectively followed by the random forest with an r 0 97 slightly lower than the xgboost model the results of svm and ann are much lower than the xgboost the xgboost is the best model that can comply with the variable prediction criteria 4 2 sensitivity analysis of the xgboost model the importance of the independent variables was further analyzed given by the regression model thereby evaluating the predictive ability of the independent variables in fig 5 we show the ranking of importance of independent variables given by the xgboost based model with the importance of independent variables given by the xgboost based model we can find three variables that predominantly influence the tws which are rainfall rf dem and sms undoubtedly precipitation plays an important role in replenishing the gws zhang et al 2020 and tws zhang et al 2019 as one of the important influencing factors dem determines the recharge and discharge areas of gws and is an important input component of the groundwater model brydsten 2006 li and wong 2010 mirosław swiatek et al 2017 the sms is another factor that influences the tws and has been widely used for the inversion of grace derived tws li et al 2018 zhen et al 2018 zhong et al 2018 4 3 performance analysis of the xgboost model 4 3 1 characteristics analysis of downscaled gws variation at spatio temporal scale fig 6 shows the grace derived and downscaled gws variation which is almost similar showing a sharped decreasing trend in the ibis the decreasing rate of gws derived from grace and downscaled gws is observed same 3 39 0 45 mm year the trend variations of gws are consistent r 0 99 before and after downscaling which shows that the xgboost model can be applied to downscale gws without losing significant information the comparison between the time series of grace derived and downscaled gws confirmed that the downscaled products maintained the accuracy of the original data irrigation largely depends on surface runoff for water qureshi et al 2009 though cropping intensities have strongly increased because the crop water requirement was not satisfied by the combination of rainfall and surface water withdrawals over the historical periods simons et al 2020 furthermore the evapotranspiration is increased in summer which amplifies the decrease in soil moisture and increases the water demand for crops consequently leads to drought by overexploitation of groundwater in the ibis average groundwater withdrawal consistently exceeds aquifer recharge and caused a significant depletion in groundwater storage during 2010 fig 6 iqbal et al 2016 also reported large depletion of groundwater during 2010 demonstrating that gws has been continuously declining after 2010 was recorded heavy rainfall of monsoon hit pakistan at the end of july 2010 fig 6 shows the rising trend in gws after august 2010 played a significant role in replenishment due to the massive flooding in august 2010 it can be observed from fig 6 that maximum groundwater depletion occurred in august 2010 144 78 m m m o n t h therefore we analyzed variations of downscaled tws and gws at a spatial scale for august 2010 fig 7 the spatial variations of downscaled tws and gws were observed in more detail the tws increased near the middle area in the ibis boundary due to a flood in august 2010 iqbal et al 2016 and reduced in the top left and east sides of the region although the gws declined all over the area particularly in the upper region of the ibis except near the middle in the ibis boundary and north west of the area the tws and gws spatial variation can be detected more effectively at high resolution after downscaling the downscaled gws efficiently also represents the variability of the sub grid heterogeneity which is the influence of geospatial and hydro climatic features at the local level on gws regarding the spatial distribution spatial images of grace based downscaled gws showed similar spatial patterns as grace based gws throughout the study area furthermore spatial climatology maps of variations in downscaled gws were generated from january 2003 to december 2016 on monthly basis to further observe spatial variability fig s1 the monthly climatology of downscaled gws reflects fluctuations in the abstraction of groundwater and recharges influenced by climatic changes and anthropogenic activities the changes in the gws are observed significantly from january to december from 2003 to 2016 in ibis spatial patterns of downscaled gws climatology have shown that the upper and intermediate regions of ibis have been severely depleted by groundwater depletion while groundwater depletion in the lower ibis regions varies from mild to severe in a further study of this region models with high resolution might be supplemented to aid in understanding the decline or increase of gws in specific locations the water management policymakers can regulate the abstraction of groundwater for the long term and some measures have been taken bhatti 2020 though rapid population growth and increased water demand coupled with the expansion of irrigated agriculture put more pressure on the sustainability of the gws when surface water withdrawal does not meet increasing demand leads to overexploitation of groundwater moreover the simulations derived from the global change analysis model gcam show that the demand for agricultural industrial and domestic water is projected to increase in this region calvin et al 2019 in general the ibis has significant problems in managing water resources particularly groundwater resources being a key agricultural producing and dwelling region of the indus basin we used downscaled tws and gws and sms from the gldas noah model to further explore the characteristics of the variations in each component as shown in fig s2 the regional gws display an obvious change trend consistent with the results reported by iqbal et al 2017 ali et al 2021 ali et al 2022 they showed that gws was the main component contributing to the regional change in tws sms is the key component of tws which is a necessary condition for the survival and growth of regional plants drought occurs when sms is unable to meet the needs of plant growth from 2009 to 2010 the ibis continued to experience a drought iqbal et al 2017 ali et al 2021 ali et al 2022 and the drought was the most severe in 2010 hydrologic condition analysis results in an understanding of the interrelationships between precipitation surface and groundwater storage and other water storage fluxes variables that influence water storage therefore the determination of hydrologic conditions focuses on the analysis of the variables that most directly influence water storage in a specific region as shown in fig s2 the extent to which the sms decreased during the period was large consequently we inferred that the drought during this period was mainly caused by insufficient soil moisture notably in the ibis drought in 2010 the reduction in tws was large while the sms did not fluctuate substantially this difference may have been caused by the lag effects of rainfall and et on sms according to zhang et al 2015a an increase in the surface temperature enhanced the regional et so the drought was strengthened during the period the persistent negative anomaly in tws after 2010 was the result of joint actions of natural and anthropogenic factors zhu et al 2021 fig s3 represents the time series variations in surface water storage compartments including precipitation sms qs and cws results indicated that sms is consistent with the precipitation pattern showing an upward and downward trend in addition the sms trend might be associated with increasing groundwater pumping and may be a contributing factor to the increase the soil moisture storage in irrigated areas of ibis however the condition was partly different in the rainy season a peaked pattern in sms was observed in august implying the dominance of monsoon precipitation though cws is fluctuating around the seasonal peaks without any significant changes overall contributions of sms and precipitation were higher in the study region zhu et al 2021 followed by qs while cws was found to be negligible therefore major deviation in tws variations might be associated with sms iqbal et al 2017 ali et al 2021 ali et al 2022 and precipitation changes zhu et al 2021 4 3 2 validation of downscaled groundwater storage at spatio temporal scale the non uniform distribution of specific yield in aquifer layers complicates the computation of groundwater storage the selected 398 observational wells gws data was used to validate the downscaled gws to evaluate the performance of downscaling model spatially and temporally the temporal variation in gws was illustrated by overlaying the observational wells on the downscaled gws the pixels having observation wells were only selected for validation analysis fig 2 the overall trend from 2003 to 2016 of the selected pixels of downscaled 3 36 mm year and observational wells 3 22 mm year gws show a decreasing trend temporally it is shown in fig 8 that the seasonal patterns in observational wells and the downscaled gws are compared for six differentpixels in the ibis between january 2003 and december 2014 the gws both as observed and downscaled showed a changing downward trend deterioration of groundwater storagein theibis is evidence of drought and groundwater extractions recent studies iqbal et al 2016 iqbal et al 2017 ali et al 2021 ali et al 2022 have shown that the ibis has undergone groundwater depletion and this downward trend is consistent with those studies furthermore the gws downscaling was in good correlation with the station data as can be shown from pearson correlations the xgboost downscaled gws exhibits a positive correlation with the monitoring wellsranging from 0 02 to 0 84 iqbal et al 2016 iqbal et al 2017 ali et al 2021 ali et al 2022 it proves a statistically substantial association between downscaled and observational wells gws observational data are only available twice a year june and october rather than 30 days mean monthly data which explains the fluctuation in amplitude in both time series grace on the other hand provides an average for each month therefore there is some ambiguity in the consistency of observational and grace data that s why grace data peaks are not perfectly aligned with observational data peaks ali et al 2021 ali et al 2022 akhtar et al 2022 5 ggdi identified drought characteristics 5 1 temporal evaluation of drought the ggdi has a declining pattern with various change characteristics suggesting that the drought recognized by the ggdi in the ibis exhibits an increasing tendency from 2003 to 2016 fig 9 depicts the ibis s drought temporal evolution features from 2003 to 2016 droughts are becoming increasingly common in recent years as seen in fig 9 the most severe drought occurred between january 2010 and february 2011 which corresponded to the effects of large groundwater depletion during 2010 reported by iqbal et al 2016 the average value of ggdi was observed 0 60 during the drought event january 2010 and february 2011 over the entire ibis a severe drought was observed by ggdi 1 81 in august 2010 the standardized drought indices used are spei sc pdsi and the grace derived index is ggdi these standardized indices are selected based on robustness to detect drought conditions in arid dominated regions such as the ibis the drought severity status was evaluated using scales table 2 that were reported in previous studies spei vicente serrano et al 2010 sc pdsi wu et al 2021 and ggdi wang et al 2020 ssa was also used to simulate ggdi time series variability features the deviations from the ssa and ggdi trends were quite consistent fig 9 with the pearson correlation coefficient r 0 94 below the significant p 0 01 threshold the time series from the ssa also shows that the ggdi trend was declining this also shows that between 2003 and 2016 the drought increased in the ibis 5 2 comparison with meteorological drought hydrological droughts spread through the soils soil moisture deficiency geographically and temporally diverse meteorological signals rainfall deficit and decreasing recharge leading to lower groundwater levels peters et al 2003 the spatial and temporal characteristics of the drought signal change over the water cycle resulting in groundwater drought lagging and attenuating against meteorological droughts van loon 2015 some variables affecting these fluctuations in drought signal are connected to watershed and aquifers which can impact the ultimate temporal and spatial appearance including the kind of soil covered thickness the hydraulic properties of the soil and the unsaturated areas that recharged tallaksen et al 2009 bloomfield et al 2015 the spei which is one of the meteorological drought indices with several accumulation periods 1 3 and 6 months and the sc pdsi one of the hydrological drought indices were used to validate ggdi this study has selected spei based on penman monteith fao 56 which has a potential evapotranspiration data of 0 5 0 5 for worldwide regions vicente serrano et al 2010 sc pdsi also has a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 globally osborn et al 2017 and the trmm precipitation anomalies to compare with the dimensionless ggdi fig s4 illustrates the ggdi spei and sc pdsi time series along with the trmm anomaly the results show that the trends of drought situations were almost similar temporally i e decreasing from 2010 01 to 2011 02 highlighted with a pink box in fig s4 the spei became smoother as evapotranspiration and precipitation durations increased the trmm anomaly also observed the deficit in rainfall earlier and during the drought period smoother variations in sc pdsi and a longer period of drought compared with spei and ggdi were observed 5 3 spatial distribution of drought the most severe drought was observed between 2010 01 and 2011 02 the spatial distribution of drought was monitored during this drought event indicating the beginning and end of the drought in fig 10 the average values of ggdi over the study area from 2010 01 to 2011 02 on a monthly scale were 0 22 0 19 0 56 0 70 0 64 1 09 0 54 1 81 1 21 0 73 0 76 0 22 0 14 and 0 05 respectively the greatest drought appears to have occurred in august 2010 with nearly the whole ibis being seriously affected and ggdi was 1 81 in february 2011 the drought relief was significant with a ggdi score maximum of 0 05 the study area should thus focus on suitable drought resilient strategies to decrease the influence of a drought disaster and increase the capacity for drought resistance 5 4 drought trend features on the grid level as shown in fig s5 the ibis exhibited monthly significant positive and negative trends from january to december at different significant levels 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 percentiles the highest significant negative downward trends were observed during all months from the middle to the upper region of ibis whereas the bottom region showed a downward and upward trend from january to december with no significance in the ibis from june to december significant downward trends at significant levels of 0 1 0 05 and no significant trends were observed in the upper region of the ibis the highest significant negative downward trends were seen from january to may 5 5 the correlation between ggdi and climate factors previous studies have shown that droughts were closely related to climate variables vissa et al 2019 liu et al 2020 in the present study sst nino3 4 soi mei and pdo were chosen to describe the influences of teleconnections over ggdi moreover wavelet coherence was employed to evaluate the link between teleconnection factors and ggdi over the ibis from 2003 to 2016 fig 11 illustrates the wavelet coherence between monthly ggdi and teleconnection factors the thin solid line is the cone of influence fig 11 and has effective spectral areas to prevent wavelet transform boundaries and high frequency erroneous information a strong black contour shows the 5 percent significance level the coherence at interannual variability was observed continuously between 2009 and 2016 on time scales of 32 40 months and intermittency was observed between 4 and 20 months at different years for nino for soi intermittency was reduced between 4 and 20 months at different years and interannual variability was observed between 2010 and 2016 periods on time scales varying from 32 to 40 months continuously in the case of mei coherence at interannual variability was reduced and observed between 2003 and 2005 and 2011 and 2016 periods on time scales varying from 8 to 10 and 32 to 38 months and intermittency increased between 4 and 20 months in different years compared to other teleconnections at different scales during different years the effect of pdo was weak the only intermittency was observed between 10 and 20 months at different years it has been observed that wavelet coherence may be used to identify the connections between ggdi and teleconnection variables in addition teleconnection variables have substantial effects on ggdi and the effect of nino3 4 is larger on ggdi than soi mei and pdo 6 discussion 6 1 influence factors of drought it is extremely important that in the context of intense climate change and human activity the effects of drought should be properly analyzed to develop acceptable strategies to ensure food security and preserve social stability liu et al 2018 concerning teleconnection variables individuals progressively understood that they play an important part in the formation of droughts dai 2011 furthermore the findings of wavelet coherence as observed in section 5 5 indicate that the teleconnection variables nino3 4 soi mei have intensive effects on drought moreover enso occurrences can significantly reduce walker circulation leading to reduce precipitation and frequent droughts tobias et al 2014 a single indicator that shows all the climate variability characteristics in large regions is probably not possible zhu et al 2017 the impact of anthropogenic influences on drought cannot be disregarded in addition to natural causes water resources with uneven geographical and temporal distributions in the ibis are scarce cheema et al 2014 during the crop season people use more groundwater for irrigation than normal leading to a clear conflict of water resources between supply and demand and eventually triggering the crisis of drought cheema et al 2014 iqbal et al 2017 the scarcity of groundwater supplies not only limits the sustainable development of the society and economy but also increases the frequency of drought devastations during the everyday lives of the people the continual rise in the population increases water consumption leading to over abstraction of water and augment of drought the worst drought during 2010 01 2011 02 fig 9 might be due to large groundwater depletion in 2010 as reported by iqbal et al 2016 this drought prompted the public to abstract more groundwater to reimburse for the scarcity of surface water in fig s4 the trmm anomaly was also observed deficit in rainfall during drought followed by other drought indices as well except for heavy rainfall in july and august because of the lag time between precipitation water infiltrate to recharge groundwater the groundwater continues to decline causing the groundwater drought up to august 2010 hence directed to the depletion of groundwater in general the major driver of drought is climate induced drought human activities are also a factor in the development of groundwater droughts in the ibis therefore the water management system should be strengthened in several ways and need to develop water saving irrigation techniques groundwater replenishment and carefully control groundwater abstraction fang et al 2010 as the rainfall is unevenly distributed in space and time surface and groundwater resources are scarce in the ibis cheema et al 2014 farmers excessively use electricity and fossil fuels to pump groundwater to compensate for the lack of rainfall excessive withdrawal of groundwater to save crops in drought conditions has drained groundwater in most parts of the world therefore ultimately triggering a drought crisis 6 2 uncertainty analysis in the present research many areas of uncertainty were encountered firstly to reduce the uncertainty among grace data we considered averaged solution of three gridded grace spherical harmonic coefficients datasets instead of a single product seyoum and milewski 2017 still the spherical harmonic coefficient solutions developed by various organizations have ambiguities due to diverse background models as well as data processing approaches in addition the spherical harmonic coefficient solutions considered different hydrological models to adjust the scale factor which eventually contributes to the presence of uncertainty second to minimize the gldas uncertainty the ensemble mean of gldas models vic noah mosaic and clm was suggested cao et al 2015 third to reduce the uncertainty among machine learning models predicted tws at fine resolution the ensemble based approach of machine learning models may be more appropriate sun et al 2021 however similar to xgboost based downscaled gws the only noah model has the same spatial resolution 0 25 thus we adopted the gldas 2 1 noah model outputs in the present study to reduce the uncertainty related to spatial resolution in evaluating water storage estimations finally using linear interpolation techniques the missing grace data were filled out this may have triggered some uncertainties however since the approach is prevalent easy and extensively used in the handling of missing data we followed similar techniques in filling the grace dataset gaps kumar et al 2020 sun et al 2018 6 3 advantages and limitations grace satellite plays a crucial part in identifying drought in places with limited water storage data yirdaw et al 2008 to reduce the influence of various errors in the gridded grace spherical harmonic coefficients data one can apply various filtering processes yet results suggest the possibility of weak signals in the derived product therefore scale factors are applied to restore signal leakage induced by the filtering process landerer and swenson 2012 in regions where hydro meteorological data are minimal grace data are an important means of estimating and managing the drought in this analysis the ggdi drought index was assessed to detect droughts the ggdi is a standardized index that compares spatio temporal drought objectively providing strong evidence for evaluating surplus and deficit groundwater availability thomas et al 2017 this study positively established the drought events between 2010 01 and 2011 02 which were considered to be because of groundwater depletion iqbal et al 2016 moreover the interaction of ggdi with teleconnection factors showed the fact that teleconnections had a substantial effect on ggdi across the ibis using the grace dataset can efficiently and expediently identify drought characteristics but there is still a certain limitation in this study the longer record of grace data is needed but the record extends more than a few years of data the results will therefore be more accurate thomas et al 2014 the grace is an essential technology for improving the accuracy and gravity monitoring of terrestrial hydrology in gravity satellite sensors with the accuracy of tens of millimeters of equal thickness grace offers realistic spatiotemporal changes in vertically integrated water storage components the new grace follow on grace fo satellite datasets will provide a valuable solution for the long term evaluation of tws variations and their associated studies resulting in significant improvements in our knowledge of grace related studies the coarse residuals of tws were resampled using cubic convolution interpolation and the inter pixel changes should be further considered due to the lack of accurate data on lakes rivers and reservoirs for all of ibis we ignored the contributions of water from these sources moreover the effect of anthropogenic activities groundwater extraction regional water division mining over mass changes in the earth s surface cannot be overlooked tang et al 2013 these effects influence of human activities are generally ignored due to the lack of observed datasets as well as difficulties in the collection and measurement of relevant information therefore analyzing the influence of anthropogenic activities on variations in water storage may provide a fresh insight into the future of science nevertheless our produced downscaled gws data can provide certain guidelines for detailed investigations of the regional gws and can help improve future hydrological research thereby enhancing the capability for sustainable water resources management 7 conclusions in this study the xgboost based downscaled gws was selected among other machine learning models to examine and evaluate drought characteristics from 2003 to 2016 the downscaled gws was compared with observed gws data on the seasonal scales showing correlation ranging from 0 02 to 0 84 the spatial downscaled gws helps in identifying precisely those regions that have the sparse density of groundwater level data the temporal evaluation trend characteristics and spatial distribution of drought were investigated utilizing ggdi from 2003 to 2016 over the ibis the wavelet coherence technique was used to evaluate the relationship between ggdi and teleconnection factors the downscaled gws dataset provides significant advantages in identifying droughts and revealing information about large scale groundwater depletion where hydrometeorological data are limited and data related to water storage variations are inadequate in this study the downscaled gws variations have provided reliable and robust quantitative results that provide a new method to explore droughts and the approach can be applied to any other region the key findings from this research are as follows i the distinct variations of tws were observed in the ibis on monthly basis the significant upward and downward trends of tws were observed on monthly basis with most of the negative trends detected between 2010 01 and 2011 02 representing severe droughts ii the drought events based on ggdi showed different temporal change characteristics in the ibis the most severe drought event was detected in the ibis between 2010 01 and 2011 02 the drought based on ggdi exhibited a downward trend from 2003 to 2016 with different temporal variation characteristics in the ibis the worst drought was observed in august 2010 with a value of ggdi 1 81 on a monthly scale iii the mk test was used to evaluate drought trends on a monthly scale the highest significant negative trends were observed from january to december from the middle to upper region of the ibis iv finally the influence of teleconnection factors on ggdi was effectively demonstrated using the wavelet coherence method nino3 4 had a significantly high influence on ggdi followed by soi and mei in the ibis 8 data availability statement the observed groundwater level data were obtained from the punjab irrigation and drainage

3023,the application of hydraulic fracturing has transformed tight sandstone gas into a very important global unconventional resource the accurate description of geochemical processes during hydraulic fracturing can provide essential information for improving tight gas production in this study field fracturing and laboratory water rock interaction experiments were designed and performed in conjunction with geochemistry isotope xrf xrd and sem techniques to reveal the prevalent geochemical processes sixty five flowback fluid samples were collected from a hydraulic fracturing well and a tight sandstone sample was drilled from gas reservoir to perform water rock interaction experiments the results indicate that hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid is a complex mixture with high tds values 0 93 33 04 g l and heavy isotopes e g mean δ18o of 5 35 mean 87sr 86sr of 0 714651 geochemistry and isotope data reveal that the mixing process between fracturing fluid and formation water exerts an important influence on the flowback fluid chemistry while water rock and fluid fluid interactions are also variably important during the hydraulic fracturing process pyrite oxidation process is confirmed during hydraulic fracturing in the tight sandstone reservoir while the addition of gel breaker makes the process prominent due to high clay mineral contents 24 ion exchange and adsorption desorption are critical factors affecting the stability of the clay minerals during the entire fracturing and flowback processes approximately 20 43 of the strontium was removed from the solution by ion exchange between the 8 and 44 h intervals of the flowback process the fractures derived from fracturing connect different types of high salinity formation water leading to potential mineral precipitation e g barite and calcite the analysis of formation water needs to be taken into consideration during hydraulic fracturing operations keywords fracturing flowback fluid water rock interactions geochemistry isotopes sulige gas field data availability data will be made available on reasonable request 1 introduction tight sandstone gas is an important unconventional hydrocarbon resource that is found in tight sandstone reservoirs with a continuous decrease in conventional oil and gas reserves tight sandstone gas is gradually becoming a more and more important alternative resource worldwide vedachalam et al 2015 zou et al 2018 qi et al 2021 tight sandstone gas deposits have been discovered in more than 70 basins around the world with proven reserves equal to approximately 2 1 1014 m3 mainly distributed in south america north america and asia holditch 2006 qiao et al 2019 currently tight sandstone gas is still the protagonist of unconventional natural gas resources zou et al 2018 herz thyhsen et al 2020 su et al 2021 however by considering the extremely low permeability overburden matrix permeability 0 1 10 3 μm2 of rocks in tight sandstone reservoirs hydraulic fracturing and horizontal wells technologies are the dominant methods for the development of the unconventional natural gas industry holditch 2006 herz thyhsen et al 2019 sun et al 2019 during hydraulic fracturing large volumes of fracturing fluid are injected with high pressure into the horizontal section of the well to create complex fracture network in the reservoir and increase the flowing ability of natural gas mcintosh et al 2019 however water rock interactions could occur between the injected fracturing fluid and the rock in the gas reservoir influencing the effect of hydraulic fracturing positive water rock interactions can stimulate reservoir fracture propagation while negative water rock interactions would lead to reservoir damage and reduce oil and gas production osselin et al 2019 huang et al 2020 qi et al 2021 hence understanding the potential geochemical processes and water rock interactions between the fracturing fluid the rock and the fluids of the gas reservoir is critical understanding the behavior and composition of the fracturing flowback water can provide insights into the in situ water rock interactions facilitating assessing the success of the fracturing operations and improving the fracturing technology jacobs 2015 huang et al 2020 owen et al 2020 fu et al 2021 the chemical and isotopic compositions of flowback water are well studied and water rock interaction types and geochemical processes were revealed in shale reservoirs e g bagheri et al 2014 osselin et al 2019 cui et al 2020 phan et al 2020 welch et al 2021 osselin et al 2019 studied the geochemical and sulfate isotopic evolution of flowback and produced waters of montney formation shale canada they found that flowback fluid chemistries were determined by mixing process between formation brine and the fracturing fluids cui et al 2020 proposed that water rock interactions e g feldspar and carbonates dissolution dominated some chemical and isotopic compositions such as boron strontium and their isotopes of flowback fluids in shale gas reservoir zhong et al 2019 found that microbial activity in flowback water might negatively influence shale gas extraction and the recycling of flowback water would enhance the enrichment and growth of halanaerobium however correlational research related to tight sandstone reservoir is scarce birkle and makechnie 2022 assessed the fracture functionality and fracturing efficiency in tight sandstone based on geochemical analysis of flowback fluid due to different reservoir environments and hydraulic fracturing technologies e g different minerals and fracturing fluids geochemical processes are distinguished between shale and tight sandstone reservoirs in addition to the analysis of flowback fluid water rock interaction experiments performed in the laboratory are also an important method to study the geochemical processes during the hydraulic fracturing process paukert vankeuren et al 2017 hakala et al 2021 although laboratory data might not match field data obtained from fractured wells laboratory experiments can simulate various fracturing conditions and analyze the compositional changes of liquid and solid phases which is difficult to achieve in the field zolfaghari et al 2016 phan et al 2018 huang et al 2020 therefore laboratory experiments were performed to study reservoir damage and water rock interactions between the fracturing fluid and the reservoir rock jew et al 2017 herz thyhsen et al 2020 ferguson et al 2021 hakala et al 2021 qi et al 2021 pyrite oxidation ion exchange and mineral precipitation were well revealed and depicted by laboratory experiments in shale reservoir jew et al 2017 paukert vankeuren et al 2017 huang et al 2022 for tight sandstone reservoir herz thyhsen et al 2020 conducted water rock interaction experiments between tight sandstone and fracturing fluid and found that calcite dissolution increased porosity of the sandstone sample from 5 to 5 8 hari et al 2021 analyzed the damage factors associated with the process of proppant crushing and embedment during hydraulic fracturing by reviewing the different experimental studies on the tight sandstone formations however neither single flowback fluid studies nor laboratory experiments can reveal in detail the geochemical processes of hydraulic fracturing field fracturing combined with laboratory water rock interaction experiments is a necessary method to study the geochemical processes during hydraulic fracturing in this paper the hydraulic fracturing experiment was conducted in the field and the flowback fluid was intensively sampled 2 hour intervals meanwhile the laboratory water rock interaction experiments were also designed and carried out using guar fracturing fluid and drilled rock core this study aimed to reveal the composition sources of the fracturing flowback fluid the geochemical processes and the water rock interactions during hydraulic fracturing using geochemistry isotope xrf xrd sem and eds techniques in a tight sandstone reservoir this is the first systematic study to characterize the geochemical mechanisms of the hydraulic fracturing process in tight sandstone gas it can provide detailed insight into in situ water rock interactions and geochemical processes during hydraulic fracturing this knowledge will assist the operators with critical information in fracturing fluid optimization and fracturing process improvement to maximize hydrocarbon production from low permeability reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and geological settings the ordos basin is the second largest sedimentary basin in china fig 1 a with abundant resources of petroleum natural gas coalbed methane and coal fan et al 2019 the sulige gas field located in the northwestern part of the ordos basin is a typical tight sandstone gas reservoir with low permeability low pressure and low abundance it is currently the largest natural gas field discovered in china with proven reserves equal to approximately 2 0 1012 m3 zou et al 2018 abundant tight sandstone gas has been found in the upper paleozoic succession of the sulige gas field shuai et al 2013 in which the tight sandstone reservoirs are primarily composed of the lower permian shanxi formation and the middle permian shihezi formation fig 1b according to the lithostratigraphic chart the shanxi formation can be divided into two units p1s2 and p1s1 there are some coal layers in the p1s2 member with intercalations of medium to fine grained sandstones gray and grayish brown mixed with black mudstones the thickness is approximately 30 40 m the lithology of the p1s1 member consists of an alternation between sandstones and mudstones deposited in distributary channel conditions the sandstones are represented by medium to fine lithic sandstones and lithic quartz sandstones with a thickness of 30 m zou et al 2018 fan et al 2019 the shihezi formation is divided into the upper shihezi formation and the lower shihezi formation the lower shihezi formation consists of light gray pebbly coarse sandstones gray white medium to coarse grained sandstones and gray green lithic quartz sandstones large cross bedding sedimentary structures are developed in the sandstones while mudstones and coal seams are rare it can be further divided into four gas units from bottom to top p2h8 p2h7 p2h6 and p2h5 the thickness of the lower shihezi formation is generally between 120 and 160 m the upper shihezi formation is also divided into four gas units from bottom to top p2h4 p2h3 p2h2 and p2h1 with an alternation between red mudstones and sandy mudstones fig 1b the thickness ranges from 140 to 160 m fan et al 2019 hui et al 2020 wu et al 2022 the p2h8 unit is the primary gas producing reservoir the porosity of the p2h8 unit is in the range of 4 4 14 3 mean 10 1 and the permeability ranges from 0 1 to 3 0 10 3 μm2 mean 1 0 10 3 μm2 which is a typical low permeability gas reservoir wei et al 2017 2 2 field hydraulic fracturing experiments the su1 well was spudded on 4 september 2020 in the middle of the sulige gas field and entered the target reservoir p2h8 at a depth of 3455 m finally the drilling was completed on 25 september with a horizontal section of 700 m fig 1c the logging curve gamma ray indicated that the tight sandstone section was 700 m long with a drilling rate of 100 0 while the gas bearing sandstone was 599 m long with an effective reservoir drilling rate of 85 6 the su1 well belongs to the upper paleozoic reservoir block with a total hydrocarbon content of 98 1 including 93 6 methane and 3 52 ethane co2 accounts for 1 05 and h2s ranges from 0 8 to 10 69 mg m3 with a mean value of 7 01 mg m3 the su1 horizontal gas well was fractured in six sections on 8 march 2021 fig 1c a total volume of 2501 m3 fracturing fluid was injected into the well the first flowback fluid sample was collected at 18 00 on 10 march 2021 and afterwards the flowback fluid was sampled every 2 h during the first day thereafter the sampling interval gradually increased with the flowback time overall sixty five flowback fluid samples were collected over 33 days from the gas well the fracturing fluid used in this study is guar fracturing fluid one of the most used fracturing fluids in low permeability reservoirs composed of make up freshwater 98 37 hydroxypropyl guar and various additives 1 63 the make up freshwater for the fracturing fluid was sampled from the shallow groundwater well located near the gas well for this

3 water rock interaction experiments laboratory experiments can reveal some water rock interactions e g carbonate dissolution precipitation of specific minerals which could be overwhelmed by the mixing between the fracturing fluid and the hypersaline formation water therefore the water rock interaction experiments were designed in the laboratory to facilitate the study of hydraulic fracturing in the field a rock core sample was collected from an adjacent well drilled near the su1 horizontal gas well 38 km as no cores were collected from the fractured well the gas layer p2h8 and the sampled core interval are parallel to the su1 fractured section rock samples used in the experiment consisted of 75 chips d 3 5 mm and 25 powder d 0 075 mm to make full use of the core samples and comply with the testing requirements zolfaghari et al 2016 herz thyhsen et al 2019 huang et al 2020 the fracturing fluid was compounded by using deionized water and additives with similar proportions as in the field fracturing fluid carrying fluid consequently rock samples 15 g were added into deionized water and fracturing fluid 60 ml respectively with a water rock ratio of 4 1 after the reaction 1 3 6 10

fluid carrying fluid and displacing liquid it is difficult to obtain the theoretical composition of fracturing fluid at the rig site however it is mainly composed of freshwater 98 37 make up freshwater can partially characterize the hydrogeochemistry of the fracturing fluid make up freshwater originates from the local shallow groundwater which is defined by low ion concentrations the anions are dominated by hco3 207 mg l with low cl 18 0 mg l and so4 2 24 0 mg l while the cations are mainly composed of ca2 and mg2 therefore the make up freshwater is characterized by the hco3 ca mg type with a low tds value 240 mg l and a slightly alkaline nature ph 7 76 low divalent cations such as ca2 36 1 mg l and mg2 15 8 mg l make it suitable to prepare guar fracturing fluid δ2h and δ18o values are equal to 62 95 and 7 87 respectively suggesting the characteristics of stable isotopes in the local groundwater fig 2 a yin et al 2011 however high ba2 al and 87sr 86sr values are detected in make up freshwater 9 75 mg l 3 08 mg l and 0 712055 respectively table 1 and are significantly higher than the values in unpolluted groundwater fig 2b rao et al 2015 inferring that the water could be contaminated 3 1 2 chemical and isotopic composition of the flowback fluid the fracturing flowback fluid has a high salinity with high mean concentrations of tds 14 181 mg l na 3405 mg l k 632 mg l ca2 1225 mg l sr2 78 0 mg l ba2 94 3 mg l cl 8184 mg l and br 93 7 mg l indicating an increasing trend with the flowback time fig 3 a at the same time mg2 so4 2 and hco3 are relatively scarce with mean values equal to 75 6 176 and 1087 mg l respectively therefore the flowback fluid falls into the cl na type category the ph ranges from 2 17 to 7 98 with a mean value of 6 26 median 6 14 suggesting a faintly acidic environment fe al and mn show wide fluctuations and an inconspicuous dynamic trend during the whole flowback process varying from 1 48 to 79 33 mg l 0 36 to 14 0 mg l and 0 05 to 6 18 mg l respectively nh4 and no3 fluctuate wildly during the early stages of the flowback process which is explained by the addition of gel breaker ammonium persulfate nh4 2s2o8 boron b an important ion in the guar fracturing fluid decreases from 66 5 to 13 9 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod is usually high in the flowback fluid after using the guar fracturing fluid silva et al 2017 in this study cod is high up to 2880 mg l during the early stages and shows a decreasing trend with flowback time table s1 the δ2h and δ18o values increase from 62 09 to 21 16 mean 37 53 and from 9 33 to 3 42 mean 5 35 respectively most samples plot below the global meteoric water line fig 2a 87sr 86sr ratios range between 0 713226 and 0 715002 with a mean of 0 714651 the values of the previously mentioned three isotopes are higher than the values obtained from local groundwater and atmospheric precipitation fig 2 yin et al 2011 rao et al 2015 they are potential indicators to trace shallow groundwater contamination caused by hydraulic fracturing in the study area especially the 87sr 86sr with higher sensitivity the concentrations for most ions cl k na ca2 sr2 ba2 and br increase rapidly with the increase of the flowback time and reach a maximum value around the 68 h mark then fluctuate and decrease between the 70 and 550 h interval and finally tend to stabilize around the 550 h mark where the gas well begins to produce gas into a gathering station fig 3a 3 2 laboratory water rock interactions the lithology of the rock used in the experiment is grayish white medium coarse grained quartzitic sandstones with a salty taste fig 4 a the results of the xrd analysis indicate that the mineralogical composition is dominated by quartz 74 6 kaolinite chlorite 19 8 and illite 4 2 with minor amounts of hematite 1 and calcite 0 4 as well as showing high k 15949 mg kg and low ca 3261 mg kg contents based on the xrf results fig 4b and c the sem images and the eds results suggest that large kaolinite stacked pseudo hexagonal platy crystals and chlorite crystals fill the quartz grains a few pyrite crystals were identified in the sandstone cracks fig 4d quartz and hematite are usually stable whereas clay minerals and calcite could interact with the fracturing fluid during hydraulic fracturing zheng et al 2021 he et al 2022 hence the water rock interaction experiments are proposed in two different environments fracturing fluid ff and deionized water dw to reveal the water rock interactions as well as the contributing factors by applying hydrochemistry xrf xrd sem and eds techniques the experiment results indicate that calcite dissolution occurred in the dw environment ca2 and hco3 concentrations showed an increasing trend the concentration of ca2 increased from 0 to 53 45 mg l on the first day then slowly increased from 53 45 to 59 46 mg l 1st to 5th day and maintained a stable state with the completion of the water rock interactions fig 5 a in the ff environment alkaline conditions inhibit the dissolution of the calcite in the rock leading to a lower ca2 concentration in comparison with the dw environment this is also supported by the fact that ca composition of the rock is higher in the ff environment after the experiment it is worth mentioning that a minor amount of calcite 0 5 0 6 is found on the 5th and 20th days and the ca contents of the rock also increased in the ff environment the experiment phenomena indicate that the new calcite precipitated during the terminal stages of the experiment potassium k is the representative element in illite steudel et al 2009 the k contents in the rock sample decreased both in the ff and the dw environments after the water rock experiments while the decrement in the ff environment was smaller than in the dw environment indicating more illite drainage from the rock in the dw environment the xrd results also support this observation fig 5b suggesting that illite contents increased slightly in the ff environment and decreased significantly in the dw environment sem images and eds are important methods used to reveal the changes in the mineral morphology in the rock before and after the water rock experiments especially in the case of clay minerals zolfaghari et al 2016 herz thyhsen et al 2020 in the obtained sem images undisturbed kaolinite appears as stacked pseudo hexagonal sheet crystals and booklet aggregates fig 2d sem results indicate that kaolinite had been corroded and some kaolinite crystals have migrated after completing the water rock experiment in the ff environment fig 6 a and b while chlorite crystal morphology remained unaffected fig 6c in comparison with the ff environment kaolinite was unaltered while chlorite appeared to be damaged in the dw environment fig 6d and e swelling of some illite crystals occurred and distal crystals dispersed in the dw environment fig 6f this also confirms the xrd results which indicate a decrease in illite in the dw environment 4 discussion 4 1 composition sources of the flowback fluid the chemical and isotopic compositions of the fracturing fluid are similar to freshwater with low ionic concentration while the flowback fluid shows the characteristics of seawater with high tds values therefore the sources that generated such a composition of the flowback fluid are worth investigating in natural water cl primarily originates from the dissolution of halite and is widely considered a conservative tracer osselin et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 halite minerals were not identified in the reservoir rocks although the maximum concentration of cl can reach 19 g l in the flowback fluid table 1 suggesting that cl in the flowback fluid does not originate only from the dissolution of halite in the tight sandstone like cl br is also conservative and is mainly found in geothermal water seawater and brine as the result of evaporation and concentration at the same time it has low concentrations in freshwater cui et al 2020 flowback fluid with high concentrations of br is characterized by formation brine the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of condensate water are lighter but are usually heavier in the formation brine rowan et al 2015 whyte et al 2021 in this study δ2h and δ18o samples tend to become heavier with the increase of the flowback time 87sr 86sr ratios of the flowback fluid are also significantly higher in comparison with make up freshwater local groundwater and atmospheric precipitation indicating the characteristics of formation water fig 2 the chemical and isotopic results indicate that the composition of the flowback fluid derives from the mixing between fracturing fluid and formation water the mixing mechanism is also supported by strong positive correlations between cl na ca2 sr2 and ba2 with determination coefficients r2 higher than 0 95 and a negative correlation r2 in the range of 0 63 0 79 with cod fig 7 in addition the laboratory experiment results show that major and trace elements of tight sandstones were leached both into the dw and the ff environments hence the dissolution of minerals is also a source of the flowback fluid composition tables s2 and s3 4 2 geochemical processes during hydraulic fracturing the hydraulic fracturing processes leave large volumes of fracturing fluids with complex chemical compositions in the tight sandstone reservoir for weeks or even months this provides an opportunity for the fracturing fluid to react with reservoir rock the evolution of the different ions and elements in the flowback fluid samples can reveal geochemical processes and mechanisms in the horizontal well during hydraulic fracturing while laboratory experiments can explain some details of water rock interactions the ionic concentrations in the first sample are similar to the concentrations in make up freshwater suggesting that it is a displacement fluid mainly composed of make up freshwater after two hours the concentration of ions indicates an increasing trend the fourth sample is different from the others and is characterized by a ph value equal to 2 17 as well as high so4 2 2690 mg l and nh4 634 mg l concentrations it can be inferred that the flowback fluid sample is predominantly composed of gel breaker nh4 2s2o8 subsequently different ions in the flowback fluid showed distinct changes based on the influence of various geochemical processes according to field fracturing and laboratory experiment results potential geochemical processes e g mixing process mineral dissolution and precipitation redox reaction ion exchange and adsorption desorption clay minerals stability that developed during hydraulic fracturing are discussed and summarized 4 2 1 mixing process mixing between fracturing fluid and formation water is a well recognized process in shale reservoirs osselin et al 2018 huang et al 2020 owen et al 2020 phan et al 2020 hydrochemistry and isotopes data are useful tool for understanding the mixing processes zhang et al 2022 li et al 2016 in this study hydrochemistry and isotopes data of the flowback fluid also suggest the development of this process in the tight sandstone reservoir however the mixing process is distinguished in different reservoirs and geological conditions fracturing fluid and formation water are two intrinsically different end members therefore conservative cl can be used as a tracer to calculate the mixing ratios based on the two end member mixing model eqs 1 2 hydrochemistry and isotope data of the flowback fluid suggest that the main component of the 1st and 2nd flowback fluid samples is fracturing fluid while the samples after the 550 h mark were mainly composed of formation water therefore the mean concentration of ions of the 1st and 2nd samples are similar to the end member of the fracturing fluid while the mean concentrations of the last two samples the 64th and 65th are similar to the end member of the formation water 1 c mf c f r c w 1 r 2 δ mf c f δ f r c w δ w 1 r c mf where cmf cf and cw are the concentration of ions of the mixing fluid the fracturing fluid and the formation water respectively δmf δf and δw represent the isotopic ratios of the mixing fluid the fracturing fluid and the formation water respectively r is the mixing ratio according to the modeling results the majority of the samples are distributed along the mixing line for ca2 na sr2 and ba2 fig 6 and fig s1 which indicates that the mixing process is the dominant determinant of the flowback fluid hydrochemistry however some samples deviate significantly from the mixing line which suggests that there were other potential sources e g mineral dissolution mineral precipitation ion exchange and adsorption besides the ones derived from mixing especially during the 51 to 190 h interval in this study the gas reservoir was fractured in six sections fig 1c however tight sandstone gas reservoirs are generally characterized by complex pore structure heterogeneous features and high bound water saturation holditch 2006 birkle and makechnie 2022 formation water accumulates in the pores of tight sandstone reservoirs in the form of bound water capillary water and free water wu et al 2022 the bound water and capillary water are unevenly distributed affected by the reservoir heterogeneity these two types of water cannot be easily drained by the gas molecules due to strong capillary pressure resulting in widely residual water areas especially in the braided river sedimentary facies of the sulige area dai et al 2012 dehghanpour et al 2013 li et al 2021 based on the strong heterogeneity characteristics of the tight sandstone reservoirs natural gas is filled preferentially in the reservoirs with high porosity and permeability gas saturation 75 formation water accumulates in the reservoirs defined by relatively low porosity and permeability gas saturation 60 forming a free water accumulation zone wei et al 2017 wu et al 2022 however hydraulic fracturing can release the formation water the fractures created by the high pressure fracturing fluid in the reservoir during hydraulic fracturing connect the fractures pores containing the formation water which results in the mixing of fracturing fluid and formation water in addition formation water might be produced through the process of countercurrent imbibition and ion diffusion due to the high concentration gradient between the high salinity formation water and the low salinity fracturing fluid balashov et al 2015 zolfaghari et al 2016 owen et al 2020 therefore the mixing process does not happen immediately and it is also uneven this is supported by the color and tds changes of the flowback fluid the 1st to 8th samples are characterized by fracturing fluid with gray and turbid aspect fig s2 after that the samples show black and turbid characteristics of the formation water black pale yellow and brick red however the pale yellow color occurs in the 16th 17th and 21st samples and the samples at the terminal stages of the flowback the 54th 57th 58th 62nd 64th and 65th samples and the tds values suggest strong fluctuations between the 21st and 40th samples suggesting an uneven mixing process overall the mixing process is complex due to the effect of the geochemical processes and reservoir heterogeneity 4 2 2 mineral dissolution the results of field and laboratory experiments show that soluble minerals such as halite and calcite dissolve immediately once the fracturing fluid is pumped into the reservoir the major and trace elements of the tight sandstone were leached and released into the aqueous solution the ions could have precipitated in the form of salts in the pores and fractures due to the high irreducible water saturation in the tight reservoir zolfaghari et al 2016 the sem images and the eds results indicate that a few halite crystals have been identified in the clay minerals fig s3 which causes the tight sandstone sample to be salty halite dissolution occurs when the fracturing fluid with low ionic concentration is pumped r1 however halite dissolution has a limited ability to increase the cl and the na concentration in the flowback fluid in comparison with the mixing process r1 nacl halite na cl r2 caco 3 calcite h ca 2 hco 3 acidic preflush is usually used to open the pores in horizontal wells calcite is more soluble at low ph conditions calcite dissolution causes ca2 and hco3 to release from the rock r2 and leads to a significant increase in ph fig s1f the increase of the hco3 concentration above the mixing line highlights the dissolution of calcite hco3 concentration increased during the 0 68 h interval and then decreased after the 68 h mark fig 3d it is speculated that the fracturing fluid initially mixed with the reaction solution between calcite and acid and then mixed with the formation water however ca2 did not show the same trend as hco3 due to the strong mixing process and the cation exchange in addition mineral dissolution also releases trace elements such as sr rb and mn from the reservoir rock table s3 4 2 3 mineral precipitation fracturing fluid with low ionic concentration usually does not cause mineral precipitation when water rock interactions occur between the fracturing fluid and the tight sandstone however formation water accumulated in the pores and fissures of the reservoir is connected by the fractures generated after hydraulic fracturing which causes mixing of the fracturing fluid and the formation water and the occurrence of a series of fluid fluid interactions barite baso4 is a commonly observed form of scaling paukert vankeuren et al 2017 xiong et al 2020 the addition of gel breaker nh4 2s2o8 increased the so4 2 concentration 2nd to 7th samples while the ba2 concentration decreased significantly table s1 fig 3e and f suggesting the generation of barite precipitation r3 barite precipitation is more likely to form during the early stages of hydraulic fracturing and near wellbore area due to the low temperatures r3 ba 2 so 4 2 baso 4 barite r4 ca 2 co 3 2 caco 3 calcite high ca2 concentration is observed in the formation water while the fracturing fluid has high co3 2 concentration the mixing between the fracturing fluid and the formation water might induce secondary calcite mineral precipitation the saturation of calcite decreases with the increase of the temperature which is different in comparison with other minerals e g barite and gypsum calcite precipitation is more likely to occur in the fracture tip area due to the high reservoir temperatures r4 in addition high f concentration is observed in the fracturing fluid in the laboratory experiment indicating potential fluorite precipitation during hydraulic fracturing the reservoir pressure gradually decreases as the fracturing process progresses the pressure gradient causes the formation water trapped inside the pores of the rock to be expelled pressure decay is also an important factor that causes mineral precipitation in the terminal stages of the flowback process therefore mineral precipitation occurs predominantly during the early and the terminal stages of hydraulic fracturing the potential secondary mineral precipitation clogs irreversibly the microfracture networks and the flow paths which reduces the hydraulic fracturing efficiency mäder et al 2006 jew et al 2017 4 2 4 redox reaction pyrite oxidation is considered one of the main water rock interactions in shale gas extraction wilke et al 2015 harrison et al 2017 xu et al 2018 but is ignored in tight sandstone reservoirs in this paper we determined that pyrite oxidation occurs during hydraulic fracturing in the tight sandstone reservoir although pyrite was not detected by xrd analyses it was identified in sem fig 4d huang et al 2020 proposed that pyrite oxidation was limited in a shale reservoir 3 8 pyrite based on the results of field hydraulic fracturing experiment using fresh water as fracturing fluid however in this study the gel breaker nh4 2s2o8 was added to the wellbore in the field fracturing experiment it breaks the guar fracturing fluid and oxidizes some minerals and ions e g pyrite mn2 fe and so4 2 show a positive correlation during the early stages of the flowback process 2 12 h fe nh4 and so4 2 concentrations increase while mn concentration decreases between the 2nd and 7th samples table s1 fig s1c and d thus indicating the oxidation process r5 and r6 the addition of gel breaker makes this process more obvious r5 2fes 2 pyrite 15 nh 4 2 s 2 o 8 16h 2 o 2fe 3 34so 4 2 30nh 4 32h r6 2mn 2 5 nh 4 2 s 2 o 8 8h 2 o 2mno 4 10so 4 2 10nh 4 16h 4 2 5 ion exchange and adsorption desorption ion exchange and adsorption desorption are very common hydrogeochemical processes in the water rock system cations such as ca2 na k sr2 and b balance negative charges on mineral surfaces in the aqueous phase particularly on clay minerals appelo and postma 2005 tipper et al 2021 huang et al 2022 chloro alkaline indices and the bivariate diagram of na cl versus ca mg hco3 so4 were used to reveal the possibility of cation exchange wu et al 2015 li et al 2018 he and li 2020 negative values for both chloro alkaline indices and an almost linear slope equal to 1 of the bivariate diagram indicate the possibility of cation exchange during the early stages of the flowback process fig s4 the solid phase e g clay minerals adsorbs ca2 in water and releases na into the solution the cation exchange between ca2 and na k is also supported by the results illustrated in fig 3b and fig s1b in which the observed ca2 concentrations plot below the mixing line while the na and the k concentration plot above the mixing line similar ionic radiuses and ionic charges of sr2 and ca2 lead to a consistent geochemical behavior appelo and postma 2005 sr2 was also adsorbed on the exchangeable sites of the clay minerals and presented a similar changing with ca2 fig 8 a 87sr 86sr ratio has a higher sensitivity to identifying the mixing processes zheng et al 2021 in this study the obtained values of the 87sr 86sr ratios were lower than the mixing values fig 8b which confirms that sr was essentially eliminated by cation exchange for example around 20 43 of sr was removed by cation exchange between the 8 and 44 h interval of the flowback process the observed b concentrations in the flowback fluid were significantly higher than those derived from the mixing indicating that there were additional sources besides mixing that greatly contributed to the increase in b concentration fig 8c due to the use of b crosslinking agent the b concentrations in the fracturing fluid are higher than in the formation water a part of the b contents was absorbed by minerals of the reservoir after fracturing fluid gel breaking afterwards the b concentration in the solution was diluted by formation water and the b absorbed in the minerals was desorbed into water this observation is illustrated in fig 8d where the c cm value the observed b concentration vs the mixing b concentration initially increases and then decreases and afterwards hovers near the mixing line value after the 574 h mark of the flowback process fig 8d the similar processes of b adsorption and desorption are also found in shale reservoirs huang et al 2022 the use of high b fracturing fluid will cause b adsorption and desorption more complex ion exchange and adsorption desorption occur during the entire hydraulic fracturing and flowback processes due to fluid mixing and fluid flow 4 2 6 clay minerals stability clay minerals represent approximately 24 of rock s mineralogical composition therefore the stability of clay minerals is a key factor affecting hydraulic fracturing in tight sandstone reservoirs clay minerals are insoluble and are difficult to undergo chemical reactions in a short time under natural conditions civan 2015 however the stability of the crystal chemistry of clay minerals is prone to change when fracturing fluid is pumped into the gas reservoir clay swelling occurs when the clay minerals interact with freshwater and is common in shales due to the presence of smectite minerals khan et al 2021 however smectite contents are low in the tight sandstone reservoirs which is different from the contents in shale clay swelling usually is not an important factor that affects the stability of clay minerals illite with small interlayers of illite smectite has a sandwich structure characterized by poor stability that is easy to disperse and expand when exposed to a high ph environment or when k is leached wilson and wilson 2014 khan et al 2021 in this paper the observed k concentrations of the flowback fluid were significantly higher than the mixing line values fig 3c expansion damage and migration of the edges of illite crystals were identified in the water rock interactions experiment fig 4f suggesting that k leaching and ion exchange play an important role in the stability of illite minerals kaolinite is nonswelling clay with a two layer structure but can easily disperse and migrate in an alkaline environment sruthi and reddy 2019 guar fracturing fluid usually needs to be crosslinked under alkaline conditions ph 9 11 therefore the stability of kaolinite was disturbed and the kaolinite crystals migrated when interaction with guar fracturing fluid occurred fig 6a and b meanwhile the intergranular pores of kaolinite were destroyed the instability of clay minerals causes the obstruction of the pore throat by particle migration and affects the gas flow civan 2015 mixing between the formation water and the fracturing fluid creates a high salinity environment and causes smaller pieces of kaolinite and illite to be released from the tight sandstone flocculation could develop and re deposit in the pore throats damaging the permeability of the reservoir bishop 1997 maley et al 2013 chlorite has a three layer structure and usually does not swell when interacting with water but it is easier to produce precipitation after contacting with acidic preflush and oxidizing solution steudel et al 2009 in the laboratory experiments the chlorite crystals were damaged and migration occurred in a high water rock ratio environment fig 6e therefore chlorite is likely to form precipitation during the early stages of hydraulic fracturing which causes the sediment to block the throat and decrease permeability herz thyhsen et al 2020 liang et al 2020 in addition frequent changes in the ph gradient can also cause the leaching of cations from the clay layers disintegrating the clay crystals fig s1f al is the main element of clay minerals al concentrations of the flowback fluid show intense fluctuations without any obvious signs of mixing reflecting the frequent water rock interactions of clay minerals fig s1e thus it is necessary to add clay stabilizers such as kcl and nh4cl into the fracturing fluid to mitigate clay minerals swelling dispersion and migration in summary hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid is a complex product of gas fluid and solid components the mixing process between fracturing fluid and formation water exerts an important control on the flowback fluid chemistry while fluid rock and fluid fluid interactions e g mineral dissolution and precipitation redox reaction ion exchange and adsorption desorption also play an essential role fig 9 therefore in hydraulic fracturing operations the type of fracturing fluid type as well as the selection of additives depends on the mineral composition and formation water chemistry of the gas reservoir complex fracturing fluids heterogeneous reservoir environments and different fracturing and flowback strategies sophisticate the flowback fluid components however meticulously depicting the geochemical processes of hydraulic fracturing by frequently sampling the flowback fluids can still generate important information used to refine the hydraulic fracturing technology and improve oil gas production 5 conclusions by taking into consideration the necessity to optimize the fracturing fluid composition and improve the fracturing process in tight sandstone reservoirs this study designed field hydraulic fracturing and laboratory water rock interaction experiments to better understand the geochemical processes and mechanisms during hydraulic fracturing in conjunction with geochemistry isotope xrf xrd and sem techniques the main conclusions are as follows 1 the flowback fluid is a complex mixture between fracturing fluid formation water and the product of fracturing fluid rock and fracturing fluid formation water interactions with high tds 0 93 33 04 g l and heavy isotopes e g mean δ18o of 5 35 mean δ2h of 37 53 and mean 87sr 86sr of 0 714651 different ions concentrations show distinct trend with the increase of flowback days caused by geochemical processes the concentrations for most ions cl k na ca2 sr2 ba2 and br increase rapidly and trend to reach a stable state with the flowback process strontium isotope 87sr 86sr shows the potential as a sensitive tracer to identify groundwater contamination in the sulige area 2 in the tight sandstone reservoir the mixing between fracturing fluid and formation water is dominated by the geochemical processes of conservative ions e g cl na br hydraulic fracturing can release the formation water but the mixing process is complex due to the high heterogeneity of the reservoir formation water with high tds values is a key factor for the creation of secondary mineral precipitation that is harmful to the gas flow the formation water should be given adequate attention in hydraulic fracturing operations 3 mineral dissolution and precipitation redox reaction ion exchange and adsorption desorption affect the geochemical processes of ca2 hco3 so4 2 k ba2 b fe al and other trace ions mineral dissolution primarily occurs during the early stages of hydraulic fracturing while precipitation might develop in the early and terminal stages due to the participation of formation brine in this study pyrite oxidation process is

3023,the application of hydraulic fracturing has transformed tight sandstone gas into a very important global unconventional resource the accurate description of geochemical processes during hydraulic fracturing can provide essential information for improving tight gas production in this study field fracturing and laboratory water rock interaction experiments were designed and performed in conjunction with geochemistry isotope xrf xrd and sem techniques to reveal the prevalent geochemical processes sixty five flowback fluid samples were collected from a hydraulic fracturing well and a tight sandstone sample was drilled from gas reservoir to perform water rock interaction experiments the results indicate that hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid is a complex mixture with high tds values 0 93 33 04 g l and heavy isotopes e g mean δ18o of 5 35 mean 87sr 86sr of 0 714651 geochemistry and isotope data reveal that the mixing process between fracturing fluid and formation water exerts an important influence on the flowback fluid chemistry while water rock and fluid fluid interactions are also variably important during the hydraulic fracturing process pyrite oxidation process

interactions geochemistry isotopes sulige gas field data availability data will be made available on reasonable request 1 introduction tight sandstone gas is an important unconventional hydrocarbon resource that is found in tight sandstone reservoirs with a continuous decrease in conventional oil and gas reserves tight sandstone gas is gradually becoming a more and more important alternative resource worldwide vedachalam et al 2015 zou et al 2018 qi et al 2021 tight sandstone gas deposits have been discovered in more than 70 basins around the world with proven reserves equal to approximately 2 1 1014 m3 mainly distributed in south america north america and asia holditch 2006 qiao et al 2019 currently tight sandstone gas is still the protagonist of unconventional natural gas resources zou et al 2018 herz thyhsen et al 2020 su et al 2021 however by considering the extremely low permeability overburden matrix permeability 0 1 10 3 μm2 of rocks in tight sandstone reservoirs hydraulic fracturing and horizontal wells technologies are the dominant methods for the development of the unconventional natural gas industry holditch 2006 herz thyhsen et al 2019 sun et al 2019 during hydraulic fracturing large volumes of fracturing fluid are injected with high pressure into the horizontal section of the well to create complex fracture network in the reservoir and increase the flowing ability of natural gas mcintosh et al 2019 however water rock interactions could occur between the injected fracturing fluid and the rock in the gas reservoir influencing the effect of hydraulic fracturing positive water rock interactions can stimulate reservoir fracture propagation while negative water rock interactions would lead to reservoir damage and reduce oil and gas production osselin et al 2019 huang et al 2020 qi et al 2021 hence understanding the potential geochemical processes and water rock interactions between the fracturing fluid the rock and the fluids of the gas reservoir is critical understanding the behavior and composition of the fracturing flowback water can provide insights into the in situ water rock interactions facilitating assessing the success of the fracturing operations and improving the fracturing technology jacobs 2015 huang et al 2020 owen et al 2020 fu et al 2021 the chemical and isotopic compositions of flowback water are well studied and water rock interaction types and geochemical processes were revealed in shale reservoirs e g bagheri et al 2014 osselin et al 2019 cui et al 2020 phan et al 2020 welch et al 2021 osselin et al 2019 studied the geochemical and sulfate isotopic evolution of flowback and produced waters of montney formation shale canada they found that flowback fluid chemistries were determined by mixing process between formation brine and the fracturing fluids cui et al 2020 proposed that water rock interactions e g feldspar and carbonates dissolution dominated some chemical and isotopic compositions such as boron strontium and their isotopes of flowback fluids in shale gas reservoir zhong et al 2019 found that microbial activity in flowback water might negatively influence shale gas extraction and the recycling of flowback water would enhance the enrichment and growth of halanaerobium however correlational research related to tight sandstone reservoir is scarce birkle and makechnie 2022 assessed the fracture functionality and fracturing efficiency in tight sandstone based on geochemical analysis of flowback fluid due to different reservoir environments and hydraulic fracturing technologies e g different minerals and fracturing fluids geochemical processes are distinguished between shale and tight sandstone reservoirs in addition to the analysis of flowback fluid water rock interaction experiments performed in the laboratory are also an important method to study the geochemical processes during the hydraulic fracturing process paukert vankeuren et al 2017 hakala et al 2021 although laboratory data might not match field data obtained from fractured wells laboratory experiments can simulate various fracturing conditions and analyze the compositional changes of liquid and solid phases which is difficult to achieve in the field zolfaghari et al 2016 phan et al 2018 huang et al 2020 therefore laboratory experiments were performed to study reservoir damage and water rock interactions between the fracturing fluid and the reservoir rock jew et al 2017 herz thyhsen et al 2020 ferguson et al 2021 hakala et al 2021 qi et al 2021 pyrite oxidation ion exchange and mineral precipitation were well revealed and depicted by laboratory experiments in shale reservoir jew et al 2017 paukert vankeuren et al 2017 huang et al 2022 for tight sandstone reservoir herz thyhsen et al 2020 conducted water rock interaction experiments between tight sandstone and fracturing fluid and found that calcite dissolution increased porosity of the sandstone sample from 5 to 5 8 hari et al 2021 analyzed the damage factors associated with the process of proppant crushing and embedment during hydraulic fracturing by reviewing the different experimental studies on the tight sandstone formations however neither single flowback fluid studies nor laboratory experiments can reveal in detail the geochemical processes of hydraulic fracturing field fracturing combined with laboratory water rock interaction experiments is a necessary method to study the geochemical processes during hydraulic fracturing in this paper the hydraulic fracturing experiment was conducted in the field and the flowback fluid was intensively sampled 2 hour intervals meanwhile the laboratory water rock interaction experiments were also designed and carried out using guar fracturing fluid and drilled rock core this study aimed to reveal the composition sources of the fracturing flowback fluid the geochemical processes and the water rock interactions during hydraulic fracturing using geochemistry isotope xrf xrd sem and eds techniques in a tight sandstone reservoir this is the first systematic study to characterize the geochemical mechanisms of the hydraulic fracturing process in tight sandstone gas it can provide detailed insight into in situ water rock interactions and geochemical processes during hydraulic fracturing this knowledge will assist the operators with critical information in fracturing fluid optimization and fracturing process improvement to maximize hydrocarbon production from low permeability reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and geological settings the ordos basin is the second largest sedimentary basin in china fig 1 a with abundant resources of petroleum natural gas coalbed methane and coal fan et al 2019 the sulige gas field located in the northwestern part of the ordos basin is a typical tight sandstone gas reservoir with low permeability low pressure and low abundance it is currently the largest natural gas field discovered in china with proven reserves equal to approximately 2 0 1012 m3 zou et al 2018 abundant tight sandstone gas has been found in the upper paleozoic succession of the sulige gas field shuai et al 2013 in which the tight sandstone reservoirs are primarily composed of the lower permian shanxi formation and the middle permian shihezi formation fig 1b according to the lithostratigraphic chart the shanxi formation can be divided into two units p1s2 and p1s1 there are some coal layers in the p1s2 member with intercalations of medium to fine grained sandstones gray and grayish brown mixed with black mudstones the thickness is approximately 30 40 m the lithology of the p1s1 member consists of an alternation between sandstones and mudstones deposited in distributary channel conditions the sandstones are represented by medium to fine lithic sandstones and lithic quartz sandstones with a thickness of 30 m zou et al 2018 fan et al 2019 the shihezi formation is divided into the upper shihezi formation and the lower shihezi formation the lower shihezi formation consists of light gray pebbly coarse sandstones gray white medium to coarse grained sandstones and gray green lithic quartz sandstones large cross bedding sedimentary structures are developed in the sandstones while mudstones and coal seams are rare it can be further divided into four gas units from bottom to top p2h8 p2h7 p2h6 and p2h5 the thickness of the lower shihezi formation is generally between 120 and 160 m the upper shihezi formation is also divided into four gas units from bottom to top p2h4 p2h3 p2h2 and p2h1 with an alternation between red mudstones and sandy mudstones fig 1b the thickness ranges from 140 to 160 m fan et al 2019 hui et al 2020 wu et al 2022 the p2h8 unit is the primary gas producing reservoir the porosity of the p2h8 unit is in the range of 4 4 14 3 mean 10 1 and the permeability ranges from 0 1 to 3 0 10 3 μm2 mean 1 0 10 3 μm2 which is a typical low permeability gas reservoir wei et al 2017 2 2 field hydraulic fracturing experiments the su1 well was spudded on 4 september 2020 in the middle of the sulige gas field and entered the target reservoir p2h8 at a depth of 3455 m finally the drilling was completed on 25 september with a horizontal section of 700 m fig 1c the logging curve gamma ray indicated that the tight sandstone section was 700 m long with a drilling rate of 100 0 while the gas bearing sandstone was 599 m long with an effective reservoir drilling rate of 85 6 the su1 well belongs to the upper paleozoic reservoir block with a total hydrocarbon content of 98 1 including 93 6 methane and 3 52 ethane co2 accounts for 1 05 and h2s ranges from 0 8 to 10 69 mg m3 with a mean value of 7 01 mg m3 the su1 horizontal gas well was fractured in six sections on 8 march 2021 fig 1c a total volume of 2501 m3 fracturing fluid was injected into the well the first flowback fluid sample was collected at 18 00 on 10 march 2021 and afterwards the flowback fluid was sampled every 2 h during the first day thereafter the sampling interval gradually increased with the flowback time overall sixty five flowback fluid samples were collected over 33 days from the gas well the fracturing fluid used in this study is guar fracturing fluid one of the most used fracturing fluids in low permeability reservoirs composed of make up freshwater 98 37 hydroxypropyl guar and various additives 1 63 the make up freshwater for the fracturing fluid was sampled from the shallow groundwater well located near the gas well for this study a make up freshwater sample was also collected the collected samples were sealed and stored at 4 c and transported to the laboratory chen et al 2020 the chemical and isotopic composition na k

by using an atomic absorption spectrometer pinaacletm 900h and inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy icap 6300 anions were measured with an ion chromatography system ics 600 the calculated ionic error balance did not exceed 5 the stable isotopic ratios δ2h and δ18o were determined by using a tc ea irms mat 253 instrument with measurement accuracies of 1 0 and 0 2 respectively 87sr 86sr was calculated by using a neptune plus mc icp ms instrument chapman et al 2012 capo et al 2014 the measured values of the sr standard nbs 987 standard over the period were 0 710249 0 000013 2σ n 13 2 3 water rock interaction experiments laboratory experiments can reveal some water rock interactions e g carbonate dissolution precipitation of specific minerals which could be overwhelmed by the mixing between the fracturing fluid and the hypersaline formation water therefore the water rock interaction experiments were designed in the laboratory to facilitate the study of hydraulic fracturing in the field a rock core sample was collected from an adjacent well drilled near the su1 horizontal gas well 38 km as no cores were collected from the fractured well the gas layer p2h8 and the sampled core interval are parallel to the su1 fractured section rock samples used in the experiment consisted of 75 chips d 3 5 mm and 25 powder d 0 075 mm to make full use of the core samples and comply with the testing requirements zolfaghari et al 2016 herz thyhsen et al 2019 huang et al 2020 the fracturing fluid was compounded by using deionized water and additives with similar proportions as in the field fracturing fluid carrying fluid consequently rock samples 15 g were added into deionized water and fracturing fluid 60 ml respectively with a water rock ratio of 4 1 after the reaction 1 3 6 10 and 20 days the fluid was centrifuged 3000 rpm for 15 min and filtrated 0 22 μm nylon and polyether sulfone filters to measure the ion composition rock samples were completely dried to measure the elemental composition xrf mineralogical composition xrd and morphology sem and eds by using an x ray fluorescence spectroscopy niton xl2 an x ray diffractometer d max 2500 and a field emission scanning electron microscope tescan mira3 respectively 3 results 3 1 field hydraulic fracturing 3 1 1 hydrogeochemistry of the injected water fracturing fluid is a complex mixture that consists of pad fluid carrying fluid and displacing liquid it is difficult to obtain the theoretical composition of fracturing fluid at the rig site however it is mainly composed of freshwater 98 37 make up freshwater can partially characterize the hydrogeochemistry of the fracturing fluid make up freshwater originates from the local shallow groundwater which is defined by low ion concentrations the anions are dominated by hco3 207 mg l with low cl 18 0 mg l and so4 2 24 0 mg l while the cations are mainly composed of ca2 and mg2 therefore the make up freshwater is characterized by the hco3 ca mg type with a low tds value 240 mg l and a slightly alkaline nature ph 7 76 low divalent cations such as ca2 36 1 mg l and mg2 15 8 mg l make it suitable to prepare guar fracturing fluid δ2h and δ18o values are equal to 62 95 and 7 87 respectively suggesting the characteristics of stable isotopes in the local groundwater fig 2 a yin et al 2011 however high ba2 al and 87sr 86sr values are detected in make up freshwater 9 75 mg l 3 08 mg l and 0 712055 respectively table 1 and are significantly higher than the values in unpolluted groundwater fig 2b rao et al 2015 inferring that the water could be contaminated 3 1 2 chemical and isotopic composition of the flowback fluid the fracturing flowback fluid has a high salinity with high mean concentrations of tds 14 181 mg l na 3405 mg l k 632 mg l ca2 1225 mg l sr2 78 0 mg l ba2 94 3 mg l cl 8184 mg l and br 93 7 mg l indicating an increasing trend with the flowback time fig 3 a at the same time mg2 so4 2 and hco3 are relatively scarce with mean values equal to 75 6 176 and 1087 mg l respectively therefore the flowback fluid falls into the cl na type category the ph ranges from 2 17 to 7 98 with a mean value of 6 26 median 6 14 suggesting a faintly acidic environment fe al and mn show wide fluctuations and an inconspicuous dynamic trend during the whole flowback process varying from 1 48 to 79 33 mg l 0 36 to 14 0 mg l and 0 05 to 6 18 mg l respectively nh4 and no3 fluctuate wildly during the early stages of the flowback process which is explained by the addition of gel breaker ammonium persulfate nh4 2s2o8 boron b an important ion in the guar fracturing fluid decreases from 66 5 to 13 9 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod is usually high in the flowback fluid after using the guar fracturing fluid silva et al 2017 in this study cod is high up to 2880 mg l during the early stages and shows a decreasing trend with flowback time table s1 the δ2h and δ18o values increase from 62 09 to 21 16 mean 37 53 and from 9 33 to 3 42 mean 5 35 respectively most samples plot below the global meteoric water line fig 2a 87sr 86sr ratios range between 0 713226 and 0 715002 with a mean of 0 714651 the values of the previously mentioned three isotopes are higher than the values obtained from local groundwater and atmospheric precipitation fig 2 yin et al 2011 rao et al 2015 they are potential indicators to trace shallow groundwater contamination caused by hydraulic fracturing in the study area especially the 87sr 86sr with higher sensitivity the concentrations for most ions cl k na ca2 sr2 ba2 and br increase rapidly with the increase of the flowback time and reach a maximum value around the 68 h mark then fluctuate and decrease between the 70 and 550 h interval and finally tend to stabilize around the 550 h mark where the gas well begins to produce gas into a gathering station fig 3a 3 2 laboratory water rock interactions the lithology of the rock used in the experiment is grayish white medium coarse grained quartzitic sandstones with a salty taste fig 4 a the results of the xrd analysis indicate that the mineralogical composition is dominated by quartz 74 6 kaolinite chlorite 19 8 and illite 4 2 with minor amounts of hematite 1 and calcite 0 4 as well as showing high k 15949 mg kg and low ca 3261 mg kg contents based on the xrf results fig 4b and c the sem images and the eds results suggest that large kaolinite stacked pseudo hexagonal platy crystals and chlorite crystals fill the quartz grains a few pyrite crystals were identified in the sandstone cracks fig 4d quartz and hematite are usually stable whereas clay minerals and calcite could interact with the fracturing fluid during hydraulic fracturing zheng et al 2021 he et al 2022 hence the water rock interaction experiments are proposed in two different environments fracturing fluid ff and deionized water dw to reveal the water rock interactions as well as the contributing factors by applying hydrochemistry xrf xrd sem and eds techniques the experiment results indicate that calcite dissolution occurred in the dw environment ca2 and hco3 concentrations showed an increasing trend the concentration of ca2 increased from 0 to 53 45 mg l on the first day then slowly increased from 53 45 to 59 46 mg l 1st to 5th day and maintained a stable state with the completion of the water rock interactions fig 5 a in the ff environment alkaline conditions inhibit the dissolution of the calcite in the rock leading to a lower ca2 concentration in comparison with the dw environment this is also supported by the fact that ca composition of the rock is higher in the ff environment after the experiment it is worth mentioning that a minor amount of calcite 0 5 0 6 is found on the 5th and 20th days and the ca contents of the rock also increased in the ff environment the experiment phenomena indicate that the new calcite precipitated during the terminal stages of the experiment potassium k is the representative element in illite steudel et al 2009 the k contents in the rock sample decreased both in the ff and the dw environments after the water rock experiments while the decrement in the ff environment was smaller than in the dw environment indicating more illite drainage from the rock in the dw environment the xrd results also support this observation fig 5b suggesting that illite contents increased slightly in the ff environment and decreased significantly in the dw environment sem images and eds are important methods used to reveal the changes in the mineral morphology in the rock before and after the water rock experiments especially in the case of clay minerals zolfaghari et al 2016 herz thyhsen et al 2020 in the obtained sem images undisturbed kaolinite appears as stacked pseudo hexagonal sheet crystals and booklet aggregates fig 2d sem results indicate that kaolinite had been corroded and some kaolinite crystals have migrated after completing the water rock experiment in the ff environment fig 6 a and b while chlorite crystal morphology remained unaffected fig 6c in comparison with the ff environment kaolinite was unaltered while chlorite appeared to be damaged in the dw environment fig 6d and e swelling of some illite crystals occurred and distal crystals dispersed in the dw environment fig 6f this also confirms the xrd results which indicate a decrease in illite in the dw environment 4 discussion 4 1 composition sources of the flowback fluid the chemical and isotopic compositions of the fracturing fluid are similar to freshwater with low ionic concentration while the flowback fluid shows the characteristics of seawater with high tds values therefore the sources that generated such a composition of the flowback fluid are worth investigating in natural water cl primarily originates from the dissolution of halite and is widely considered a conservative tracer osselin et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 halite minerals were not identified in the reservoir rocks although the maximum concentration of cl can reach 19 g l in the flowback fluid table 1 suggesting that cl in the flowback fluid does not originate only from the dissolution of halite in the tight sandstone like cl br is also conservative and is mainly found in geothermal water seawater and brine as the result of evaporation and concentration at the same time it has low concentrations in freshwater cui et al 2020 flowback fluid with high concentrations of br is characterized by formation brine the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of condensate water are lighter but are usually heavier in the formation brine rowan et al 2015 whyte et al 2021 in this study δ2h and δ18o samples tend to become heavier with the increase of the flowback time 87sr 86sr ratios of the flowback fluid are also significantly higher in comparison with make up freshwater local groundwater and atmospheric precipitation indicating the characteristics of formation water fig 2 the chemical and isotopic results indicate that the composition of the flowback fluid derives from the mixing between fracturing fluid and formation water the mixing mechanism is also supported by strong positive correlations between cl na ca2 sr2 and ba2 with determination coefficients r2 higher than 0 95 and a negative correlation r2 in the range of 0 63 0 79 with cod fig 7 in addition the laboratory experiment results show that major and trace elements of tight sandstones were leached both into the dw and the ff environments hence the dissolution of minerals is also a source of the flowback fluid composition tables s2 and s3 4 2 geochemical processes during hydraulic fracturing the hydraulic fracturing processes leave large volumes of fracturing fluids with complex chemical compositions in the tight sandstone reservoir for weeks or even months this provides an opportunity for the fracturing fluid to react with reservoir rock the evolution of the different ions and elements in the flowback fluid samples can reveal geochemical processes and mechanisms in the horizontal well during hydraulic fracturing while laboratory experiments can explain some details of water rock interactions the ionic concentrations in the first sample are similar to the concentrations in make up freshwater suggesting that it is a displacement fluid mainly composed of make up freshwater after two hours the concentration of ions indicates an increasing trend the fourth sample is different from the others and is characterized by a ph value equal to 2 17 as well as high so4 2 2690 mg l and nh4 634 mg l concentrations it can be inferred that the flowback fluid sample is predominantly composed of gel breaker nh4 2s2o8 subsequently different ions in the flowback fluid showed distinct changes based on the influence of various geochemical processes according to field fracturing and laboratory experiment results potential geochemical processes e g mixing process mineral dissolution and precipitation redox reaction ion exchange and adsorption desorption clay minerals stability that developed during hydraulic fracturing are discussed and summarized 4 2 1 mixing process mixing between fracturing fluid and formation water is a well recognized process in shale reservoirs osselin et al 2018 huang et al 2020 owen et al 2020 phan et al 2020 hydrochemistry and isotopes data are useful tool for understanding the mixing processes zhang et al 2022 li et al 2016 in this study hydrochemistry and isotopes data of the flowback fluid also suggest the development of this process in the tight sandstone reservoir however the mixing process is distinguished in different reservoirs and geological conditions fracturing fluid and formation water are two intrinsically different end members therefore conservative cl can be used as a tracer to calculate the mixing ratios based on the two end member mixing model eqs 1 2 hydrochemistry and isotope data of the flowback fluid suggest that the main component of the 1st and 2nd flowback fluid samples is fracturing fluid while the samples after the 550 h mark were mainly composed of formation water therefore the mean concentration of ions of the 1st and 2nd samples are similar to the end member of the fracturing fluid while the mean concentrations of the last two samples the 64th and 65th are similar to the end member of the formation water 1 c mf c f r c w 1 r 2 δ mf c f δ f r c w δ w 1 r c mf where cmf cf and cw are the concentration of ions of the mixing fluid the fracturing fluid and the formation water respectively δmf δf and δw represent the isotopic ratios of the mixing fluid the fracturing fluid and the formation water respectively r is the mixing ratio according to the modeling results the majority of the samples are distributed along the mixing line for ca2 na sr2 and ba2 fig 6 and fig s1 which indicates that the mixing process is the dominant determinant of the flowback fluid hydrochemistry however some samples deviate significantly from the mixing line which suggests that there were other potential sources e g mineral dissolution mineral precipitation ion exchange and adsorption besides the ones derived from mixing especially during the 51 to 190 h interval in this study the gas reservoir was fractured in six sections fig 1c however tight sandstone gas reservoirs are generally characterized by complex pore structure heterogeneous features and high bound water saturation holditch 2006 birkle and makechnie 2022 formation water accumulates in the pores of tight sandstone reservoirs in the form of bound water capillary water and free water wu et al 2022 the bound water and capillary water are unevenly distributed affected by the reservoir heterogeneity these two types of water cannot be easily drained by the gas molecules due to strong capillary pressure resulting in widely residual water areas especially in the braided river sedimentary facies of the sulige area dai et al 2012 dehghanpour et al 2013 li et al 2021 based on the strong heterogeneity characteristics of the tight sandstone reservoirs natural gas is filled preferentially in the reservoirs with high porosity and permeability gas saturation 75 formation water accumulates in the reservoirs defined by relatively low porosity and permeability gas saturation 60 forming a free water accumulation zone wei et al 2017 wu et al 2022 however hydraulic fracturing can release the formation water the fractures created by the high pressure fracturing fluid in the reservoir during hydraulic fracturing connect the fractures pores containing the formation water which results in the mixing of fracturing fluid and formation water in addition formation water might be produced through the process of countercurrent imbibition and ion diffusion due to the high concentration gradient between the high salinity formation water and the low salinity fracturing fluid balashov et al 2015 zolfaghari et al 2016 owen et al 2020 therefore the mixing process does not happen immediately and it is also uneven this is supported by the color and tds changes of the flowback fluid the 1st to 8th samples are characterized by fracturing fluid with gray and turbid aspect fig s2 after that the samples show black and turbid characteristics of the formation water black pale yellow and brick red however the pale yellow color occurs in the 16th 17th and 21st samples and the samples at the terminal stages of the flowback the 54th 57th 58th 62nd 64th and 65th samples and the tds values suggest strong fluctuations between the 21st and 40th samples suggesting an uneven mixing process overall the mixing process is complex due to the effect of the geochemical processes and reservoir heterogeneity 4 2 2 mineral dissolution the results of field and laboratory experiments show that soluble minerals such as halite and calcite dissolve immediately once the fracturing fluid is pumped into the reservoir the major and trace elements of the tight sandstone were leached and released into the aqueous solution the ions could have precipitated in the form of salts in the pores and fractures due to the high irreducible water saturation in the tight reservoir zolfaghari et al 2016 the sem images and the eds results indicate that a few halite crystals have been identified in the clay minerals fig s3 which causes the tight sandstone sample to be salty halite dissolution occurs when the fracturing fluid with low ionic concentration is pumped r1 however halite dissolution has a limited ability to increase the cl and the na concentration in the flowback fluid in comparison with the mixing process r1 nacl halite na cl r2 caco 3 calcite h ca 2 hco 3 acidic preflush is usually used to open the pores in horizontal wells calcite is more soluble at low ph conditions calcite dissolution causes ca2 and hco3 to release from the rock r2 and leads to a significant increase in ph fig s1f the increase of the hco3 concentration above the mixing line highlights the dissolution of calcite hco3 concentration increased during the 0 68 h interval and then decreased after the 68 h mark fig 3d it is speculated that the fracturing fluid initially mixed with the reaction solution between calcite and acid and then mixed with the formation water however ca2 did not show the same trend as hco3 due to the strong mixing process and the cation exchange in addition mineral dissolution also releases trace elements such as sr rb and mn from the reservoir rock table s3 4 2 3 mineral precipitation fracturing fluid with low ionic concentration usually does not cause mineral precipitation when water rock interactions occur between the fracturing fluid and the tight sandstone however formation water accumulated in the pores and fissures of the reservoir is connected by the fractures generated after hydraulic fracturing which causes mixing of the fracturing fluid and the formation water and the occurrence of a series of fluid fluid interactions barite baso4 is a commonly observed form of scaling paukert vankeuren et al 2017 xiong et al 2020 the addition of gel breaker nh4 2s2o8 increased the so4 2 concentration 2nd to 7th samples while the ba2 concentration decreased significantly table s1 fig 3e and f suggesting the generation of barite precipitation r3 barite precipitation is more likely to form during the early stages of hydraulic fracturing and near wellbore area due to the low temperatures r3 ba 2 so 4 2 baso 4 barite r4 ca 2 co 3 2 caco 3 calcite high ca2 concentration is observed in the formation water while the fracturing fluid has high co3 2 concentration the mixing between the fracturing fluid and the formation water might induce secondary calcite mineral precipitation the saturation of calcite decreases with the increase of the temperature which is different in comparison with other minerals e g barite and gypsum calcite precipitation is more likely to occur in the fracture tip area due to the high reservoir temperatures r4 in addition high f concentration is observed in the fracturing fluid in the laboratory experiment indicating potential fluorite precipitation during hydraulic fracturing the reservoir pressure gradually decreases as the fracturing process progresses the pressure gradient causes the formation water trapped inside the pores of the rock to be expelled pressure decay is also an important factor that causes mineral precipitation in the terminal stages of the flowback process therefore mineral precipitation occurs predominantly during the early and the terminal stages of hydraulic fracturing the potential secondary mineral precipitation clogs irreversibly the microfracture networks and the flow paths which reduces the hydraulic fracturing efficiency mäder et al 2006 jew et al 2017 4 2 4 redox reaction pyrite oxidation is considered one of the main water rock interactions in shale gas extraction wilke et al 2015 harrison et al 2017 xu et al 2018 but is ignored in tight sandstone reservoirs in this paper we determined that pyrite oxidation occurs during hydraulic fracturing in the tight sandstone reservoir although pyrite was not detected by xrd analyses it was identified in sem fig 4d huang et al 2020 proposed that pyrite oxidation was limited in a shale reservoir 3 8 pyrite based on the results of field hydraulic fracturing experiment using fresh water as fracturing fluid however in this study the gel breaker nh4 2s2o8 was added to the wellbore in the field fracturing experiment it breaks the guar fracturing fluid and oxidizes some minerals and ions e g pyrite mn2 fe and so4 2 show a positive correlation during the early stages of the flowback process 2 12 h fe nh4 and so4 2 concentrations increase while mn concentration decreases between the 2nd and 7th samples table s1 fig s1c and d thus indicating the oxidation process r5 and r6 the addition of gel breaker makes this process more obvious r5 2fes 2 pyrite 15 nh 4 2

common hydrogeochemical processes in the water rock system cations such as ca2 na k sr2 and b balance negative charges on mineral surfaces in the aqueous phase particularly on clay minerals appelo and postma 2005 tipper et al 2021 huang et al 2022 chloro alkaline indices and the bivariate diagram of na cl versus ca mg hco3 so4 were used to reveal the possibility of cation exchange wu et al 2015 li et al 2018 he and li 2020 negative values for both chloro alkaline indices and an almost linear slope equal to 1 of the bivariate diagram indicate the possibility of cation exchange during the early stages of the flowback process fig s4 the solid phase e g clay minerals adsorbs ca2 in water and releases na into the solution the cation exchange between ca2 and na k is also supported by the results illustrated in fig 3b and fig s1b in which the observed ca2 concentrations plot below the mixing line while the na and the k concentration plot above the mixing line similar ionic radiuses and ionic charges of sr2 and ca2 lead to a consistent geochemical behavior appelo and postma 2005 sr2 was also adsorbed on the exchangeable sites of the clay minerals and presented a similar changing with ca2 fig 8 a 87sr 86sr ratio has a higher sensitivity to identifying the mixing processes zheng et al 2021 in this study the obtained values of the 87sr 86sr ratios were lower than the mixing values fig 8b which confirms that sr was essentially eliminated by cation exchange for example around 20 43 of sr was removed by cation exchange between the 8 and 44 h interval of the flowback process the observed b concentrations in the flowback fluid were significantly higher than those derived from the mixing indicating that there were additional sources besides mixing that greatly contributed to the increase in b concentration fig 8c due to the use of b crosslinking agent the b concentrations in the fracturing fluid are higher than in the formation water a part of the b contents was absorbed by minerals of the reservoir after fracturing fluid gel breaking afterwards the b concentration in the solution was diluted by formation water and the b absorbed in the minerals was desorbed into water this observation is illustrated in fig 8d where the c cm value the observed b concentration vs the mixing b concentration initially increases and then decreases and afterwards hovers near the mixing line value after the 574 h mark of the flowback process fig 8d the similar processes of b adsorption and desorption are also found in shale reservoirs huang et al 2022 the use of high b fracturing fluid will cause b adsorption and desorption more complex ion exchange and adsorption desorption occur during the entire hydraulic fracturing and flowback processes due to fluid mixing and fluid flow 4 2 6 clay minerals stability clay minerals represent approximately 24 of rock s mineralogical composition therefore the stability of clay minerals is a key factor affecting hydraulic fracturing in tight sandstone reservoirs clay minerals are insoluble and are difficult to undergo chemical reactions in a short time under natural conditions civan 2015 however the stability of the crystal chemistry of clay minerals is prone to change when fracturing fluid is pumped into the gas reservoir clay swelling occurs when the clay minerals interact with freshwater and is common in shales due to the presence of smectite minerals khan et al 2021 however smectite contents are low in the tight sandstone reservoirs which is different from the contents in shale clay swelling usually is not an important factor that affects the stability of clay minerals illite with small interlayers of illite smectite has a sandwich structure characterized by poor stability that is easy to disperse and expand when exposed to a high ph environment or when k is leached wilson and wilson 2014 khan et al 2021 in this paper the observed k concentrations of the flowback fluid were significantly higher than the mixing line values fig 3c expansion damage and migration of the edges of illite crystals were identified in the water rock interactions experiment fig 4f suggesting that k leaching and ion exchange play an important role in the stability of illite minerals kaolinite is nonswelling clay with a two layer structure but can easily disperse and migrate in an alkaline environment sruthi and reddy 2019 guar fracturing fluid usually needs to be crosslinked under alkaline conditions ph 9 11 therefore the stability of kaolinite was disturbed and the kaolinite crystals migrated when interaction with guar fracturing fluid occurred fig 6a and b meanwhile the intergranular pores of kaolinite were destroyed the instability of clay minerals causes the obstruction of the pore throat by particle migration and affects the gas flow civan 2015 mixing between the formation water and the fracturing fluid creates a high salinity environment and causes smaller pieces of kaolinite and illite to be released from the tight sandstone flocculation could develop and re deposit in the pore throats damaging the permeability of the reservoir bishop 1997 maley et al 2013 chlorite has a three layer structure and usually does not swell when interacting with water but it is easier to produce precipitation after contacting with acidic preflush and oxidizing solution steudel et al 2009 in the laboratory experiments the chlorite crystals were damaged and migration occurred in a high water rock ratio environment fig 6e therefore chlorite is likely to form precipitation during the early stages of hydraulic fracturing which causes the sediment to block the throat and decrease permeability herz thyhsen et al 2020 liang et al 2020 in addition frequent changes in the ph gradient can also cause the leaching of cations from the clay layers disintegrating the clay crystals fig s1f al is the main element of clay minerals al concentrations of the flowback fluid show intense fluctuations without any obvious signs of mixing reflecting the frequent water rock interactions of clay minerals fig s1e thus it is necessary to add clay stabilizers such as kcl and nh4cl into the fracturing fluid to mitigate clay minerals swelling dispersion and migration in summary hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid is a complex product of gas fluid and solid components the mixing process between fracturing fluid and formation water exerts an important control on the flowback fluid chemistry while fluid rock and fluid fluid interactions e g mineral dissolution and precipitation redox reaction ion exchange and adsorption desorption also play an essential role fig 9 therefore in hydraulic fracturing operations the type of fracturing fluid type as well as the selection of additives depends on the mineral composition and formation water chemistry of the gas reservoir complex fracturing fluids heterogeneous reservoir environments and different fracturing and flowback strategies sophisticate the flowback fluid components however meticulously depicting the geochemical processes of hydraulic fracturing by frequently sampling the flowback fluids can still generate important information used to refine the hydraulic fracturing technology and improve oil gas production 5 conclusions by taking into consideration the necessity to optimize the fracturing fluid composition and improve the fracturing process in tight sandstone reservoirs this study designed field hydraulic fracturing and laboratory water rock interaction experiments to better understand the geochemical processes and mechanisms during hydraulic fracturing in conjunction with geochemistry isotope xrf xrd and sem techniques the main conclusions are as follows 1 the flowback fluid is a complex mixture between fracturing fluid formation water and the product of fracturing fluid rock and fracturing fluid formation water interactions with high tds 0 93 33 04 g l and heavy isotopes e g mean δ18o of 5 35 mean δ2h of 37 53 and mean 87sr 86sr of 0 714651 different ions concentrations show distinct trend with the increase of flowback days caused by geochemical processes the concentrations for most ions cl k na ca2 sr2 ba2 and br increase rapidly and trend to reach a stable state with the flowback process strontium isotope 87sr 86sr shows the potential as a sensitive tracer to identify groundwater contamination in the sulige area 2 in the tight sandstone reservoir the mixing between fracturing fluid and formation water is dominated by the geochemical processes of conservative ions e g cl na br hydraulic fracturing can release the formation water but the mixing process is complex due to the high heterogeneity of the reservoir formation water with high tds values is a key factor for the creation of secondary mineral precipitation that is harmful to the gas flow the formation water should be given adequate attention in hydraulic fracturing operations 3 mineral dissolution and precipitation redox reaction ion exchange and adsorption desorption affect the geochemical processes of ca2 hco3 so4 2 k ba2 b fe al and other trace ions mineral dissolution primarily occurs during the early stages of hydraulic fracturing while precipitation might develop in the early and terminal stages due to the participation of formation brine in this study pyrite oxidation process is confirmed during hydraulic fracturing in the tight sandstone reservoir the addition of gel breaker makes oxidation process more obvious 4 another new discovery is that ion exchange and adsorption desorption exist throughout the fracturing and flowback processess and have a significant influence on the stability of clay minerals around 20 43 of sr was removed from the flowback fluid by ion exchange between the 8 and 44 h intervals of the flowback process appropriate clay stabilizers are essential to mitigate swelling dispersion and migration of clay minerals during the hydraulic

3024,to understand the water energy and carbon cycles in the tibetan plateau tp it is essential to estimate seasonal and inter annual variations in energy fluxes and evapotranspiration et for alpine meadow ecosystems the multiyear 2014 2019 energy fluxes and et for a typical alpine meadow at arou station northeastern tp and their environmental and biophysical controls were evaluated using the eddy covariance method in this study latent heat flux le was the dominant component of energy consumption during the growing season whereas sensible heat flux h dominated energy partitioning during the non growing season h showed the opposite trend to le while the seasonal variation of soil heat flux g was small the daily et was primarily controlled by the available energy on the seasonal scale soil water content swc and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi displayed secondary effects on et during the non growing and growing seasons respectively the inter annual et was relatively stable ranging from 562 6 to 661 9 mm coefficient of variation cv 7 4 this was slightly higher than the annual precipitation despite large variations in inter annual precipitation cv 19 9 and was most likely due to snow and frozen ground melting the cumulative et in the growing season was about 77 of the annual et there was a nonlinear increase in the daily priestley taylor coefficient α et eteq where eteq is the equilibrium evaporation with an increase in bulk surface conductance gc which was insensitive to increases in gc that exceeded 15 mm s 1 there was a good relationship between gc and ndvi this study provides insights into the driving mechanisms of long term variations in the energy partitioning and biophysical controls on et in alpine meadow ecosystems keywords energy flux evapotranspiration bulk surface conductance decoupling factor alpine meadow tibetan plateau 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a critical factor involving the water energy and carbon cycles jung et al 2010 ma et al 2015 tong et al 2017 energy fluxes are generally controlled by meteorological and biophysical processes quantifying et for various ecosystems such as grasslands yue et al 2019 wetlands yan et al 2020 croplands lei and yang 2010 and forests marques et al 2020 has improved the understanding of interactions between land surface and atmosphere et quantification is also useful to optimize land surface parameters yue et al 2019 and explore its response to climate change zhang et al 2018 as alpine ecosystems are sensitive and vulnerable to climate change zhang et al 2018 it is important to quantify et to further understand hydrological processes and elucidate the driving mechanisms of alpine ecosystems the tibetan plateau tp with an average altitude of more than 4000 m a s l has the world s highest alpine ecosystem which is sensitive to climate change owing to its fragile environment and unique geophysical location gu et al 2008 alpine grasslands account for more than 60 of the total area of the tp figure s1 among which most grasslands are dominated by alpine meadows cui and graf 2009 li et al 2013a li et al 2013b alpine meadows which are characterized by low temperatures relatively high precipitation and intense solar radiation play a critical role in reducing desertification and maintaining ecological stability gu et al 2008 ma et al 2015 alpine meadows are fragile ecosystems that are extremely sensitive to climate change sun et al 2019 and are widely distributed in the northeastern and southeastern tp zhang et al 2018 therefore quantifying et in an alpine meadow is essential to assist in comprehensively understanding soil vegetation atmosphere interactions and hence develop sustainable water resource management practices ma et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 although several studies have focused on et for alpine meadows in the tp chen et al 2021 gu et al 2008 li et al 2013a li et al 2013b sun et al 2019 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 most were short term studies consisting of less than a year or only a few days of observations this limited dataset only provides partial insights into the dynamics of energy fluxes and et in alpine meadows although some studies used long term data for exploring the drivers on et for alpine meadow during the growing season wang et al 2020 drivers on et during the non growing season were neglected and the lysimeter method was used which may result in greater uncertainty than the eddy covariance ec method several studies have also quantified et using remote sensing models reanalysis data and land surface models in the tp han et al 2021 li et al 2015 sun et al 2020 however the substantial uncertainties associated with et estimation i e input data and model parameters still exist in addition the magnitude of controls on et varies with vegetation type and timescale williams et al 2012 zheng et al 2016 owing to the large spatial heterogeneity of climates and different land covers across the tp there is no consensus on whether energy or water limits et in the alpine meadow under different climatic conditions for example some studies suggest that energy rather than soil moisture limited et for the alpine kobresia gu et al 2005 2008 and humid alpine meadows on an annual scale zhang et al 2018 other studies inferred that et was controlled by water in the alpine meadow steppe liu et al 2009 hu et al 2009 proposed that the canopy stomatal conductance controlled et at the diurnal scale whereas leaf area index lai was the dominant factor controlling et at the seasonal and annual scales these varying conclusions highlight the importance of quantifying the seasonal and inter annual variations in energy fluxes and et and their driving forces for alpine meadows based on long term and high frequency flux measurements located in the northeastern area of the tp the heihe river basin hrb is the second largest inland endorheic basin in northwest china the heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research hiwater project was launched in 2012 and has provided abundant meteorological and ec data with important progress being made li et al 2013a li et al 2013b nearly 70 of the total river runoff is generated from the upper reaches of the hrb which promotes social and economic development in the middle and lower reaches of the hrb gao et al 2016 alpine meadow is the major ecosystem in the upper reaches of the hrb gao et al 2016 sun et al 2019 these data provide us an opportunity to better understand the eco hydrological processes of an alpine meadow ecosystem many studies have evaluated et variations or energy exchanges through observation sun et al 2019 remote sensing models tian et al 2013 wang et al 2013 and hydrological models gao et al 2016 li et al 2011 in the upper reaches of the hrb sun et al 2019 used a boosted regression trees based method to analyze the flux exchanges of the alpine meadow ecosystem which suggested that it is energy limited wang et al 2013 derived daily et by using the penman monteith equation and modis lai dataset and found that it can provide reliable et estimation in arid and cold regions tian et al 2013 estimated et using an extended three temperature 3 t model in the hrb and found that the 3 t model can produce satisfactory results at large scales li et al 2011 simulated et with two hydrological models and demonstrated that the results calculated for both models were comparable gao et al 2016 developed a distributed ecohydrological model to simulate hydrological processes in the upper reaches of the hrb and found that et was controlled by water availability in regions with elevations lower than 3200 m these studies provide valuable insights for the study of et in the hrb however many studies using short term observation data collected over periods of less than two years which is difficult to analyze the inter annual variation in et moreover few studies have analyzed et controlling factors using remote sensing and hydrological models in the upper reaches of the hrb using abundant meteorological and ec data this study quantified et variations both seasonal and inter annual and clarified the controlling factors for an alpine meadow ecosystem in hrb this study used 6 year ec measurements and meteorological data to address three objectives 1 investigate seasonal and inter annual variations in energy fluxes and et for the alpine meadow 2 quantify the meteorological and biophysical controls on et for the alpine meadow in the tp and 3 explore whether energy or water restricts et variability based on long term observations these results will improve the understanding of the driving mechanisms of meteorological and biophysical controls on et in alpine meadows 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site arou 38 05on 100 46oe 3033 m a s l is located in the upper reaches of hrb at the northeastern edge of the tp china fig 1 due to the fragile environment and complex terrain it is difficult to obtain long term and continuous data in the tp although the area ratio of alpine meadows with an elevation less than 3500 m a s l in the tp is about 12 the arou site is an ideal study site for exploring the eco hydrological processes of alpine meadow which has long term and continuous data from the hiwater project this region is characterized by a typical continental alpine climate with extensive snow cover and frozen ground che et al 2019 the land cover is alpine meadow dominated by elymus nutans with some intermixing of roegneria nutans sun et al 2019 the canopy height is between 0 2 and 0 3 m during the growing season the soil is sandy loam with silt loam near the surface and sandy soil in the deeper layers che et al 2019 the average annual temperature and precipitation are 0 4 c and 438 mm respectively zhou et al 2018 with the precipitation primarily occurring from may to september this period was also defined as the growing season the maximum lai at the arou site is approximately 6 5 sun et al 2019 2 2 meteorological and ec measurements meteorological and energy flux measurements were obtained at the alpine meadow site from 2014 to 2019 the open path ec system was installed 3 5 m above the surface and consisted of a three dimensional 3d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific usa and an open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500a i cor usa ec measurements included wind direction wind speed m s 1 virtual temperature c standard deviation of lateral wind speed m s 1 water vapor g m 3 and carbon dioxide molar

environmental variables included air temperature c relative humidity wind speed m s 1 and direction pressure hpa precipitation mm four radiation components w m 2 soil heat flux w m 2 soil temperature c and soil moisture all data were measured at 30 min intervals precipitation was measured using a tilting bucket rain gauge due to the tilting bucket rain gauge not being an accurate and direct measure of snow in winter the precipitation in winter may have been underestimated further details are provided in che et al 2019 and the datasets can be downloaded for free online https data tpdc ac

corrections included spike removal coordinate rotation frequency response correction sonic virtual temperature correction and corrections for density fluctuation webb pearman leuning wpl correction data quality controls marked with 2 were removed data were discarded when precipitation occurred within 1 h or the friction velocity was less than 0 1 m s 1 liu et al 2011 the reddyproc package was used to fill missing turbulence data wutzler et al 2018 the relationship between turbulent fluxes h le and available energy rn g is shown in fig 2 these turbulent fluxes exhibited a high correlation with available energy the linear correlation was higher during the non growing season r2 0 86 than that during the growing season r2 0 83 the regression line slopes for the non growing season growing season and entire year were 0 79 0 94 and 0 89 respectively this demonstrates that the turbulent fluxes had a high correlation with available energy the energy balance closure ratio ebr ranged from 0 81 to 1 15 with a mean value of 0 98 indicating that the eddy flux data were reliable table 1 during the growing season the ebr was 0 94 whereas it was 1 01 during the non growing season this energy imbalance was primarily due to systematic errors missing turbulent capture and heat storage pardo et al 2015 energy imbalance generally exists in alpine meadows chang et al 2018 gu et al 2005 and hence it is essential to address this issue prior to calculating et therefore the correction method in twine et al 2000 was applied the daily et wwere calculated using le λ where λ is the latent heat of vaporization of water due to the lack of lai measurements the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was used to explore the influence of vegetation on bulk surface conductance gc the ndvi was

semiarid ecosystems tian et al 2017 2 5 statistical analysis ridge regression was used to analyze the influence of environmental variables on et for avoiding multicollinearity between explanatory variables path analysis was used to explore the direct and indirect effects of environmental variables coffman and maccallum 2005 additionally linear and nonlinear regressions among the energy fluxes

conditions fig 3 illustrates the daily meteorological conditions during the study period the mean annual rg was 190 w m 2 ranging from 185 5 to 193 9 w m 2 and its daily variations exhibited similar trends each year the variations in ta and vpd exhibited similar seasonal patterns to that of rg increasing from winter to mid summer and decreasing thereafter the daily average ta during the study period was 0 11 c the lowest ta occurred in january whereas the highest primarily occurred in july the annual vpd ranged from 0 25 to 0 28 kpa with an average of 0 26 kpa the soil water content swc at a depth of 10 40 cm increased rapidly when precipitation occurred and then decreased suddenly after precipitation events the daily swc at a depth of 10 40 cm remained high due to recharge from frequent rainfall during the growing season the daily swc variations at 60 cm depth varied from 0 05 to 0 12 m3 m 3 the annual precipitation exhibited large inter annual variability and precipitation primarily occurred during the growing seasons the maximum daily precipitation occurred in 2019 at 61 6 mm 3 2 diurnal and seasonal variations in energy fluxes fig 4 presents the diurnal cycles of energy fluxes during the non growing and growing seasons the average diurnal energy fluxes were similar peaking at approximately 13 00 except for the soil heat flux during the non growing and growing seasons the average diurnal rn reached a peak of 291 7 and 462 2 w m 2 during the non growing and growing seasons at 13 00 respectively the diurnal variations in soil heat flux exhibited an s curve with a small value compared to that of the other energy fluxes the diurnal g reached its peak at 2 and 1 h after rn reached its peak during the non growing and growing seasons respectively g was the lowest with means of 0 1 and 2 4 w m 2 during the non growing and growing seasons respectively the average diurnal variations in turbulent fluxes h and le peaked between 12 00 and 13 00 decreasing at 18 00 the mean h was the highest at 18 7 w m 2 amounting to 48 7 of rn during the non growing season the average h was higher than the le during the daytime whereas the average le was higher than h at night during the non growing season the mean h increased rapidly during the daytime and decreased at night during the non growing season the le increased quickly during the growing season the mean le was the major form of energy consumption amounting to 77 3 of rn during the growing season the diurnal le was consistently greater than the diurnal h during the growing season fig 5 presents the daily behaviors of energy fluxes rn h le and g and the bowen ratio β for 2014 2019 in order to examine the seasonal patterns of energy partitions all energy fluxes exhibited clear seasonal trends fig 5a and 5b the daily rn and le increased sharply at the beginning of the growing season with increasing temperature and vegetation sprouting while the daily rn and le decreased rapidly at the end of the growing season with decreasing temperature and withering vegetation the daily h exhibited an opposite trend to that of le the daily g had a similar seasonal trend to that of rn while its variation was small fig 5b the daily rn ranged from 34 58 to 201 21 w m 2 with an average of 69 12 w m 2 and peaked in july the daily g ranged from 22 4 to 21 84 w m 2 with an average of 1 04 w m 2 the daily g increased significantly from march and its values became positive indicating that the soil developed into an energy sink it then decreased rapidly at the end of the growing season because of low temperature and freezing soil fig 5a in winter the daily g was generally negative and its fluctuation was small indicating that the soil was an energy source the g rn ratio was less than 4 4 during the non growing season and g consumed 2 3 of the rn during the growing season table 2 the g rn ratio ranged from 0 4 to 3 9 averaging at 1 7 during the study period at the annual scale the le exhibited distinct seasonal patterns similar to those of rn the ratio of le rn exceeded 78 7 during the growing season indicating that the le was the major consumer of available energy while le constituted 37 4 54 5 of rn during the non growing season the seasonal variations in h and β were almost opposite to those of le h was an important energy component during the non growing season and amounted to 55 9 of rn while it amounted to approximately 13 9 to 22 4 of rn during the growing season the β was typically less than 0 32 during the growing season whereas it varied from 0 98 to 3 05 during the non growing season the h and β were high prior to the growth of vegetation and with an increase in temperature and vegetation sprouting in may h and β gradually declined fig 5a c 3 3 seasonal variations in et the variations in monthly et et0 and precipitation are shown in fig 6 the monthly et increased from january peaked in july and then decreased gradually the seasonal variations in et were similar to those of et0 with a high correlation of 0 96 the highest monthly et occurred in july 112 2 124 4 mm and was similar to the highest et0 92 9 103 3 mm during the study period the monthly precipitation reached its peak in july or august providing sufficient water for vegetation precipitation occurred simultaneously with a high et during the growing season there were 16 months in which the monthly et was higher than the precipitation during the growing season monthly et and precipitation were strongly correlated during the study period r2 0 77 the monthly et et0 ratio ranged from 0 89 to 1 27 averaging 1 15 during the growing season however there were large differences between et and et0 during the non growing season fig 6 this was because low temperature and limited soil moisture led to lower et and a high rn led to high et0 for example the et et0 was 0 49 during the non growing season in 2016 and the monthly et et0 was the lowest in december differences between et and et0 during the non growing season in 2016 were greater than those in other years as there were only 27 precipitation days during the non growing season in 2016 this limited the available water and resulted in lower et 3 4 inter annual variations in energy and evapotranspiration the cumulative et and et0 for 2014 2019 are presented in table 3 the annual et of the alpine meadow varied from 562 6 to 661 9 mm averaging 602 5 mm the annual precipitation ranged from 400 8 to 662 1 mm with an average of 485 1 mm et during the growing season accounted for 68 80 7 of annual et in the period 2014 2019 although there were considerable inter annual variations in precipitation coefficient of variation cv 19 9 the variations in annual et were relatively small cv 7 4 in the alpine meadow this implies that the annual et had small inter annual variations compared with that of annual precipitation the inter annual variations in et during the growing season were also low with a cv of 3 36 whereas the inter annual variations in precipitation were relatively large cv 16 differences between the annual et and et0 were less than 9 for the period 2014 2019 although annual precipitation fluctuated by 248 5 mm inter annual variations in et were less than 86 9 mm 3 5 seasonal variations in bulk surface parameters seasonal variations in ga gc α β and ω were investigated fig 7 to clarify the importance of biological controls on et monthly ga varied insignificantly during the study period ranging from 10 32 to 14 87 mm s 1 with a mean of 12 54 mm s 1 fig 7a the gc has been considered a biophysical indicator of et influenced by lai and the leaf level stomatal conductance igarashi et al 2015 geng et al 2020 the daily gc varied from 0 21 to 26 04 mm s 1 averaging 2 74 mm s 1 during the non growing season the maximum gc ranged from 21 15 mm s 1 2016 to 29 24 mm s 1 2019 with a mean maximum of 26 88 mm s 1 during the growing season the monthly gc was higher during the growing season than during the non growing season fig 7b the monthly values for α were greater than 1 0 due to sufficient water supply during the growing season fig 7c this indicates that the available energy rather than the water supply controlled et at the alpine meadow during the growing season the monthly values of α ranged from 0 42 to 0 71 with an average of 0 55 during the non growing season this suggests that the water supply limited and significantly affected et during the non growing season the monthly β varied from 1 66 to 5 49 during the non growing season fig 7d indicating that more energy returned to the atmosphere with h being the dominant form of energy flux the average monthly β was 0 38 during the growing season indicating that the le was the major form of energy consumption due to abundant precipitation the seasonal pattern of ω was similar to that of gc the monthly ω ranged from 0 61 to 0 8 during the growing season and was higher than that during the non growing season this indicates that et was primarily dependent on available energy during the growing season fig 7e during the non growing season the average monthly ω was 0 31 suggesting that et was primarily dependent on water supply to analyze the relationship between ω and et the frequency of ω and the average daily et were calculated at an interval of 0 1 for ω fig 8 the proportion of ω that was less than 0 5 was 54 86 implying that et was primarily coupled with the vpd at the annual scale however et was primarily controlled by available energy during the growing season the frequency distribution peaked when ω was 0 1 0 2 accounting for 20 2 of the total the et increased with ω within 0 0 9 the magnitude of et peaked when ω was 0 8 0 9 a sudden decline in et occurred when ω was greater than 0 9 4 discussion 4 1 environmental factors et is considered a multivariate phenomenon due to various environmental and meteorological variables ding et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 the ridge regression between et and environmental variables revealed that all environmental variables could be attributable to 66 and 95 of the variations in et during the non growing and growing seasons respectively table 4 except for wind speed all environmental variables had significant effects on et during the study period swc exhibited a negative effect on et during the growing season whereas it showed a significant positive effect on et during the non growing season rn vpd and ta produced positive influences on et during the study period the ndvi played an important role in the daily et variation during the growing season moreover path analysis was conducted to explore the direct and indirect effects of meteorological factors on et during the growing and non growing seasons fig 9 this analysis indicated that rn had a significant direct influence on et followed by ndvi and vpd the standard coefficient of the total effect of rn was 0 84 0 77 0 46 0 15 which was much larger than that of ndvi 0 25 0 48 0 15 0 18 and vpd 0 15 fig 9a the indirect effect of ta 0 75 0 15 0 11 was larger than its direct effect 0 04 on et the swc showed a negative indirect effect on et while the standard coefficient of u was indirectly positive during the growing season rn and swc showed primary and secondary direct influences on et during the non growing season while the direct effect of the vpd was small and negative fig 9b overall the daily et was much more strongly controlled by rn during the study period while swc and ndvi played secondary roles during the non growing and growing seasons respectively the monthly et was primarily driven by the monthly rn during the non growing and growing seasons followed by ta and vpd fig 10 during the non growing season the monthly et decreased with an increasing monthly swc when the swc exceeded 20 where more soil moisture existed before and after the growing season contrastingly the monthly et increased when the swc was lower than 15 during the growing season et primarily comprised of transpiration which mainly originated from soil moisture in the shallow soil layer as this study used soil moisture at 0 60 cm depth it may not be representative of the actual soil moisture affected by transpiration hence the relationship between the monthly et and monthly swc was weak and insignificant during the growing season this was similar to that observed in a template of douglas fir stands jassal et al 2009 and a mixed plantation tong et al 2017 overall et was primarily determined by the available energy at daily and seasonal scales vegetation growth and soil moisture played secondary roles in et variation during the growing and non growing seasons respectively 4 2 biophysical controls on et the mean annual gc for the alpine meadow was 5 84 mm s 1 which was higher than that for the alpine steppe in the tp ma et al 2015 although considerably lower than that of the alpine meadow with kobresia humilis during the growth period gu et al 2005 this result may be attributed to the large spatial heterogeneity of vegetation coverage the average gc during the growing season in 2016 was the lowest 5 81 mm s 1 indicating that the decrease in stomatal conductance prevented water loss at high temperatures yue et al 2019 the monthly α had a high correlation with gc at an r2 of 0 85 whereas daily α increased nonlinearly with an increase in gc for the alpine meadow for the period 2014 2019 fig 11 this is consistent with the results of other studies in different ecosystems such as grasslands in the united states wilson and baldocchi 2000 tropical forests in brazil marques et al 2020 croplands in china lei and yang 2010 grasslands in the loess plateau of china yue et al 2019 mixed plantations in north china tong et al 2017 and the alpine steppes ma et al 2015 and meadows in the tp gu et al 2008 when gc was less than15 mm s 1 the daily α increased rapidly however α only gradually increased when gc exceeded 15 mm s 1 indicating that α was insensitive to gc in the alpine meadow when gc was larger than 15 mm s 1 these results indicated that gc may have strongly influenced et when gc was lower than the threshold value 15 mm s 1 the threshold was approximately 13 mm s 1 for alpine steppe in the tp ma et al 2015 and 16 mm s 1 in irrigated croplands ding et al 2013 lei and yang 2010 there was a positive correlation between daily ω and α fig 12 similar to that of plantations tong et al 2017 and polar coppice zenone et al 2015 the mean daily ω was 0 71 during the growing season indicating that et was less coupled with vpd values of ω were less than 0 5 during the non growing season which indicated that et might be affected by gc and vpd coupling the α ranged from 0 44 to 0 62 with an average value of 0 56 during the non growing seasons table 3 the low values during the non growing seasons indicated that the alpine meadow was in a water limited state high values of α greater than1 0 during the growing seasons showed that the alpine meadow was energy limited on the seasonal scale higher et is usually associated with higher gc yue et al 2020 generally gc can be influenced by the changes in the vpd soil moisture and photosynthetic capacity ma et al 2015 the gc decreased as the vpd increased during the growing season fig 13 similar to that in semiarid grasslands krishnan et al 2012 yue et al 2019 alpine steppes ma et al 2015 forests marques et al 2020 zhu et al 2014 and plantations geng et al 2020 when the swc was less than 0 15 m3 m 3 α ranged from 0 23 to 0 65 and the ndvi was lower than 0 25 fig 14 the α increased substantially when the swc exceeded 0 15 m3 m 3 and became insensitive to swc when it was higher than 0 35 m3 m 3 this demonstrates that there was sufficient water to supply et in addition α increased with an increase in ndvi indicating that plant growth may significantly impact α et when the ndvi was lower less than 0 3 during the non growing season α was insensitive to the ndvi a positive relationship was also observed between gc and the ndvi the gc increased with an increase in ndvi indicating that vegetation growth was considerably influenced by gc fig 15 4 3 relationship between et and precipitation the ratio of et p is generally used as an index reflecting how efficiently the ecosystem utilizes the incoming precipitation krishnan et al 2012 the annual et p ranged from 0 99 to 1 6 with an average of 1 24 for 2014 2019 table 3 this was higher than that for semiarid grassland in the loess plateau 1 10 yue et al 2019 grazed mongolian steppe 0 6 li et al 2007 and alpine meadows 0 88 gu et al 2005 and alpine steppes in the tp 1 06 ma et al 2015 it was also similar to the values for caatinga in the semiarid region of brazil da silva et al 2017 during the growing season the annual et p was 1 08 whereas it was 3 4 during the non growing season the ratio of p et0 varied from 0 62 2018 to 1 01 2019 averaging 0 77 this suggests that the alpine meadow is water limited in particular et and et0 were lower than precipitation as there were only 250 days with valid data in 2019 potentially creating large uncertainties for et and et0 values the difference in et p between the growing and non growing seasons was significant this was primarily attributable to measurement errors as the rain gauge could not capture snow in winter the annual et exceeding precipitation resulted in a continuous decrease in soil water storage however the inter annual variations in soil water were low cv 5 indicating the presence of an external water input in fact there were dense carpets of short grass over alpine meadows that were able to retain soil moisture the thawing of frozen ground and mountain snowpacks provided sufficient water for et despite the precipitation being lower than et during the study period 4 4 comparisons with other studies in the tp the diurnal variation patterns of energy fluxes are consistent with those of other ecosystems in the tp yan et al 2017 yao et al 2011 the energy fluxes had seasonal patterns similar to those in wetlands steppes and alpine meadows in the tp gu et al 2005 ma et al 2015 shang et al 2015 yan et al 2020 yao et al 2008 le was the primary energy consumer during the growing season whereas h played a major role during the non growing season previous studies have validated this pattern using in situ measurements and remote sensing models ma et al 2015 this study found that daily et was primarily affected by rn which was similar to the findings for alpine meadows in the southeastern zou et al 2018 and northeastern tp zhang et al 2018 however this result differed from that of the alpine kobresia meadow grasslands and alpine steppe ecosystems in the tp gu et al 2005 hu et al 2009 ma et al 2015 gu et al 2005 analyzed the seasonal patterns of energy partitioning revealing that vegetation phenology and soil moisture were the main factors that controlled et during the growing season in the alpine meadow hu et al 2009 suggested that lai was the primary factor affecting et in grasslands ma et al 2015 suggested that et is generally controlled by water supply in the alpine steppe this divergence from previous results was primarily due to vegetation type and topographical differences 5 conclusions this study conducted multiyear in situ observations of energy fluxes and et using the ec technique over a typical alpine meadow in the northeastern tp seasonal and inter annual variations in energy partitioning were primarily driven by h during the non growing season whereas le was the primary consumer of available energy during the growing season daily et exhibited distinct seasonal patterns with peaks ranging from 5 4 to 5 87 mm d 1 in july the ratio of et p varied from 0 99 to 1 6 averaging 1 27 this indicated that p was mostly consumed by et et was mainly controlled by the available energy on the seasonal scale swc and ndvi played secondary roles in et variation during the non growing and growing seasons respectively all environmental variables were attributable to 66 and 95 of et during the non growing and growing seasons respectively in addition vpd and ndvi played important roles in et through their effects on canopy conductance while swc was insensitive to gc when swc was lower than 0 15 m3 m 3 or higher than 0 35 m3 m 3 a nonlinear relationship between gc and vpd was observed along with that in gc versus α the α became insensitive to gc when gc exceeded 15 mm s 1 and a positive relationship was observed between gc and ndvi et was strongly influenced by gc when gc was lower than the threshold value this study provides a detail perspective of the dynamics of et and energy fluxes and meteorological and biophysical

3024,to understand the water energy and carbon cycles in the tibetan plateau tp it is essential to estimate seasonal and inter annual variations in energy fluxes and evapotranspiration et for alpine meadow ecosystems the multiyear 2014 2019 energy fluxes and et for a typical alpine meadow at arou station northeastern tp and their environmental and biophysical controls were evaluated using the eddy covariance method in this study latent heat flux le was the dominant component of energy consumption during the growing season whereas sensible heat flux h dominated energy partitioning during the non growing season h showed the opposite trend to le while the seasonal variation of soil heat flux g was small the daily et was primarily controlled by the available energy on the seasonal scale soil water content swc and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi displayed secondary effects on et during the non growing and growing seasons respectively the inter annual et was relatively stable ranging from 562 6 to 661 9 mm coefficient of variation cv 7 4 this was slightly higher than the annual precipitation despite large variations in inter annual precipitation cv 19 9 and was most likely due to snow and frozen ground melting the cumulative et in the growing season was about 77 of the annual et there was a nonlinear increase in the daily priestley taylor coefficient α et eteq where eteq is the equilibrium evaporation with an increase in bulk surface conductance gc which was insensitive to increases in gc that exceeded 15 mm s 1 there was a good relationship between gc and ndvi this study provides insights into the driving mechanisms of long term variations in the energy partitioning and biophysical controls on et in alpine meadow ecosystems keywords energy flux evapotranspiration bulk surface conductance decoupling factor alpine meadow tibetan plateau 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a critical factor involving the water energy and carbon cycles jung et al 2010 ma et al 2015 tong et al 2017 energy fluxes are generally controlled by meteorological and biophysical processes quantifying et for various ecosystems such as grasslands yue et al 2019 wetlands yan et al 2020 croplands lei and yang 2010 and forests marques et al 2020 has improved the understanding of interactions between land surface and atmosphere et quantification is also useful to optimize land surface parameters yue et al 2019 and explore its response to climate change zhang et al 2018 as alpine ecosystems are sensitive and vulnerable to climate change zhang et al 2018 it is important to quantify et to further understand hydrological processes and elucidate the driving mechanisms of alpine ecosystems the tibetan plateau tp with an average altitude of more than 4000 m a s l has the world s highest alpine ecosystem which is sensitive to climate change owing to its fragile environment and unique geophysical location gu et al 2008 alpine grasslands account for more than 60 of the total area of the tp figure s1 among which most grasslands are dominated by alpine meadows cui and graf 2009 li et al 2013a li et al 2013b alpine meadows which are characterized by low temperatures relatively high precipitation and intense solar radiation play a critical role in reducing desertification and maintaining ecological stability gu et al 2008 ma et al 2015 alpine meadows are fragile ecosystems that are extremely sensitive to climate change sun et al 2019 and are widely distributed in the northeastern and southeastern tp zhang et al 2018 therefore quantifying et in an alpine meadow is essential to assist in comprehensively understanding soil vegetation atmosphere interactions and hence develop sustainable water resource management practices ma et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 although several studies have focused on et for alpine meadows in the tp chen et al 2021 gu et al 2008 li et al 2013a li et al 2013b sun et al 2019 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 most were short term studies consisting of less than a year or only a few days of observations this limited dataset only provides partial insights into the dynamics of energy fluxes and et in alpine meadows although some studies used long term data for exploring the drivers on et for alpine meadow during the growing season wang et al 2020 drivers on et during the non growing season were neglected and the lysimeter method was used which may result in greater uncertainty than the eddy covariance ec method several studies have also quantified et using remote sensing models reanalysis data and land surface models in the tp han et al 2021 li et al 2015 sun et al 2020 however the substantial uncertainties associated with et estimation i e input data and model parameters still exist in addition the magnitude of controls on et varies with vegetation type and timescale williams et al 2012 zheng et al 2016 owing to the large spatial heterogeneity of climates and different land covers across the tp there is no consensus on whether energy or water limits et in the alpine meadow under different climatic conditions for example some studies suggest that energy rather than soil moisture limited et for the alpine kobresia gu et al 2005 2008 and humid alpine meadows on an annual scale zhang et al 2018 other studies inferred that et was controlled by water in the alpine meadow steppe liu et al 2009 hu et al 2009 proposed that the canopy stomatal conductance controlled et at the diurnal scale whereas leaf area index lai was the dominant factor controlling et at the seasonal and annual scales these varying conclusions highlight the importance of quantifying the seasonal and inter annual variations in energy fluxes and et and their driving forces for alpine meadows based on long term and high frequency flux measurements located in the northeastern area of the tp the heihe river basin hrb is the second largest inland endorheic basin in northwest china the heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research hiwater project was launched in 2012 and has provided abundant meteorological and ec data with important progress being made li et al 2013a li et al 2013b nearly 70 of the total river runoff is generated from the upper reaches of the hrb which promotes social and economic development in the middle and lower reaches of the hrb gao et al 2016 alpine meadow is the major ecosystem in the upper reaches of the hrb gao et al 2016 sun et al 2019 these data provide us an opportunity to better understand the eco hydrological processes of an alpine meadow ecosystem many studies have evaluated et variations or energy exchanges through observation sun et al 2019 remote sensing models tian et al 2013 wang et al 2013 and hydrological models gao et al 2016 li et al 2011 in the upper reaches of the hrb sun et al 2019 used a boosted regression trees based method to analyze the flux exchanges of the alpine meadow ecosystem which suggested that it is energy limited wang et al 2013 derived daily et by using the penman monteith equation and modis lai dataset and found that it can provide reliable et estimation in arid and cold regions tian et al 2013 estimated et using an extended three temperature 3 t model in the hrb and found that the 3 t model can produce satisfactory results at large scales li et al 2011 simulated et with two hydrological models and demonstrated that the results calculated for both models were comparable gao et al 2016 developed a distributed ecohydrological model to simulate hydrological processes in the upper reaches of the hrb and found that et was controlled by water availability in regions with elevations lower than 3200 m these studies provide valuable insights for the study of et in the hrb however many studies using short term observation data collected over periods of less than two years which is difficult to analyze the inter annual variation in et moreover few studies have analyzed et controlling factors using remote sensing and hydrological models in the upper reaches of the hrb using abundant meteorological and ec data this study quantified et variations both seasonal and inter annual and clarified the controlling factors for an alpine meadow ecosystem in hrb this study used 6 year ec measurements and meteorological data to address three objectives 1 investigate seasonal and inter annual variations in energy fluxes and et for the alpine meadow 2 quantify the meteorological and biophysical controls on et for the alpine meadow in the tp and 3 explore whether energy or water restricts et variability based on long term observations these results will improve the understanding of the driving mechanisms of meteorological and biophysical controls on et in alpine meadows 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site arou 38 05on 100 46oe 3033 m a s l is located in the upper reaches of hrb at the northeastern edge of the tp china fig 1 due to the fragile environment and complex terrain it is difficult to obtain long term and continuous data in the tp although the area ratio of alpine meadows with an elevation less than 3500 m a s l in the tp is about 12 the arou site is an ideal study site for exploring the eco hydrological processes of alpine meadow which has long term and continuous data from the hiwater project this region is characterized by a typical continental alpine climate with extensive snow cover and frozen ground che et al 2019 the land cover is alpine meadow dominated by elymus nutans with some intermixing of roegneria nutans sun et al 2019 the canopy height is between 0 2 and 0 3 m during the growing season the soil is sandy loam with silt loam near the surface and sandy soil in the deeper layers che et al 2019 the average annual temperature and precipitation are 0 4 c and 438 mm respectively zhou et al 2018 with the precipitation primarily occurring from may to september this period was also defined as the growing season the maximum lai at the arou site is approximately 6 5 sun et al 2019 2 2 meteorological and ec measurements meteorological and energy flux measurements were obtained at the alpine meadow site from 2014 to 2019 the open path ec system was installed 3 5 m above the surface and consisted of a three dimensional 3d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific usa and an open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500a i cor usa ec measurements included wind direction wind speed m s 1 virtual temperature c standard deviation of lateral wind speed m s 1 water vapor g m 3 and carbon dioxide molar

environmental variables included air temperature c relative humidity wind speed m s 1 and direction pressure hpa precipitation mm four radiation components w m 2 soil heat flux w m 2 soil temperature c and soil moisture all data were measured at 30 min intervals precipitation was measured using a tilting bucket rain gauge due to the tilting bucket rain gauge not being an accurate and direct measure of snow in winter the precipitation in winter may have been underestimated further details are provided in che et al 2019 and the datasets can be downloaded for free online https data tpdc ac

corrections included spike removal coordinate rotation frequency response correction sonic virtual temperature correction and corrections for density fluctuation webb pearman leuning wpl correction data quality controls marked with 2 were removed data were discarded when precipitation occurred within 1 h or the friction velocity was less than 0 1 m s 1 liu et al 2011 the reddyproc package was used to fill missing turbulence data wutzler et al 2018 the relationship between turbulent fluxes h le and available energy rn g is shown in fig 2 these turbulent fluxes exhibited a high correlation with available energy the linear correlation was higher during the non growing season r2 0 86 than that during the growing season r2 0 83 the regression line slopes for the non growing season growing season and entire year were 0 79 0 94 and 0 89 respectively this demonstrates that the turbulent fluxes had a high correlation with available energy the energy balance closure ratio ebr ranged from 0 81 to 1 15 with a mean value of 0 98 indicating that the eddy flux data were reliable table 1 during the growing season the ebr was 0 94 whereas it was 1 01 during the non growing season this energy imbalance was primarily due to systematic errors missing turbulent capture and heat storage pardo et al 2015 energy imbalance generally exists in alpine meadows chang et al 2018 gu et al 2005 and hence it is essential to address this issue prior to calculating et therefore the correction method in twine et al 2000 was applied the daily et wwere calculated using le λ where λ is the latent heat of vaporization of water due to the lack of lai measurements the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was used to explore the influence of vegetation on bulk surface conductance gc the ndvi was extracted from the mod13q1 product with a 16 day temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 250 m https lpdaac usgs gov products mod13q1v006 2 4 parameter calculation the daily reference

to 1 when ω is approximately 1 et is primarily controlled by available energy and the surface is completely decoupled from overhead conditions when ω is approximately 0 et is principally controlled by stomatal conductance and vpd leading to strong coupling between the surface and the external boundary jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 the priestley taylor coefficient α defined as the ratio of observed le

eq δ γ δ le r n g when α 1 et is controlled by the available energy due to a sufficient water supply when α less than 1 et is primarily controlled by the water supply this typically occurs in arid and semiarid ecosystems tian et al 2017 2 5 statistical analysis ridge regression was used to analyze the influence of environmental variables on et for avoiding multicollinearity between explanatory variables path analysis was used to explore the direct and indirect effects of environmental variables coffman and maccallum 2005 additionally linear and nonlinear regressions among the energy fluxes and meteorological and biophysical factors were conducted statistical analysis was carried out using matlab r2016a math works inc and spss 16 0 spss inc software 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions fig 3 illustrates the daily meteorological conditions during the study period the mean annual rg was 190 w m 2 ranging from 185 5 to 193 9 w m 2 and its daily variations exhibited similar trends each year the variations in ta and vpd exhibited similar seasonal patterns to that of rg increasing from winter to mid summer and decreasing thereafter the daily average ta during the study period was 0 11 c the lowest ta occurred in january whereas the highest primarily occurred in july the annual vpd ranged from 0 25 to 0 28 kpa with an average of 0 26 kpa the soil water content swc at a depth of 10 40 cm increased rapidly when precipitation occurred and then decreased suddenly after precipitation events the daily swc at a depth of 10 40 cm remained high due to recharge from frequent rainfall during the growing season the daily swc variations at 60 cm depth varied from 0 05 to 0 12 m3 m 3 the annual precipitation exhibited large inter annual variability and precipitation primarily occurred during the growing seasons the maximum daily precipitation occurred in 2019 at 61 6 mm 3 2 diurnal and seasonal variations in energy fluxes fig 4 presents the diurnal cycles of energy fluxes during the non growing and growing seasons the average diurnal energy fluxes were similar peaking at approximately 13 00 except for the soil heat flux during the non growing and growing seasons the average diurnal rn reached a peak of 291 7 and 462 2 w m 2 during the non growing and growing seasons at 13 00 respectively the diurnal variations in soil heat flux exhibited an s curve with a small value compared to that of the other energy fluxes the diurnal g reached its peak at 2 and 1 h after rn reached its peak during the non growing and growing seasons respectively g was the lowest with means of 0 1 and 2 4 w m 2 during the non growing and growing seasons respectively the average diurnal variations in turbulent fluxes h and le peaked between 12 00 and 13 00 decreasing at 18 00 the mean h was the highest at 18 7 w m 2 amounting to 48 7 of rn during the non growing season the average h was higher than the le during the daytime whereas the average le was higher than h at night during the non growing season the mean h increased rapidly during the daytime and decreased at night during the non growing season the le increased quickly during the growing season the mean le was the major form of energy consumption amounting to 77 3 of rn during the growing season the diurnal le was consistently greater than the diurnal h during the growing season fig 5 presents the daily behaviors of energy fluxes rn h le and g and the bowen ratio β for 2014 2019 in order to examine the seasonal patterns of energy partitions all energy fluxes exhibited clear seasonal trends fig 5a and 5b the daily rn and le increased sharply at the beginning of the growing season with increasing temperature and vegetation sprouting while the daily rn and le decreased rapidly at the end of the growing season with decreasing temperature and withering vegetation the daily h exhibited an opposite trend to that of le the daily g had a similar seasonal trend to that of rn while its variation was small fig 5b the daily rn ranged from 34 58 to 201 21 w m 2 with an average of 69 12 w m 2 and peaked in july the daily g ranged from 22 4 to 21 84 w m 2 with an average of 1 04 w m 2 the daily g increased significantly from march and its values became positive indicating that the soil developed into an energy sink it then decreased rapidly at the end of the growing season because of low temperature and freezing soil fig 5a in winter the daily g was generally negative and its fluctuation was small indicating that the soil was an energy source the g rn ratio was less than 4 4 during the non growing season and g consumed 2 3 of the rn during the growing season table 2 the g rn ratio ranged from 0 4 to 3 9 averaging at 1 7 during the study period at the annual scale the le exhibited distinct seasonal patterns similar to those of rn the ratio of le rn exceeded 78 7 during the growing season indicating that the le was the major consumer of available energy while le constituted 37 4 54 5 of rn during the non growing season the seasonal variations in h and β were almost opposite to those of le h was an important energy component during the non growing season and amounted to 55 9 of rn while it amounted to approximately 13 9 to 22 4 of rn during the growing season the β was typically less than 0 32 during the growing season whereas it varied from 0 98 to 3 05 during the non growing season the h and β were high prior to the growth of vegetation and with an increase in temperature and vegetation sprouting in may h and β gradually declined fig 5a c 3 3 seasonal variations in et the variations in monthly et et0 and precipitation are shown in fig 6 the monthly et increased from january peaked in july and then decreased gradually the seasonal variations in et were similar to those of et0 with a high correlation of 0 96 the highest monthly et occurred in july 112 2 124 4 mm and was similar to the highest et0 92 9 103 3 mm during the study period the monthly precipitation reached its peak in july or august providing sufficient water for vegetation precipitation occurred simultaneously with a high et during the growing season there were 16 months in which the monthly et was higher than the precipitation during the growing season monthly et and precipitation were strongly correlated during the study period r2 0 77 the monthly et et0 ratio ranged from 0 89 to 1 27 averaging 1 15 during the growing season however there were large differences between et and et0 during the non growing season fig 6 this was because low temperature and limited soil moisture led to lower et and a high rn led to high et0 for example the et et0 was 0 49 during the non growing season in 2016 and the monthly et et0 was the lowest in december differences between et and et0 during the non growing season in 2016 were greater than those in other years as there were only 27 precipitation days during the non growing season in 2016 this limited the available water and resulted in lower et 3 4 inter annual variations in energy and evapotranspiration the cumulative et and et0 for 2014 2019 are presented in table 3 the annual et of the alpine meadow varied from 562 6 to 661 9 mm averaging 602 5 mm the annual precipitation ranged from 400 8 to 662 1 mm with an average of 485 1 mm et during the growing season accounted for 68 80 7 of annual et in the period 2014 2019 although there were considerable inter annual variations in precipitation coefficient of variation cv 19 9 the variations in annual et were relatively small cv 7 4 in the alpine meadow this implies that the annual et had small inter annual variations compared with that of annual precipitation the inter annual variations in et during the growing season were also low with a cv of 3 36 whereas the inter annual variations in precipitation were relatively large cv 16 differences between the annual et and et0 were less than 9 for the period 2014 2019 although annual precipitation fluctuated by 248 5 mm inter annual variations in et were less than 86 9 mm 3 5 seasonal variations in bulk surface parameters seasonal variations in ga gc α β and ω were investigated fig 7 to clarify the importance of biological controls on et monthly ga varied insignificantly during the study period ranging from 10 32 to 14 87 mm s 1 with a mean of 12 54 mm s 1 fig 7a the gc has been considered a biophysical indicator of et influenced by lai and the leaf level stomatal conductance igarashi et al 2015 geng et al 2020 the daily gc varied from 0 21 to 26 04 mm s 1 averaging 2 74 mm s 1 during the non growing season the maximum gc ranged from 21 15 mm s 1 2016 to 29 24 mm s 1 2019 with a mean maximum of 26 88 mm s 1 during the growing season the monthly gc was higher during the growing season than during the non growing season fig 7b the monthly values for α were greater than 1 0 due to sufficient water supply during the growing season fig 7c this indicates that the available energy rather than the water supply controlled et at the alpine meadow during the growing season the monthly values of α ranged from 0 42 to 0 71 with an average of 0 55 during the non growing season this suggests that the water supply limited and significantly affected et during the non growing season the monthly β varied from 1 66 to 5 49 during the non growing season fig 7d indicating that more energy returned to the atmosphere with h being the dominant form of energy flux the average monthly β was 0 38 during the growing season indicating that the le was the major form of energy consumption due to abundant precipitation the seasonal pattern of ω was similar to that of gc the monthly ω ranged from 0 61 to 0 8 during the growing season and was higher than that during the non growing season this indicates that et was primarily dependent on available energy during the growing season fig 7e during the non growing season the average monthly ω was 0 31 suggesting that et was primarily dependent on water supply to analyze the relationship between ω and et the frequency of ω and the average daily et were calculated at an interval of 0 1 for ω fig 8 the proportion of ω that was less than 0 5 was 54 86 implying that et was primarily coupled with the vpd at the annual scale however et was primarily controlled by available energy during the growing season the frequency distribution peaked when ω was 0 1 0 2 accounting for 20 2 of the total the et increased with ω within 0 0 9 the magnitude of et peaked when ω was 0 8 0 9 a sudden decline in et occurred when ω was greater than 0 9 4 discussion 4 1 environmental factors et is considered a multivariate phenomenon due to various environmental and meteorological variables ding et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 the ridge regression between et and environmental variables revealed that all environmental variables could be attributable to 66 and 95 of the variations in et during the non growing and growing seasons respectively table 4 except for wind speed all environmental variables had significant effects on et during the study period swc exhibited a negative effect on et during the growing season whereas it showed a significant positive effect on et during the non growing season rn vpd and ta produced positive influences on et during the study period the ndvi played an important role in the daily et variation during the growing season moreover path analysis was conducted to explore the direct and indirect effects of meteorological factors on et during the growing and non growing seasons fig 9 this analysis indicated that rn had a significant direct influence on et followed by ndvi and vpd the standard coefficient of the total effect of rn was 0 84 0 77 0 46 0 15 which was much larger than that of ndvi 0 25 0 48 0 15 0 18 and vpd 0 15 fig 9a the indirect effect of ta 0 75 0 15 0 11 was larger than its direct effect 0 04 on et the swc showed a negative indirect effect on et while the standard coefficient of u was indirectly positive during the growing season rn and swc showed primary and secondary direct influences on et during the non growing season while the direct effect of the vpd was small and negative fig 9b overall the daily et was much more strongly controlled by rn during the study period while swc and ndvi played secondary roles during the non growing and growing seasons respectively the monthly et was primarily driven by the monthly rn during the non growing and growing seasons followed by ta and vpd fig 10 during the non growing season the monthly et decreased with an increasing monthly swc when the swc exceeded 20 where more soil moisture existed before and after the growing season contrastingly the monthly et increased when the swc was lower than 15 during the growing season et primarily comprised of transpiration which mainly originated from soil moisture in the shallow soil layer as this study used soil moisture at 0 60 cm depth it may not be representative of the actual soil moisture affected by transpiration hence the relationship between the monthly et and monthly swc was weak and insignificant during the growing season this was similar to that observed in a template of douglas fir stands jassal et al 2009 and a mixed plantation tong et al 2017 overall et was primarily determined by the available energy at daily and seasonal scales vegetation growth and soil moisture played secondary roles in et variation during the growing and non growing seasons respectively 4 2 biophysical controls on et the mean annual gc for the alpine meadow was 5 84 mm s 1 which was higher than that for the alpine steppe in the tp ma et al 2015 although considerably lower than that of the alpine meadow with kobresia humilis during the growth period gu et al 2005 this result may be attributed to the large spatial heterogeneity of vegetation coverage the average gc during the growing season in 2016 was the lowest 5 81 mm s 1 indicating that the decrease in stomatal conductance prevented water loss at high temperatures yue et al 2019 the monthly α had a high correlation with gc at an r2 of 0 85 whereas daily α increased nonlinearly with an increase in gc for the alpine meadow for the period 2014 2019 fig 11 this is consistent with the results of other studies in different ecosystems such as grasslands in the united states wilson and baldocchi 2000 tropical forests in brazil marques et al 2020 croplands in china lei and yang 2010 grasslands in the loess plateau of china yue et al 2019 mixed plantations in north china tong et al 2017 and the alpine steppes ma et al 2015 and meadows in the tp gu et al 2008 when gc was less than15 mm s 1 the daily α increased rapidly however α only gradually increased when gc exceeded 15 mm s 1 indicating that α was insensitive to gc in the alpine meadow when gc was larger than 15 mm s 1 these results indicated that gc may have strongly influenced et when gc was lower than the threshold value 15 mm s 1 the threshold was approximately 13 mm s 1 for alpine steppe in the tp ma et al 2015 and 16 mm s 1 in irrigated croplands ding et al 2013 lei and yang 2010 there was a positive correlation between daily ω and α fig 12 similar to that of plantations tong et al 2017 and polar coppice zenone et al 2015 the mean daily ω was 0 71 during the growing season indicating that et was less coupled with vpd values of ω were less than 0 5 during the non growing season which indicated that et might be affected by gc and vpd coupling the α ranged from 0 44 to 0 62 with an average value of 0 56 during the non growing seasons table 3 the low values during the non growing seasons indicated that the alpine meadow was in a water limited state high values of α greater than1 0 during the growing seasons showed that the alpine meadow was energy limited on the seasonal scale higher et is usually associated with higher gc yue et al 2020 generally gc can be influenced by the changes in the vpd soil moisture and photosynthetic capacity ma et al 2015 the gc decreased as the vpd increased during the growing season fig 13 similar to that in semiarid grasslands krishnan et al 2012 yue et al 2019 alpine steppes ma et al 2015 forests marques et al 2020 zhu et al 2014 and plantations geng et al 2020 when the swc was less than 0 15 m3 m 3 α ranged from 0 23 to 0 65 and the ndvi was lower than 0 25 fig 14 the α increased substantially when the swc exceeded 0 15 m3 m 3 and became insensitive to swc when it was higher than 0 35 m3 m 3 this demonstrates that there was sufficient water to supply et in addition α increased with an increase in ndvi indicating that plant growth may significantly impact α et when the ndvi was lower less than 0 3 during the non growing season α was insensitive to the ndvi a positive relationship was also observed between gc and the ndvi the gc increased with an increase in ndvi indicating that vegetation growth was considerably influenced by gc fig 15 4 3 relationship between et and precipitation the ratio of et p is generally used as an index reflecting how efficiently the ecosystem utilizes the incoming precipitation krishnan et al 2012 the annual et p ranged from 0 99 to 1 6 with an average of 1 24 for 2014 2019 table 3 this was higher than that for semiarid grassland in the loess plateau 1 10 yue et al 2019 grazed mongolian steppe 0 6 li et al 2007 and alpine meadows 0 88 gu et al 2005 and alpine steppes in the tp 1 06 ma et al 2015 it was also similar to the values for caatinga in the semiarid region of brazil da silva et al 2017 during the growing season the annual et p was 1 08 whereas it was 3 4 during the non growing season the ratio of p et0 varied from 0 62 2018 to 1 01 2019 averaging 0 77 this suggests that the alpine meadow is water limited in particular et and et0 were lower than precipitation as there were only 250 days with valid data in 2019 potentially creating large uncertainties for et and et0 values the difference in et p between the growing and non growing seasons was significant this was primarily attributable to measurement errors as the rain gauge could not capture snow in winter the annual et exceeding precipitation resulted in a continuous decrease in soil water storage however the inter annual variations in soil water were low cv 5 indicating the presence of an external water input in fact there were dense carpets of short grass over alpine meadows that were able to retain soil moisture the thawing of frozen ground and mountain snowpacks provided sufficient water for et despite the precipitation being lower than et during the study period 4 4 comparisons with other studies in the tp the diurnal variation patterns of energy fluxes are consistent with those of other ecosystems in the tp yan et al 2017 yao et al 2011 the energy fluxes had seasonal patterns similar to those in wetlands steppes and alpine meadows in the tp gu et al 2005 ma et al 2015 shang et al 2015 yan et al 2020 yao et al 2008 le was the primary energy consumer during the growing season whereas h played a major role during the non growing season previous studies have validated this pattern using in situ measurements and remote sensing models ma et al 2015 this study found that daily et was primarily affected by rn which was similar to the findings for alpine meadows in the southeastern zou et al 2018 and northeastern tp zhang et al 2018 however this result differed from that of the alpine kobresia meadow grasslands and alpine steppe ecosystems in the tp gu et al 2005 hu et al 2009 ma et al 2015 gu et al 2005 analyzed the seasonal patterns of energy partitioning revealing that vegetation phenology and soil moisture were the main factors that controlled et during the growing season in the alpine meadow hu et al 2009 suggested that lai was the primary factor affecting et in grasslands ma et al 2015 suggested that et is generally controlled by water supply in the alpine steppe this divergence from previous results was primarily due to vegetation type and topographical differences 5 conclusions this study conducted multiyear in situ observations of energy fluxes and et using the ec technique over a typical alpine meadow in the northeastern tp seasonal and inter annual variations in energy partitioning were primarily driven by h during the non growing season whereas le was the primary consumer of available energy during the growing season daily et exhibited distinct seasonal patterns with peaks ranging from 5 4 to 5 87 mm d 1 in july the ratio of et p varied from 0 99 to 1 6 averaging 1 27 this indicated that p was mostly consumed by et et was mainly controlled by the available energy on the seasonal scale swc and ndvi played secondary roles in et variation during the non growing and growing seasons respectively all environmental variables were attributable to 66 and 95 of et during the non growing and growing seasons respectively in addition vpd and ndvi played important roles in et through their effects on canopy conductance while swc was insensitive to gc when swc was lower than 0 15 m3 m 3 or higher than 0 35 m3 m 3 a nonlinear relationship between gc and vpd was observed along with that in gc versus α the α became insensitive to gc when gc exceeded 15 mm s 1 and a positive relationship was observed between gc and ndvi et was strongly influenced by gc when gc was lower than the threshold value this study provides a detail perspective of the dynamics of et and energy fluxes and meteorological and biophysical
