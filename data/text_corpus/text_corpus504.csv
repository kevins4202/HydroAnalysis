2520,floating canopies with unanchored roots are often distributed in streams and wetlands which alters the evolution of the flow velocity inside the canopy interiors based on the flow continuity equation and layer averaged momentum equations an analytical model was proposed to predict the velocity evolution through floating canopies under unidirectional flow laboratory experiments showed that the velocity evolution within the canopy interior was impacted by the mean channel velocity canopy density and ratio of the height of the free flow region below the floating canopy to the flow depth inside a floating canopy the flow adjustment distance xd was defined as the distance from the canopy leading edge to the position at which the velocity decreased to a constant value a new estimator of xd was proposed and validated for floating canopies the shear parameter c 0 076 0 025 was determined and used to characterize the vertical momentum exchange between the in canopy and below canopy flows the velocities of the proposed model predicted using the new estimator xd and shear parameter c were in good agreement with fourteen groups of measurements from different sources the vegetation rigidity and flexibility had a weak influence on the flow velocity evolution inside the floating canopy this indicated that the proposed model was capable of accurately predicting the velocity evolution through floating canopies of vegetation in addition the proposed model can be applied to predict the velocity evolution inside the root zones of floating vegetation islands fvis compared to that of the drag of the root zones the influence of the drag of the floating island on the velocity evolution inside the root zones was negligible keywords floating canopy velocity evolution analytical model flow adjustment distance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in streams and wetlands floating canopies play an important role in river ecosystems as they alter the flow velocity evolution and the transport process of suspended particles e g hartstein and stevens 2005 huai and li 2016 liu et al 2022 o donncha et al 2015 plew 2010 strohmeier et al 2005 tseung et al 2016 under appropriate environmental and climate conditions floating vegetation blooms may cover the entire water surface for example eichhornia crassipes is a tropical invasive free floating macrophyte originating in south america that widely grows in east china southeast asia the southeast united states europe etc e g downing kunz and stacey 2011 downing kunz and stacey

crassipes has strong fecundity so its biomass increases rapidly under appropriate environmental conditions its roots are connected forming a strong network so it remains stable under unidirectional current flow specifically root networks occur when the density of e crassipes surpasses 1 1 0 2 m 1 downing kunz and stacey 2011 e crassipes canopies can completely cover the water surfaces of ditches and streams fig 1 e g goeden and andrés 1999 stohlgren et al 2013 van driesche and abell 2008 floating vegetation impacts the flow structure and velocity distribution within and below the root zone e g huai et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 specifically the flow velocity within floating roots is reduced due to vegetation drag but the velocity between the channel bed and roots is enhanced due to flow continuity e crassipes can improve water quality by removing heavy metals nitrogen and phosphorus through its roots e g ai et al 2020 fu et al 2021 fu et al 2020 liu et al 2019 qiao et al 2022 the biological uptake efficiency of the floating roots of e crassipes is affected by mass transfer processes and hydrodynamic flow interactions within and below the floating roots e g downing kunz and stacey 2011 downing kunz and stacey 2012 the difference between the velocities within and below a floating canopy or roots forms a shear layer at the bottom of the canopy if the shear is sufficiently strong kelvin helmholtz vortices kh vortices occur and drive momentum exchange between the in canopy and below canopy flows abdelrhman 2007 cheng et al 2019 plew 2010 plew et al 2006 the complicated flow structure inside and below a floating canopy may impact the transport and diffusion of pollutants and sediment which may further impact the bed morphology thus it is important to understand the evolution of flow velocity through a floating canopy in an open channel the influence of a floating canopy on the flow structure is similar to the influence of a submerged canopy for both scenarios vegetation decreases in canopy velocities producing a shear layer associated with vertical momentum exchange at the interface of the canopy and free flow due to the velocity difference between the in canopy and free flows previous studies have proposed some models for predicting the velocity evolution within submerged canopies chen et al 2013 huthoff et al 2007 lei and nepf 2021 huai et al 2021 liu and shan 2022 for example chen et al 2013 proposed an exponential model to predict the velocity evolution inside a submerged canopy but their model overestimated the measured velocity for a dense canopy this likely occurred because the exponential model excluded the influence of turbulent shear stress at the top of the canopy to compensate for this weakness lei and nepf 2021 recently proposed a two layer model to estimate the evolution of flow velocity through a submerged canopy which included the influence of the turbulent shear stress on in canopy flow however the boundary conditions between the submerged and floating scenarios are different which lead to different flow structures and velocity distributions fig s1 in the supporting information specifically for a submerged canopy the bed drag is much smaller than the vegetation drag so the influence of the bed drag on in canopy flow was ignored e g ghisalberti and nepf 2004 however for a floating canopy case the free stream flow below the canopy is not only influenced by the canopy but also restricted by the channel bed plew 2010 bed drag significantly alters the vertical profile of velocity below the floating canopy fig 2 b due to the different force balances between the submerged and floating canopy cases the predictive models for velocity evolution in submerged canopies e g chen et al 2013 lei and nepf 2021 cannot be directly used for floating canopies therefore the main goal of this study is to propose a new model for predicting the velocity evolution inside floating vegetation canopies many studies have focused on the ecological impact of floating canopies on stream and wetland environments and the hydrodynamics in a channel with a floating canopy have been investigated flume experiments e g plew 2010 huai et al 2012 were performed to investigate the vertical distribution of the flow velocity within and below a floating canopy due to vegetation drag the flow entering the floating canopy is deflected from the canopy to the below canopy region as the distance from the canopy leading edge x 0 increases the in canopy flow decelerates and the velocity below the canopy accelerates until new force balances form for the flows inside and below the canopy the flow adjustment distance xd is defined as the distance from the canopy leading edge to the position at which the in canopy velocity decreases to a constant beyond xd if the shear layer at the canopy bottom is sufficiently strong kh vortices start to form and the local reynolds shear stress is significantly enhanced ai et al 2020 yu et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 fu et al 2020 the penetration distance into the canopy δe is defined as the vertical distance from the canopy bottom z hg to the in canopy position where the reynolds shear stress decreases to 10 of its peak value at the canopy bottom it was reported that δe is inversely proportional to the canopy drag δ e c d a 1 nepf et al 2007 nepf and vivoni 2000 plew 2010 for a submerged canopy lei and nepf 2021 reported that δe is limited by the canopy height hc and the water depth above the canopy h hc and δe can be estimated by 1 δ e min 0 23 0 06 c d a h h c h c we use this idea to estimate the penetration distance for a floating canopy we examine eq 1 to determine whether it is appropriate for use on a floating canopy for a channel with floating vegetation some analytical models e g bai et al 2022 fu et al 2021 huai et al 2012 zhang et al 2022 have been proposed to predict the vertical and transverse profiles of velocities in the fully developed flow region x xd but they cannot predict the velocity profiles in the flow adjustment region x 0 to xd in an open channel a floating vegetation canopy alters the flow velocity distribution within and below the canopy which may further impact the transport process of suspended sediment and organics to understand the influence of a floating canopy on the flow velocity it is important to have a method to predict the velocity evolution through an entire floating canopy but there is no such analytical model to fill this knowledge gap this study proposes an analytical model to estimate the evolution of the in canopy flow velocity through an entire floating canopy the proposed model does not include a calibration parameter and all input parameters can be obtained from flow and vegetation conditions which is advantageous for its application we first introduce the theory in section 2 the experimental methods are shown in section 3 the published data for model validation are summarized in section 4 sections 5 and 6 present the experimental results and model verification respectively finally the sensitivity analysis of the parameters and model application are discussed in section 7 2 theory this study investigated velocity evolution through a floating canopy that does not move on the water surface of an open channel shown as e crassipes fig 1 as current flow encounters a fixed floating canopy the flow is deflected vertically from the floating canopy to the region below the canopy decreasing the in canopy velocity h z hg and increasing the velocity below the canopy h g z 0 within and around a floating canopy the flow is preliminarily adjusted in the streamwise and vertical directions x and z respectively forming a two dimensional flow fig 2a and b a two layer model is proposed to characterize the two dimensional flow in which the mean velocities within u c x and below ub x the canopy are assumed to be vertically uniform fig 2c for a channel with a floating canopy the flow continuity equation is 2 u c x h c 1 ϕ u b x h g u 0 h the momentum equations within and below the floating canopy are eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 ρ u c x u c x x w c x u z c h c ρ g h c h x ρ c d a h

long 1 m wide and 0 5 m high straight recirculating flume with a horizontal channel bed the flow discharge was measured by a flowmeter the flow depth was controlled by the tailgate and measured by rulers upstream and downstream of the test section a steady uniform flow was achieved when the flow depth over the test section differed within 0 3 cm 1 of the flow depth in this study the flow depth ranged from 22 5 to 33 0 cm the mean channel velocity u 0 varied between 9 3 and 17 3 cm s which matched the favorable flow velocity 2 to 20 cm s for the growth of e crassipes as observed in taihu lake china approximately 4 to 20 cm s li et al 2007 and a pond in escondido ca usa approximately 2 to 16 cm s downing kunz and stacey 2011 for all cases the flow was subcritical with a froude number fr u 0 g h of 0 05 to 0 11 and was turbulent with a reynolds number re u 0 r ν with the kinematic viscosity ν 0 01 cm2 s of 13 200 to 23 900 preliminary experiments confirmed that the flow was fully developed and that the velocity was laterally uniform before entering the test section rigid cylinders were staggered and glued into 1 cm thick polyvinyl chloride pvc boards the pvc boards were fixed above the water surface and the cylinders were placed downward to simulate floating roots the wooden rigid cylinder had a diameter of 0 8 cm which was within the observed range for 2 6 month old e crassipes d 0 1 to 1 5 cm as reported in downing kunz and stacey 2011 downing kunz and stacey 2012 zhao et al 2012 real roots at the canopy leading edge may slightly bend in response to downward flow deflection and other roots farther from the leading edge may suspend freely in the water for the same solid volume fraction the floating rigid cylinder array creates a porous structure similar to the floating roots of e crassipes two plant densities were considered for model canopies n 0 020 and 0 035 plants cm2 the frontal area per canopy volume a nd values were 1 6 and 2 8 m 1 respectively which was consistent with the observed range a 1 0 to 3 0 m 1 for e crassipes in the field downing kunz and stacey 2011 downing kunz and stacey 2012 center and spencer 1981 in this study the model canopy was 4 m long and 1 m wide the canopy and flume had the same width such that flow adjustment did not occur in the lateral direction instead flow adjustment in the vertical direction occurred within the canopy leading edge xd x 0 in all cases the submerged height of the model floating canopy remained the same i e hc 14 cm which matched the root length 6 to 15 cm of 2 6 month old e crassipes downing kunz and stacey 2011 downing kunz and stacey 2012 penfound and earle 1948 because the parameters for model canopies are similar to the values in the field this study achieved a full scale investigation the height of the free flow region below the canopy hg was defined as the distance from the channel bed z 0 to the bottom of the floating canopy z hg which was calculated from hg h h c however real roots are flexible and reconfigurable with increasing velocity which may reduce the submerged height of the roots and impact the velocity evolution within the interior of a floating canopy thus the effect of rigid and flexible vegetation on velocity evolution within a canopy interior is discussed in section 7 3 the experimental parameters are summarized in table 1 note that we measured only the flow adjustment distance xd in cases a1 a8 3 2 velocity measurement the coordinate system is shown in fig 2 x y and z denote the streamwise lateral and vertical directions respectively x 0 represents the leading edge of the floating canopy y 0 represents the centerline of the canopy and flume z 0 represents the surface of the channel bed the corresponding velocity components are defined as u x y z u v w the velocities were measured by a nortek acoustic doppler velocimetry adv system equipped with a downward looking probe in each case the vertical profile of velocity was measured at x 300 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 and 350 cm measurements confirmed that the velocity at the middle canopy depth differed from the depth averaged velocity within the canopy uc 1 h c h g h u d z by less than 8 indicating that the velocity at the middle canopy depth was the same as the canopy depth averaged velocity thus the velocity was measured along the centerline of the canopy and at the middle depth of the canopy z hg hc 2 to capture the possibly sharp variation in velocity within the flow adjustment region the interval between two neighboring x positions was set to 20 to 30 cm in the flow adjustment region x 0 to xd depending on the canopy density and height and 50 cm in the fully developed region x xd to l within each canopy the velocity was measured at y 0 y dy 8 and y dy 8 in a characteristic region at each x position where dy is the lateral spacing between two side by side neighboring cylinders fig 2a with a larger canopy density n 0 035 plants cm2 cases 1 to 4 had a smaller dy 11 6 cm while for cases 5 to 8 n 0 020 plants cm2 dy 21 4 cm for cases 1 to 8 the longitudinal spacing dx between two adjacent cylinders remained the same with dx 5 8 cm the 4 m long model canopy consisted of 8 pvc boards and each board was 1 m long and 47 cm wide these boards were placed side by side along the channel centerline and a gap region 5 cm between two boards was created to place the downside looking adv probe appropriately without removing cylinders fig s2 in si the adv probe was placed vertically and at the same position relative to neighboring cylinders to account for the impact of spatial flow heterogeneity on velocity measurements the mean of the three velocities was considered the spatial mean velocity at each position the velocity was recorded for 120 s at a frequency of 50 hz raw data with correlations less than 75 and a signal to noise ratio smaller than 15 db were removed the remaining velocity spikes were filtered using the method of goring and nikora 2002 matlab code was used to decompose the filtered instantaneous velocities into time average components denoted u v and w and fluctuating components denoted u v and w for rigid cylinders the drag coefficient can be estimated from the method of etminan et al 2017 who included the impact of flow constriction by adjacent cylinders on flow velocity the constricted velocity within the canopy was defined as u c u c x 1 2 ϕ π etminan et al 2017 and the drag coefficient cd was estimated from the stem reynolds number r ec u c d ν white 1991 14 c d 1 10 r ec 2 3 for all cases cd rigid 1 0 to 1 2 for flexible vegetation the drag coefficient can be estimated from the method of ellington 1991 15 c d f l e x i b l e 1 95 50 r e w where the reynolds number of the flexible blades was r e w u c x w b ν and w b was the width of the blades assuming that the blade width was the same as the cylinder diameter the drag coefficient of the flexible canopy cd flexible 2 0 to 2 1 estimated by eq 15 was greater than the cd rigid 1 0 to 1 2 of the rigid canopy however the proposed model is insensitive to the drag coefficient cd thus for simplicity it is reasonable to use cd 1 in the following prediction see the details in section 7 5 the bed shear stress coefficient cb was determined from the method proposed by liu and shan 2019 the bed shear stress τb was considered the same as the near bed reynolds shear stress τxz ρ u w very close to the channel bed e g z 1 cm the bed shear stress was estimated from the measured τb and u 0 using c b τ b ρ u 0 2 using this method cb 0 003 0 001 for the channel bed to quantitatively compare the predicted and measured velocities the root mean square error rmse was defined 16 rmse 1 n i 1 n u c m x u c p x 2 where n is the number of measurements and predictions and u c m x and u c p x are the measured and predicted velocities respectively 4 data from the literature to verify the proposed model data from plew 2010 and zhao et al 2017 were used the two studies reported the mean channel velocity u 0 the depth averaged velocity within the canopy uc and the depth averaged velocity beneath the canopy ub over a wide range of canopy densities a 1 0 3 2 m 1 and relative flow depths h g h 0 2 0 7 in the two studies velocities were measured at the centerline of the floating canopy but only in the fully developed flow region although the experimental setups of these studies were described in detail in their papers a brief introduction of each study is given herein for convenience the experimental parameters used in these studies are summarized in table 2 first plew 2010 performed two series of experiments in open channels with floating canopies which were composed of aluminum cylinders with a diameter of d 0 95 cm two cases from the first series of experiments were chosen to verify the proposed model denoted pn1 to pn2 in table 2 the velocities were measured in a 12 m long 0 75 m wide flume with a slope of s 0 0014 the floating canopies were 5 1 m long and had the same width as the channel the frontal area per canopy volume was a 1 0 m 1 and the relative flow depth h g h varied between 0 2 and 0 4 next three cases in the second series of experiments were chosen for model verification denoted rn1 to rn3 in table 2 the experiments were conducted using particle tracking velocimetry ptv in a 6 m long and 0 6 m wide flume each floating canopy occupied the entire test section of the channel with a frontal area per canopy volume of a 1 0 to 1 9 m 1 for these cases the relative flow depth was constant h g h 0 5 for all five cases the bed shear stress coefficient was estimated from c b τ b ρ u b 2 where the bed shear stress τb was estimated from the vertical profile of the reynolds shear stress close to the channel bed second zhao et al 2017 conducted the experiment in a 20 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 5 m deep flume with a bed slope of s 0 001 in this case denoted zn1 in table 2 the flow depth was h 36 cm and the mean channel velocity was u 0 12 cm s the floating canopy was constructed with rigid plexiglass cylinders with a diameter of d 0 8 cm the canopy was 8 m long and 0 6 m wide with a frontal area per canopy volume of a 3 2 m 1 the submerged height of the rigid cylinders was hc 11 cm thus the height of the free flow region below the canopy was h g 25 cm yielding h g h 0 7 5 experimental results as the flow entered the canopy it was deflected vertically from the canopy interior to the region below the canopy such that the velocity decreased within the flow adjustment distance inside the canopy the flow adjustment distance xd was defined as the distance from the canopy leading edge to the position at which the velocity inside the canopy decreased to a constant e g fig 3 a if the canopy length l was shorter than xd the velocity decreased within the entire canopy for a submerged canopy lei and nepf 2021 reported that the flow adjustment distance normalized by canopy height xd hc was a function of canopy density 1 cdahc and relative flow depth h hc h using this idea for a floating canopy the scaling analysis suggested that the flow adjustment distance normalized by the canopy height xd hc was related to the canopy density 1 cdahc and the relative flow depth hg h the scaling analysis shown in the si using the xd measured from 16 cases in this study table 1 the predictive equation for xd was determined by linear fitting r2 0 91 17 x d h c 2 8 3 4 1 c d a h c 3 7 h g h 2 eq 17 was used to estimate xd for each floating canopy so the flow adjustment region xd x 0 and fully developed flow region x xd could be identified in which equations 9 and 13 were used to predict the in canopy velocities respectively the impacts of mean channel velocity u 0 relative flow depth h g h and frontal area per canopy volume a on velocity evolution within the canopy interior were examined fig 3 for the same relative flow depth and canopy frontal area the mean channel velocity had a negligible influence on the velocity evolution through the two canopies specifically for u 0 16 8 0 3 cm s case 1 and 13 3 0 2 cm s case 2 the measured velocity normalized by the mean channel velocity uc x u 0 collapsed onto the same line fig 3a next for the same relative flow depth h g h a greater vegetation density canopy frontal area a provided greater vegetation drag and thus produced a smaller normalized in canopy velocity fig 3b in addition the relative flow depth affected the velocity evolution for the same canopy frontal area a a lower relative flow depth h g h produced a larger normalized velocity fig 3c for example the normalized velocities in case 4 with h g h 0 4 red squares were on average 25 greater than those in case 2 with h g h 0 6 orange triangles this occurred because a greater h g h suggested a larger free flow area below the canopy so more water went below the canopy and less water went through the canopy resulting in a smaller normalized velocity inside the canopy the slow in canopy flow and fast free stream flow generated a shear layer at the bottom of the canopy fig 4 a shows the vertical profile of the normalized reynolds shear stress u w u 0 2 in the fully developed flow region case 3 x 250 cm xd 200 cm the reynolds shear stress was maximized at the bottom of the canopy to express the shear stress the shear parameter c x was defined to characterize vertical momentum exchange between the in canopy and below canopy flows specifically the shear stress at the canopy bottom was 18 τ h g x ρ c x u b x u c x 2 the reynolds shear stress measured at the canopy bottom τ h g x and the mean velocities within uc x and below the canopy ub x were used to calculate the c x value in fig 4b for all cases the shear parameter c x decreased rapidly with the canopy leading edge x xd 0 5 possibly due to the vertical diverging flow in which the shear layer has not yet formed beyond x xd 0 5 the shear layer started to form at the canopy bottom such that c x gradually increased between x xd 0 5 and 1 when the flow was fully developed a steady shear layer formed such that c x remained constant within uncertainty fig 4b except for very few points at the canopy leading edge the other points through entire floating canopies could be represented by the mean c 0 076 0 025 fig 4b in addition the value of c had a negligible influence on the predicted velocity evolution see the details in section 7 1 so it is reasonable to use the mean c value in the following calculation 6 model validation first the experimental data from this study table 1 were used to verify the proposed model fig 5 compares the measured and predicted velocity evolution values within the canopy interior u 0 9 3 17 3 cm s h g h 0 4 0 6 a 1 6 and 2 8 m 1 the red dashed lines represent the propagated uncertainty in c cb and u 0 the predicted longitudinal profiles of the in canopy velocity were in good agreement with the measurements fig 5 for all cases the rmse u 0 between the predicted and measured velocities was less than 6 next data from the literature plew 2010 zhao et al 2017 were used to verify the new model table 2 the two studies measured velocity only in the fully developed flow region inside the canopies thus we had one point for each case to verify the model for wider flow and vegetation conditions u 0 8 4 34 1 cm s h g h 0 2 0 7 a 1 0 3 2 m 1 the proposed model reproduced the velocity evolution for the floating canopy cases of plew 2010 and zhao et al 2017 with an rmse u 0 0 4 to 10 8 fig 6 fig 6f shows a sharp velocity decrease at the canopy leading edge because the large plant density a 3 2 m 1 produced a shorter flow adjustment distance xd table 2 within the canopy compared to the other five canopies a 1 0 1 9 m 1 overall the good agreement between the prediction and measurement indicates that the proposed model eq 9 and 13 can predict the velocity evolution within a floating canopy 7 discussion 7 1 shear parameter c for a floating canopy the shear parameter c represents the strength of the shear layer between the in canopy and below canopy layers so how it is determined may impact the predicted velocity evolution within the canopy eqs 9 and 13 plew 2010 suggested that c 0 04 in eq 18 which is slightly smaller than the value c 0 076 0 025 obtained in this study possibly because plew 2010 considered a smaller frontal area per canopy volume a 0 5 to 1 9 m 1 than this study a 1 6 and 2 8 m 1 for a submerged canopy because the flow within and above the canopy also exhibited a two layer pattern e g chen et al 2013 huthoff et al 2007 konings et al 2012 luhar and nepf 2013 murphy et al 2007 the shear parameter c for submerged canopies was used for comparison the shear parameter c was estimated by 19 c k c δ e h 1 3 where kc is an empirical constant chen et al 2013 suggested that kc 0 07 0 02 for submerged canopies to examine the influence of the c value on the predicted velocity evolution case 2 h 33 cm u 0 13 3 0 2 cm s cb 0 003 and a 2 8 m 1 was taken as an example three c values were considered c 0 076 eq 18 0 048 eq 19 and 0 04 plew 2010 and all other parameters were fixed the predicted velocity evolution had a weak dependence on the c values fig 7 when c increased by approximately twofold from 0 04 to 0 076 the rmse u 0 between the predicted and measured velocities only decreased from 7 to 3 suggesting that the proposed model eqs 9 and 13 was insensitive to the c value however c 0 076 was suggested because this value was obtained using the data in the floating canopy cases 7 2 interior flow adjustment distance x d for a submerged canopy lei and nepf 2021 suggested that xd hc is a function of cdahc and h hc h 2 and thus proposed an estimator for xd hc 20 x d h c 3 4 2 5 1 c d a h c 3 3 h h c h 2 herein hc was the height of a submerged canopy in this study we proposed an equation for predicting xd for a floating canopy see eq 17 the two methods eqs 17 and 20 were used to predict xd and the predictions are compared in fig 8 as expected the estimator of xd in this study performs better than that of lei and nepf 2021 specifically the difference between the prediction of eq 17 and the measured xd was 5 on average which was smaller than the difference between the predictions of eq 20 and the measurements 28 on average for the same channel velocity canopy height flow depth and plant density the estimator for a submerged canopy underestimated xd relative to that for a floating canopy this is because the same channel velocity plant density and canopy height produced the same in canopy velocity for both submerged and floating canopies but the mean velocity above a submerged canopy was greater than the mean velocity below a floating canopy due to the contribution of bed drag thus the momentum exchange at the top of a submerged canopy was stronger than that at the bottom of a floating canopy resulting in quicker flow development and thus a shorter flow adjustment distance within the submerged canopy due to different flow processes between submerged and floating canopies the estimator of flow adjustment distance for a submerged canopy eq 20 may not be suitable for a floating canopy 7 3 effect of rigid and flexible vegetation on velocity evolution real vegetation is generally flexible and bends in response to flow so the effect of rigid and flexible vegetation on velocity evolution needs to be discussed we do not have experimental data for floating vegetation to examine the influence of vegetation flexibility on velocity so we used velocity measurements collected in submerged canopies with rigid cylinders and flexible plants this is feasible because the vegetation drag associated with flexibility is the main contributor to the velocity reduction within both submerged and floating canopies the velocity measurements from case ln1 rigid cylinders and case ln2 flexible plants in lei and nepf 2021 were taken as examples table 3 the two cases were chosen because they had almost the same nondimensional canopy density ahc 0 88 for case ln1 with the height of the rigid canopy hc and ahd 0 80 for case ln2 with the deflected height of the flexible canopy hd and flow conditions u 0 6 5 cm s h 36 cm the longitudinal profiles of velocity through rigid and flexible canopies collapsed with respect to each other and the measured flow adjustment distance within a submerged canopy xd m was equal within a reasonable degree of uncertainty the two dashed lines in fig 9 indicating that vegetation flexibility has a negligible influence on velocity evolution fig 9 note that the reconfiguration of plants may occur primarily at the canopy leading edge with a large velocity and the same canopy height hc for a rigid canopy and hd for a flexible canopy and vegetation density canopy frontal area a can produce the same velocity evolution within the canopy interior this suggests that the proposed model can be used for not only floating rigid canopies but also flexible canopies 7 4 model application the proposed model is further applied in predicting the velocity evolution inside the root zones of a floating vegetation island fvi the floating mat of an fvi fixed the plants with flexible roots suspended in the water forming a porous structure that allowed flow through the roots roots at the leading edge of an fvi may bend due to vertical flow deflection however the reconfiguration of roots does not have a significant influence on velocity evolution because velocity distributions through flexible and rigid canopies are almost the same see section 7 3 and fig 9 the treatment efficiency of an fvi is related to velocity inside root zones in canopy velocity which is similar to the focus of this study the difference between a floating canopy and an fvi is that an fvi has additional bed friction from the floating island however the bed friction is sufficiently small relative to the drag of the root zone so the bed friction is generally ignored in general the root zone of an fvi has a frontal area per root volume of a 1 6 to 2 5 m 1 downing kunz and stacey 2012 liu et al 2019 and the friction coefficient of a floating island is cf 0 003 to 0 009 wang et al 2019 the floating island bed drag ρ c f u c x 2 obtained was 2 to 8 of the drag produced by the root zone ρ c d a h c 2 1 ϕ u c x 2 indicating that the bed drag term of the island is negligible to further examine the effect of the bed drag of a floating island on velocity prediction we derived the governing equation for an fvi based on eq 3 21 ρ u c x u c x x w c x u z c h c ρ g h c h x ρ c d a h c 2 1 ϕ u c x 2 ρ c u b x u c x 2 ρ c f u c x 2 following the same steps as those in section 2

and 18 respectively we took case 1 u 0 16 8 0 3 cm s h 33 cm cb 0 003 and a 2 8 m 1 as an example the bed friction coefficient cf 0 006 was chosen based on the range of cf 0 003 to 0 009 for the general materials of floating islands because the difference between the predicted velocities of eq 9 c f 0 and eq 22 c f 0 006 was only 1 the bed friction of the floating island had a negligible influence on the predicted velocity evolution fig 10 thus it is reasonable to use eq 9 to predict the velocity evolution inside the root zone of an fvi next eq 9 was used to predict the velocity evolution inside a root zone of the fvi based on the experimental data of yu et al 2019 table 4 fig 11 shows that the velocity evolution predicted by eq 9 matched measurements with an rmse u 0 7 9 indicating that the proposed model was also valid for predicting velocity evolution inside the root zone of an fvi 7 5 sensitivity analysis of c d the impact of the drag coefficient c d on the predicted velocity evolution is discussed in cases 1 to 8 table 1 the minimum velocity in the fully developed flow region of cylinder arrays was ucf 5 8 cm s yielding u cf u cf 1 2 ϕ π 6 3 cm s and thus the reynolds number rec u cf d ν 504 resulting in the maximum cd rigid 1 2 for rigid canopies estimated from eq 14 if cases 1 to 8 had flexible canopies with the same canopy height frontal area and flow conditions the maximum drag coefficient increased to cd flexible 2 1 estimated from eq 15 using rew 464 for a higher flow velocity greater u 0 the reconfiguration of flexible roots produced a smaller deflected canopy height hd and nondimensional density ahd and thus a greater in canopy velocity a greater rew yielding a smaller cd thus a wider range of cd 1 2 was chosen to examine the sensitivity of the proposed model eq 9 to the cd value fig 12 we considered case 5 h 33 cm c 0 076 0 025 cb 0 003 and a 1 6 m 1 as an example in the fully developed flow region e g x 350 cm the in canopy velocity difference between cd 1 and 2 was 0 7 cm s which was comparable to the measured uncertainty 0 4 cm s this finding indicates that it is reasonable to use cd 1 in the proposed model 8 conclusion laboratory experiments were performed to examine the velocity evolution inside a floating canopy in an open channel with different mean channel velocities canopy densities and relative flow depths inside floating canopies the flow adjustment distance xd was defined as the distance between the canopy leading edge and the position at which the in canopy velocity decreased to a constant which was a function of the canopy density 1 cdahc and the relative flow depth hg h a new estimator of xd was proposed and validated eq 17 to quantify the vertical momentum exchange between in canopy

2520,floating canopies with unanchored roots are often distributed in streams and wetlands which alters the evolution of the flow velocity inside the canopy interiors based on the flow continuity equation and layer averaged momentum equations an analytical model was proposed to predict the velocity evolution through floating canopies under unidirectional flow laboratory experiments showed that the velocity evolution within the canopy interior was impacted by the mean channel velocity canopy density and ratio of the height of the free flow region below the floating canopy to the flow depth inside a floating canopy the flow adjustment distance xd was defined as the distance from the canopy leading edge to the position at which the velocity decreased to a constant value a new estimator of xd was proposed and validated for floating canopies the shear parameter c 0 076 0 025 was determined and used to characterize the vertical momentum exchange between the in canopy and below canopy flows the velocities of the proposed model predicted using the new estimator xd and shear parameter c were in good agreement with fourteen groups of measurements from different sources the vegetation rigidity and flexibility had a weak influence on the flow velocity evolution inside the floating canopy this indicated that the proposed model was capable of accurately predicting the velocity evolution through floating canopies of vegetation in addition the proposed model can be applied to predict the velocity evolution inside the root zones of floating vegetation islands fvis compared to that of the drag of the root zones the influence of the drag of the floating island on the velocity evolution inside the root zones was negligible keywords floating canopy velocity evolution

stacey 2011 downing kunz and stacey 2012 the difference between the velocities within and below a floating canopy or roots forms a shear layer at the bottom of the canopy if the shear is sufficiently strong kelvin helmholtz vortices kh vortices occur and drive momentum exchange between the in canopy and below canopy flows abdelrhman 2007 cheng et al 2019 plew 2010 plew et al 2006 the complicated flow structure inside and below a floating canopy may impact the transport and diffusion of pollutants and sediment which may further impact the bed morphology thus it is important to understand the evolution of flow velocity through a floating canopy in an open channel the influence of a floating canopy on the flow structure is similar to the influence of a submerged canopy for both scenarios vegetation decreases in canopy velocities producing a shear layer associated with vertical momentum exchange at the interface of the canopy and free flow due to the velocity difference between the in canopy and free flows previous studies have proposed some models for predicting the velocity evolution within submerged canopies chen et al 2013 huthoff et al 2007 lei and nepf 2021 huai et al 2021 liu and shan 2022 for example chen et al 2013 proposed an exponential model to predict the velocity evolution inside a submerged canopy but their model overestimated the measured velocity for a dense canopy this likely occurred because the exponential model excluded the influence of turbulent shear stress at the top of the canopy to compensate for this weakness lei and nepf 2021 recently proposed a two layer model to estimate the evolution of flow velocity through a submerged canopy which included the influence of the turbulent shear stress on in canopy flow however the boundary conditions between the submerged and floating scenarios are different which lead to different flow structures and velocity distributions fig s1 in the supporting information specifically for a submerged canopy the bed drag is much smaller than the vegetation drag so the influence of the bed drag on in canopy flow was ignored e g ghisalberti and nepf 2004 however for a floating canopy case the free stream flow below the canopy is not only influenced by the canopy but also restricted by the channel bed plew 2010 bed drag significantly alters the vertical profile of velocity below the floating canopy fig 2 b due to the different force balances between the submerged and floating canopy cases the predictive models for velocity evolution in submerged canopies e g chen et al 2013 lei and nepf 2021 cannot be directly used for floating canopies therefore the main goal of this study is to propose a new model for predicting the velocity evolution inside floating vegetation canopies many studies have focused on the ecological impact of floating canopies on stream and wetland environments and the hydrodynamics in a channel with a floating canopy have been investigated flume experiments e g plew 2010 huai et al 2012 were performed to investigate the vertical distribution of the flow velocity within and below a floating canopy due to vegetation drag the flow entering the floating canopy is deflected from the canopy to the below canopy region as the distance from the canopy leading edge x 0 increases the in canopy flow decelerates and the velocity below the canopy accelerates until new force balances form for the flows inside and below the canopy the flow adjustment distance xd is defined as the distance from the canopy leading edge to the position at which the in canopy velocity decreases to a constant beyond xd if the shear layer at the canopy bottom is sufficiently strong kh vortices start to form and the local reynolds shear stress is significantly enhanced ai et al 2020 yu et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 fu et al 2020 the penetration distance into the canopy δe is defined as the vertical distance from the canopy bottom z hg to the in canopy position where the reynolds

this idea to estimate the penetration distance for a floating canopy we examine eq 1 to determine whether it is appropriate for use on a floating canopy for a channel with floating vegetation some analytical models e g bai et al 2022 fu et al 2021 huai et al 2012 zhang et al 2022 have been proposed to predict the vertical and transverse profiles of velocities in the fully developed flow region x xd but they cannot predict the velocity profiles in the flow adjustment region x 0 to xd in an open channel a floating vegetation canopy alters the flow velocity distribution within and below the canopy which may further impact the transport process of suspended sediment and organics to understand the influence of a floating canopy on the flow velocity it is important to have a method to predict the velocity evolution through an entire floating canopy but there is no such analytical model to fill this knowledge gap this study proposes an analytical model to estimate the evolution of the in canopy flow velocity through an entire floating canopy the proposed model does not include a calibration parameter and all input parameters can be obtained from flow and vegetation conditions which is advantageous for its application we first introduce the theory in section 2 the experimental methods are shown in section 3 the published data for model validation are summarized in section 4 sections 5 and 6 present the experimental results and model verification respectively finally the sensitivity analysis of the parameters and model application are discussed in section 7 2 theory this study investigated velocity evolution through a floating canopy that does not move on the water surface of an open channel shown as e crassipes fig 1 as current flow encounters a fixed floating canopy the flow is deflected vertically from the floating canopy to the region below the canopy decreasing the in canopy velocity h z hg and increasing the velocity below the canopy h g z 0 within and around a floating canopy the flow is preliminarily adjusted in the streamwise and vertical directions x and z respectively forming a two dimensional flow fig 2a and b a two layer model is proposed to

long 1 m wide and 0 5 m high straight recirculating flume with a horizontal channel bed the flow discharge was measured by a flowmeter the flow depth was controlled by the tailgate and measured by rulers upstream and downstream of the test section a steady uniform flow was achieved when the flow depth over the test section differed within 0 3 cm 1 of the flow depth in this study the flow depth ranged from 22 5 to 33 0 cm the mean channel velocity u 0 varied between 9 3 and 17 3 cm s which matched the favorable flow velocity 2 to 20 cm s for the growth of e crassipes as observed in taihu lake china approximately 4 to 20 cm s li et al 2007 and a pond in escondido ca usa approximately 2 to 16 cm s downing kunz and stacey 2011 for all cases the flow was subcritical with a froude number fr u 0 g h of 0 05 to 0 11 and was turbulent with a reynolds number re u 0 r ν with the kinematic viscosity ν 0 01 cm2 s of 13 200 to 23 900 preliminary experiments confirmed that the flow was fully developed and that the velocity was laterally uniform before entering the test section rigid cylinders were staggered and glued into 1 cm thick polyvinyl chloride pvc boards the pvc boards were fixed above the water surface and the cylinders were placed downward to simulate floating roots the wooden rigid cylinder had a diameter of 0 8 cm which was within the observed range for 2 6 month old e crassipes d 0 1 to 1 5 cm as reported in downing kunz and stacey 2011 downing kunz and stacey 2012 zhao et al 2012 real roots at the canopy leading edge may slightly bend in response to downward flow deflection and other roots farther from the leading edge may suspend freely in the water for the same solid volume fraction the floating rigid cylinder array creates a porous structure similar to the floating roots of e crassipes two plant densities were considered for model canopies n 0 020 and 0 035 plants cm2 the frontal area per canopy volume a nd values were 1 6 and 2 8 m 1 respectively which was consistent with the observed range a 1 0 to 3 0 m 1 for e crassipes in the field downing kunz and stacey 2011 downing kunz and stacey 2012 center and spencer 1981 in this study the model canopy was 4 m long and 1 m wide the canopy and flume had the same width such that flow adjustment did not occur in the lateral direction instead flow adjustment in the vertical direction occurred within the canopy leading edge xd x 0 in all cases the submerged height of the model floating canopy remained the same i e hc 14 cm which matched the root length 6 to 15 cm of 2 6 month old e crassipes downing kunz and stacey 2011 downing kunz and stacey 2012 penfound and earle 1948 because the parameters for model canopies are similar to the values in the field this study achieved a full scale investigation the height of the free flow region below the canopy hg was defined as the distance from the channel bed z 0 to the bottom of the floating canopy z hg which was calculated from hg h h c however real roots are flexible and reconfigurable with increasing velocity which may reduce the submerged height of the roots and impact the velocity evolution within the interior of a floating canopy thus the effect of rigid and flexible vegetation on velocity evolution within a canopy interior is discussed in section 7 3 the experimental parameters are summarized in table 1 note that we measured only the flow adjustment distance xd in cases a1 a8 3 2 velocity measurement the coordinate system is shown in fig 2 x y and z denote the streamwise lateral and vertical directions respectively x 0 represents the leading edge of the floating canopy y 0 represents the centerline of the canopy and flume z 0 represents the surface of the channel bed the corresponding velocity components are defined as u x y z u v w the velocities were measured by a nortek acoustic doppler velocimetry adv system equipped with a downward looking probe in each case the vertical profile of velocity was measured at x 300 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 and 350 cm measurements confirmed that the velocity at the middle canopy depth differed from the depth averaged velocity within the canopy uc 1 h c h g h u d z by less than 8 indicating that the velocity at the middle canopy depth was the same as the canopy depth averaged velocity thus the velocity was measured along the centerline of the canopy and at the middle depth of the canopy z hg hc 2 to capture the possibly sharp variation in velocity within the flow adjustment region the interval between two neighboring x positions was set to 20 to 30 cm in the flow adjustment region x 0 to xd depending on the canopy density and height and 50 cm in the fully developed region x xd to l within each canopy the velocity was measured at y 0 y dy 8 and y dy 8 in a characteristic region at each x position where dy is the lateral spacing between two side by side neighboring cylinders fig 2a with a larger canopy density n 0 035 plants cm2 cases 1 to 4 had a smaller dy 11 6 cm while for cases 5 to 8 n 0 020 plants cm2 dy 21 4 cm for cases 1 to 8 the longitudinal spacing dx between two adjacent cylinders remained the same with dx 5 8 cm the 4 m long model canopy consisted of 8 pvc boards and each board was 1 m long and 47 cm wide these boards were placed side by side along the channel centerline and a gap region 5 cm between two boards was created to place the downside looking adv probe appropriately without removing cylinders fig s2 in si the adv probe was placed vertically and at the same position relative to neighboring cylinders to account for the impact of spatial flow heterogeneity on velocity measurements the mean of the three velocities was considered the spatial mean velocity at each position the velocity was recorded for 120 s at a frequency of 50 hz raw data with correlations less than 75 and a signal to noise ratio smaller than 15 db were removed the remaining velocity spikes were filtered using the method of goring and nikora 2002 matlab code was used to decompose the filtered instantaneous velocities into time average components denoted u v and w and fluctuating components denoted u v and w for rigid cylinders the drag coefficient can be estimated from the method of etminan et al 2017 who included the impact of flow constriction by adjacent cylinders on flow velocity the constricted velocity within the canopy was defined as u c u c x 1 2 ϕ π etminan et al 2017 and the drag coefficient cd was estimated from the stem reynolds number r ec u c d ν white 1991 14 c d 1 10 r ec 2 3 for all cases cd rigid 1 0 to 1 2 for flexible vegetation the drag coefficient can be estimated from the method of ellington 1991 15 c d f l e x i b l e 1 95 50 r e w where the reynolds number of the flexible blades was r e w u c x w b ν and w b was the width of the blades assuming that the blade width was the same as the cylinder diameter the drag coefficient of the flexible canopy cd flexible 2 0 to 2 1 estimated by eq 15 was greater than the cd rigid 1 0 to 1 2 of the rigid canopy however the proposed model is insensitive to the drag coefficient cd thus for simplicity it is reasonable to use cd 1 in the following prediction see the details in section 7 5 the bed shear stress coefficient cb was determined from the method proposed by liu and shan 2019 the bed shear stress τb was considered the same as the near bed reynolds shear stress τxz ρ u w very close to the channel bed e g z 1 cm the bed shear stress was estimated from the measured τb and u 0 using c b τ b ρ u 0 2 using this method cb 0 003 0 001 for the channel bed to quantitatively compare the predicted and measured velocities the root mean square error rmse was defined 16 rmse 1 n i 1 n u c m x u c p x 2 where n is the number of measurements and predictions and u c m x and u c p x are the measured and predicted velocities respectively 4 data from the literature to verify the proposed model data from plew 2010 and zhao et al 2017 were used the two studies reported the mean channel velocity u 0 the depth averaged velocity within the canopy uc and the depth averaged velocity beneath the canopy ub over a wide range of canopy densities a 1 0 3 2 m 1 and relative flow depths h g h 0 2 0 7 in the two studies velocities were measured at the centerline of the floating canopy but only in the fully developed flow region although the experimental setups of these studies were described in detail in their papers a brief introduction of each study is given herein for convenience the experimental parameters used in these studies are summarized in table 2 first plew 2010 performed two series of experiments in open channels with floating canopies which were composed of aluminum cylinders with a diameter of d 0 95 cm two cases from the first series of experiments were chosen to verify the proposed model denoted pn1 to pn2 in table 2 the velocities were measured in a 12 m long 0 75 m wide flume with a slope of s 0 0014 the floating canopies were 5 1 m long and had the same width as the channel the frontal area per canopy volume was a 1 0 m 1 and the relative flow depth h g h varied between 0 2 and 0 4 next three cases in the second series of experiments were chosen for model verification denoted rn1 to rn3 in table 2 the experiments were conducted using particle tracking velocimetry ptv in a 6 m long and 0 6 m wide flume each floating canopy occupied the entire test section of the channel with a frontal area per canopy volume of a 1 0 to 1 9 m 1 for these cases the relative flow depth was constant h g h 0 5 for all five cases the bed shear stress coefficient was estimated from c b τ b ρ u b 2 where the bed shear stress τb was estimated from the vertical profile of the reynolds shear stress close to the channel bed second zhao et al 2017 conducted the experiment in a 20 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 5 m deep flume with a bed slope of s 0 001 in this case denoted zn1 in table 2 the flow depth was h 36 cm and the mean channel velocity was u 0 12 cm s the floating canopy was constructed with rigid plexiglass cylinders with a diameter of d 0 8 cm the canopy was 8 m long and 0 6 m wide with a frontal area per canopy volume of a 3 2 m 1 the submerged height of the rigid cylinders was hc 11 cm thus the height of the free flow region below the canopy was h g 25 cm yielding h g h 0 7 5 experimental results as the flow entered the canopy it was deflected vertically from the canopy interior to the region below the canopy such that the velocity decreased within the flow adjustment distance inside the canopy the flow adjustment distance xd was defined as the distance from the canopy leading edge to the position at which the velocity inside the canopy decreased to a constant e g fig 3 a if the canopy length l was shorter than xd the velocity decreased within the entire canopy for a submerged canopy lei and nepf 2021 reported that the flow adjustment distance normalized by canopy height xd hc was a function of canopy density 1 cdahc and relative flow depth h hc h using this idea for a floating canopy the scaling analysis suggested that the flow adjustment distance normalized by the canopy height xd hc was related to the canopy density 1 cdahc and the relative flow depth hg h the scaling analysis shown in the si using the xd measured from 16 cases in this study table 1 the predictive equation for xd was determined by linear fitting r2 0 91 17 x d h c 2 8 3 4 1 c d a h c 3 7 h g h 2 eq 17 was used to estimate xd for each floating canopy so the flow adjustment region xd x 0 and fully developed flow region x xd could be identified in which equations 9 and 13 were used to predict the in canopy velocities respectively the impacts of mean channel velocity u 0 relative flow depth h g h and frontal area per canopy volume a on velocity evolution within the canopy interior were examined fig 3 for the same relative flow depth and canopy frontal area the mean channel velocity had a negligible influence on the velocity evolution through the two canopies specifically for u 0 16 8 0 3 cm s case 1 and 13 3 0 2 cm s case 2 the measured velocity normalized by the mean channel velocity uc x u 0 collapsed onto the same line fig 3a next for the same relative flow depth h g h a greater vegetation density canopy frontal area a provided greater vegetation drag and thus produced a smaller normalized in canopy velocity fig 3b in addition the relative flow depth affected the velocity evolution for the same canopy frontal area a a lower relative flow depth h g h produced a larger normalized velocity fig 3c for example the normalized velocities in case 4 with h g h 0 4 red squares were on average 25 greater than those in case 2 with h g h 0 6 orange triangles this occurred because a greater h g h suggested a larger free flow area below the canopy so more water went below the canopy and less water went through the canopy resulting in a smaller normalized velocity inside the canopy the slow in canopy flow and fast free stream flow generated a shear layer at the bottom of the canopy fig 4 a shows the vertical profile of the normalized reynolds shear stress u w u 0 2 in the fully developed flow region case 3 x 250 cm xd 200 cm the reynolds shear stress was maximized at the bottom of the canopy to express the shear stress the shear parameter c x was defined to characterize vertical momentum exchange between the in canopy and below canopy flows specifically the shear stress at the canopy bottom was 18 τ h g x ρ c x u b x u c x 2 the reynolds shear stress measured at the canopy bottom τ h g x and the mean velocities within uc x and below the canopy ub x were used to calculate the c x value in fig 4b for all cases the shear parameter c x decreased rapidly with the canopy leading edge x xd 0 5 possibly due to the vertical diverging flow in which the shear layer has not yet formed beyond x xd 0 5 the shear layer started to form at the canopy bottom such that c x gradually increased between x xd 0 5 and 1 when the flow was fully developed a steady shear layer formed such that c x remained constant within uncertainty fig 4b except for very few points at the canopy leading edge the other points through entire floating canopies could be represented by the mean c 0 076 0 025 fig 4b in addition the value of c had a negligible influence on the predicted velocity evolution see the details in section 7 1 so it is reasonable to use the mean c value in the following calculation 6 model validation first the experimental data from this study table 1 were used to verify the proposed model fig 5 compares the measured and predicted velocity evolution values within the canopy interior u 0 9 3 17 3 cm s h g h 0 4 0 6 a 1 6 and 2 8 m 1 the red dashed lines represent the propagated uncertainty in c cb and u 0 the predicted longitudinal profiles of the in canopy velocity were in good agreement with the measurements fig 5 for all cases the rmse u 0 between the predicted and measured velocities was less than 6 next data from the literature plew 2010 zhao et al 2017 were used to verify the new model table 2 the two studies measured velocity only in the fully developed flow region inside the canopies thus we had one point for each case to verify the model for wider flow and vegetation conditions u 0 8 4 34 1 cm s h g h 0 2 0 7 a 1 0 3 2 m 1 the proposed model reproduced the velocity evolution for the floating canopy cases of plew 2010 and zhao et al 2017 with an rmse u 0 0 4 to 10 8 fig 6 fig 6f shows a sharp velocity decrease at the canopy leading edge because the large plant density a 3 2 m 1 produced a shorter flow adjustment distance xd table 2 within the canopy compared to the other five canopies a 1 0 1 9 m 1 overall the good agreement between the prediction and measurement indicates that the proposed model eq 9 and 13 can predict the velocity evolution within a floating canopy 7 discussion 7 1 shear parameter c for a floating canopy the shear parameter c represents the strength of the shear layer between the in canopy and below canopy layers so how it is determined may impact the predicted velocity evolution within the canopy eqs 9 and 13 plew 2010 suggested that c 0 04 in eq 18 which is slightly smaller than the value c 0 076 0 025 obtained in this study possibly because plew 2010 considered a smaller frontal area per canopy volume a 0 5 to 1 9 m 1 than this study a 1 6 and 2 8 m 1 for a submerged canopy because the flow within and above the canopy also exhibited a two layer pattern e g chen et al 2013 huthoff et al 2007 konings et al 2012 luhar and nepf 2013 murphy et al 2007 the shear parameter c for submerged canopies was used for comparison the shear parameter c was estimated by 19 c k c δ e h 1 3 where kc is an empirical constant chen et al 2013 suggested that kc 0 07 0 02 for submerged canopies to examine the influence of the c value on the predicted velocity evolution case 2 h 33 cm u 0 13 3 0 2 cm s cb 0 003 and a 2 8 m 1 was taken as an example three c values were considered c 0 076 eq 18 0 048 eq 19 and 0 04 plew 2010 and all other parameters were fixed the predicted velocity evolution had a weak dependence on the c values fig 7 when c increased by approximately twofold from 0 04 to 0 076 the rmse u 0 between the predicted and measured velocities only decreased from 7 to 3 suggesting that the proposed model eqs 9 and 13 was insensitive to the c value however c 0 076 was suggested because this value was obtained using the data in the floating canopy cases 7 2 interior flow adjustment distance x d for a submerged canopy lei and nepf 2021 suggested that xd hc is a function of cdahc and h hc h 2 and thus proposed an estimator for xd hc 20 x d h c 3 4 2 5 1 c d a h c 3 3 h h c h 2 herein hc was the height of a submerged canopy in this study we proposed an equation for predicting xd for a floating canopy see eq 17 the two methods eqs 17 and 20 were used to predict xd and the predictions are compared in fig 8 as expected the estimator of xd in this study performs better than that of lei and nepf 2021 specifically the difference between the prediction of eq 17 and the measured xd was 5 on average which was smaller than the difference between the predictions of eq 20 and the measurements 28 on average for the same channel velocity canopy height flow depth and plant density the estimator for a submerged canopy underestimated xd relative to that for a floating canopy this is because the same channel velocity plant density and canopy height produced the same in canopy velocity for both submerged and floating canopies but the mean velocity above a submerged canopy was greater than the mean velocity below a floating canopy due to the contribution of bed drag thus the momentum exchange at the top of a submerged canopy was stronger than that at the bottom of a floating canopy resulting in quicker flow development and thus a shorter flow adjustment distance within the submerged canopy due to different flow processes between submerged and floating canopies the estimator of flow adjustment distance for a submerged canopy eq 20 may not be suitable for a floating canopy 7 3 effect of rigid and flexible vegetation on velocity evolution real vegetation is generally flexible and bends in response to flow so the effect of rigid and flexible vegetation on velocity evolution needs to be discussed we do not have experimental data for floating vegetation to examine the influence of vegetation flexibility on velocity so we used velocity measurements collected in submerged canopies with rigid cylinders and flexible plants this is feasible because the vegetation drag associated with flexibility is the main contributor to the velocity reduction within both submerged and floating canopies the velocity measurements from case ln1 rigid cylinders and case ln2 flexible plants in lei and nepf 2021 were taken as examples table 3 the two cases were chosen because they had almost the same nondimensional canopy density ahc 0 88 for case ln1 with the height of the rigid canopy hc and ahd 0 80 for case ln2 with the deflected height of the flexible canopy hd and flow conditions u 0 6 5 cm s h 36 cm the longitudinal profiles of velocity through rigid and flexible canopies collapsed with respect to each other and the measured flow adjustment distance within a submerged canopy xd m was equal within a reasonable degree of uncertainty the two dashed lines in fig 9 indicating that vegetation flexibility has a negligible influence on velocity evolution fig 9 note that the reconfiguration of plants may occur primarily at the canopy leading edge with a large velocity and the same canopy height hc for a rigid canopy and hd for a flexible canopy and vegetation density canopy frontal area a can produce the same velocity evolution within the canopy interior this suggests that the proposed model can be used for not only floating rigid canopies but also flexible canopies 7 4 model application the proposed model is further applied in predicting the velocity evolution inside the root zones of a floating vegetation island fvi the floating mat of an fvi fixed the plants with flexible roots suspended in the water forming a porous structure that allowed flow through the roots roots at the leading edge of an fvi may bend due to vertical flow deflection however the reconfiguration of roots does not have a significant influence on velocity evolution because velocity distributions through flexible and rigid canopies are almost the same see section 7 3 and fig 9 the treatment efficiency of an fvi is related to velocity inside root zones in canopy velocity which is similar to the focus of this study the difference between a floating canopy and an fvi is that an fvi has additional bed friction from the floating island however the bed friction is sufficiently small relative to the drag of the root zone so the bed friction is generally ignored in general the root zone of an fvi has a frontal area per root volume of a 1 6 to 2 5 m 1 downing kunz and stacey 2012 liu et al 2019 and the friction coefficient of a floating island is cf 0 003 to 0 009 wang et al 2019 the floating island bed drag ρ c f u c x 2 obtained was 2 to 8 of the drag produced by the root zone ρ c d a h c 2 1 ϕ u c x 2 indicating that the bed drag term of the island is negligible to further examine the effect of the bed drag of a floating island on velocity prediction we derived the governing equation for an fvi based on eq 3 21 ρ u c x u c x x w c x u z c h c ρ g h c h x ρ c d a h c 2 1 ϕ u c x 2 ρ c u b x u c x 2 ρ c f u c x 2 following the same steps as those in section 2 the solution to uc x was 22 f u 2 a f b f 4 c f b f 2 arctan b f 2 u 4 c f b f 2 1 2 ln u 2 b f u c f f u c x f u 0 β f α f x where αf βf af bf and cf in eq 22 are expressed as 23 α f h g 2 1 ϕ 2 h c 2 h c h g 2 a f h h c 1 ϕ h g 2 1 ϕ 2 h c 2 u 0 β f c h h g 3 1 h c ϕ h 2 c d a h c 2 1 ϕ h c h g 3 1 ϕ 2 c b c f b f 2 c h 3 1 h c ϕ h 2 h c 2 1 ϕ h c b c h 3 1 h c ϕ h 2 c d a h c h g 3 2 1 ϕ h c 3

and 18 respectively we took case 1 u 0 16 8 0 3 cm s h 33 cm cb 0 003 and a 2 8 m 1 as an example the bed friction coefficient cf 0 006 was chosen based on the range of cf 0 003 to 0 009 for the general materials of floating islands because the difference between the predicted velocities of eq 9 c f 0 and eq 22 c f 0 006 was only 1 the bed friction of the floating island had a negligible influence on the predicted velocity evolution fig 10 thus it is reasonable to use eq 9 to predict the velocity evolution inside the root zone of an fvi next eq 9 was used to predict the velocity evolution inside a root zone of the fvi based on the experimental data of yu et al 2019 table 4 fig 11 shows that the velocity evolution predicted by eq 9 matched measurements with an rmse u 0 7 9 indicating that the proposed model was also valid for predicting velocity evolution inside the root zone of an fvi 7 5 sensitivity analysis of c d the impact of the drag coefficient c d on the predicted velocity evolution is discussed in cases 1 to 8 table 1 the minimum velocity in the fully developed flow region of cylinder arrays was ucf 5 8 cm s yielding u cf u cf 1 2 ϕ π 6 3 cm s and thus the reynolds number rec u cf d ν 504 resulting in the maximum cd rigid 1 2 for rigid canopies estimated from eq 14 if cases 1 to 8 had flexible canopies with the same canopy height frontal area and flow conditions the maximum drag coefficient increased to cd flexible 2 1 estimated from eq 15 using rew 464 for a higher flow velocity greater u 0 the reconfiguration of flexible roots produced a smaller deflected canopy height hd and nondimensional density ahd and thus a greater in canopy velocity a greater rew yielding a smaller cd thus a wider range of cd 1 2 was chosen to examine the sensitivity of the proposed model eq 9 to the cd value fig 12 we considered case 5 h 33 cm c 0 076 0 025 cb 0 003 and a 1 6 m 1 as an example in the fully developed flow region e g x 350 cm the in canopy velocity difference between cd 1 and 2 was 0 7 cm s which was comparable to the measured uncertainty 0 4 cm s this finding indicates that it is reasonable to use cd 1 in the proposed model 8 conclusion laboratory experiments were performed to examine the velocity evolution inside a floating canopy in an open channel with different mean channel velocities canopy densities and relative flow depths inside floating canopies the flow adjustment distance xd was defined as the distance between the canopy leading edge and the position at which the in canopy velocity decreased to a constant which was a function of the canopy density 1 cdahc and the relative flow depth hg h a new estimator of xd was proposed and validated eq 17 to quantify the vertical momentum exchange between in canopy and below canopy flows the shear parameter c 0 076 0 025 representing vertical momentum exchange was determined for floating canopies based on the flow continuity equation and momentum equation an analytical model was proposed for predicting the velocity evolution within floating canopies fourteen groups of experimental data from this study and previous studies were used to verify the new model the predicted velocity evolution was in good agreement with the measurements indicating that the proposed model was capable of accurately predicting the velocity evolution inside floating canopies

2521,deep rooted vegetation transpires a considerable amount of deep soil water with different ages in the unsaturated zone however the tradeoffs between new water of transpiration temporally originating from post planting precipitation and old water of transpiration temporally originating from pre planting precipitation across the vegetation lifespan are poorly understood in this study we collected soil samples from beyond 28 m soil depth on the loess plateau of china to investigate the influence of deep rooted vegetation on the age of soil water and analyze the proportion of new and old water of transpiration in the unsaturated zone under grassland 22 year old apple orchard and 17 year old peach orchard water isotopes 2h 18o and 3h solutes chloride nitrate sulfate and soil water content were used to identify the critical water ages in the unsaturated zone one year water age water age corresponding to stand age and the maximum water age of transpiration and to determine soil water deficit soil evaporation loss fraction and potential groundwater recharge the results showed that soil water mainly moved as piston flow in these soil profiles and deep soil water largely came from heavy precipitation deep rooted vegetation restrained new pore water velocity and potential groundwater recharge new pore water velocity declined from 0 40 m yr 1 to 0 14 m yr 1 and 0 34 m yr 1 for apple and peach respectively deep rooted vegetation decreased groundwater recharge by 9 46 for apple and 7 04 for peach compared to grassland over the vegetation lifespan annual average transpiration was 500 56 mm yr 1 and 468 89 mm yr 1 with maximum water age of 63 years and 45 years for apple and peach respectively the transpiration of deep rooted vegetation mainly used new water 94 97 for apple and 97 47 for peach the total old water of transpiration was 553 mm for apple and 209 mm for peach our results identify the temporal sources of vegetation water use offering new insights into the transpiration process of deep rooted vegetation keywords water age transpiration deep rooted vegetation loess plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction transpiration is the largest continental water flux returning to the atmosphere representing about 80 90 of terrestrial evapotranspiration good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 and a dominant force in the global water cycle schlesinger and jasechko 2014 in the soil plant atmosphere continuum vegetation on different land use types takes up water of different ages schenk and jackson 2005 investigating the time of transpiration helps us understand water transit through the water cycle benettin et al 2021 thus studies on transpiration water age are becoming increasingly valuable especially under the situation of land use changes sprenger et al 2018 transpiration water age of vegetation is a function of travel time from roots to the atmosphere root access to water and water held in the soil sprenger et al 2019 quantifying the water age of transpiration can help us to understand which water is used by vegetation allen et al 2019 the absolute age of water taken up by vegetation varies from days to years including precipitation water originating from previous growing seasons allen et al 2019 brinkmann et al 2018 and stored soil water several decades old zhang et al 2017 overall the water age transpired by vegetation largely depends on the different water ages available in the unsaturated zone sprenger et al 2019 in the unsaturated zone multiple tracers are needed to identify water age since different tracers span different temporal scales abbott et al 2016 si and jong 2007 for example natural variations in the stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen can be used to date water from precipitation events up to 3 5 years koeniger et al 2016 similarly artificial chloride nitrate and sulfate can identify water age from the moment of fertilization tritium bulge has been used to chronicle water age in deep soils on the loess plateau in china li et al 2018 li and si 2018 meanwhile revealing the mechanism of soil water flow is necessary to interpret soil water age for tracers because it strongly depends on the flow mechanism under the assumption of piston flow the inferred ages from historical tracers could be the actual soil water age bethke and johnson 2008 therefore multiple tracers can provide ideal signals of water age under piston flow mechanism in the unsaturated zone depending on the climate and soil conditions vegetation has different root distribution and root uptake strategies to access water of different ages in arid and semiarid zones vegetation develops deep roots that can access very old water beyer et al 2016 fan et al 2017 the large consumption of old water in deep soil could break the connection between surface water and groundwater zhang et al 2018 once depleted old soil water is difficult to recharge due to correlation with deep soil water even forming a dried soil layer where soil water was deficit jia et al 2019 several studies have focused on water deficit caused by excessive vegetation transpiration markewitz et al 2010 shao et al 2021 wang et al 2011 investigating patterns of deep soil water depletion li et al 2019b markewitz et al 2010 spatial distribution and driving factors of water deficit liang et al 2022 wang et al 2011 and eco hydrological processes barua et al 2021 yang et al 2022 transpiration water age is useful for identifying which age of water is consumed recent studies found that deep rooted vegetation transpired soil water older than the stand age li et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 however few studies have quantitatively explored the temporal origin of transpiration water for deep rooted vegetation due to excessive transpiration from deep soils deep soil water deficit has been a major issue limiting water resource sustainability which often occurs on the loess plateau in china huang and shao 2019 jia et al 2020 2019 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 reported that deep rooted vegetation on the loess plateau transpired water up to several decades old considering the life cycle of perennial vegetation soil water originating from pre planting precipitation was called old water while soil water from post planting precipitation was called new water old water consumption indicates the available precipitation resources cannot meet the vegetation transpiration during the growing period tradeoffs between the new and old water consumed throughout the vegetation life cycle become important for balancing deep soil water but are rarely studied thus this study aimed to distinguish the proportions of new and old water during the life cycle transpiration of perennial deep rooted vegetation 22 year old apple orchard and 17 year old peach orchard on the loess plateau and to estimate the hydrological components affected by excessive transpiration the objectives were to 1 determine the critical water ages and their corresponding depths in the unsaturated zone 2 quantify new and old water in vegetation transpiration and 3 evaluate the hydrological compartments of new and old water in vegetation transpiration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site was in the tianhe watershed 36 39 36 40 n 109 22 109 23 e fig 1 a in the central region of the loess plateau in china the optimal area for the grain for green project geng et al 2020 the topography and landforms include ridges and gullies with varying elevations of 988 1344 m the soil layers are very thick with groundwater table deeper than 100 m zhu et al 2018 the deep loess profile comprises alternating glacial loess and interglacial paleosol the soil texture is predominantly silty silt content 60 the watershed is in a warm temperate semiarid zone with a continental monsoon climate the long term 1961 2018 average annual temperature is 10 1 c and the average annual precipitation is 543 131 mm about 70 of average annual precipitation occur between june and september the study area has undergone dramatic land use changes since the implementation of the grain for green project in 1999 economic vegetation was expanded because orchards reduce soil water erosion and increase local farmer income we chose a typical apple orchard converted from natural grassland in 1995 and a peach orchard converted from natural grassland in 2001 and nearby long term natural grassland as the control treatment fig 1b table 1 2 2 sampling and analyzing three soil cores were collected at the top platform of a hillside using a hollow stem auger to 30 m depth for the apple orchard and grassland and 28 m for the peach orchard each core was separated into 20 cm intervals soil sampling was conducted on august 1st 6th in 2017 for the apple orchard and on august 1st 15th in 2018 for the peach orchard and the grassland the soil samples were measured to determine soil water content water isotopes solute concentration chloride nitrate and sulfate and soil texture each soil sample was partitioned into three parts and placed into 1 an aluminum box for soil water content measurement through the oven drying method 24 h at 105 c 2 a plastic bottle sealed with sealing film and stored at 18 c for soil water extraction and subsequent stable isotopes and tritium measurements 3 a fiber bag for measuring solute concentration and soil texture soil clay silt and sand fractions were measured using the pipette method gee and bauder 1986 for accurate estimations of the long term soil evaporation loss fraction soil samples to a depth of at least 10 m were extracted monthly to measure soil water content and stable isotopes from june to october 2018 in addition a hand auger with an inner diameter of 85 mm was used to sample roots between the diagonals of four similar sized trees under the apple and peach orchards root samples were collected at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 3 m below the root zone the samples were sieved through 1 mm mesh and washed with water then the roots were collected with tweezers fine roots 2 mm were analyzed with winrhizo imaging analysis software at 300 dpi dots per inch fine root length density was calculated as the ratio of fine root length to soil volume a custom made precipitation collector was placed in a bare area to collect incident precipitation fig 1b the collector comprised a funnel inserted and sealed into a cylindrical collection reservoir with a standard plastic ping pong ball placed loosely over the opening of the funnel water filled the funnel during rain events making the ping pong ball float and allowing water to enter the reservoir after the rain events the ping pong ball sat tight against the funnel opening preventing debris from entering the reservoir and minimizing evaporation water loss after removal from the collectors the rainwater was stored at 4 c before analysis precipitation samples were collected for each rain event between may 2018 and august 2020 totaling 123 samples the vacuum extraction method was used to extract water from the soil samples in the laboratory the extraction efficiencies were 100 2 pure soil water 8 ml was mixed with 12 ml scintillation solution hisafe3 in a 25 ml standard plastic bottle after 24 h of dark adaptation the tritium count was recorded using a low background liquid scintillation counter quantulus 1220 perkinelmer singapore the results were expressed in tu units with a detection limit of 10 5 tu defined as 3 29 times the standard deviation of the measurement according to armbruster and pry 2008 the δ2h and δ18o compositions in soil water were determined with a liquid water isotope analyzer iwa 45ep los gatos research usa with a measurement accuracy of 1 5 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o the isotopic composition of each water sample was expressed as 1 δ x r sample r standard 1 1000 where x is 2h or 18o r sample and r standard are the ratios of 2h 1h or 18o 16o in the sample and the standard vienna standard mean ocean water respectively deionized water 25 ml was added to 5 g oven dried soil samples to determine chloride nitrate and sulfate concentrations in soil water the samples were then agitated on a reciprocal shaker table for 1 h and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min the concentration of the supernatant solution was analyzed by ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 thermo fisher scientific usa and then converted to pore water chloride nitrate and sulfate concentrations 2 3 partitioning the temporal origins of transpiration water into pre and post plantation in perennial deep rooted vegetation the water age of transpiration was reflected by resolving the temporal origin of soil water ignoring the time of transpiration from soil to xylem the water age of transpiration of deep rooted vegetation was divided into two parts according to its temporal origin the post planting new water and pre planting old water soild fertilizers containing large amounts of chloride nitrate and sulfate were applied at planting thus the water age of the deepest soil solute peak was considered the moment at planting with this soil depth as the critical layer between old and new water the whole profile was partitioned into two sub profiles fig 2 no exchange of soil water occurred at the interface between new and old water if piston flow dominated soil water recharge we established the water balance equations for each of the two sub profiles according to the fate of the soil water in the new water zone transpiration was derived as the difference between the net precipitation and soil evaporation loss and the soil water recharge during vegetation planting fig 2b in the old water zone transpiration came from the deep soil water deficit soil water recharge and loss of groundwater recharge under deep rooted vegetation fig 2c the cumulative chloride age in the unsaturated zone was calculated to determine the maximum water age of transpiration which did not need a steady state huang et al 2020 however chloride input from fertilization was not available for this study fortunately the tritium peak could be used to trace the soil water age in 1963 li et al 2018 li and si 2018 the maximum water age of transpiration was determined using a method that combined the tritium peak with the chloride cumulative age more specifically if the maximum water consumption depth exceeded the tritium peak depth the maximum water age of transpiration was considered the sum of the water age of tritium peak and the cumulative chloride age below the tritium peak when the depth of maximum water consumption was shallower than the tritium peak the maximum water age of transpiration was calculated as the difference between the water age at the tritium peak and the chloride cumulative age at depth from root depth to tritium peak fig 2 the following sections elaborate on the hydrological components for partitioning the temporal origins of transpiration water into pre and post plantation fig 3 2 3 1 soil water deficit soil water in the deep soil profile under shallow rooted grassland was considered the initial soil water status under deep rooted vegetation zhang et al 2018 soil water deficit was the difference between soil water storage under grassland and deep rooted vegetation soil water deficit was calculated eqs 2 4 ignoring change in soil water content in the active layer 2 δ s a l l θ s θ d 3 δ s n l l n θ s θ d 4 δ s o l n l θ s θ d where δ s a δ s n and δ s o are the total soil water deficit soil water deficit of new water and soil water deficit of old water mm θ s z and θ d z are the volumetric soil water contents of shallow rooted and deep rooted vegetation cm3 cm 3 respectively l is the maximum depth of water consumption mm l is depth of the soil water active layer mm l n is the interface depth between old and new water the depth of the deepest solute peak in the soil mm 2 3 2 soil water recharge for new water the pore water velocity of the new water is defined as the depth of the new water divided by the corresponding time eq 5 the new water recharge is defined as the new water storage divided by the corresponding water age eq 6 5 v n l n t 6 r n s n δ s n t l l n θ d t where v n is new pore water velocity r n is new water recharge s n is soil water storage relative to grassland δ s n is soil water deficit of new water t is the stand age of deep rooted vegetation 2 3 3 evapotranspiration from new water when planting deep rooted vegetation some precipitation returned to the atmosphere through soil evaporation and plant transpiration while the remainder was recharged into the soil hence the evapotranspiration from new water during this time was equivalent to the precipitation minus the new water recharge eq 7 7 et n p r n where et n is the evapotranspiration from new water mm yr 1 and p is annual average precipitation during vegetation planting mm yr 1 2 3 4 soil evaporation loss fraction soil evaporation and plant transpiration had different temporal attributes in the long term water balance under deep rooted vegetation soil evaporation loss which took place in topsoil was considered part of new water evapotranspiration partitioning was adopted to compare old water of transpiration with new water of transpiration we used the model of steady state isotope mass balance eq 8 to calculate the fractions of evaporation loss this model was derived from the evapotranspiration partitioning approach kool et al 2014 and then reframed to estimate evaporation loss al oqaili et al 2020 it assumed input water was balanced by fractionated water evaporation and non fractionated water transpiration and groundwater recharge soil evaporation e can be calculated as the product of evaporation loss fraction and precipitation the average value of soil water evaporation fraction f can be estimated eqs 8 and 9 8 f e p δ p δ s δ e δ s 9 δ i f δ e δ s δ s the input water δ p originated from local precipitation without irrigation thus the lc excess value of the effective input water lc i eq 10 was calculated based on eq 9 and the dual isotope method xiang et al 2021 10 lc i f δ e δ s δ s 2 h a f δ e δ s δ s 18 o b where lc i is the lc excess value of the effective input water set to zero because precipitation is the only soil water source and δ s is the soil water isotope the soil water isotopes below the soil water active layer were used for the grassland while the soil water isotopes between l and l n depths were used for the deep rooted vegetation δ e is the isotopic composition of evaporated water eq 11 based on the craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 11 δ e δ s ε α h δ a ε k 1 h ε k 1000 where ε and α are the kinetic fractionation factor ε α 1 10 3 δ a is the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor estimated as δ a δ p ε α and α is a function of temperature eqs 12 and 13 gibson et al 2008 horita and wesolowski 1994 for the methods and uncertainty of estimating δ a please refer to skrzypek et al 2015 ε k was calculated from eqs 14 and 15 12 10

9723 where parameter n is the aerodynamic diffusion ranging from 0 5 saturated soil conditions to 1 0 very dry soil conditions the value of n was set as 0 75 because the evaporating soil layer had alternate saturating and drying conditions over time in this study we estimated the values of α and ε k based on long term 1961 2018 average daily temperature and relative humidity 2 3 5 groundwater recharge and pore water velocity for the shallow rooted zone long term annual groundwater recharge was determined using the tritium peak method eqs 16 and 17 allison et al 1990 16 r s l l t θ s t 1 v θ s 17 v l t l t 1 where r s is groundwater under the grassland mm yr 1 l t is tritium peak depth mm t t is the time between the sampling year and 1963 yr and v is pore water velocity under the grassland mm yr 1 these two equations assumed that soil water from precipitation took one year to penetrate the soil water active layer groundwater recharge for deep rooted vegetation was determined as the difference between potential groundwater recharge under grassland and the loss of soil water recharge under deep rooted vegetation eq 18 18 r d r s l l s θ s t where r d is potential groundwater recharge under deep rooted vegetation mm yr 1 depth l corresponding to water age is t r which can be calculated using the chloride cumulative age method huang et al 2020 l s is the soil depth corresponding to water age t r under grassland the pore water velocity in the entire root zone was estimated as the ratio between the maximum water consumption depth and the corresponding water age eq 19 19 v r l t r where v r is the pore water velocity in the entire root zone m yr 1 l is the maximum depth of water consumption m t r is the water age corresponding to the maximum root depth year 2 3 6 transpiration from new water and old water for new water precipitation was divided into evaporation transpiration and soil water recharge thus transpiration from new water can be calculated eq 20 old water of transpiration originated from soil water deficit soil water recharge and groundwater recharge eq 21 total transpiration was equal to the sum of new water and old water transpiration eq 22 20 t n p e r n 21 t o δ s o t s n t r d 22 t a t n t o for the entire deep profile fig 2a total transpiration was calculated with eq 23 the actual annual evapotranspiration eq 24 was equal to the sum of transpiration eq 22 or 23 plus evaporation 23 t a p δ s a t r d e 24 et t a e p δ s a t r d 2 4 statistical analysis the difference between the means of the two treatments can be tested using the student s t test 25 t x y σ x 2 σ y 2 where x and y are the means and σ x and σ y are the standard errors of variables x and y respectively a significant difference is considered when the value is greater than 1 96 p 0 05 3 results 3 1 water isotopes in precipitation and soil water monthly δ18o values in precipitation ranged from 13 8 to 3 2 with a volume weighted mean value of 9 1 1 0 mean sd monthly δ2h values ranged from 95 6 to 14 3 with a volume weighted mean value of 63 1 7 0 fig 4 soil water isotopes were located close to but below lmwl fig 4 revealing that soil water came from precipitation soil water isotope values were close to the monthly volume weighted isotope values of large precipitation amounts july september average deep soil water isotopes were close to isotope signals from most heavy precipitation fig s1 indicating that deep soil water was mainly from heavy precipitation soil water isotopes were more enriched than volume weighted precipitation values and the slopes and intercepts were lower than those of lmwl the slopes of the evaporation line of soil water isotopes were similar 5 82 0 74 for grassland 5 75 0 47 for apple orchard and 5 53 0 35 for peach orchard meanwhile the fitted tritium profiles had bell shaped distributions within each soil profile fig 5 d showing that the piston flow dominated the recharge mechanism 3 2 water ages of soil profiles soil water and soil water isotopes in the 0 2 m soil layer fluctuated greatly under the three vegetation types due to alternating dry and wet periods caused by precipitation and evapotranspiration within the year fig 5a b indicating the three land uses have the same depths of soil water active layer so the water age of soil water within 2 m soil depth was determined as one year ignoring soil water storage in soil water active layer soil water deficit was 1819 mm to 26 4 m under the apple orchard and 589 mm to 19 6 m under the peach orchard fig 5a chloride nitrate and sulfate concentrations did not change dramatically in the deep soil profile under grassland fig 5c1 but noteworthy peaks occurred at 5 m under the apple orchard and 7 4 m under the peach orchard caused by historical fertilization fig 5c2 c3 the solutes below the interface layer were not affected by fertilization and did not change sharply with depth thus soil depths of about 5 m and 7 4 m were considered the critical interface layer for new and old water under the apple and peach orchards respectively the average velocity of new pore water was about 0 14 m yr 1 under the apple orchard and 0 34 m yr 1 under the peach orchard the fitted tritium profiles had bell shaped distributions within the soil profile fig 5d peak concentrations occurred at 23 43 0 38 m under the grassland 22 88 0 10 m under the apple orchard and 22 95 0 29 m under the peach orchard statistically significant differences in peak depths occurred between the deep rooted orchards and grassland p 0 05 according to the fine root length density frld from the soil surface to the maximum rooting depth of the two tree species fig 6 the maximum rooting depths under the apple orchard and the peach orchard were the same as the maximum water consumption depths 26 4 and 19 6 m respectively based on the tritium peak depth and chloride accumulative age method the maximum water age of transpiration was about 63 years under the apple orchard and 45 years under the peach orchard the average pore water velocities through the entire root zone were about 0 40 0 39 and 0 40 m yr 1 for grassland apple orchard and peach orchard respectively 3 3 partitioning temporal origins of transpiration 3 3 1 new water of transpiration the grassland had 76 82 mm yr 1 of groundwater recharge eq 16 table 2 and 5 65 soil evaporation loss fraction eq 8 such that the average annual transpiration under grassland was 436 13 mm yr 1 the apple orchard had 265 02 mm soil water storage derived from new water 2 5 m depth 508 99 mm yr 1 average evapotranspiration for a water age of 22 years 6 74 soil evaporation loss fraction eq 8 and thus about 475 39 mm yr 1 average new water of transpiration the peach orchard had about 559 82 mm yr 1 precipitation input since the planation year soil water deficit of new water 2 7 4 m was about 834 35 mm with about 510 74 mm yr 1 average annual evapotranspiration for water age of 17 years and 7 14 soil evaporation loss fraction consequently the peach orchard had about 473 23 mm yr 1 average new water of transpiration 3 3 2 old water of transpiration under the apple orchard the average groundwater recharge declined to 69 55 mm yr 1 eq 18 average annual soil water deficit with water age 22 years was about 65 48 mm yr 1 for the apple orchard while soil water recharge was 29 24 mm yr 1 based on eq 21 old water of transpiration was 25 17 mm yr 1 under the peach orchard the average groundwater recharge was 71 41 mm yr 1 soil water consumption from old water was about 360 82 mm and soil water recharge was 62 48 mm yr 1 hence old water of transpiration was about 12 29 mm yr 1 4 discussion 4 1 soil water age signals in the unsaturated zone soil water age is zero when precipitation falls on the soil surface sprenger et al 2019 2018 at our experimental site snowmelt is relatively small with an average annual value of 18 4 mm causing a slight infiltration delay of a few days however this lag time can be ignored in this study s annual scale as a result we assumed that precipitation time is consistent with soil water infiltration time the measured tritium profiles showed that the historical rainwater tracer signal over time in the unsaturated soil profile fig 5d the bell shaped tritium distribution indicated that soil piston flow dominated in the non fractured unsaturated zone li and si 2018 lin and wei 2006 post bomb tritiated rainwater diffused into the soil matrix resulting in a bell shaped tritium distribution within the soil profile resembling soil piston flow foster 1975 consistent with stable isotopes at other sites on the loess plateau of china yang and fu 2017 the estimated old and new water failed to mix via piston flow to our knowledge preferential flow only occurs in some restricted low lying areas on the loess plateau huang et al 2019 xiang et al 2019 our study site is located on the top platform of a hillside where it is unlikely that preferential flow will occur thus age dating tracers measured the actual water age in our study we determined three critical water ages in the unsaturated zone using multiple tracers and soil water content measurements one year water age water age corresponding to stand age and the maximum water age of transpiration the soil water active layer was defined as 0 2 m after measuring soil water dynamics and variation of stable isotopes in the unsaturated zone over one year fig 5a b consistent with wu et al 2021 the soil water active layer is usually considered for one year s water tao et al 2021 undergoing multiple soil water depletion and recharge process throughout the year so one year old water in the unsaturated zone will not affect the water cycle in the long term suo et al 2018 water age corresponding to stand age was determined by artificially adding solutes to a depth that reflects the effect of deep rooted vegetation on the new water recharge rate the depth of 22 year water age was 5 m with a new water recharge rate of 0 14 m yr 1 under the apple orchard while the depth of 17 year water age was 7 4 m with a new water recharge rate of 0 34 m yr 1 under the peach orchard showing that vegetation type affects the depth of water year corresponding to stand age as used in previous studies the maximum transpired water age was determined using tritium peaks combined with the chloride accumulative age method huang et al 2018 lu et al 2020 our study found that the 22 year old apple orchard transpired water above the 26 4 m soil layer with a maximum water age of 63 years while the 17 year old peach orchard transpired water above the 19 6 m soil layer with a maximum water age of 45 years indicating deep rooted vegetation transpired soil water that was older than the stand age 4 2 partitioning temporal origin of transpiration into pre and post plantation our results showed that deep rooted vegetation transpired water mainly from new water table 2 the new water located in shallow soil was easily accessible to vegetation roots fan et al 2017 meanwhile more than half of frld 61 for apple and 66 for peach was concentrated in new water fig 6 indicating dense root networks in shallow soil more likely to take up new water than old water in addition new water came from annual precipitation while old water came from the soil water formed by pre planting precipitation the long term average new water source was 543 mm yr 1 while the old water source was 76 82 mm yr 1 under the grassland furthermore deep rooted vegetation uses new water in the early stages of planting with its shallow root system and low transpiration requirements zhang et al 2020 the proportion of old water of transpiration to total transpiration was small 5 03 for apple and 2 53 for peach however the accumulative amount of transpired old water was not negligible after the land use change reaching 553 mm for apple orchard and 209 mm for the peach orchard since it is not available for precipitation recharge after land use changes total old water consumption was 7 2 times higher for the apple and 2 7 times higher for the peach than annual average groundwater recharge under grassland old water of transpiration was 25 mm yr 1 for the apple orchard and 12 mm yr 1 for the peach orchard indicating that the 22 year old apple trees used more old water for transpiration than the 17 year old peach trees which was likely due to 1 deeper rooting depth of apple trees 26 4 m vs 19 6 m 2 different root water uptake strategies for example wu et al 2022 found that peach trees used more shallow soil water representing new water than apple trees 3 slightly older stand age 4 3 hydrological compartments of new and old water this study decomposed the soil water balance method by combining soil water water isotopes and chloride concentrations the et values in this study accounted for 102 52 of the average annual precipitation under the apple orchard 93 43 under the peach orchard and 80 92 under the grassland within the range 82 110 reported on the loess plateau li et al 2019a the estimated soil evaporation loss fraction f e p values were about 6 58 for the apple orchard 7 14 for the peach orchard and 4 84 for the grassland close to the lower limit 5 15 reported by xiang et al 2021 using the same method on the loess plateau groundwater recharge declined by 9 46 for the apple orchard and 7 04 for the peach orchard after land use conversion relative to the grassland similar to the 6 1 reduction for alfalfa plantation and 11 0 reduction in the unsaturated zone li et al 2014 turkeltaub et al 2018 the conversion of natural grassland into deep rooted vegetation led to a series of hydrological changes with new pore water velocity declining from 0 40 m yr 1 to 0 14 m yr 1 and 0 34 m yr 1 for apple and peach respectively indicating that deep rooted vegetation decreased recharge rate of new water annual precipitation recharges to the maximum depth of 2 m fig 5a leading to water deficits when new water below 2 m is consumed in the rooting zone therefore deep rooted vegetation had greater new water of transpiration than grassland old water of transpiration largely led to a serious old water deficit with a small effect on groundwater recharge old water of transpiration by the apple orchard resulted in old water deficit equivalent to 85 of annual average groundwater recharge under grassland table 2 groundwater recharge was only reduced by 9 5 under the apple orchard and 7 0 under the peach orchard compared to grassland due to a lagged response in the unsaturated zone li et al 2019c rossman et al 2014 the phenomenon of delayed tracer breakthrough in groundwater recharge was demonstrated in a lysimeter experiment benettin et al 2021 4 4 uncertainty of this study the uncertainty of this study comes largely from the 1 soil evaporation loss fraction due to the short term observation of water isotopes in precipitation 2 potential groundwater recharge for deep rooted vegetation due to the uncertainty of chloride inputs the volume weighted average water isotopes used in this study were 9 1 1 0 for δ18o and 63 1 7 0 for δ2h depleted than the values reported in the mid 1980s to 1990s 8 1 3 7 for δ18o and 58 2 27 4 for δ2h liu et al 2014 given the earlier precipitation isotopes were used the estimated soil evaporation loss fraction had similar results to our study 5 7 vs 5 6 for grassland 6 5 vs 6 7 for the apple and 6 9 vs 7 1 for the peach for the uncertainty of chloride input we calculated an annual chloride concentration of 1 32 mg l 1 based on the tritium profile under grassland which was close to other studies in the surrounding areas 1 4 mg l 1 gates et al 2011 1 0 mg l 1 li et al 2017 and 0 8 mg l 1 huang et al 2018 to identify land use impacts we selected grassland adjacent to deep rooted vegetation distance 500 m to ensure the same climatic and hydrological conditions further the spatial variations in soil profiles can be excluded due to the similar soil water distribution and soil texture fractions fig 5a in addition seasonal variations in soil water and water isotopes were above 2 m fig 5a b so the sampling season did not impact the changes in water isotopes chloride and soil water below 2 m soil layers therefore our sampling process is reliable for data acquisition 5 conclusions in this study multiple tracers were used to label three critical water ages and their corresponding depths under different vegetation conditions on the loess plateau the amounts of new water of transpiration temporally originating from post planting precipitation and old water of transpiration temporally originating from pre planting precipitation were estimated over the vegetation lifespan using the water balance method for two sub profiles new water depths in the soil profile were about 5 0 m with a 22 year water age under the apple orchard and 7 4 m with a 17 year water age under the peach orchard while the maximum water age depths were 26 4 m for the 63 year water age and 19 6 m for the 45 year water age deep rooted vegetation mainly transpired new water accounting for about 94 97 of the total transpiration with a transpiration rate of 500 56 mm yr 1 under the apple orchard and 97 47 of the total transpiration with a transpiration rate of 485 52 mm yr 1 under the peach orchard these findings could improve our understanding of hydrological cycle partitioning into different compartments and fluxes in the unsaturated zone from the perspective of water age credit

2521,deep rooted vegetation transpires a considerable amount of deep soil water with different ages in the unsaturated zone however the tradeoffs between new water of transpiration temporally originating from post planting precipitation and old water of transpiration temporally originating from pre planting precipitation across the vegetation lifespan are poorly understood in this study we collected soil samples from beyond 28 m soil depth on the loess plateau of china to investigate the influence of deep rooted vegetation on the age of soil water and analyze the proportion of new and old water of transpiration in the unsaturated zone under grassland 22 year old apple orchard and 17 year old peach orchard water isotopes 2h 18o and 3h solutes chloride nitrate sulfate and soil water content were used to identify the critical water ages in the unsaturated zone one year water age water age corresponding to stand age and the maximum water age of transpiration and to determine soil water deficit soil evaporation loss fraction and potential groundwater recharge the results showed that soil water mainly moved as piston flow in these soil profiles and deep soil water largely came from heavy precipitation deep rooted vegetation restrained new pore water velocity and potential groundwater recharge new pore water velocity declined from 0 40 m yr 1 to 0 14 m yr 1 and 0 34 m yr 1 for apple and peach respectively deep rooted vegetation decreased groundwater recharge by 9 46 for apple and 7 04 for peach compared to grassland over the vegetation lifespan annual average transpiration was 500 56 mm yr 1 and 468 89 mm yr 1 with maximum water age of 63 years and 45 years for apple and peach respectively the transpiration of deep rooted vegetation mainly used new water 94 97 for apple and 97 47 for peach the total old water of transpiration was 553 mm for apple and 209 mm for peach our results identify the temporal sources of vegetation water use offering new insights into the transpiration process of deep rooted vegetation keywords water age transpiration deep rooted vegetation loess plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction transpiration is the largest continental water flux returning to the atmosphere representing about 80 90 of terrestrial evapotranspiration good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 and a dominant force in the global water cycle schlesinger and jasechko 2014 in the soil plant atmosphere continuum vegetation on different land use types takes up water of different ages schenk and jackson 2005 investigating the time of transpiration helps us understand water transit through the water cycle benettin et al 2021 thus studies on transpiration water age are becoming increasingly valuable especially under the situation of land use changes sprenger et al 2018 transpiration water age of vegetation is a function of travel time from roots to the atmosphere root access to water and water held in the soil sprenger et al 2019 quantifying the water age of transpiration can help us to understand which water is used by vegetation allen et al 2019 the absolute age of water taken up by vegetation varies from days to years including precipitation water originating from previous growing seasons allen et al 2019 brinkmann et al 2018 and stored soil water several decades old zhang et al 2017 overall the water age transpired by vegetation largely depends on the different water ages available in the unsaturated zone sprenger et al 2019 in the unsaturated zone multiple tracers are needed to identify water age since different tracers span different temporal scales abbott et al 2016 si and jong 2007 for example natural variations in the stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen can be used to date water from precipitation events up to 3 5 years koeniger et al 2016 similarly artificial chloride nitrate and sulfate can identify water age from the moment of fertilization tritium bulge has been used to chronicle water age in deep soils on the loess plateau in china li et al 2018 li and si 2018 meanwhile revealing the mechanism of soil water flow is necessary to interpret soil water age for tracers because it strongly depends on the flow mechanism under the assumption of piston flow the inferred ages from historical tracers could be the actual soil water age bethke and johnson 2008 therefore multiple tracers can provide ideal signals of water age under piston flow mechanism in the unsaturated zone depending on the climate and soil conditions vegetation has different root distribution and root uptake strategies to access water of different ages in arid and semiarid zones vegetation develops deep roots that can access very old water beyer et al 2016 fan et al 2017 the large consumption of old water in deep soil could break the connection between surface water and groundwater zhang et al 2018 once depleted old soil water is difficult to recharge due to correlation with deep soil water even forming a dried soil layer where soil water was deficit jia et al 2019 several studies have focused on water deficit caused by excessive vegetation transpiration markewitz et al 2010 shao et al 2021 wang et al 2011 investigating patterns of deep soil water depletion li et al 2019b markewitz et al 2010 spatial distribution and driving factors of water deficit liang et al 2022 wang et al 2011 and eco hydrological processes barua et al 2021 yang et al 2022 transpiration water age is useful for identifying which age of water is consumed recent studies found that deep rooted vegetation transpired soil water older than the stand age li et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 however few studies have quantitatively explored the temporal origin of transpiration water for deep rooted vegetation due to excessive transpiration from deep soils deep soil water deficit has been a major issue limiting water resource sustainability which often occurs on the loess plateau in china huang and shao 2019 jia et al 2020 2019 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 reported that deep rooted vegetation on the loess plateau transpired water up to several decades old considering the life cycle of perennial vegetation soil water originating from pre planting precipitation was called old water while soil water from post planting precipitation was called new water old water consumption indicates the available precipitation resources cannot meet the vegetation transpiration during the growing period tradeoffs between the new and old water consumed throughout the vegetation life cycle become important for balancing deep soil water but are rarely studied thus this study aimed to distinguish the proportions of new and old water during the life cycle transpiration of perennial deep rooted vegetation 22 year old apple orchard and 17 year old peach orchard on the loess plateau and to estimate the hydrological components affected by excessive transpiration the objectives were to 1 determine the critical water ages and their corresponding depths in the unsaturated zone 2 quantify new and old water in vegetation transpiration and 3 evaluate the hydrological compartments of new and old water in vegetation transpiration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site was in the tianhe watershed 36 39 36 40 n 109 22 109 23 e fig 1 a

988 1344 m the soil layers are very thick with groundwater table deeper than 100 m zhu et al 2018 the deep loess profile comprises alternating glacial loess and interglacial paleosol the soil texture is predominantly silty silt content 60 the watershed is in a warm temperate semiarid zone with a continental monsoon climate the long term 1961 2018 average annual temperature is 10 1 c and the average annual precipitation is 543 131 mm about 70 of average annual precipitation occur between june and september the study area has undergone dramatic land use changes since the implementation of the grain for green project in 1999 economic vegetation was expanded because orchards reduce soil water erosion and increase local farmer income we chose a typical apple orchard converted from natural grassland in 1995 and a peach orchard converted from natural grassland in 2001 and nearby long term natural grassland as the control treatment fig 1b table 1 2 2 sampling and analyzing three soil cores were collected at the top platform of a hillside using a hollow stem auger to 30 m depth for the apple orchard and grassland and 28 m for the peach orchard each core was separated into 20 cm intervals soil sampling was conducted on august 1st 6th in 2017 for the apple orchard and on august 1st 15th in 2018 for the peach orchard and the grassland the soil samples were measured to determine soil water content water isotopes solute concentration chloride nitrate and sulfate and soil texture each soil sample was partitioned into three parts and placed into 1 an aluminum box for soil water content measurement through the oven drying method 24 h at 105 c 2 a plastic bottle sealed with sealing film and stored at 18 c for soil water extraction and subsequent stable isotopes and tritium measurements 3 a fiber bag for measuring solute concentration and soil texture soil clay silt and sand fractions were measured using the pipette method gee and bauder 1986 for accurate estimations of the long term soil evaporation loss fraction soil samples to a depth of at least 10 m were extracted monthly to measure soil water content and stable isotopes from june to october 2018 in addition a hand auger with an inner diameter of 85 mm was used to sample roots between the diagonals of four similar sized trees under the apple and peach orchards root samples were collected at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 3 m below the root zone the samples were sieved through 1 mm mesh and washed with water then the roots were collected with tweezers fine roots 2 mm were analyzed with winrhizo imaging analysis software at 300 dpi dots per inch fine root length density was calculated as the ratio of fine root length to soil volume a custom made precipitation collector was placed in a bare area to collect incident precipitation fig 1b the collector comprised a funnel inserted and sealed into a cylindrical collection reservoir with a standard plastic ping pong ball placed loosely over the opening of the funnel water filled the funnel during rain events making the ping pong ball float and allowing water to enter the reservoir after the rain events the ping pong ball sat tight against the funnel opening preventing debris from entering the reservoir and minimizing evaporation water loss after removal from the collectors the rainwater was stored at 4 c before analysis precipitation samples were collected for each rain event between may 2018 and august 2020 totaling 123 samples the vacuum extraction method was used to extract water from the soil samples in the laboratory the extraction efficiencies were 100 2 pure soil water 8 ml was mixed with 12 ml scintillation solution hisafe3 in a 25 ml standard plastic bottle after 24 h of dark adaptation the tritium count was recorded using a low background liquid scintillation counter quantulus 1220 perkinelmer singapore the results were expressed in tu units with a detection limit of 10 5 tu defined as 3 29 times the standard deviation of the measurement according to armbruster and pry 2008 the δ2h and δ18o compositions in soil water were determined with a liquid water isotope analyzer iwa 45ep los gatos research usa with a measurement accuracy of 1 5 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o the isotopic composition of each water sample was expressed as 1 δ x r sample r standard 1 1000 where x is 2h or 18o r sample and r standard are the ratios of 2h 1h or 18o 16o in the sample and the standard vienna standard mean ocean water respectively deionized water 25 ml was added to 5 g oven dried soil samples to determine chloride nitrate and sulfate concentrations in soil water the samples were then agitated on a reciprocal shaker table for 1 h and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min the concentration of the supernatant solution was analyzed by ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 thermo fisher scientific usa and then converted to pore water chloride nitrate and sulfate concentrations 2 3 partitioning the temporal origins of transpiration water into pre and post plantation in perennial deep rooted vegetation the water age of transpiration was reflected by resolving the temporal origin of soil water ignoring the time of transpiration from soil to xylem the water age of transpiration of deep rooted vegetation was divided into two parts according to its temporal origin the post planting new water and pre planting old water soild fertilizers containing large amounts of chloride nitrate and sulfate were applied at planting thus the water age of the deepest soil solute peak was considered the moment at planting with this soil depth as the critical layer between old and new water the whole profile was partitioned into two sub profiles fig 2 no exchange of soil water occurred at the interface between new and old water if piston flow dominated soil water recharge we established the water balance equations for each of the two sub profiles according to the fate of the soil water in the new water zone transpiration was derived as the difference between the net precipitation and soil evaporation loss and the soil water recharge during vegetation planting fig 2b in the old water zone transpiration came from the deep soil water deficit soil water recharge and loss of groundwater recharge under deep rooted vegetation fig 2c the cumulative chloride age in the unsaturated zone was calculated to determine the maximum water age of transpiration which did not need a steady state huang et al 2020 however chloride input from fertilization was not available for this study fortunately the tritium peak could be used to trace the soil water age in 1963 li et al 2018 li and si 2018 the maximum water age of transpiration was determined using a method that combined the tritium peak with the chloride cumulative age more specifically if the maximum water consumption depth exceeded the tritium peak depth the maximum water age of transpiration was considered the sum of the water age of tritium peak and the cumulative chloride age below the tritium peak when the depth of maximum water consumption was shallower than the tritium peak the maximum water age of transpiration was calculated as the difference between the water age at the tritium peak and the chloride cumulative age at depth from root depth to tritium peak fig 2 the following sections elaborate on the hydrological components for partitioning the temporal origins of transpiration water into pre and post plantation fig 3 2 3 1 soil water deficit soil water in the deep soil profile under shallow rooted grassland was considered the initial soil water status under deep rooted vegetation zhang et al 2018 soil water deficit was the difference between soil water storage under grassland and deep rooted vegetation soil water deficit was calculated eqs 2 4 ignoring change in soil water content in the active layer 2 δ s a l l θ s θ d 3 δ s n l l n θ s θ d 4 δ s o l n l θ s θ d where δ s a δ s n and δ s o are the total soil water deficit soil water deficit of new water and soil water deficit of old water mm θ s z and θ d z are the volumetric soil water contents of shallow rooted and deep rooted vegetation cm3 cm 3 respectively l is the maximum depth of water consumption mm l is depth of the soil water active layer mm l n is the interface depth between old and new water the depth of the deepest solute peak in the soil mm 2 3 2 soil water recharge for new water the pore water velocity of the new water is defined as the depth of the new water divided by the corresponding time eq 5 the new water recharge is defined as the new water storage divided by the corresponding water age eq 6 5 v n l n t 6 r n s n δ s n t l l n θ d t where v n is new pore water velocity r n is new water recharge s n is soil water storage relative to grassland δ s n is soil water deficit of new water t is the stand age of deep rooted vegetation 2 3 3 evapotranspiration from new water when planting deep rooted vegetation some precipitation returned to the atmosphere through soil evaporation and plant transpiration while the remainder was recharged into the soil hence the evapotranspiration from new water during this time was equivalent to the precipitation minus the new water recharge eq 7 7 et n p r n where et n is the evapotranspiration from new water mm yr 1 and p is annual average precipitation during vegetation planting mm yr 1 2 3 4 soil evaporation loss fraction soil evaporation and plant transpiration had different temporal attributes in the long term water balance under deep rooted vegetation soil evaporation loss which took place in topsoil was considered part of new water evapotranspiration partitioning was adopted to compare old water of transpiration with new water of transpiration we used the model of steady state isotope mass balance eq 8 to calculate the fractions of evaporation loss this model was derived from the evapotranspiration partitioning approach kool et al 2014 and then reframed to estimate evaporation loss al oqaili et al 2020 it assumed input water was balanced by fractionated water evaporation and non fractionated water transpiration and groundwater recharge soil evaporation e can be calculated as the product of evaporation loss fraction and precipitation the average value of soil water evaporation fraction f can be estimated eqs 8 and 9 8 f e p δ p δ s δ e δ s 9 δ i f δ e δ s δ s the input water δ p originated from local precipitation without irrigation thus the lc excess value of the effective input water lc i eq 10 was calculated based on eq 9 and the dual isotope method xiang et al 2021 10 lc i f δ e δ s δ s 2 h a f δ e δ s δ s 18 o b where lc i is the lc excess value of the effective input water set to zero because precipitation is the only soil water source and δ s is the soil water isotope the soil water isotopes below the soil water active layer were used for the grassland while the soil water isotopes between l and l n depths were used for the deep rooted vegetation δ e is the isotopic composition of evaporated water eq 11 based on the craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 11 δ e δ s ε

temperature eqs 12 and 13 gibson et al 2008 horita and wesolowski 1994 for the methods and uncertainty of estimating δ a please refer to skrzypek et al 2015 ε k was calculated from eqs 14 and 15 12 10

9723 where parameter n is the aerodynamic diffusion ranging from 0 5 saturated soil conditions to 1 0 very dry soil conditions the value of n was set as 0 75 because the evaporating soil layer had alternate saturating and drying conditions over time in this study we estimated the values of α and ε k based on long term 1961 2018 average daily temperature and relative humidity 2 3 5 groundwater recharge and pore water velocity for the shallow rooted zone long term annual groundwater recharge was determined using the tritium peak method eqs 16 and 17 allison et al 1990 16 r s l l t θ s t 1 v θ s 17 v l t l t 1 where r s is groundwater under the grassland mm yr 1 l t is tritium peak depth mm t t is the time between the sampling year and 1963 yr and v is pore water velocity under the grassland mm yr 1 these two equations assumed that soil water from precipitation took one year to penetrate the soil water active layer groundwater recharge for deep rooted vegetation was determined as the difference between potential groundwater recharge under grassland and the loss of soil water recharge under deep rooted vegetation eq 18 18 r d r s l l s θ s t where r d is potential groundwater recharge under deep rooted vegetation mm yr 1 depth l corresponding to water age is t r which can be calculated using the chloride cumulative age method huang et al 2020 l s is the soil depth corresponding to water age t r under grassland the pore water velocity in the entire root zone was estimated as the ratio between the maximum water consumption depth and the corresponding water age eq 19 19 v r l t r where v r is the pore water velocity in the entire root zone m yr 1 l is the maximum depth of water consumption m t r is the water age corresponding to the maximum root depth year 2 3 6 transpiration from new water and old water for new water precipitation was divided into evaporation transpiration and soil water recharge thus transpiration from new water can be calculated eq 20 old water of transpiration originated from soil water deficit soil water recharge and groundwater recharge eq 21 total transpiration was equal to the sum of new water and old water transpiration eq 22 20 t n p e r n 21 t o δ s o t s n t r d 22 t a t n t o for the entire deep profile fig 2a total transpiration was calculated with eq 23 the actual annual evapotranspiration eq 24 was equal to the sum of transpiration eq 22 or 23 plus evaporation 23 t a p δ s a t r d e 24 et t a e p δ s a t r d 2 4 statistical analysis the difference between the means of the two treatments can be tested using the student s t test 25 t x y σ x 2 σ y 2 where x and y are the means and σ x and σ y are the standard errors of variables x and y respectively a significant difference is considered when the value is greater than 1 96 p 0 05 3 results 3 1 water isotopes in precipitation and soil water monthly δ18o values in precipitation ranged from 13 8 to 3 2 with a volume weighted mean value of 9 1 1 0 mean sd monthly δ2h values ranged from 95 6 to 14 3 with a volume weighted mean value of 63 1 7 0 fig 4 soil water isotopes were located close to but below lmwl fig 4 revealing that soil water came from precipitation soil water isotope values were close to the monthly volume weighted isotope values of large precipitation amounts july september average deep soil water isotopes were close to isotope signals from most heavy precipitation fig s1 indicating that deep soil water was mainly from heavy precipitation soil water isotopes were more enriched than volume weighted precipitation values and the slopes and intercepts were lower than those of lmwl the slopes of the evaporation line of soil water isotopes were similar 5 82 0 74 for grassland 5 75 0 47 for apple orchard and 5 53 0 35 for peach orchard meanwhile the fitted tritium profiles had bell shaped distributions within each soil profile fig 5 d showing that the piston flow dominated the recharge mechanism 3 2 water ages of soil profiles soil water and soil water isotopes in the 0 2 m soil layer fluctuated greatly under the three vegetation types due to alternating dry and wet periods caused by precipitation and evapotranspiration within the year fig 5a b indicating the three land uses have the same depths of soil water active layer so the water age of soil water within 2 m soil depth was determined as one year ignoring soil water storage in soil water active layer soil water deficit was 1819 mm to 26 4 m under the apple orchard and 589 mm to 19 6 m under the peach orchard fig 5a chloride nitrate and sulfate concentrations did not change dramatically in the deep soil profile under grassland fig 5c1 but noteworthy peaks occurred at 5 m under the apple orchard and 7 4 m under the peach orchard caused by historical fertilization fig 5c2 c3 the solutes below the interface layer were not affected by fertilization and did not change sharply with depth thus soil depths of about 5 m and 7 4 m were considered the critical interface layer for new and old water under the apple and peach orchards respectively the average velocity of new pore water was about 0 14 m yr 1 under the apple orchard and 0 34 m yr 1 under the peach orchard the fitted tritium profiles had bell shaped distributions within the soil profile fig 5d peak concentrations occurred at 23 43 0 38 m under the grassland 22 88 0 10 m under the apple orchard and 22 95 0 29 m under the peach orchard statistically significant differences in peak depths occurred between the deep rooted orchards and grassland p 0 05 according to the fine root length density frld from the soil surface to the maximum rooting depth of the two tree species fig 6 the maximum rooting depths under the apple orchard and the peach orchard were the same as the maximum water consumption depths 26 4 and 19 6 m respectively based on the tritium peak depth and chloride accumulative age method the maximum water age of transpiration was about 63 years under the apple orchard and 45 years under the peach orchard the average pore water velocities through the entire root zone were about 0 40 0 39 and 0 40 m yr 1 for grassland apple orchard and peach orchard respectively 3 3 partitioning temporal origins of transpiration 3 3 1 new water of transpiration the grassland had 76 82 mm yr 1 of groundwater recharge eq 16 table 2 and 5 65 soil evaporation loss fraction eq 8 such that the average annual transpiration under grassland was 436 13 mm yr 1 the apple orchard had 265 02 mm soil water storage derived from new water 2 5 m depth 508 99 mm yr 1 average evapotranspiration for a water age of 22 years 6 74 soil evaporation loss fraction eq 8 and thus about 475 39 mm yr 1 average new water of transpiration the peach orchard had about 559 82 mm yr 1 precipitation input since the planation year soil water deficit of new water 2 7 4 m was about 834 35 mm with about 510 74 mm yr 1 average annual evapotranspiration for water age of 17 years and 7 14 soil evaporation loss fraction consequently the peach orchard had about 473 23 mm yr 1 average new water of transpiration 3 3 2 old water of transpiration under the apple orchard the average groundwater recharge declined to 69 55 mm yr 1 eq 18 average annual soil water deficit with water age 22 years was about 65 48 mm yr 1 for the apple orchard while soil water recharge was 29 24 mm yr 1 based on eq 21 old water of transpiration was 25 17 mm yr 1 under the peach orchard the average groundwater recharge was 71 41 mm yr 1 soil water consumption from old water was about 360 82 mm and soil water recharge was 62 48 mm yr 1 hence old water of transpiration was about 12 29 mm yr 1 4 discussion 4 1 soil water age signals in the unsaturated zone soil water age is zero when precipitation falls on the soil surface sprenger et al 2019 2018 at our experimental site snowmelt is relatively small with an average annual value of 18 4 mm causing a slight infiltration delay of a few days however this lag time can be ignored in this study s annual scale as a result we assumed that precipitation time is consistent with soil water infiltration time the measured tritium profiles showed that the historical rainwater tracer signal over time in the unsaturated soil profile fig 5d the bell shaped tritium distribution indicated that soil piston flow dominated in the non fractured unsaturated zone li and si 2018 lin and wei 2006 post bomb tritiated rainwater diffused into the soil matrix resulting in a bell shaped tritium distribution within the soil profile resembling soil piston flow foster 1975 consistent with stable isotopes at other sites on the loess plateau of china yang and fu 2017 the estimated old and new water failed to mix via piston flow to our knowledge preferential flow only occurs in some restricted low lying areas on the loess plateau huang et al 2019 xiang et al 2019 our study site is located on the top platform of a hillside where it is unlikely that preferential flow will occur thus age dating tracers measured the actual water age in our study we determined three critical water ages in the unsaturated zone using multiple tracers and soil water content measurements one year water age water age corresponding to stand age and the maximum water age of transpiration the soil water active layer was defined as 0 2 m after measuring soil water dynamics and variation of stable isotopes in the unsaturated zone over one year fig 5a b consistent with wu et al 2021 the soil water active layer is usually considered for one year s water tao et al 2021 undergoing multiple soil water depletion and recharge process throughout the year so one year old water in the unsaturated zone will not affect the water cycle in the long term suo et al 2018 water age corresponding to stand age was determined by artificially adding solutes to a depth that reflects the effect of deep rooted vegetation on the new water recharge rate the depth of 22 year water age was 5 m with a new water recharge rate of 0 14 m yr 1 under the apple orchard while the depth of 17 year water age was 7 4 m with a new water recharge rate of 0 34 m yr 1 under the peach orchard showing that vegetation type affects the depth of water year corresponding to stand age as used in previous studies the maximum transpired water age was determined using tritium peaks combined with the chloride accumulative age method huang et al 2018 lu et al 2020 our study found that the 22 year old apple orchard transpired water above the 26 4 m soil layer with a maximum water age of 63 years while the 17 year old peach orchard transpired water above the 19 6 m soil layer with a maximum water age of 45 years indicating deep rooted vegetation transpired soil water that was older than the stand age 4 2 partitioning temporal origin of transpiration into pre and post plantation our results showed that deep rooted vegetation transpired water mainly from new water table 2 the new water located in shallow soil was easily accessible to vegetation roots fan et al 2017 meanwhile more than half of frld 61 for apple and 66 for peach was concentrated in new water fig 6 indicating dense root networks in shallow soil more likely to take up new water than old water in addition new water came from annual precipitation while old water came from the soil water formed by pre planting precipitation the long term average new water source was 543 mm yr 1 while the old water source was 76 82 mm yr 1 under the grassland furthermore deep rooted vegetation uses new water in the early stages of planting with its shallow root system and low transpiration requirements zhang et al 2020 the proportion of old water of transpiration to total transpiration was small 5 03 for apple and 2 53 for peach however the accumulative amount of transpired old water was not negligible after the land use change reaching 553 mm for apple orchard and 209 mm for the peach orchard since it is not available for precipitation recharge after land use changes total old water consumption was 7 2 times higher for the apple and 2 7 times higher for the peach than annual average groundwater recharge under grassland old water of transpiration was 25 mm yr 1 for the apple orchard and 12 mm yr 1 for the peach orchard indicating that the 22 year old apple trees used more old water for transpiration than the 17 year old peach trees which was likely due to 1 deeper rooting depth of apple trees 26 4 m vs 19 6 m 2 different root water uptake strategies for example wu et al 2022 found that peach trees used more shallow soil water representing new water than apple trees 3 slightly older stand age 4 3 hydrological compartments of new and old water this study decomposed the soil water balance method by combining soil water water isotopes and chloride concentrations the et values in this study accounted for 102 52 of the average annual precipitation under the apple orchard 93 43 under the peach orchard and 80 92 under the grassland within the range 82 110 reported on the loess plateau li et al 2019a the estimated soil evaporation loss fraction f e p values were about 6 58 for the apple orchard 7 14 for the peach orchard and 4 84 for the grassland close to the lower limit 5 15 reported by xiang et al 2021 using the same method on the loess plateau groundwater recharge declined by 9 46 for the apple orchard and 7 04 for the peach orchard after land use conversion relative to the grassland similar to the 6 1 reduction for alfalfa plantation and 11 0 reduction in the unsaturated zone li et al 2014 turkeltaub et al 2018 the conversion of natural grassland into deep rooted vegetation led to a series of hydrological changes with new pore water velocity declining from 0 40 m yr 1 to 0 14 m yr 1 and 0 34 m yr 1 for apple and peach respectively indicating that deep rooted vegetation decreased recharge rate of new water annual precipitation recharges to the maximum depth of 2 m fig 5a leading to water deficits when new water below 2 m is consumed in the rooting zone therefore deep rooted vegetation had greater new water of transpiration than grassland old water of transpiration largely led to a serious old water deficit with a small effect on groundwater recharge old water of transpiration by the apple orchard resulted in old water deficit equivalent to 85 of annual average groundwater recharge under grassland table 2 groundwater recharge was only reduced by 9 5 under the apple orchard and 7 0 under the peach orchard compared to grassland due to a lagged response in the unsaturated zone li et al 2019c rossman et al 2014 the phenomenon of delayed tracer breakthrough in groundwater recharge was demonstrated in a lysimeter experiment benettin et al 2021 4 4 uncertainty of this study the uncertainty of this study comes largely from the 1 soil evaporation loss fraction due to the short term observation of water isotopes in precipitation 2 potential groundwater recharge for deep rooted vegetation due to the uncertainty of chloride inputs the volume weighted average water isotopes used in this study were 9 1 1 0 for δ18o and 63 1 7 0 for δ2h depleted than the values reported in the mid 1980s to 1990s 8 1 3 7 for δ18o and 58 2 27 4 for δ2h liu et al 2014 given the earlier precipitation isotopes were used the estimated soil evaporation loss fraction had similar results to our study 5 7 vs 5 6 for grassland 6 5 vs 6 7 for the apple and 6 9 vs 7 1 for the peach for the uncertainty of chloride input we calculated an annual chloride concentration of 1 32 mg l 1 based on the tritium profile under grassland which was close to other studies in the surrounding areas 1 4 mg l 1 gates et al 2011 1 0 mg l 1 li et al 2017 and 0 8 mg l 1 huang et al 2018 to identify land use impacts we selected grassland adjacent to deep rooted vegetation distance 500 m to ensure the same climatic and hydrological conditions further the spatial variations in soil profiles can be excluded due to the similar soil water distribution and soil texture fractions fig 5a in addition seasonal variations in soil water and water isotopes were above 2 m fig 5a b so the sampling season did not impact the changes in water isotopes chloride and soil water below 2 m soil layers therefore our sampling process is reliable for data acquisition 5 conclusions in this study multiple tracers were used to label three critical water ages and their corresponding depths under different vegetation conditions on the loess plateau the amounts of new water of transpiration temporally originating from post planting precipitation and old water of transpiration temporally originating from pre planting precipitation were estimated over the vegetation lifespan using the water balance method for two sub profiles new water depths in the soil profile were about 5 0 m with a 22 year water age under the apple orchard and 7 4 m with a 17 year water age under the peach orchard while the maximum water age depths were 26 4 m for the 63 year water age and 19 6 m for the 45 year water age deep rooted vegetation mainly transpired new water accounting for about 94 97 of the total transpiration with a transpiration rate of 500 56 mm yr 1 under the apple orchard and 97 47 of the total transpiration with a transpiration rate of 485 52 mm yr 1 under the peach orchard these findings could improve our understanding of hydrological cycle partitioning into different compartments and fluxes in the unsaturated zone from the perspective of water age credit

2522,in this study a novel fully hybrid simulation optimization approach is proposed for enhancing the prediction performance of the conceptual technische universität wien tuw hydrological model in the simulation part of the proposed approach the tuw model is hybridized with a support vector regression svr model where svr directly uses the tuw model outputs as input and simulates the runoff process this hybridized simulation model is then integrated to a hybrid optimization approach where heuristic harmony search hs and nelder mead simplex nms optimization approaches are mutually integrated the objective of the hybrid hs nms optimization approach is to calibrate the associated parameter values of both tuw and svr models by maximizing the nash sutcliffe efficiency n s e calculated between simulated and observed runoff values the applicability of the proposed approach is evaluated on a murat sub basin of the gediz river basin grb in turkey for different simulation and optimization model combinations identified results indicated that the proposed fully hybrid simulation optimization approach not only efficiently calibrates the associated solution parameters but also improves the prediction performance of the tuw model keywords tuw model support vector regression harmony search nelder mead simplex hybrid optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction prediction of runoff time series is an important task in water resources planning and management studies since conversion of rainfall to runoff is a highly nonlinear process and influenced by numerous natural and anthropogenic factors accurate prediction of the runoff is usually difficult yuan and forshay 2021 alizadeh et al 2017 huo et al 2012 hydrological models are the key elements for runoff prediction studies by considering simplified versions of the real world systems including surface water groundwater etc although there are different classifications in literature hydrological models can be roughly classified under three groups empirical models conceptual models and physically based models devia et al 2015 empirical models get only the information from the existing data and provide a nonlinear relationship between input and output therefore they are also called as the data driven or black box models conceptual models include almost all elements of the natural system by considering several interconnected reservoirs consisting of the physical processes of rainfall evapotranspiration baseflow percolation etc their mathematical equations are simple and include some parameters that are usually adjusted through field data and or calibration physically based models include all the principles of the physical processes of the natural system they are dependent to the solution of the governing partial differential equations based on the measurable parameters in space and time devia et al 2015 among these models physically based models provide a large amount of information about the natural system however this outcome does not mean that physically based models always result with the best modeling outcomes compared to others the reason of this is usually associated with the requirements to the large amount of spatially distributed field data and meteorological hydrological time series about the system in the lack of these information there may be large uncertainties in the model results which make generalization ability of the model limited abott et al 1986 for such cases the conceptual models can be used as an alternative way since they do not require spatially distributed field data instead they use conceptual model parameters which represent the simplified expressions of the physical systems the performance of these models is usually based on simulated degree of complexity of the modeled system kumanlioglu and fistikoglu 2019 note that the complex models usually provide more information regarding the system since they better capture the nonlinear relationships between rainfall and runoff processes however their calibration and verification periods are usually difficult due to their large number of model parameters gan et al 1997 alternatively empirical models can also be used for runoff prediction problems by considering the data related with the rainfall and runoff processes recently many artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches such as the artificial neural networks ann support vector machines svm or deep learning algorithms dla have been employed to runoff time series prediction problems abrahart et al 2012 chang et al 2017 govindaraju and rao 2000 hosseini and mahjouri 2016 londhe and gavraskar 2018 malik et al 2020 tayfur 2012 zhang et al 2018 note that these empirical based black box models cannot provide detailed information regarding the conversion of rainfall to runoff process therefore use of only precipitation and evapotranspiration time series as the input of the empirical models may not be sufficient to precisely predict the future runoff due to absence of the existing autocorrelation in runoff series kumanlioglu and fistikoglu 2019 machado et al 2011 wu and chau 2011 for this purpose previously observed runoff values are considered as additional inputs in many studies to improve the prediction performance of the empirical models nowadays hybridized versions of the hydrological models have become popular tools to simulate the rainfall and runoff processes the main philosophy behind these models is to integrate the conceptual or physical models with the empirical ones in other words they integrate process driven and data driven models to improve the calibration and verification performances compared to their stand alone use nourani et al 2014 the current literature includes several studies that integrate different hydrological and data driven methods anctil and tape 2004 integrated the lumped génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier gr4j hydrological model with ann based data driven model in this integration antecedent precipitation index api and soil moisture index smi values obtained from gr4j model have been considered as the inputs of the ann model their model results indicated that the ann based hybrid model effectively represent the rainfall runoff process humphrey et al 2016 also integrated gr4j and ann models to solve monthly streamflow prediction problems in their model simulated soil moisture from gr4j is used to represent initial watershed conditions of a bayesian ann model chen and adams 2006 integrated different lumped semi distributed and integrated hydrological models with ann to simulate rainfall runoff process in their integration the spatial variation of rainfall the heterogeneity of watershed characteristics and their impacts on runoff can be investigated their results indicated that the integrated ann based approach provides more accurate results than those obtained by using the linear superposition of fluxes at watershed outlet young et al 2017 developed a hybrid modeling approach that integrates the physically based hec hms model with ann and svm based data driven models to predict hourly runoffs in crishan creek taiwan in their hybrid model hec hms is first used to simulate the rainfall runoff process and its output is used as the input of the ann and svm models together with the rainfall observations as can be seen from the studies above different conceptual or physical based models have been integrated with the data driven methods to develop hybrid modeling approaches the key similarity of the mentioned studies is that they use previous runoff observations as the input of the data driven methods it should be noted that in time series analyses in literature it is a standard practice to use the previous runoff observations to forecast the future runoff values a few time steps ahead however when the observed runoff values in future are not available for the long periods the accuracy of the runoff forecasting studies will be dependent on the accuracy of the previously predicted values in this context if the previously predicted values are not accurate the accuracy of the newly forecasted values will not be accurate if this process is applied for the long periods it might be possible to obtain error accumulations in the forecasted values as an expected behavior therefore development of a hydrological modeling approach without considering previous observed runoff values becomes important for the problems with long forecasting periods regarding this issue ghaith et al 2019 proposed a hybrid hydrological model that integrates the conceptual hydrological model hymod with ann in their model hymod model is executed several times for the randomly generated parameter values and the results providing a good prediction performance are used in the training process of the ann model note that the developed hybrid hydrological models have also been integrated to optimization models for calibrating the model parameters in this context kumanlioglu and fistikoglu 2019 developed a hybrid hydrological model that integrates the daily conceptual gr4j hydrological model with ann in an optimization framework where genetic algorithm ga is used in their model the internal structure of gr4j model is modified through ann approach and this hybridized model is integrated to ga for determining the related solution parameters according to their results this kind integration significantly improves the prediction performance compared to stand alone use of gr4j model the hybridization schemes mentioned above are related with the integration of the physical or conceptual hydrological models with the data driven approaches this kind of integration improves the prediction ability of the hydrological models than their single use note that there is another hybridization scheme in literature which are used to combine the optimization approaches these hybrid optimization approaches integrate different optimization algorithms which have different search characteristics in terms of the global and local search procedures ayvaz and elçi 2013 for such an integration the global optimization approaches start the search process with the multiple solution vectors and explores the entire search space to determine the possible location of the global optimum solution then the local search approaches get the results of the heuristic approaches as the initial solution and improves the solution by fine tuning the decision variable values ayvaz et al 2009 this integration improves the solution quality since it uses the diversification feature of the global approaches and intensification feature of the local search approaches rahami et al 2011 in this study a novel fully hybrid simulation optimization approach is proposed for enhancing the prediction performance of the hydrological models in the simulation part of the proposed approach the rainfall runoff process is simulated by using the conceptual technische universität wien tuw hydrological model to improve the prediction performance a nonlinear support vector regression svr model is integrated to the tuw model the integrated tuw svr model is then linked to a hybrid optimization approach where heuristic harmony search hs and the nelder mead simplex nms optimization approaches have been mutually integrated the main objective of the proposed hs nms optimization approach is to calibrate the parameters of both tuw and svr models by maximizing the nash sutcliffe efficiency n s e between the observed and simulated runoff values the applicability of the proposed fully hybrid simulation optimization approach is evaluated on gediz river basin by applying six approaches consisting of different combinations of simulation and optimization procedures furthermore a detailed sensitivity analysis has been conducted for all the approaches for different optimization parameter sets and random number seeds identified results indicated that the proposed fully hybrid simulation optimization approach significantly improves the calibration and verification performances compared to the stand alone application of the conceptual tuw model 2 model development 2 1 technische universität wien tuw hydrological model the daily rainfall runoff process in this paper is simulated by using the conceptual tuw hydrological model merz 2002 merz and blöschl 2004 parajka et al 2007 tuw model follows the computational structure of the hbv hydrologiska byråns vattenavdelning hydrological model bergstrom 1976 lindström 1997 and simulates rainfall runoff process by using the inputs of the total precipitation mean temperature and potential evapotranspiration it can simulate the rainfall runoff process for both lumped and semi distributed cases in the lumped case the input data is averaged for the whole basin area on the other hand they are being distributed over different elevation zones in the semi distributed case depending on the relative areas of each zone brziak et al 2020 the conceptual structure of the semi distributed tuw model can be seen in fig 1 as can be seen from fig 1 the model computes daily runoff by means of the snow soil response and routing modules the snow module uses degree day approach to simulate the snow accumulation or meting process by using the degree day factor d d f and melting temperature t m parameters the parameter of snow correction factor s c f is used to correct the catch deficit of the precipitation gages while snowfall occurs to distinguish the type of the precipitation i e rainfall snowfall or mixture of rainfall and snowfall a threshold temperature interval t r t s is used where t r and t s represent the rainfall and snowfall threshold temperatures respectively parajka et al 2007 since the original tuw model has no feature to correct the precipitation and temperature data for each elevation zone it is modified by including two additional parameters dp e l e v and dt e l e v to perform this task note that the parameters of dp e l e v and dt e l e v represent the linear precipitation increase and linear temperature decrease c per 100 m above mean sea level respectively the soil module works for simulating the runoff generation and changes in the soil moisture state by considering three parameters fc l p r a t β among them fc represents the maximum soil moisture storage l p r a t is used to limit the potential evapotranspiration and β is used to control the nonlinearity of the runoff generation sleziak et al 2018 the response module simulates the runoff on the hillslopes by using two reservoirs the upper zone reservoir gets the excess rainfall and diverts it to outside through three different paths flowing out from the reservoir s outlet based on a fast storage coefficient k 1 exceeding the reservoir s storage state ls u z and flowing through an additional outlet based on a very fast storage coefficient k 0 or percolating towards the lower zone with a constant rate c p e r c the lower soil zone diverts its storage to outside based on a slow storage coefficient k 2 the routing module gets the aggregated outflows of both reservoirs and routes flow by using a triangular transfer function based on two parameters where c r o u t e is a free scaling parameter and b m a x is the maximum base at low flows parajka et al 2007 note that in original version of the tuw model the rainfall runoff process is simulated via snow soil response and routing modules by using the 15 calibration parameters sleziak et al 2018 however this value is increased to 17 in this study with inclusion of two additional parameters in the snow model the names units and the possible ranges of these parameters have been listed in table 1 note that values of these parameters are all determined by using the proposed hybrid optimization approach detailed information about the structure of the tuw model can be found in parajka et al 2007 2 2 support vector regression svr model svm first proposed by boser et al 1992 is one of the most important supervised machine learning approaches in literature although svm is developed to solve the classification problems based on the statistical learning theory recently it is also applied to the solution of the nonlinear regression problems dibike et al 2001 karahan et al 2014 malik et al 2020 in both applications the main objective is to classify the data by locating an n dimensional hyperplane among them the data points which this hyperplane is in contact are called as the support vectors and the objective is defined as to seek the best position of the hyperplane depending on these support vectors this process requires of transforming the regression problem into a quadratic problem qp and then solving by means of an optimization approach solution of a regression problem by using the svm is as follows let n be the number of training data x i be the i th input data of the training data set y i be the corresponding i t h output data i 1 2 3 n the objective of the svr is to solve the regression problem by mapping this training data into a high dimensional feature space based on the following regression equation 1 y x i ω ϕ x i b where ω is the weight vector ϕ is the mapping function that transforms the data from input space to feature space and b is the bias of the hyperplane an appropriate svr function can be obtained by minimizing the following convex optimization problem 2 j min 1 2 ω 2 subject to 3 y i ω ϕ x i b ε where j is the objective function to be minimized 2 is the euclidian norm and ε is the residual margin which indicates the performance of the optimization process note that there may be possibility of no such function to satisfy these constraints for all the data points therefore the optimization problem should be converted to the following form by including the slack variables to allow regression errors based on the soft margin concept 4 j min 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i subject to y i ω ϕ x i b ε ξ i ω ϕ x i b y i ε ξ i ξ i 0 5 ξ i 0 where ξ i and ξ i are the slack variables and c is the box constraint which is used to control the penalty value imposed on observations that lie outside the ε margin to solve the optimization formulation given above the results of the nonlinear regression equation can be stated in dual form by means of the lagrange function as follows 6 y x i j 1 n α j α j k x i x j b where α j and α j are the dual variables and k x i x j is the kernel function which is calculated by taking the inner product of x i and x j several kernel functions are available in literature including linear polynomial gaussian etc among them the gaussian kernel function is used as follows 7 k x i x j e x p γ x i x j 2 where γ is the kernel constant after these definitions dual form of the optimization formulation becomes a qp problem as follows 8 l min 1 2 i 1 n j 1 n k x i x j α i α i α j α j ε i 1 n α i α i i 1 n y i α i α i subject to i 1 n α i α i 0 0 α i c 9 0 α i c the solution this qp problem provides the optimum values of α i s and α i s for this solution the required solution parameters are c γ and ε which are all determined by using the proposed hybrid optimization approach note that matlab s built in svr library is used in this study to train the regression model and to predict corresponding results for the given input data 2 3 harmony search hs optimization approach hs is a heuristic optimization approach inspired by the observation that a group of musicians seeks for the best state of harmony this musical process is analogous to engineering optimization since the aim of the optimization is to seek for a global optimum solution this analogy between musical improvisation and engineering optimization was first presented by geem et al 2001 in this context the musicians in the group correspond to decision variables of the optimization problem and the collection of the notes in their memories correspond to the potential values of the decision variables note that musicians generate a new harmony depending on three musical processes i by playing the pitches in their harmony memory ii by playing the slightly adjusted pitches of the previously played pitches in their harmony memory iii by playing random pitches without considering their harmony memory note that geem et al 2001 mathematically formulated these musical processes to solve an optimization problem based on the following rules i memory consideration ii pitch adjusting iii random selection combination of these three rules is used to generate a new harmony solution vector from the current harmony memory if this new generated harmony produces better objective function value than the worst stored one in harmony memory the vector with the worst objective function value is replaced with the new generated solution vector and this process is repeated until satisfying the termination criterion this computational structure can be seen as a pseudo code in fig 2 as can be seen from fig 2 the search process via hs consists of the 5 steps the first step aims to randomly generate the harmony memory and calculate the corresponding objective function values the second step aims to generate the new solution vector from harmony memory or from possible random range based on memory consideration and random selection the third step is used to perform the pitch adjusting process in the fourth step the newly generated solution vector is compared to the worst solution vector in harmony memory in terms of the objective function values if this newly generated harmony is better than the worst one in harmony memory the worst one is replaced with the new one the final step is used to control if termination criterion is satisfied or not to solve an optimization problem depending on these steps it is required to provide some solution parameters which are harmony memory size h m s harmony memory considering rate h m c r pitch adjusting rate p a r and the bandwidth b w hm is the main solution matrix in which values of the decision variables and the corresponding objective function values are stored the value of hms is usually set depending on the problem type hmcr is the probability of selecting the new decision variables from hm or not it is an important parameter such that for low hmcr values speed of the convergence reduces since only few elite harmonies are selected from the hm on the other hand high hmcr values lead to selection of the decision variables mostly from hm and prevent the exploration of random possibilities yang 2009 the parameter of par is used to decide if the newly selected solution vector from hm will be subjected to pitch adjusting or not note that the pitch adjusting process is used to maintain the diversity of the solution ayvaz 2009 for the solutions with low par parameters slow convergence is observed due to the exploration of a small subspace on the other hand a high value of par may cause the algorithm to work like a random search yang 2009 the final parameter bw is used to determine the magnitude of the change of the decision variables in pitch adjusting process this is also an important parameter since its value influences the convergence behavior note that the value of bw is usually adjusted based on the lower and upper bounds of the decision variables as in the other heuristic optimization algorithms values of these solution parameters significantly influence the identified results therefore a detailed sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the algorithm performance for different parameter combinations 2 4 nelder mead simplex nms approach nms first proposed by nelder and mead 1965 is a well known direct optimization approach for solving the multidimensional unconstrained optimization problems it is completely different from the classical simplex method for solving the constrained linear programming problems nms is suitable for the problems with non smooth or discontinuous solution spaces since it does not require any gradient information to find a search direction instead it relies on a simple direct search in which the parameter estimates are selected based on the knowledge gained in prior iterations to identify good estimates to reject bad estimates and to generate better estimates from the search pattern of the good estimates u s army corps of engineers 2000 depending on the simple structure the nms is utilized by the hydrologic engineering center hydrologic modeling system hec hms u s army corps of engineers 2000 as the built in optimization tool for calibrating the associated model parameters furthermore the current literature also includes some studies that uses the nms in hydrological modeling abida 2009 barati 2011 jérôme et al 2021 the pseudo code of the nms optimization approach can be seen in fig 3 note that the built in optimization toolbox of the matlab includes an nms module in this context the bound constrained modification of this nms module d errico 2022 is used in this study 2 5 development of hybrid hs nms optimization approach one of the important features of the proposed approach is the hybridized use of the hs and nms optimization approaches hs is a global heuristic optimization approach and applied to many problems in different fields of science although hs is very efficient in globally exploring the entire search space its local search ability is usually weak that is why some improved variants of it has been proposed in literature ayvaz 2009 feng et al 2017 fesanghary et al 2008 jang et al 2008 similar outcomes can also be observed for nms that although the approach is very efficient its convergence behavior is extremely sensitive to the selected starting points zahara and kao 2009 therefore integration of these two optimization approaches can allow to obtain the better optimization results than those obtained by using their stand alone use note that there are some studies in literature where hs and nms approaches have been integrated in the hybrid optimization framework feng et al 2017 jang et al 2008 although both models are also integrated in this work the followed hybridization structure is different from them note that the newly proposed hybrid hs nms optimization approach has two options for integrating the global and local search procedures in the first option the problem is first solved by using hs after termination nms gets the results of hs as the initial solution and improves solution by fine tuning the decision variable values in the second option hs generates a new solution vector by means of the random selection memory consideration and pitch adjusting processes once the condition that the newly generated solution vector is better than the worst one has been satisfied this newly generated solution is subjected to the local search by nms this hybridization option indicates that the local search procedure is just applied to the solutions with better objective function values than the worst stored one in hm note that the nms based local search model is just executed once in the first option however it is executed many times in the second option and this process significantly increases the computational cost of the optimization process therefore execution of the nms based local search model is adjusted based on a local search probability p c when this probability is satisfied by the model the corresponding harmony is subjected to local search in the proposed hybrid hs nms optimization approach note that the second hybridization strategy has been used in this study by considering a small p c value depending on this hybridization strategy fig 4 shows the pseudo code of the hybrid hs nms optimization approach by modifying the step 4 of the stand alone hs fig 2 2 6 integration of simulation and optimization models as indicated previously the objective of the proposed fully hybrid simulation optimization approach is to improve the prediction performance of the conceptual tuw hydrological model for this purpose six different approaches namely hs tuw nms tuw hs nms tuw hs tuw svr nms tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr are proposed in hs tuw approach the 17 model parameters see table 1 of the modified tuw hydrological model are calibrated by using the hs based optimization model in this integration hs determines the possible values of the calibration parameters and transfer them to tuw model then tuw simulates the rainfall runoff process and computes the runoff values at the watershed s outlet after this process the simulated and observed runoff values are evaluated and this information is passed back to the optimization model in nms tuw approach the same solution methodology is followed by hs tuw and the key difference is the use of the nms optimization method therefore the performance of a local search approach is evaluated by directly changing hs with nms in the optimization model in hs nms tuw both hs and nms are used in the optimization model by considering the previously mentioned hybridization approach where the results of hs are subjected to local search by nms based on the probability of p c in hs tuw svr approach similarly the parameters of the modified tuw model are determined by using the stand alone hs the difference of this approach from hs tuw is that the results of tuw are used by the svr model to improve the prediction performance by means of a hybrid modeling approach in this integration svr model gets the outcomes of the soil response and the routing modules of the tuw model as the input data then hs additionally determines the values of 3 calibration parameters c γ and ε and trains the svr model to calculate its output as the simulated runoff values similarly the simulated and observed runoff values are then evaluated and this information is passed to the optimization model to adjust the values of the tuw and svr model parameters similarly in nms tuw svr model the same tasks with hs tuw svr are performed by just changing the global hs based optimization model with a local nms based model in the last approach hs nms tuw svr a fully hybridized modeling approach is followed such a way that hs based optimization approach has been hybridized with nms and tuw hydrological model has been hybridized with svr therefore the influence of both hybrid optimization and hybrid hydrological modeling approach is evaluated fig 5 shows the flowchart of the proposed fully hybrid approach which describes how the hybridized simulation and optimization processes are integrated as can be seen the optimization model executes the simulation model for each optimization cycle while simulation model consists of just tuw model in hs tuw nms tuw or hs nms tuw it includes both tuw and svr models in hs tuw svr nms tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr approaches 2 7 problem formulation the problem of calibrating the parameters of the modified tuw hydrological model can be solved by using hs tuw nms tuw hs nms tuw hs tuw svr nms tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr approaches in all approaches the final part of the simulation model includes the calculation of the objective function value in literature different error indicators are used as the objective function among them the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 has been used as the objective function in the proposed approach by using nse the optimization problem can be mathematically formulated as follows 10 nse m a x 1 i 1 n t q i q i 2 i 1 n t q i q 2 subject to 11 x k min x k x k max 12 x k x x 1 x 2 x 3 x n d where n t is the number of time steps in the observation period q i and q i are the observed and simulated runoff values at i t h time step i 1 2 3 n t respectively q is the mean of the observed runoff values n d is the number of decision variables of the optimization model x k is the k t h decision variable of the optimization model k 1 2 3 n d x is the set of the decision variables x k min and x k max are the lower and upper bounds of the k t h decision variable as can be seen from the optimization formulation given above the objective of the proposed hybrid optimization approach is to determine the elements of the decision variable set x by maximizing the nse value note that the value of nse changes between and 1 where a value of 1 means a perfect match between the observed and simulated values a value of nse less than zero indicates that the mean value of the observed data would have been a better predictor than the model krause et al 2005 it should be noted that the performance of the optimization process has also been evaluated by means of the kling gupta efficiency k g e and percent bias p b i a s indicators whose mathematical definitions are given as follows gupta et al 2009 13 kge 1 r 1 2 σ σ 2 μ μ 2 14 p b i a s i 1 n t q i q i i 1 n t q i 100 where r is the correlation coefficient between the observed and simulated runoffs σ and σ are the standard deviation of the observed and simulated flows respectively μ and μ are the mean of the observed and simulated flows respectively similar to nse the kge value changes between and 1 and a value of 1 means a perfect match between the observed and simulated values on the other hand the value of pbias is used to evaluate the bias between the observed and simulated values the desired value pbias is 0 and its positive and negative values correspond to underestimation and overestimation biases respectively moriasi et al 2007 note that the prediction performance of the hydrological models can be evaluated based on the calculated values of nse kge and pbias as given in table 2 kalin et al 2010 3 study area the assessment of the proposed simulation optimization approach is evaluated on gediz river basin grb which is in the western part of turkey fig 6 grb has a drainage area of 17 500 km2 which corresponds about 2 of the turkey s total area the main river branch of the basin is the gediz river consisting of 386 km long river branch which originates from the murat mountain and flows towards the aegean sea the data used in this study belongs to the murat basin which is one of the sub basins of grb note that murat sub basin is in the upstream part of the grb and has a drainage area of 3272 4 km2 which approximately corresponds to the 19 of the area of grb fig 6 shows the location map of the murat sub basin on grb and turkey note that this basin was previously used by different researchers by using various daily or monthly hydrological modeling approaches turan and doğan 2015 turan and yurdusev 2016 okkan et al 2017 okkan and kırdemir 2019 kumanlioglu and fistikoglu 2019 the key similarity of these previous modeling efforts is that the used hydrological models are lumped that is why the semi distributed tuw hydrological model is selected in this study note that fig 6 also shows two additional sub basins in gray filled which are the demirci and deliinis sub basins the applicability of the proposed approach is also tested for these basins in terms of different hydro meteorological data and basin characteristics detailed information about this additional evaluation is given in section 5 the parameters of the modified tuw hydrological model and svr are calibrated by using the flow observations on the stream gage eie 523 acisu located at the outlet of the murat sub basin fig 6 in this context the flow observations between 2002 and 2006 are supplied from the state hydraulic works dsi of turkey among them the data for 2002 water year is used for model warm up period the data for 2003 and 2004 water years are used for model calibration and the data for 2005 and 2006 water years are used for model verification note that the modified tuw model requires three inputs for converting the rainfall to runoff which are the areal mean precipitation areal mean temperature and evapotranspiration in this context the precipitation and temperature data of 17188 uşak 17746 demirci 17748 simav and 17750 gediz meteorological gages fig 4 are collected and converted into areal precipitation and temperature time series by means of the thiessen polygon approach the corresponding polygon weights are 56 5 4 4 8 2 and 30 9 respectively evapotranspiration time series are calculated by using the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the statistics of the flow and the meteorological observation data for the warm up calibration and verification periods are listed in table 3 4 model results in this section modeling results of the hs tuw nms tuw hs nms tuw hs tuw svr nms tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr solution approaches are evaluated for different conditions for all the solutions the lower and upper bounds of the modified tuw calibration parameters are taken as given in table 1 after this process the associated hs solution parameters need to be given before starting the search process as the other heuristic search methods in literature selection of the appropriate parameter values is an important stage in hs since accuracy of the solutions mostly depends on these parameter values as indicated previously hs has 4 solution parameters which are the hms hmcr par and bw among them bw is usually adjusted by considering the lower x k min and upper x k max bounds of the decision variables k 1 2 3 n d therefore its value is set to bw x k max x k min 100 for all the solutions for the other parameters a detailed sensitivity analysis has been conducted to evaluate the algorithm s performance for different parameter combinations in this context the results of the proposed approach have been evaluated by considering two scenarios in scenario 1 different hs parameter combinations have been generated by considering the following discrete values hms 10 20 30 40 hmcr 0 80 0 85 0 90 0 95 and par 0 35 0 40 0 45 0 50 using these parameter values the proposed approach has been executed for 4 3 64 parameter realizations so that the variation of each parameter relative to each other is considered fig 7 after solving the problem for these parameter values the solution with the maximum objective function value has been selected as the best solution and the corresponding hs parameter values have been recorded then in scenario 2 the problem has been solved 10 times again by considering these parameter sets the reason of these additional solutions is to evaluate the performance and robustness of the optimization model for different random number seeds all the solutions in scenarios 1 and 2 have been conducted by setting the maximum number of improvisations to 10 000 furthermore the probability of p c is taken as 0 05 for the solutions with hybrid optimization since use of this small probability is sufficient according to the previous trials after defining different parameter realizations each approach i e hs tuw hs nms tuw hs tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr is executed 64 times in scenario 1 by considering the parameter values in fig 7 note that the optimization model aims to determine the parameter values of the modified tuw as well as the svr models by maximizing eq 10 subject to eqs 11 and 12 this parameter estimation procedure is conducted by using the flow observations of the murat basin for the calibration period 2003 2004 water years after obtaining the model results the outcome of each solution is also evaluated for the verification period 2005 2006 water years for hs tuw hs nms tuw hs tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr approaches statistical evaluation of the identified solutions can be seen in table 4 for calibration and verification periods in scenario 1 note that scenario 1 does not include outcomes for nms tuw and nms tuw svr approaches since hs based optimization model is not used in these approaches it can be seen from table 4 that the optimization model resulted with the mean nse value of 0 9176 for hs tuw 0 9239 for hs nms tuw 0 9273 for hs tuw svr and 0 9354 for hs nms tuw svr approaches respectively for the best solutions of the 64 model executions the final nse values have been obtained as 0 9341 for hs tuw 0 9356 for hs nms tuw 0 9442 for hs tuw svr and 0 9476 for hs nms tuw svr approaches respectively these results indicate that inclusion of nms to the optimization model improves the calibration accuracy compared to the stand alone use of hs similarly inclusion of svr to the simulation model improves the calibration accuracy compared to the stand alone use of the tuw model when the identified results are evaluated in terms of their verification performances it is seen that inclusion of nms to the optimization model reduces the nse value from 0 6910 to 0 6573 for the best solutions in scenario 1 however inclusion of svr to the simulation model significantly improves the verification accuracy such that the final nse value is increased from 0 6910 to 0 8222 in hs tuw svr compared to hs tuw similarly inclusion of nms to the optimization model increases the verification nse from 0 8222 to 0 8458 these results indicate that use of the fully hybrid solution strategy significantly increases solution accuracy especially for the verification period after obtaining these results in scenario 1 the hs parameter sets giving the best calibration results are determined as given in table 4 using these parameter values each solution approach is executed 10 times in scenario 2 for different random number seeds note that these different seed values are also used in nms tuw and nms tuw svr approaches during determination of the initial solutions before execution of the search procedure table 4 also includes the results of these 10 model executions in scenario 2 as can be seen the results of scenario 2 have also the same trends with those obtained in scenario 1 for 10 model executions of each solution approach the mean nse values in calibration period are obtained as 0 9276 for hs tuw 0 9293 for hs nms tuw 0 9393 for hs tuw svr and 0 9506 for hs nms tuw svr approaches respectively these results indicate that inclusion of nms and svr also improves the calibration accuracy in scenario 2 as obtained in scenario 1 as expected the overall model improvements are better than scenario 1 since all the model executions are conducted with the best hs parameter sets this result can also be observed in the calculated standard deviations such that all the approaches are resulted with the lower values than those obtained in scenario 1 table 4 also includes the results of nms tuw and nms tuw svr approaches which are also evaluated in scenario 2 as indicated previously the optimization model just consists of the nms based local search model in these approaches while keeping all the remaining parts are the same with hs tuw and hs tuw svr as can be seen the mean nse values for nms tuw and nms tuw svr approaches are obtained as 0 8172 and 0 8696 and these values are lower than the ones those obtained by using the hs tuw and hs tuw svr approaches respectively the same outcome is also obtained for the best solutions where the final nse values are lower than the ones obtained for hs tuw and hs tuw svr approaches respectively note that the results of nms tuw and nms tuw svr approaches also indicate that inclusion of svr to the simulation model improves the solution accuracy as an expected behavior for the best solutions of each approach in scenario 2 the simulated runoff hydrographs have been compared with the observed ones in fig 8 for the calibration and verification periods as can be seen from fig 8 observed runoff hydrograph in the calibration period is well captured by each solution approach on the other hand there are some deviations in the verification period such that the first peak around the year of 2005 is not accurately captured by hs tuw nms tuw and hs nms tuw approaches there are also some oscillations of the simulated runoff values around march 2006 for the same models however those problems have not been observed in hs tuw svr nms tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr models such a way that inclusion of svr to the simulation model has significantly increased the prediction performance for the verification period note that fig 8 also includes the prediction ranges of scenario 2 light green for 10 different model executions it is seen that in the calibration period the results of different model executions have wider prediction ranges for nms tuw approach than the others the best prediction ranges have been observed for hs nms tuw svr approach for the verification period again the widest prediction range has been observed for nms tuw approach for the best calibration results for scenario 2 the final calculated nse kge and pbias values have been given in table 5 as can be seen while the best calibration nse has been obtained for hs nms tuw svr approach the same is not valid for the other indicators instead the best kge and pbias values have been observed for hs nms tuw approach for the verification period while the best nse and pbias values have been obtained for hs nms tuw svr the best kge is observed for hs tuw svr approach note that the overall evaluation of nse kge and pbias values for both calibration and verification periods indicates that the prediction performances of each approach are very good according to the performance ratings given in table 2 for these solutions the final decision variable values can be seen in table 6 as can be seen all the approaches determined the parameter values in the provided ranges given in table 1 it should be noted that all the best results given above are determined by selecting the solutions with the maximum nse values in the calibration period in this context an additional evaluation has also been followed by selecting the solutions with the maximum nse values in the verification period as the best solutions fig 9 shows the results of this evaluation in terms of the scatter plots for each approach as can be seen hs tuw svr approach has the highest verification nse value 0 8609 in this analysis although hs nms tuw svr had the highest value 0 8328 in the previous analysis however the highest calibration nse value 0 9555 has been obtained again in hs nms tuw svr approach just as observed in the previous analysis the results of this analysis indicate that all the approaches again resulted with the similar outcomes even if the best solution selection strategy is changed 5 performance evaluation for different basins as indicated in the previous sections the proposed simulation optimization approach provided efficient calibration and verification results for all the proposed approaches however it is also essential to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach for different basins in terms of different hydrometeorological data and basin characteristics for this purpose applicability of the proposed six approaches is evaluated for demirci and deliinis sub basins of grb fig 10 shows location of these basins together with the corresponding digital elevation models dem fig 10 also shows locations of the stream and meteorological gages which are used for developing the hydrological models as can be seen from fig 10 eie 522 borlu and eie 515 topuzdamlari stream gages are located at the outlet of demirci and deliinis sub basins respectively note that tuw hydrological model for demirci sub basin is developed by using the flow data of 2000 2001 water years for warm up 2002 2003 water years for calibration and 2004 2005 water years for verification periods similarly deliinis sub basin is developed by using the flow data of 1997 water year for warm up 1998 2003 water years for calibration and 2004 2006 water years for verification periods as indicated previously tuw hydrological model requires the areal mean precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration time series for converting rainfall to runoff these data are supplied from 5278 koprubasi 17746 demirci and 17748 simav meteorological gages the statistics of the flow and the meteorological observation data for the warm up calibration and verification periods are given in tables 7 and 8 for demirci and deliinis sub basins respectively after processing the meteorological and hydrological data the proposed simulation optimization approach is executed for six different approaches hs tuw nms tuw hs nms tuw hs tuw svr nms tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr all the approaches are executed 10 times as in scenario 2 in the previous analysis to evaluate the model results for different random number seeds table 9 presents the statistical evaluation of these 10 model executions for both demirci and deliinis sub basins as can be seen from table 9 for demirci sub basin the mean nse values are obtained as 0 8695 and 0 8843 for hs tuw and hs nms tuw approaches respectively similarly the mean nse values are obtained as 0 9173 and 0 9234 for hs tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr approaches respectively these outcomes indicate that inclusion of nms to the optimization model statistically improves the model identification results similarly inclusion of svr to the simulation model also significantly improves the solution accuracy as similar with the model identification results of murat sub basin for the solutions without global optimization the accuracy of the model results is obtained low such that nms tuw model is resulted with the mean nse value of 0 7270 and this result is lower than the one obtained for hs tuw model similarly nms tuw svr approach is resulted with the mean nse value of 0 8292 and this value is lower than the one obtained for hs tuw svr this outcome indicates the importance of using the global or global local hybrid optimization approach in the optimization model rather than directly using the local search approach however inclusion of svr to the simulation part again improves the solution accuracy even if the local search method is used in the optimization model note that the model outcomes of the deliinis sub basin have also the similar trends in terms of the identified solutions for the best calibration results of both basins the final nse kge and pbias values are provided in table 10 as can be seen from table 10 for the calibration period the best nse is obtained for hs nms tuw svr approach for both demirci and deliinis subbasins on the other hand the best kge and pbias values are obtained for hs nms tuw svr approach in demirci and for hs nms tuw approach in deliinis sub basins respectively for the verification period the best nse is again obtained for hs nms tuw svr approach for both demirci and deliinis subbasins on the other hand the best kge and pbias values are obtained for hs nms tuw svr and hs tuw svr approaches in demirci and deliinis sub basins respectively according to the performance ratings presented in table 2 the overall prediction performances for both calibration and verification periods are obtained as good or very good for both sub basins 6 discussion as can be seen from the results presented above the proposed fully hybrid simulation optimization approach can effectively predict the runoff values by considering different combinations of the simulation and optimization approaches in the following sections the critical issues regarding the proposed approach are discussed in the optimization model the heuristic hs optimization approach has been hybridized with local nms approach which is available in the optimization toolbox of the matlab platform in the classical nms module of the matlab it is not possible to define the lower and upper bounds for the decision variables and this process in some cases leads to obtain negative parameter values for the svr model therefore there may be possibility of obtaining errors during the search process to eliminate this problem the bound constrained modification of the built in nms module which is developed by d errico 2022 has been used although this modified module can effectively determine the parameter values satisfying the bound constraints it may increase the number of iterations to find a bound constrained solution the developed hybrid optimization methodology in this study uses the regular hs optimization approach in literature different improved versions of the hs optimization approach are available degertekin 2012 geem 2006 jaberipour and khorram 2010 mahdavi et al 2007 ouyang et al 2017 zeng and dong 2016 in this context the prediction performance of the proposed approach can be improved by using these modified versions which is the beyond the scope of this work the proposed hybrid hs nms approach considers the hybridization strategy presented in ayvaz et al 2009 where the classical hs is hybridized with excel solver optimization routine in vba platform in this hybridization strategy the local search module is executed by the global search module based on a probability p c according to the previous trials use of a small probability value such as 0 05 or 0 10 can be sufficient to find the improved solutions however it may be possible to use higher probability values for different problems and this may increase the computational cost of the optimization model in the proposed approach the runoff prediction problem has been solved by calibrating the tuw model parameters by maximizing the nse values between the simulated and observed runoff values in other words the model is calibrated by considering a single objective function however the conceptual tuw hydrological model can also simulate the soil moisture or the snow related calculations in this context the calibration process can also be conducted by using an additional objective function in terms of these additional computations under multi objective optimization framework one of the important contributions of this study is the use of the svr in the simulation part as indicated previously there are some studies in literature which use svm and other data driven approaches for predicting the runoff values however those studies usually use the previous runoff observations as the input of the data driven approaches this study eliminates this problem by directly using the tuw model outputs as the input of the svr model without using the previous runoff observations by executing the tuw svr approach for the generated parameter values by the optimization model the calibration and verification performance of the stand alone tuw model can be improved however this kind of solution strategy requires to execute the tuw model and to train the svr approach for each optimization cycle and this process may increase the computational cost especially for the long simulation periods in all the svr calculations the matlab s built in svr routine has been used this routine uses three parameters c γ and ε to characterize the support vectors and perform a regression analysis although matlab includes built in solution approaches to determine these parameter values they may require long computation time since svr model is executed for each optimization cycle use of the built in solution approaches significantly increases the computational cost therefore these three parameters have also been determined by using the proposed optimization approach by considering them as additional decision variables in the proposed approach the tuw model is modified by including two additional parameters dp e l e v and dt e l e v to simulate precipitation increase and temperature decrease with elevation together with these parameters the modified version of the tuw model includes total 17 calibration parameters note that these parameter values can be decreased by replacing the lumped response and routing modules with svr just as given in the study of kumanlioglu and fistikoglu 2019 where the lumped gr4j model is modified with ann however this modification is also beyond the scope of this work the performance of the proposed fully hybrid simulation optimization approach is evaluated by modeling the rainfall runoff process on murat sub basin according to the identified results inclusion of nms to the optimization model improves the solution accuracy similarly inclusion of svr to the simulation model also improves the solution accuracy depending on these outcomes the best prediction and verification results for murat sub basin is obtained for hs nms tuw svr which is the fully hybrid simulation optimization approach however it is essential to evaluate whether the performance of the proposed approach will be the same for different sizes of watersheds or not therefore the applicability of the proposed approach is also evaluated for two additional sub basins of the grb which are the demirci and deliinis sub basins according to the identification results all the approaches are resulted with the solutions in similar trends with those obtained for the murat sub basin 7 conclusion in this study a novel fully hybrid simulation optimization approach is proposed for solving the runoff prediction problems the proposed approach uses the conceptual semi distributed tuw hydrological model in the simulation model to improve the prediction performance during the simulation stage the tuw model is hybridized with a nonlinear svr approach which directly uses the outcome of the tuw model as input and simulates the runoff values as output this hybridized simulation model is then integrated to an optimization model where hybrid hs nms optimization approach is used the hs nms approach mutually integrates the global exploration capability of hs and local fine tuning capability of nms optimization approaches depending on these hybridization schemes it is proposed six approaches which are hs tuw nms tuw hs nms tuw hs tuw svr nms tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr the performance of each approach is evaluated for different hs parameter sets and random number seeds the applicability of the proposed four approaches have been evaluated on the murat sub basin of grb in turkey identified results indicated that the proposed fully hybrid simulation optimization approach can significantly increase the

2522,in this study a novel fully hybrid simulation optimization approach is proposed for enhancing the prediction performance of the conceptual technische universität wien tuw hydrological model in the simulation part of the proposed approach the tuw model is hybridized with a support vector regression svr model where svr directly uses the tuw model outputs as input and simulates the runoff process this hybridized simulation model is then integrated to a hybrid optimization approach where heuristic harmony search hs and nelder mead simplex nms optimization approaches are mutually integrated the objective of the hybrid hs nms optimization approach is to calibrate the associated parameter values of both tuw and svr models by maximizing the nash sutcliffe efficiency n s e calculated between simulated and observed runoff values the applicability of the proposed approach is evaluated on a murat sub basin of the gediz river basin grb in turkey for different simulation and optimization model combinations identified results indicated that the proposed fully hybrid simulation optimization approach not only efficiently calibrates the associated solution parameters but also improves the prediction performance of the tuw model keywords tuw model support vector regression harmony search nelder mead simplex hybrid optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction prediction of runoff time series is an important task in water resources planning and management studies since conversion of rainfall to runoff is a highly nonlinear process and influenced by numerous natural and anthropogenic factors accurate prediction of the runoff is usually difficult yuan and forshay 2021 alizadeh et al 2017 huo et al 2012 hydrological models are the key elements for runoff prediction studies by considering simplified versions of the real world systems including surface water groundwater etc although there are different classifications in literature hydrological models can be roughly classified under three groups empirical models conceptual models and physically based models devia et al 2015 empirical models get only the information from the existing data and provide a nonlinear relationship between input and output therefore they are also called as the data driven or black box models conceptual models include almost all elements of the natural system by considering several interconnected reservoirs consisting of the physical processes of rainfall evapotranspiration baseflow percolation etc their mathematical equations are simple and include some parameters that are usually adjusted through field data and or calibration physically based models include all the principles of the physical processes of the natural system they are dependent to the solution of the governing partial differential equations based on the measurable parameters in space and time devia et al 2015 among these models physically based models provide a large amount of information about the natural system however this outcome does not mean that physically based models always result with the best modeling outcomes compared to others the reason of this is usually associated with the requirements to the large amount of spatially distributed field data and meteorological hydrological time series about the system in the lack of these information there may be large uncertainties in the model results which make generalization ability of the model limited abott et al 1986 for such cases the conceptual models can be used as an alternative way since they do not require spatially distributed field data instead they use conceptual model parameters which represent the simplified expressions of the physical systems the performance of these models is usually based on simulated degree of complexity of the modeled system kumanlioglu and fistikoglu 2019 note that the complex models usually provide more information regarding the system since they better capture the nonlinear relationships between rainfall and runoff processes however their calibration and verification periods are usually difficult due to their large number of model parameters gan et al 1997 alternatively empirical models can also be used for runoff prediction problems by considering the data related with the rainfall and runoff processes recently many artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches such as the artificial neural networks ann support vector machines svm or deep learning algorithms dla have been employed to runoff time series prediction problems abrahart et al 2012 chang et al 2017 govindaraju and rao 2000 hosseini and mahjouri 2016 londhe and gavraskar 2018 malik et al 2020 tayfur 2012 zhang et al 2018 note that these empirical based black box models cannot provide detailed information regarding the conversion of rainfall to runoff process therefore use of only precipitation and evapotranspiration time series as the input of the empirical models may not be sufficient to precisely predict the future runoff due to absence of the existing autocorrelation in runoff series kumanlioglu and fistikoglu 2019 machado et al 2011 wu and chau 2011 for this purpose previously observed runoff values are considered as additional inputs in many studies to improve the prediction performance of the empirical models nowadays hybridized versions of the hydrological models have become popular tools to simulate the rainfall and runoff processes the main philosophy behind these models is to integrate the conceptual or physical models with the empirical ones in other words they integrate process driven and data driven models to improve the calibration and verification performances compared to their stand alone use nourani et al 2014 the current literature includes several studies that integrate different hydrological and data driven methods anctil and tape 2004 integrated the lumped génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier gr4j hydrological model with ann based data driven model in this integration antecedent precipitation index api and soil moisture index smi values obtained from gr4j model have been considered as the inputs of the ann model their model results indicated that the ann based hybrid model effectively represent the rainfall runoff process humphrey et al 2016 also integrated gr4j and ann models to solve monthly streamflow prediction problems in their model simulated soil moisture from gr4j is used to represent initial watershed conditions of a bayesian ann model chen and adams 2006 integrated different lumped semi distributed and integrated hydrological models with ann to simulate rainfall runoff process in their integration the spatial variation of rainfall the heterogeneity of watershed characteristics and their impacts on runoff can be investigated their results indicated that the integrated ann based approach provides more accurate results than those obtained by using the linear superposition of fluxes at watershed outlet young et al 2017 developed a hybrid modeling approach that integrates the physically based hec hms model with ann and svm based data driven models to predict hourly runoffs in crishan creek taiwan in their hybrid model hec hms is first used to simulate the rainfall runoff process and its output is used as the input of the ann and svm models together with the rainfall observations as can be seen from the studies above different conceptual or physical based models have been integrated with the data driven methods to develop hybrid modeling approaches the key similarity of the mentioned studies is that they use previous runoff observations as the input of the data driven methods it should be noted that in time series analyses in literature it is a standard practice to use the previous runoff observations to forecast the future runoff values a few time steps ahead however when the observed runoff values in future are not available for the long periods the accuracy of the runoff forecasting studies will be dependent on the accuracy of the previously predicted values in this context if the previously predicted values are not accurate the accuracy of the newly forecasted values will not be accurate if this process is applied for the long periods it might be possible to obtain error accumulations in the forecasted values as an expected behavior therefore development of a hydrological modeling approach without considering previous observed runoff values becomes important for the problems with long forecasting periods regarding this issue ghaith et al 2019 proposed a hybrid hydrological model that integrates the conceptual hydrological model hymod with ann in their model hymod model is executed several times for the randomly generated parameter values and the results providing a good prediction performance are used in the training process of the ann model note that the developed hybrid hydrological models have also been integrated to optimization models for calibrating the model parameters in this context kumanlioglu and fistikoglu 2019 developed a hybrid hydrological model that integrates the daily conceptual gr4j hydrological model with ann in an optimization framework where genetic algorithm ga is used in their model the internal structure of gr4j model is modified through ann approach and this hybridized model is integrated to ga for determining the related solution parameters according to their results this kind integration significantly improves the prediction performance compared to stand alone use of gr4j model the hybridization schemes mentioned above are related with the integration of the physical or conceptual hydrological models with the data driven approaches this kind of integration improves the prediction ability of the hydrological models than their single use note that there is another hybridization scheme in literature which are used to combine the optimization approaches these hybrid optimization approaches integrate different optimization algorithms which have different search characteristics in terms of the global and local search procedures ayvaz and elçi 2013 for such an integration the global optimization approaches start the search process with the multiple solution vectors and explores the entire search space to determine the possible location of the global optimum solution then the local search approaches get the results of the heuristic approaches as the initial solution and improves the solution by fine tuning the decision variable values ayvaz et al 2009 this integration improves the solution quality since it uses the diversification feature of the global approaches and intensification feature of the local search approaches rahami et al 2011 in this study a novel fully hybrid simulation optimization approach is proposed for enhancing the prediction performance of the hydrological models in the simulation part of the proposed approach the rainfall runoff process is simulated by using the conceptual technische universität wien tuw hydrological model to improve the prediction performance a nonlinear support vector regression svr model is integrated to the tuw model the integrated tuw svr model is then linked to a hybrid optimization approach where heuristic harmony search hs and the nelder mead simplex nms optimization approaches have been mutually integrated the main objective of the proposed hs nms optimization approach is to calibrate the parameters of both tuw and svr models by maximizing the nash sutcliffe efficiency n s e between the observed and simulated runoff values the applicability of the proposed fully hybrid simulation optimization approach is evaluated on gediz river basin by applying six approaches consisting of different combinations of simulation and optimization procedures furthermore a detailed sensitivity analysis has been conducted for all the approaches for different optimization parameter sets and random number seeds identified results indicated that the proposed fully hybrid simulation optimization approach significantly improves the calibration and verification performances compared to the stand alone application of the conceptual tuw model 2 model development 2 1 technische universität wien tuw hydrological model the daily rainfall runoff process in this paper is simulated by using the conceptual tuw hydrological model merz 2002 merz and blöschl 2004 parajka et al 2007 tuw model follows the computational structure of the hbv hydrologiska byråns vattenavdelning hydrological model bergstrom 1976 lindström 1997 and simulates rainfall runoff process by using the inputs of the total precipitation mean temperature and potential evapotranspiration it can simulate the rainfall runoff process for both lumped and semi distributed cases in the lumped case the input data is averaged for the whole basin area on the other hand they are being distributed over different elevation zones in the semi distributed case depending on the relative areas of each zone brziak et al 2020 the conceptual structure of the semi distributed tuw model can be seen in fig 1 as can be seen from fig 1 the model computes daily runoff by means of the snow soil response and routing modules the snow module uses degree day approach to simulate the snow accumulation or meting process by using the degree day factor d d f and melting temperature t m parameters the parameter of snow correction factor s c f is used to correct the catch deficit of the precipitation gages while snowfall occurs to distinguish the type of the precipitation i e rainfall snowfall or mixture of rainfall and snowfall a threshold temperature interval t r t s is used where t r and t s represent the rainfall and snowfall threshold temperatures respectively parajka et al 2007 since the original tuw model has no feature to correct the precipitation and temperature data for each elevation zone it is modified by including two additional parameters dp e l e v and dt e l e v to perform this task note that the parameters of dp e l e v and dt e l e v represent the linear precipitation increase and linear temperature decrease c per 100 m above mean sea level respectively the soil module works for simulating the runoff generation and changes in the soil moisture state by considering three parameters fc l p r a t β among them fc represents the maximum soil moisture storage l p r a t is used to limit the potential evapotranspiration and β is used to control the nonlinearity of the runoff generation sleziak et al 2018 the response module simulates the runoff on the hillslopes by using two reservoirs the upper zone reservoir gets the excess rainfall and diverts it to outside through three different paths flowing out from the reservoir s outlet based on a fast storage coefficient k 1 exceeding the reservoir s storage state ls u z and flowing through an additional outlet based on a very fast storage coefficient k 0 or percolating towards the lower zone with a constant rate c p e r c the lower soil zone diverts its storage to outside based on a slow storage coefficient k 2 the routing module gets the aggregated outflows of both reservoirs and routes flow by using a triangular transfer function based on two parameters where c r o u t e is a free scaling parameter and b m a x is the maximum base at low flows parajka et al 2007 note that in original version of the tuw model the rainfall runoff process is simulated via snow soil response and routing modules by using the 15 calibration parameters sleziak et al 2018 however this value is increased to 17 in this study with inclusion of two additional parameters in the snow model the names units and the possible ranges of these parameters have been listed in table 1 note that values of these parameters are all determined by using the proposed hybrid optimization approach detailed information about the structure of the tuw model can be found in parajka et al 2007 2 2 support vector regression svr model svm first proposed by boser et al 1992 is one of the most important supervised machine learning approaches in literature although svm is developed to solve the classification problems based on the statistical learning theory recently it is also applied to the solution of the nonlinear regression problems dibike et al 2001 karahan et al 2014 malik et al 2020 in both applications the main objective is to classify the data by locating an n dimensional hyperplane among them the data points which this hyperplane is in contact are called as the support vectors and the objective is defined as to seek the best position of the hyperplane depending on these support vectors this process requires of transforming the regression problem into a quadratic problem qp and then solving by means of an optimization approach solution of a regression problem by using the svm is as follows let n be the number of training data x i be the i th input data of the training data set y i be the corresponding i t h output data i 1 2 3 n the objective of the svr is to solve the regression problem by mapping this training data into a high dimensional feature space based on the following regression equation 1 y x i ω ϕ x i b where ω is the weight vector ϕ is the mapping function that transforms the data from input space to feature space and b is the bias of the hyperplane an appropriate svr function can be obtained by minimizing the following convex optimization problem 2 j min 1 2 ω 2 subject to 3 y i ω ϕ x i b ε where j is the objective function to be minimized 2 is the euclidian norm and ε is the residual margin which indicates the performance of the optimization process note that there may be possibility of no such function to satisfy these constraints for all the data points therefore the optimization problem should be converted to the following form by including the slack variables to allow regression errors based on the soft margin concept 4 j min 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i subject to y i ω ϕ x i b ε ξ i ω ϕ x i b y i ε ξ i ξ i 0 5 ξ i 0 where ξ i and ξ i are the slack variables and c is the box constraint which is used to control the penalty value imposed on observations that lie outside the ε margin to solve the optimization formulation given above the results of the nonlinear regression equation can be stated in dual form by means of the lagrange function as follows 6 y x i j 1 n α j α j k x i x j b where α j and α j are the dual variables and k x i x j is the kernel function which is calculated by taking the inner product of x i and x j several kernel functions are available in literature including linear polynomial gaussian etc among them the gaussian kernel function is used as follows 7 k x i x j e x p γ x i x j 2 where γ is the kernel constant after these definitions dual form of the optimization formulation becomes a qp problem as follows 8 l min 1 2 i 1 n j 1 n k x i x j α i α i α j α j ε i 1 n α i α i i 1 n y i α i α i subject to i 1 n α i α i 0 0 α i c 9 0 α i c the solution this qp problem provides the optimum values of α i s and α i s for this solution the required solution parameters are c γ and ε which are all determined by using the proposed hybrid optimization approach note that matlab s built in svr library is used in this study to train the regression model and to predict corresponding results for the given input data 2 3 harmony search hs optimization approach hs is a heuristic optimization approach inspired by the observation that a group of musicians seeks for the best state of harmony this musical process is analogous to engineering optimization since the aim of the optimization is to seek for a global optimum solution this analogy between musical improvisation and engineering optimization was first presented by geem et al 2001 in this context the musicians in the group correspond to decision variables of the optimization problem and the collection of the notes in their memories correspond to the potential values of the decision variables note that musicians generate a new harmony depending on three musical processes i by playing the pitches in their harmony memory ii by playing the slightly adjusted pitches of the previously played pitches in their harmony memory iii by playing random pitches without considering their harmony memory note that geem et al 2001 mathematically formulated these musical processes to solve an optimization problem based on the following rules i memory consideration ii pitch adjusting iii random selection combination of these three rules is used to generate a new harmony solution vector from the current harmony memory if this new generated harmony produces better objective function value than the worst stored one in harmony memory the vector with the worst objective function value is replaced with the new generated solution vector and this process is repeated until satisfying the termination criterion this computational structure can be seen as a pseudo code in fig 2 as can be seen from fig 2 the search process via hs consists of the 5 steps the first step aims to randomly generate the harmony memory and calculate the corresponding objective function values the second step aims to generate the new solution vector from harmony memory or from possible random range based on memory consideration and random selection the third step is used to perform the pitch adjusting process in the fourth step the newly generated solution vector is compared to the worst solution vector in harmony memory in terms of the objective function values if this newly generated harmony is better than the worst one in harmony memory the worst one is replaced with the new one the final step is used to control if termination criterion is satisfied or not to solve an optimization problem depending on these steps it is required to provide some solution parameters which are harmony memory size h m s harmony memory considering rate h m c r pitch adjusting rate p a r and the bandwidth b w hm is the main solution matrix in which values of the decision variables and the corresponding objective function values are stored the value of hms is usually set depending on the problem type hmcr is the probability of selecting the new decision variables from hm or not it is an important parameter such that for low hmcr values speed of the convergence reduces since only few elite harmonies are selected from the hm on the other hand high hmcr values lead to selection of the decision variables mostly from hm and prevent the exploration of random possibilities yang 2009 the parameter of par is used to decide if the newly selected solution vector from hm will be subjected to pitch adjusting or not note that the pitch adjusting process is used to maintain the diversity of the solution ayvaz 2009 for the solutions with low par parameters slow convergence is observed due to the exploration of a small subspace on the other hand a high value of par may cause the algorithm to work like a random search yang 2009 the final parameter bw is used to determine the magnitude of the change of the decision variables in pitch adjusting process this is also an important parameter since its value influences the convergence behavior note that the value of bw is usually adjusted based on the lower and upper bounds of the decision variables as in the other heuristic optimization algorithms values of these solution parameters significantly influence the identified results therefore a detailed sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the algorithm performance for different parameter combinations 2 4 nelder mead simplex nms approach nms first proposed by nelder and mead 1965 is a well known direct optimization approach for solving the multidimensional unconstrained optimization problems it is completely different from the classical simplex method for solving the constrained linear programming problems nms is suitable for the problems with non smooth or discontinuous solution spaces since it does not require any gradient information to find a search direction instead it relies on a simple direct search in which the parameter estimates are selected based on the knowledge gained in prior iterations to identify good estimates to reject bad estimates and to generate better estimates from the search pattern of the good estimates u s army corps of engineers 2000 depending on the simple structure the nms is utilized by the hydrologic engineering center hydrologic modeling system hec hms u s army corps of engineers 2000 as the built in optimization tool for calibrating the associated model parameters furthermore the current literature also includes some studies that uses the nms in hydrological modeling abida 2009 barati 2011 jérôme et al 2021 the pseudo code of the nms optimization approach can be seen in fig 3 note that the built in optimization toolbox of the matlab includes an nms module in this context the bound constrained modification of this nms module d errico 2022 is used in this study 2 5 development of hybrid hs nms optimization approach one of the important features of the proposed approach is the hybridized use of the hs and nms optimization approaches hs is a global heuristic optimization approach and applied to many problems in different fields of science although hs is very efficient in globally exploring the entire search space its local search ability is usually weak that is why some improved variants of it has been proposed in literature ayvaz 2009 feng et al 2017 fesanghary et al 2008 jang et al 2008 similar outcomes can also be observed for nms that although the approach is very efficient its convergence behavior is extremely sensitive to the selected starting points zahara and kao 2009 therefore integration of these two optimization approaches can allow to obtain the better optimization results than those obtained by using their stand alone use note that there are some studies in literature where hs and nms approaches have been integrated in the hybrid optimization framework feng et al 2017 jang et al 2008 although both models are also integrated in this work the followed hybridization structure is different from them note that the newly proposed hybrid hs nms optimization approach has two options for integrating the global and local search procedures in the first option the problem is first solved by using hs after termination nms gets the results of hs as the initial solution and improves solution by fine tuning the decision variable values in the second option hs generates a new solution vector by means of the random selection memory consideration and pitch adjusting processes once the condition that the newly generated solution vector is better than the worst one has been satisfied this newly generated solution is subjected to the local search by nms this hybridization option indicates that the local search procedure is just applied to the solutions with better objective function values than the worst stored one in hm note that the nms based local search model is just executed once in the first option however it is executed many times in the second option and this process significantly increases the computational cost of the optimization process therefore execution of the nms based local search model is adjusted based on a local search probability p c when this probability is satisfied by the model the corresponding harmony is subjected to local search in the proposed hybrid hs nms optimization approach note that the second hybridization strategy has been used in this study by considering a small p c value depending on this hybridization strategy fig 4 shows the pseudo code of the hybrid hs nms optimization approach by modifying the step 4 of the stand alone hs fig 2 2 6 integration of simulation and optimization models as indicated previously the objective of the proposed fully hybrid simulation optimization approach is to improve the prediction performance of the conceptual tuw hydrological model for this purpose six different approaches namely hs tuw nms tuw hs nms tuw hs tuw svr nms tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr are proposed in hs tuw approach the 17 model parameters see table 1 of the modified tuw hydrological model are calibrated by using the hs based optimization model in this integration hs determines the possible values of the calibration parameters and transfer them to tuw model then tuw simulates the rainfall runoff process and computes the runoff values at the watershed s outlet after this process the simulated and observed runoff values are evaluated and this information is passed back to the optimization model in nms tuw approach the same solution methodology is followed by hs tuw and the key difference is the use of the nms optimization method therefore the performance of a local search approach is evaluated by directly changing hs with nms in the optimization model in hs nms tuw both hs and nms are used in the optimization model by considering the previously mentioned hybridization approach where the results of hs are subjected to local search by nms based on the probability of p c in hs tuw svr approach similarly the parameters of the modified tuw model are determined by using the stand alone hs the difference of this approach from hs tuw is that the results of tuw are used by the svr model to improve the prediction performance by means of a hybrid modeling approach in this integration svr model gets the outcomes of the soil response and the routing modules of the tuw model as the input data then hs additionally determines the values of 3 calibration parameters c γ and ε and trains the svr model to calculate its output as the simulated runoff values similarly the simulated and observed runoff values are then evaluated and this information is passed to the optimization model to adjust the values of the tuw and svr model parameters similarly in nms tuw svr model the same tasks with hs tuw svr are performed by just changing the global hs based optimization model with a local nms based model in the last approach hs nms tuw svr a fully hybridized modeling approach is followed such a way that hs based optimization approach has been hybridized with nms and tuw hydrological model has been hybridized with svr therefore the influence of both hybrid optimization and hybrid hydrological modeling approach is evaluated fig 5 shows the flowchart of the proposed fully hybrid approach which describes how the hybridized simulation and optimization processes are integrated as can be seen the optimization model executes the simulation model for each optimization cycle while simulation model consists of just tuw model in hs tuw nms tuw or hs nms tuw it includes both tuw and svr models in hs tuw svr nms tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr approaches 2 7 problem formulation the problem of calibrating the parameters of the modified tuw hydrological model can be solved by using hs tuw nms tuw hs nms tuw hs tuw svr nms tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr approaches in all approaches the final part of the simulation model includes the calculation of the objective function value in literature different error indicators are used as the objective function among them the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 has been used as the objective function in the proposed approach by using nse the optimization problem can be mathematically formulated as follows 10 nse m a x 1 i 1 n t q i q i 2 i 1 n t q i q 2 subject to 11 x k min x k x k max 12 x k x x 1 x 2 x 3 x n d where n t is the number of time steps in the observation period q i and q i are the observed and simulated runoff values at i t h time step i 1 2 3 n t respectively q is the mean of the observed runoff values n d is the number of decision variables of the optimization model x k is the k t h decision variable of the optimization model k 1 2 3 n d x is the set of the decision variables x k min and x k max are the lower and upper bounds of the k t h decision variable as can be seen from the optimization formulation given above the objective of the proposed hybrid optimization approach is to determine the elements of the decision variable set x by maximizing the nse value note that the value of nse changes between and 1 where a value of 1 means a perfect match between the observed and simulated values a value of nse less than zero indicates that the mean value of the observed data would have been a better predictor than the model krause et al 2005 it should be noted that the performance of the optimization process has also been evaluated by means of the kling gupta efficiency k g e and percent bias p b i a s indicators whose mathematical definitions are given as follows gupta et al 2009 13 kge 1 r 1 2 σ σ 2 μ μ 2 14 p b i a s i 1 n t q i q i i 1 n t q i 100 where r is the correlation coefficient between the observed and simulated runoffs σ and σ are the standard deviation of the observed and simulated flows respectively μ and μ are the mean of the observed and simulated flows respectively similar to nse the kge value changes between and 1 and a value of 1 means a perfect match between the observed and simulated values on the other hand the value of pbias is used to evaluate the bias between the observed and simulated values the desired value pbias is 0 and its positive and negative values correspond to underestimation and overestimation biases respectively moriasi et al 2007 note that the prediction performance of the hydrological models can be evaluated based on the calculated values of nse kge and pbias as given in table 2 kalin et al 2010 3 study area the assessment of the proposed simulation optimization approach is evaluated on gediz river basin grb which is in the western part of turkey fig 6 grb has a drainage area of 17 500 km2 which corresponds about 2 of the turkey s total area the main river branch of the basin is the gediz river consisting of 386 km long river branch which originates from the murat mountain and flows towards the aegean sea the data used in this study belongs to the murat basin which is one of the sub basins of grb note that murat sub basin is in the upstream part of the grb and has a drainage area of 3272 4 km2 which approximately corresponds to the 19 of the area of grb fig 6 shows the location map of the murat sub basin on grb and turkey note that this basin was previously used by different researchers by using various daily or monthly hydrological modeling approaches turan and doğan 2015 turan and yurdusev 2016 okkan et al 2017 okkan and kırdemir 2019 kumanlioglu and fistikoglu 2019 the key similarity of these previous modeling efforts is that the used hydrological models are lumped that is why the semi distributed tuw hydrological model is selected in this study note that fig 6 also shows two additional sub basins in gray filled which are the demirci and deliinis sub basins the applicability of the proposed approach is also tested for these basins in terms of different hydro meteorological data and basin characteristics detailed information about this additional evaluation is given in section 5 the parameters of the modified tuw hydrological model and svr are calibrated by using the flow observations on the stream gage eie 523 acisu located at the outlet of the murat sub basin fig 6 in this context the flow observations between 2002 and 2006 are supplied from the state hydraulic works dsi of turkey among them the data for 2002 water year is used for model warm up period the data for 2003 and 2004 water years are used for model calibration and the data for 2005 and 2006 water years are used for model verification note that the modified tuw model requires three inputs for converting the rainfall to runoff which are the areal mean precipitation areal mean temperature and evapotranspiration in this context the precipitation and temperature data of 17188 uşak 17746 demirci 17748 simav and 17750 gediz meteorological gages fig 4 are collected and converted into areal precipitation and temperature time series by means of the thiessen polygon approach the corresponding polygon weights are 56 5 4 4 8 2 and 30 9 respectively evapotranspiration time series are calculated by using the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the statistics of the flow and the meteorological observation data for the warm up calibration and verification periods are listed in table 3 4 model results in this section modeling results of the hs tuw nms tuw hs nms tuw hs tuw svr nms tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr solution approaches are evaluated for different conditions for all the solutions the lower and upper bounds of the modified tuw calibration parameters are taken as given in table 1 after this process the associated hs solution parameters need to be given before starting the search process as the other heuristic search methods in literature selection of the appropriate parameter values is an important stage in hs since accuracy of the solutions mostly depends on these parameter values as indicated previously hs has 4 solution parameters which are the hms hmcr par and bw among them bw is usually adjusted by considering the lower x k min and upper x k max bounds of the decision variables k 1 2 3 n d therefore its value is set to bw x k max x k min 100 for all the solutions for the other parameters a detailed sensitivity analysis has been conducted to evaluate the algorithm s performance for different parameter combinations in this context the results of the proposed approach have been evaluated by considering two scenarios in scenario 1 different hs parameter combinations have been generated by considering the following discrete values hms 10 20 30 40 hmcr 0 80 0 85 0 90 0 95 and par 0 35 0 40 0 45 0 50 using these parameter values the proposed approach has been executed for 4 3 64 parameter realizations so that the variation of each parameter relative to each other is considered fig 7 after solving the problem for these parameter values the solution with the maximum objective function value has been selected as the best solution and the corresponding hs parameter values have been recorded then in scenario 2 the problem has been solved 10 times again by considering these parameter sets the reason of these additional solutions is to evaluate the performance and robustness of the optimization model for different random number seeds all the solutions in scenarios 1 and 2 have been conducted by setting the maximum number of improvisations to 10 000 furthermore the probability of p c is taken as 0 05 for the solutions with hybrid optimization since use of this small probability is sufficient according to the previous trials after defining different parameter realizations each approach i e hs tuw hs nms tuw hs tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr is executed 64 times in scenario 1 by considering the parameter values in fig 7 note that the optimization model aims to determine the parameter values of the modified tuw as well as the svr models by maximizing eq 10 subject to eqs 11 and 12 this parameter estimation procedure is conducted by using the flow observations of the murat basin for the calibration period 2003 2004 water years after obtaining the model results the outcome of each solution is also evaluated for the verification period 2005 2006 water years for hs tuw hs nms tuw hs tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr approaches statistical evaluation of the identified solutions can be seen in table 4 for calibration and verification periods in scenario 1 note that scenario 1 does not include outcomes for nms tuw and nms tuw svr approaches since hs based optimization model is not used in these approaches it can be seen from table 4 that the optimization model resulted with the mean nse value of 0 9176 for hs tuw 0 9239 for hs nms tuw 0 9273 for hs tuw svr and 0 9354 for hs nms tuw svr approaches respectively for the best solutions of the 64 model executions the final nse values have been obtained as 0 9341 for hs tuw 0 9356 for hs nms tuw 0 9442 for hs tuw svr and 0 9476 for hs nms tuw svr approaches respectively these results indicate that inclusion of nms to the optimization model improves the calibration accuracy compared to the stand alone use of hs similarly inclusion of svr to the simulation model improves the calibration accuracy compared to the stand alone use of the tuw model when the identified results are evaluated in terms of their verification performances it is seen that inclusion of nms to the optimization model reduces the nse value from 0 6910 to 0 6573 for the best solutions in scenario 1 however inclusion of svr to the simulation model significantly improves the verification accuracy such that the final nse value is increased from 0 6910 to 0 8222 in hs tuw svr compared to hs tuw similarly inclusion of nms to the optimization model increases the verification nse from 0 8222 to 0 8458 these results indicate that use of the fully hybrid solution strategy significantly increases solution accuracy especially for the verification period after obtaining these results in scenario 1 the hs parameter sets giving the best calibration results are determined as given in table 4 using these parameter values each solution approach is executed 10 times in scenario 2 for different random number seeds note that these different seed values are also used in nms tuw and nms tuw svr approaches during determination of the initial solutions before execution of the search procedure table 4 also includes the results of these 10 model executions in scenario 2 as can be seen the results of scenario 2 have also the same trends with those obtained in scenario 1 for 10 model executions of each solution approach the mean nse values in calibration period are obtained as 0 9276 for hs tuw 0 9293 for hs nms tuw 0 9393 for hs tuw svr and 0 9506 for hs nms tuw svr approaches respectively these results indicate that inclusion of nms and svr also improves the calibration accuracy in scenario 2 as obtained in scenario 1 as expected the overall model improvements are better than scenario 1 since all the model executions are conducted with the best hs parameter sets this result can also be observed in the calculated standard deviations such that all the approaches are resulted with the lower values than those obtained in scenario 1 table 4 also includes the results of nms tuw and nms tuw svr approaches which are also evaluated in scenario 2 as indicated previously the optimization model just consists of the nms based local search model in these approaches while keeping all the remaining parts are the same with hs tuw and hs tuw svr as can be seen the mean nse values for nms tuw and nms tuw svr approaches are obtained as 0 8172 and 0 8696 and these values are lower than the ones those obtained by using the hs tuw and hs tuw svr approaches respectively the same outcome is also obtained for the best solutions where the final nse values are lower than the ones obtained for hs tuw and hs tuw svr approaches respectively note that the results of nms tuw and nms tuw svr approaches also indicate that inclusion of svr to the simulation model improves the solution accuracy as an expected behavior for the best solutions of each approach in scenario 2 the simulated runoff hydrographs have been compared with the observed ones in fig 8 for the calibration and verification periods as can be seen from fig 8 observed runoff hydrograph in the calibration period is well captured by each solution approach on the other hand there are some deviations in the verification period such that the first peak around the year of 2005 is not accurately captured by hs tuw nms tuw and hs nms tuw approaches there are also some oscillations of the simulated runoff values around march 2006 for the same models however those problems have not been observed in hs tuw svr nms tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr models such a way that inclusion of svr to the simulation model has significantly increased the prediction performance for the verification period note that fig 8 also includes the prediction ranges of scenario 2 light green for 10 different model executions it is seen that in the calibration period the results of different model executions have wider prediction ranges for nms tuw approach than the others the best prediction ranges have been observed for hs nms tuw svr approach for the verification period again the widest prediction range has been observed for nms tuw approach for the best calibration results for scenario 2 the final calculated nse kge and pbias values have been given in table 5 as can be seen while the best calibration nse has been obtained for hs nms tuw svr approach the same is not valid for the other indicators instead the best kge and pbias values have been observed for hs nms tuw approach for the verification period while the best nse and pbias values have been obtained for hs nms tuw svr the best kge is observed for hs tuw svr approach note that the overall evaluation of nse kge and pbias values for both calibration and verification periods indicates that the prediction performances of each approach are very good according to the performance ratings given in table 2 for these solutions the final decision variable values can be seen in table 6 as can be seen all the approaches determined the parameter values in the provided ranges given in table 1 it should be noted that all the best results given above are determined by selecting the solutions with the maximum nse values in the calibration period in this context an additional evaluation has also been followed by selecting the solutions with the maximum nse values in the verification period as the best solutions fig 9 shows the results of this evaluation in terms of the scatter plots for each approach as can be seen hs tuw svr approach has the highest verification nse value 0 8609 in this analysis although hs nms tuw svr had the highest value 0 8328 in the previous analysis however the highest calibration nse value 0 9555 has been obtained again in hs nms tuw svr approach just as observed in the previous analysis the results of this analysis indicate that all the approaches again resulted with the similar outcomes even if the best solution selection strategy is changed 5 performance evaluation for different basins as indicated in the previous sections the proposed simulation optimization approach provided efficient calibration and verification results for all the proposed approaches however it is also essential to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach for different basins in terms of different hydrometeorological data and basin characteristics for this purpose applicability of the proposed six approaches is evaluated for demirci and deliinis sub basins of grb fig 10 shows location of these basins together with the corresponding digital elevation models dem fig 10 also shows locations of the stream and meteorological gages which are used for developing the hydrological models as can be seen from fig 10 eie 522 borlu and eie 515 topuzdamlari stream gages are located at the outlet of demirci and deliinis sub basins respectively note that tuw hydrological model for demirci sub basin is developed by using the flow data of 2000 2001 water years for warm up 2002 2003 water years for calibration and 2004 2005 water years for verification periods similarly deliinis sub basin is developed by using the flow data of 1997 water year for warm up 1998 2003 water years for calibration and 2004 2006 water years for verification periods as indicated previously tuw hydrological model requires the areal mean precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration time series for converting rainfall to runoff these data are supplied from 5278 koprubasi 17746 demirci and 17748 simav meteorological gages the statistics of the flow and the meteorological observation data for the warm up calibration and verification periods are given in tables 7 and 8 for demirci and deliinis sub basins respectively after processing the meteorological and hydrological data the proposed simulation optimization approach is executed for six different approaches hs tuw nms tuw hs nms tuw hs tuw svr nms tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr all the approaches are executed 10 times as in scenario 2 in the previous analysis to evaluate the model results for different random number seeds table 9 presents the statistical evaluation of these 10 model executions for both demirci and deliinis sub basins as can be seen from table 9 for demirci sub basin the mean nse values are obtained as 0 8695 and 0 8843 for hs tuw and hs nms tuw approaches respectively similarly the mean nse values are obtained as 0 9173 and 0 9234 for hs tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr approaches respectively these outcomes indicate that inclusion of nms to the optimization model statistically improves the model identification results similarly inclusion of svr to the simulation model also significantly improves the solution accuracy as similar with the model identification results of murat sub basin for the solutions without global optimization the accuracy of the model results is obtained low such that nms tuw model is resulted with the mean nse value of 0 7270 and this result is lower than the one obtained for hs tuw model similarly nms tuw svr approach is resulted with the mean nse value of 0 8292 and this value is lower than the one obtained for hs tuw svr this outcome indicates the importance of using the global or global local hybrid optimization approach in the optimization model rather than directly using the local search approach however inclusion of svr to the simulation part again improves the solution accuracy even if the local search method is used in the optimization model note that the model outcomes of the deliinis sub basin have also the similar trends in terms of the identified solutions for the best calibration results of both basins the final nse kge and pbias values are provided in table 10 as can be seen from table 10 for the calibration period the best nse is obtained for hs nms tuw svr approach for both demirci and deliinis subbasins on the other hand the best kge and pbias values are obtained for hs nms tuw svr approach in demirci and for hs nms tuw approach in deliinis sub basins respectively for the verification period the best nse is again obtained for hs nms tuw svr approach for both demirci and deliinis subbasins on the other hand the best kge and pbias values are obtained for hs nms tuw svr and hs tuw svr approaches in demirci and deliinis sub basins respectively according to the performance ratings presented in table 2 the overall prediction performances for both calibration and verification periods are obtained as good or very good for both sub basins 6 discussion as can be seen from the results presented above the proposed fully hybrid simulation optimization approach can effectively predict the runoff values by considering different combinations of the simulation and optimization approaches in the following sections the critical issues regarding the proposed approach are discussed in the optimization model the heuristic hs optimization approach has been hybridized with local nms approach which is available in the optimization toolbox of the matlab platform in the classical nms module of the matlab it is not possible to define the lower and upper bounds for the decision variables and this process in some cases leads to obtain negative parameter values for the svr model therefore there may be possibility of obtaining errors during the search process to eliminate this problem the bound constrained modification of the built in nms module which is developed by d errico 2022 has been used although this modified module can effectively determine the parameter values satisfying the bound constraints it may increase the number of iterations to find a bound constrained solution the developed hybrid optimization methodology in this study uses the regular hs optimization approach in literature different improved versions of the hs optimization approach are available degertekin 2012 geem 2006 jaberipour and khorram 2010 mahdavi et al 2007 ouyang et al 2017 zeng and dong 2016 in this context the prediction performance of the proposed approach can be improved by using these modified versions which is the beyond the scope of this work the proposed hybrid hs nms approach considers the hybridization strategy presented in ayvaz et al 2009 where the classical hs is hybridized with excel solver optimization routine in vba platform in this hybridization strategy the local search module is executed by the global search module based on a probability p c according to the previous trials use of a small probability value such as 0 05 or 0 10 can be sufficient to find the improved solutions however it may be possible to use higher probability values for different problems and this may increase the computational cost of the optimization model in the proposed approach the runoff prediction problem has been solved by calibrating the tuw model parameters by maximizing the nse values between the simulated and observed runoff values in other words the model is calibrated by considering a single objective function however the conceptual tuw hydrological model can also simulate the soil moisture or the snow related calculations in this context the calibration process can also be conducted by using an additional objective function in terms of these additional computations under multi objective optimization framework one of the important contributions of this study is the use of the svr in the simulation part as indicated previously there are some studies in literature which use svm and other data driven approaches for predicting the runoff values however those studies usually use the previous runoff observations as the input of the data driven approaches this study eliminates this problem by directly using the tuw model outputs as the input of the svr model without using the previous runoff observations by executing the tuw svr approach for the generated parameter values by the optimization model the calibration and verification performance of the stand alone tuw model can be improved however this kind of solution strategy requires to execute the tuw model and to train the svr approach for each optimization cycle and this process may increase the computational cost especially for the long simulation periods in all the svr calculations the matlab s built in svr routine has been used this routine uses three parameters c γ and ε to characterize the support vectors and perform a regression analysis although matlab includes built in solution approaches to determine these parameter values they may require long computation time since svr model is executed for each optimization cycle use of the built in solution approaches significantly increases the computational cost therefore these three parameters have also been determined by using the proposed optimization approach by considering them as additional decision variables in the proposed approach the tuw model is modified by including two additional parameters dp e l e v and dt e l e v to simulate precipitation increase and temperature decrease with elevation together with these parameters the modified version of the tuw model includes total 17 calibration parameters note that these parameter values can be decreased by replacing the lumped response and routing modules with svr just as given in the study of kumanlioglu and fistikoglu 2019 where the lumped gr4j model is modified with ann however this modification is also beyond the scope of this work the performance of the proposed fully hybrid simulation optimization approach is evaluated by modeling the rainfall runoff process on murat sub basin according to the identified results inclusion of nms to the optimization model improves the solution accuracy similarly inclusion of svr to the simulation model also improves the solution accuracy depending on these outcomes the best prediction and verification results for murat sub basin is obtained for hs nms tuw svr which is the fully hybrid simulation optimization approach however it is essential to evaluate whether the performance of the proposed approach will be the same for different sizes of watersheds or not therefore the applicability of the proposed approach is also evaluated for two additional sub basins of the grb which are the demirci and deliinis sub basins according to the identification results all the approaches are resulted with the solutions in similar trends with those obtained for the murat sub basin 7 conclusion in this study a novel fully hybrid simulation optimization approach is proposed for solving the runoff prediction problems the proposed approach uses the conceptual semi distributed tuw hydrological model in the simulation model to improve the prediction performance during the simulation stage the tuw model is hybridized with a nonlinear svr approach which directly uses the outcome of the tuw model as input and simulates the runoff values as output this hybridized simulation model is then integrated to an optimization model where hybrid hs nms optimization approach is used the hs nms approach mutually integrates the global exploration capability of hs and local fine tuning capability of nms optimization approaches depending on these hybridization schemes it is proposed six approaches which are hs tuw nms tuw hs nms tuw hs tuw svr nms tuw svr and hs nms tuw svr the performance of each approach is evaluated for different hs parameter sets and random number seeds the applicability of the proposed four approaches have been evaluated on the murat sub basin of grb in turkey identified results indicated that the proposed fully hybrid simulation optimization approach can significantly increase the calibration and verification prediction performances compared to its stand alone version credit authorship contribution statement pinar g durgut methodology software writing review editing m tamer

2523,heat is a natural tracer that can be used to estimate groundwater velocity and fluxes however most studies if not all are focused on vertical flow due to the existence of a simple closed form analytical solution that well captures the characteristics of vertical heat transport in this study we show that lateral groundwater inflow to rivers can also be inferred from natural heat signals by integrating theoretical development and field observation a closed form analytical solution for lateral heat transport in unconfined aquifers is developed and serves as the basis for the inversion of groundwater velocity two parameter estimation techniques markov chain monte carlo mcmc and a trial and error method are applied to estimate groundwater velocity using groundwater temperature observed at wells the mcmc method requires at least one observation well and its performance increases with the number of wells the trial and error method requires three observation wells and can appropriately represent the groundwater velocity the performance of both methods is affected by the uncertainty of hydrogeological and thermal parameters such as porosity thermal conductivity of the overlying and underlying layers and aquifer thickness porosity is the most sensitive and thermal conductivity is the least sensitive parameter to the accuracy of estimated groundwater velocity the developed heat tracer method for estimating lateral groundwater inflow to rivers is novel script provided and could be a valuable alternative to the widely used environmental tracers keywords groundwater discharge heat tracer method parameter inversion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater inflow to rivers in lowlands is an important component of the hydrologic cycle that serves as the outlet of groundwater recharge occurring in uplands freeze and cherry 1979 environmental tracers e g radon chlorofluorocarbons is a common tool to infer the inflow rate based on the different hydrogeochemical properties between groundwater and surface water cook and herczeg 2012 however the accuracy of environmental tracer method highly depends on a few factors that could not be easily evaluated in the field such as the gas exchange rate between water and air for radon and the determination of surface water and groundwater tracer concentrations cook et al 2003 heat has been widely used as a tracer to infer groundwater flow in different geological settings anderson 2005 one of the fundamental works in the history of heat tracer methods is the analytical model that depicting vertical heat transport in a semi infinite domain under steady state flow condition stallman 1965 it serves as the basis for many follow up works cartwright 1970 ferguson et al 2003 taniguchi 1993 more recently multiple analytical models have been proposed to estimate vertical hydrologic exchange flow using the amplitude and frequency information of observed temperature profiles chen et al 2018b hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 luce et al 2013 although those studies demonstrate heat signal is a good indicator of groundwater flow they are limited only to vertical groundwater flow and do not apply to the highly dynamic flow condition leroux et al 2021 numerical heat tracer methods are also commonly used due to the flexibility for the boundary condition and the consideration of subsurface heterogeneity compared with the analytical heat tracer method the key idea behind the numerical heat tracer methods is that the fluid flux is considered as a variable that can be estimated using the observed temperature via the parameter inversion approach for example the software 1dtemppro v2 estimates the vertical flux in hyporheic zone from observed temperature in sediments using iterative levenberg marquardt nonlinear regression approach koch et al 2016 similarly the software flux bot estimates the flux using an enhanced parameter estimation toolbox from matlab munz and schmidt 2017 the above two software tools do not allow the estimation of sub daily highly dynamic fluxes chen et al 2022 overcomes the problem by consecutively estimating the fluxes over small time interval using a data assimilation based approach referred to as the ensemble smoother multiple data assimilation the prerequisite of all numerical heat tracer methods is that it requires the heat source to be constrained at the boundary and model geometry to be well defined these two conditions are satisfied for the hyporheic zone where heat signal mainly comes from the river water and only propagates to the shallow depth of the sediments 1 m however the numerical heat tracer methods cannot be used if the heat source is unknown most heat tracer related studies use natural heat signal to estimate vertical flux but little attention is put on the estimation of lateral flux however recent studies have shown that groundwater temperature can respond to climate changes and geological activity which indicates the potential use of heat as a tracer for example increasing temperature of recharged groundwater can propagate laterally to a few kilometers with the groundwater flow burns et al 2017 chen et al 2018a combined temperature and chloride pulses observed in springs to infer the degassing activity of a volcano since dissolved degassing gases can increase the recharge groundwater temperature the marked difference of using heat as a tracer to estimate vertical flux and lateral flux lie in the fact that heat conduction loss to the overlying and underlying layers cannot be neglected for lateral flow in this study we aim to develop a heat tracer method to estimate lateral groundwater inflow to rivers the method is built upon an analytical model for heat transport in an unconfined aquifer and combined with parameter inversion method to estimate groundwater flow velocity method performance is systematically evaluated through parameter sensitivity analysis and applied in our study site details of the heat tracer method are given below 2 methodology 2 1 study site the study site is near pingshan river shenzhen china fig 1 a pingshan river is an urban river with the tributary shixi river originating from the mountain in upstream this site is located at the cross section of these two rivers and designed for long term monitoring of surface water and groundwater interaction precipitation is the dominant factor that controls the dynamic change of river stage and groundwater level especially in the period from april and september when precipitation occurs frequently five observation wells are located at different distances away from the river fig 1 b a high permeable layer of sandy gravel is identified through the cores collected

the shallow and deep zones are usually subject to different controlling factors if recharge is not considered temperatures below 20 m are typically controlled by geothermal heat flux anderson 2005 kurylyk et al 2019 and for the shallow zone of aquifers i e 20 m temperature could be affected by multiple factors such as air temperature change and snow the heat tracer method developed in this study is particularly applied to shallow aquifers without considering the influence of geothermal heat flux heat transport in groundwater from the hillslope to the lowland river is illustrated in fig 2 heat exchange between the aquifer and the overlying underlying layers via conduction due to the temperature difference could significantly affect the observed temperature signal in the aquifer in contrast solute transport is not much affected by the adjacent layers at short time scale e g hours days because solute diffusion is far lower than heat conduction although both solute and heat

groundwater velocity using heat as a tracer eq 11 can serve as a fast screening tool to estimate the groundwater inflow to rivers assuming the hydrogeologic and thermal properties e g porosity thermal conductivity of the aquifer and adjacent layers are known there are four parameters need to be determined while applying eq 11 including groundwater flow velocity v the recharge temperature δt the distance from the recharging point to the first observation well o1 l and the time of the observed temperature data after recharging t 0 the great advantage of using the analytical model to estimate the parameters is it can consider the model geometry as an unknown parameter which cannot be achieved by using a numerical model for parameter estimation because l is typically unknown with the estimation of groundwater velocity as the goal two methods are developed by using the temperature data in different ways the first is bayesian inference based markov chain monte carlo mcmc method and the other is trial and error method 2 3 1 mcmc according to the bayes theorem the posterior probability density function pdf of parameters x conditioned on observed temperature t p x t is 15 p x t p t x p x where p x is the prior probability density function pdf and p t x is the observed temperature x includes m unknown parameters where m varies from 1 to 4 parameters v δt l t 0 based on eq 11 to obtain the posterior distribution of p x t we used metropolis hastings m h algorithm as the mcmc sampler to draw samples from p x t the basic steps of m h sampling include 1 choose an initial x 0 assuming the prior x 0 follows the uniform distribution 2 propose a new xnew from previous estimation xk 1 by 16 x new x k 1 n 0 cov 0 x where n 0 cov 0 x is a gaussian distribution with the diagonal

until enough samples are obtained the mcmc based heat tracer method allows the incorporation of observed temperature time series from multiple locations here we consider two scenarios one observation well and three observation wells more observations indicate more constraints on the parameters and the method performance of each scenario will be evaluated later 2 3 2 trial and error the trial and error approach stems from the fact that the unknown four parameters can be estimated by solving a system of three non linear equations with the last parameter obtained by trial and error the equation system requires temperature observations from three wells the basic steps include 1 propose an initial set of t0 that uniformly distributed between t 0 min and t 0 max at a small time interval e g 0 1 day 2 for each t0 in the set of t0 constructing three non linear equations 18 l i v δ t l t i i 1 2 3 where i represents the number of observation wells ti is the temperature measured at well i and then calculate the mean squared error mse for each t0 19 ms e 1 n i 1 n l i v δ t l t i where n is the number of data points which is 3 here the minimum mse corresponds to the optimal t 0 3 propose an initial set of δt that uniformly distributed between δt min and δt max at a small interval e g 0 1 c with t 0 known constructing a system of two equations based on eq 18 with observations from two of the three wells similarly find the optimal δt corresponding to the minimum mse eq 18 4 the optimal v is obtained similarly by solving one equation using temperature observation from one well for l the optimal value is obtained by finding the minimum mse without solving equations the non linear equations system can be solved by any non linear solver e g the fsolve function in scipy package of python 2 4 evaluating the performance of heat tracer methods the abovementioned heat tracer methods are developed under ideal conditions where hydrogeologic and thermal properties are known however that information may not be all available or not accurate enough in practice here we design three cases to evaluate the method performance assuming the information of aquifer thickness c1 aquifer porosity c2 and thermal conductivity of the overlying and underlying layers c3 are uncertain while applying eq 11 or eq 12 for each case six scenarios with different number of unknown parameters 2 3 4 and different number of observations wells 1 and 3 are considered the base model parameters and parameters associated with each scenario are listed in table 1 3 results 3 1 model validation and field data to validate the developed analytical expression for heat transport in the unconfined aquifer the predicted temperature by eq 11 at different locations were compared against the numerical simulation results for the numerical model the thickness of overlying underlying layers and the aquifer length are set to be 10 m and 500 m respectively to reduce the boundary effects the geometry that a thin layer sits between two thick layers poses a challenge to meshing here we refined the mesh along the interface between the aquifer and adjacent layers to reduce the numerical error thereby resulting a total of 214 506 fine meshes in addition we set thermal conductivity of the aquifer to be a small number 1 10 10 w mk in the numerical model for comparison purpose the analytical simulation results match the numerical results well except for the short period when temperature gradient is large it is possibly due to the numerical dispersion that cannot be avoided while solving advection dispersion equation in comsol similar phenomenon is also observed in using comsol to solve the problem of solute transport in a single fracture zhu et al 2016 the temporal change of temperature gradient at different locations shows that the gradients would reach a near steady state at late time fig 3 b our site condition is close to the steady state as the temperature gradient does not show obvious variation during the one month period except for the disturbance of precipitation at our study site the measured groundwater temperature of w8 was about 0 8 c lower than that of w10 over the observation period indicating there existed heat loss along the flowpath fig 4 a when precipitation occurs in the period of 2021 10 08 and 2021 10 15 the temperature of w8 increased to that of w10 this is because the residence time of groundwater flow from w10 to w8 decreased after precipitation due to the increased hydraulic gradient thus less heat was lost via conduction along the flowpath fig 4 b it is worth mentioning that the response of hydraulic head to precipitation is stronger than that of temperature for both wells indicating the application of heat tracer method relies on the in situ groundwater temperature variability in space the measured groundwater velocity by the flowmeter at three locations was 10 m d and the groundwater velocity estimated by the mcmc method is 6 7 m d such high value suggests a highly permeable layer exists in the alluvium aquifer as demonstrated by the vertical profile of hydraulic conductivity fig 4 c we will set 6 7 m d as the true groundwater velocity and use simulated temperature as the observations to evaluate the method performance under different scenarios in the next 3 2 performance of heat tracer method the mcmc based heat tracer method performs better with less unknown parameters and more observation wells fig 5 for the scenarios of two unknown parameters v and δt with 3 observation wells fig 5 m n the means of posterior distributions are close to the true values indicating using temperature data alone are enough to estimate groundwater velocity accurately if l and t 0 are known with more unknown parameters the uncertainty range for each parameter increases and the mean of posterior distribution deviates away from the true value for example for the scenarios of 3 unknown parameters with 3 observation wells fig 5 g i the mean of posterior velocity is 32 lower than the true value in contrast the mean of posterior δt and t 0 are still close to the true values as the number of unknown parameters increases to 4 the uncertainty ranges of parameters keep increasing fig 5 a d if the number of observation wells reduces to 1 the uncertainty ranges for each parameter would further increase compared with the corresponding cases with 3 observation wells for 2 unknowns the mean of posterior v and δt are still close to the true value however for 3 and 4 unknowns the posterior distribution of parameters cannot provide a confident estimation the trial and error method provides accurate estimation for each of the 4 parameters fig 6 the minimum mae corresponds to the predefined t 0 no matter which t 0 is chosen fig 6 a it is worth mentioning that the solution of eq 18 for the other three parameters deviates from the true value even when t 0 is accurate but it would not affect the identification of the optimal t 0 hence the trial and error process needs to be conducted for each parameter sequentially for δt v and l the estimated values are identical to the true values for all t 0 demonstrating the robustness of the trial and error method 3 3 sensitivity to the hydraulic and thermal properties aquifer thickness is an important parameter for model geometry for a constant heat source at the inlet and constant groundwater velocity the heat signal for a thicker aquifer can propagate further compared with that for a thinner aquifer fig 7 shows the sensitivity of estimated parameters to b by mcmc method case c1 for the scenario of 2 unknown parameters with 3 observation wells fig 7 m the error of estimated groundwater velocity can increase from 0 accurate b up to 22 25 underestimation of b and 51 50 underestimation of b this finding applies to the scenarios of 2 fig 7 m n and 3 fig 7 g i unknowns with 3 observation wells when the number of unknowns increases to 4 fig 7 a d the error of b still obviously affects the accuracy of groundwater velocity however for the other three unknowns there is no obvious linkage between the error of b and the error of estimates the reason may be there existing internal uncertainty for the mcmc method while the number of unknowns increases to 4 similarly if there is only 1 observation well the error of b can also strongly affect the accuracy of estimated parameters porosity is another important hydraulic property that may affect the performance of the heat tracer method as it is coupled with the actual groundwater velocity eqs 1 and 11 hence the uncertainty of porosity could be transferred to the uncertainty of estimated velocity it can be observed that for the case c2 the error of estimated groundwater velocity is above 40 fig 8 a g m when there are 3 observation wells no matter how many unknowns 2 3 or 4 in contrast overestimation of porosity has less influence on the accuracy of other parameters in addition underestimation of porosity seems to have a stronger impact on the accuracy of all unknowns when there is only 1 observation well the errors are comparable to the corresponding cases with 3 observation wells and the patterns are also similar thermal conductivity of the overlying and underlying layers for the aquifer determines the degree of heat conduction loss along the flowpath eqs 2 and 3 thus it is also a critical parameter that needs to be evaluated it can be observed that for the case c3 the uncertainty of estimated parameter typically increases with the error of thermal conductivity fig 9 the good thing is it has less impact 10 on the estimation of groundwater velocity for all cases although thermal conductivity of the subsurface is usually not measured in the field using empirical value would not be a big issue the sensitivity of estimated groundwater velocity by the trial and error method is like that by the mcmc method in the reasonable error ranges of evaluated model parameter aquifer porosity and thermal conductivity of the adjacent layers are the most and least sensitive to the accuracy of estimated groundwater velocity respectively hence it is recommended to conduct a detailed survey of aquifer porosity and aquifer thickness by drilling a core to reduce the uncertainty of estimated groundwater velocity fig 10 3 4 method limitation the advantage of the mcmc based heat tracer method is that it requires less observation well and is more flexible with the number of unknowns the error for the estimated groundwater velocity could be up to 20 with only 1 well and adding wells can effectively reduce the error although the maximum number of wells we evaluated is 3 the framework of mcmc can be easily extended to any number of wells if available the trial and error method requires 3 observation wells but its accuracy is higher than that of mcmc based method the performance of both methods would be affected due to the uncertainty of model parameters thus measurements of porosity thickness and thermal conductivity is a good start while using the heat tracer method aquifer heterogeneity is another factor that may affect heat transport by analogy with solute transport guo et al 2020 guo et al 2021 irvine et al 2015 the implicit assumption of eq 1 is heat conduction between liquid and solid matrix reaches equilibrium instantaneously however this assumption may be violated when grain size is large or groundwater velocity is high gossler et al 2020 quantifying such heterogeneity is currently a challenge due to the lack of high resolution mapping of spatial temperature profile 4 conclusions we developed a heat tracer method that can serve as a fast screening tool to estimate groundwater discharge to the river this method is built from a closed form analytical solution that considers advective heat transport in the aquifer and heat conduction to the overlying and underlying layers along the flow path groundwater velocity can be estimated via the mcmc based parameter estimation method and the trial and error method both methods exhibit good performance under the ideal condition assuming that model parameters are accurate the sensitivity analysis showed that the accuracy of estimated velocity is most sensitive to the aquifer porosity followed by aquifer thickness and thermal conductivity of the overlying and underlying layers the heat

2523,heat is a natural tracer that can be used to estimate groundwater velocity and fluxes however most studies if not all are focused on vertical flow due to the existence of a simple closed form analytical solution that well captures the characteristics of vertical heat transport in this study we show that lateral groundwater inflow to rivers can also be inferred from natural heat signals by integrating theoretical development and field observation a closed form analytical solution for lateral heat transport in unconfined aquifers is developed and serves as the basis for the inversion of groundwater velocity two parameter estimation techniques markov chain monte carlo mcmc and a trial and error method are applied to estimate groundwater velocity using groundwater temperature observed at wells the mcmc method requires at least one observation well and its performance increases with the number of wells the trial and error method requires three observation wells and can appropriately represent the groundwater velocity the performance of both methods is affected by the uncertainty of hydrogeological and thermal parameters such as porosity thermal conductivity of the overlying and underlying layers and aquifer thickness porosity is the most sensitive and thermal conductivity is the least sensitive parameter to the accuracy of estimated groundwater velocity the developed heat tracer method for estimating lateral groundwater inflow to rivers is novel script provided and could be a valuable alternative to the widely used environmental tracers keywords groundwater discharge heat tracer method parameter inversion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater inflow to rivers in lowlands is an important component of the hydrologic cycle that serves as the outlet of groundwater recharge occurring in uplands freeze and cherry 1979 environmental tracers e g radon chlorofluorocarbons is a common tool to infer the inflow rate based on the different hydrogeochemical properties between groundwater and surface water cook and herczeg 2012 however the accuracy of environmental tracer method highly depends on a few factors that could not be easily evaluated in the field such as the gas exchange rate between water and air for radon and the determination of surface water and groundwater tracer concentrations cook et al 2003 heat has been widely used as a tracer to infer groundwater flow in different geological settings anderson 2005 one of the fundamental works in the history of heat tracer methods is the analytical model that depicting vertical heat transport in a semi infinite domain under steady state flow condition stallman 1965 it serves as the basis for many follow up works cartwright 1970 ferguson et al 2003 taniguchi 1993 more recently multiple analytical models have been proposed to estimate vertical hydrologic exchange flow using the amplitude and frequency information of observed temperature profiles chen et al 2018b hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 luce et al 2013 although those studies demonstrate heat signal is a good indicator of groundwater flow they are limited only to vertical groundwater flow and do not apply to the highly dynamic flow condition leroux et al 2021 numerical heat tracer methods are also commonly used due to the flexibility for the boundary condition and the consideration of subsurface heterogeneity compared with the analytical heat tracer method the key idea behind the numerical heat tracer methods is that the fluid flux is considered as a variable that can be estimated using the observed temperature via the parameter inversion approach for example the software 1dtemppro v2 estimates the vertical flux in hyporheic zone from observed temperature in sediments using iterative levenberg marquardt nonlinear regression approach koch et al 2016 similarly the software flux bot estimates the flux using an enhanced parameter estimation toolbox from matlab munz and schmidt 2017 the above two software tools do not allow the estimation of sub daily highly dynamic fluxes chen et al 2022 overcomes the problem by consecutively estimating the fluxes over small time interval using a data assimilation based approach referred to as the ensemble smoother multiple data assimilation the prerequisite of all numerical heat tracer methods is that it requires the heat source to be constrained at the boundary and model geometry to be well defined these two conditions are satisfied for the hyporheic zone where heat signal mainly comes from the river water and only propagates to the shallow depth of the sediments 1 m however the numerical heat tracer methods cannot be used if the heat source is unknown most heat tracer related studies use natural heat signal to estimate vertical flux but little attention is put on the estimation of lateral flux however recent studies have shown that groundwater temperature can respond to climate changes and geological activity which indicates the potential use of heat as a tracer for example increasing temperature of recharged groundwater can propagate laterally to a few kilometers with the groundwater flow burns et al 2017 chen et al 2018a combined temperature and chloride pulses observed in springs to infer the degassing activity of a volcano since dissolved degassing gases can increase the recharge groundwater temperature the marked difference of using heat as a tracer to estimate vertical flux and lateral flux lie in the fact that heat conduction loss to the overlying and underlying layers cannot be neglected for lateral flow in this study we aim to develop a heat tracer method to estimate lateral groundwater inflow to rivers the method is built upon an analytical model for heat transport in an unconfined aquifer and combined with parameter inversion method to estimate groundwater flow velocity method performance is systematically evaluated through parameter sensitivity analysis and applied in our study site details of the heat tracer method are given below 2 methodology 2 1 study site the study site is near pingshan river shenzhen china fig 1 a pingshan river is an urban river with the tributary shixi river originating from the mountain in upstream this site is located at the cross section of these two rivers and designed for long term monitoring of surface water and groundwater interaction precipitation is the dominant factor that controls the dynamic change of river stage and groundwater level especially in the period from april and september when precipitation occurs frequently five observation wells are located at different distances away from the river fig 1 b a high permeable layer of sandy gravel is identified through the cores collected at the wells w8 w4 and w10 indicating the potential strong hydraulic connection between the river and the riparian aquifer fig 1 c two ctd sensors ctd diver are placed in the nearest w8 and farthest w10 well to the river respectively to monitor hydraulic head and temperature at 15 min interval since september 2021 water table is typically at the depth of 3 4 m below the land surface depending on

the shallow and deep zones are usually subject to different controlling factors if recharge is not considered temperatures below 20 m are typically controlled by geothermal heat flux anderson 2005

study is particularly applied to shallow aquifers without considering the influence of geothermal heat flux heat transport in groundwater from the hillslope to the lowland river is illustrated in fig 2 heat exchange between the aquifer and the overlying underlying layers via conduction due to the temperature difference could significantly affect the observed temperature signal in the aquifer in

observation period indicating there existed heat loss along the flowpath fig 4 a when precipitation occurs in the period of 2021 10 08 and 2021 10 15 the temperature of w8 increased to that of w10 this is because the residence time of groundwater flow from w10 to w8 decreased after precipitation due to the increased hydraulic gradient thus less heat was lost via conduction along the flowpath fig 4 b it is worth mentioning that the response of hydraulic head to precipitation is stronger than that of temperature for both wells indicating the application of heat tracer method relies on the in situ groundwater temperature variability in space the measured groundwater velocity by the flowmeter at three locations was 10 m d and the groundwater velocity estimated by the mcmc method is 6 7 m d such high value suggests a highly permeable layer exists in the alluvium aquifer as demonstrated by the vertical profile of hydraulic conductivity fig 4 c we will set 6 7 m d as the true groundwater velocity and use simulated temperature as the observations to evaluate the method performance under different scenarios in the next 3 2 performance of heat tracer method the mcmc based heat tracer method performs better with less unknown parameters and more observation wells fig 5 for the scenarios of two unknown parameters v and δt with 3 observation wells fig 5 m n the means of posterior distributions are close to the true values indicating using temperature data alone are enough to estimate groundwater velocity accurately if l and t 0 are known with more unknown parameters the uncertainty range for each parameter increases and the mean of posterior distribution deviates away from the true value for example for the scenarios of 3 unknown parameters with 3 observation wells fig 5 g i the mean of posterior velocity is 32 lower than the true value in contrast the mean of posterior δt and t 0 are still close to the true values as the number of unknown parameters increases to 4 the uncertainty ranges of parameters keep increasing fig 5 a d if the number of observation wells reduces to 1 the uncertainty ranges for each parameter would further increase compared with the corresponding cases with 3 observation wells for 2 unknowns the mean of posterior v and δt are still close to the true value however for 3 and 4 unknowns the posterior distribution of parameters cannot provide a confident estimation the trial and error method provides accurate estimation for each of the 4 parameters fig 6 the minimum mae corresponds to the predefined t 0 no matter which t 0 is chosen fig 6 a it is worth mentioning that the solution of eq 18 for the other three parameters deviates from the true value even when t 0 is accurate but it would not affect the identification of the optimal t 0 hence the trial and error process needs to be conducted for each parameter sequentially for δt v and l the estimated values are identical to the true values for all t 0 demonstrating the robustness of the trial and error method 3 3 sensitivity to the hydraulic and thermal properties aquifer thickness is an important parameter for model geometry for a constant heat source at the inlet and constant groundwater velocity the heat signal for a thicker aquifer can propagate further compared with that for a thinner aquifer fig 7 shows the sensitivity of estimated parameters to b by mcmc method case c1 for the scenario of 2 unknown parameters with 3 observation wells fig 7 m the error of estimated groundwater velocity can increase from 0 accurate b up to 22 25 underestimation of b and 51 50 underestimation of b this finding applies to the scenarios of 2 fig 7 m n and 3 fig 7 g i unknowns with 3 observation wells when the number of unknowns increases to 4 fig 7 a d the error of b still obviously affects the accuracy of groundwater velocity however for the other three unknowns there is no obvious linkage between the error of b and the error of estimates the reason may be there existing internal uncertainty for the mcmc method while the number of unknowns increases to 4 similarly if there is only 1 observation well the error of b can also strongly affect the accuracy of estimated parameters porosity is another important hydraulic property that may affect the performance of the heat tracer method as it is coupled with the actual groundwater velocity eqs 1 and 11 hence the uncertainty of porosity could be transferred to the uncertainty of estimated velocity it can be observed that for the case c2 the error of estimated groundwater velocity is above 40 fig 8 a g m when there are 3 observation wells no matter how many unknowns 2 3 or 4 in contrast overestimation of porosity has less influence on the accuracy of other parameters in addition underestimation of porosity seems to have a stronger impact on the accuracy of all unknowns when there is only 1 observation well the errors are comparable to the corresponding cases with 3 observation wells and the patterns are also similar thermal conductivity of the overlying and underlying layers for the aquifer determines the degree of heat conduction loss along the flowpath eqs 2 and 3 thus it is also a critical parameter that needs to be evaluated it can be observed that for the case c3 the uncertainty of estimated parameter typically increases with the error of thermal conductivity fig 9 the good thing is it has less impact 10 on the estimation of groundwater velocity for all cases although thermal conductivity of the subsurface is usually not measured in the field using empirical value would not be a big issue the sensitivity of estimated groundwater velocity by the trial and error method is like that by the mcmc method in the reasonable error ranges of evaluated model parameter aquifer porosity and thermal conductivity of the adjacent layers are the most and least sensitive to the accuracy of estimated groundwater velocity respectively hence it is recommended to conduct a detailed survey of aquifer porosity and aquifer thickness by drilling a core to reduce the uncertainty of estimated groundwater velocity fig 10 3 4 method limitation the advantage of the mcmc based heat tracer method is that it requires less observation well and is more flexible with the number of unknowns the error for the estimated groundwater velocity could be up to 20 with only 1 well and adding wells can effectively reduce the error although the maximum number of wells we evaluated is 3 the framework of mcmc can be easily extended to any number of wells if available the trial and error method requires 3 observation wells but its accuracy is higher than that of mcmc based method the performance of both methods would be affected due to the uncertainty of model parameters thus measurements of porosity thickness and thermal conductivity is a good start while using the heat tracer method aquifer heterogeneity is another factor that may affect heat transport by analogy with solute transport guo et al 2020 guo et al 2021 irvine et al 2015 the implicit assumption of eq 1 is heat conduction between liquid and solid matrix reaches equilibrium instantaneously however this assumption may be violated when grain size is large or groundwater velocity is high gossler et al 2020 quantifying such heterogeneity is currently a challenge due to the lack of high resolution mapping of spatial temperature profile 4 conclusions we developed a heat tracer method that can serve as a fast screening tool to estimate groundwater discharge to the river this method is built from a closed form analytical solution that considers advective heat transport in the aquifer and heat conduction to the overlying and underlying layers along the flow path groundwater velocity can be estimated via the mcmc based parameter estimation method and the trial and error method both methods exhibit good performance under the ideal condition assuming that model parameters are accurate the sensitivity analysis showed that the accuracy of estimated velocity is most sensitive to the aquifer porosity followed by aquifer thickness and thermal conductivity of the overlying and underlying layers the heat tracer method could be an alternative to the widely used isotope based method to estimate groundwater discharge to rivers credit authorship contribution statement kewei chen conceptualization formal

2524,more research has been done on the uncertainty of stormwater quantity as compared to quality modelling although the washoff model has been in use for decades there is a general lack of studies on the uncertainty associated with washoff modelling and how this uncertainty varies between catchments in different climate zones due to differences in rainfall conditions this study investigated model structure uncertainty in addition to gaining knowledge on model parameter uncertainty in water quality modelling of urban catchments located in two climate zones such a study not only adds to the body of knowledge but highlights the importance of distinguishing the difference in washoff behaviour and their results between catchments in different climate zones following an exhaustive search and assessment of data quality the rainfall discharge and water quality data sourced from 11 residential catchments which include 72 events from temperate catchments and 59 from tropical catchments were analysed comparison of uncertainty between buildup washoff model bw and washoff model wo results for particulate total suspended solids tss mixed total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn and dissolved ortho phosphate op ammonium nh4 n phase water quality parameters were carried by using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method higher average relative interval length aril values obtained for tropical catchments showed that uncertainty in model prediction is higher than temperate catchments this result is confirmed for both the bw and wo modelling approaches the threshold criteria for obtaining behavioural set chosen as likelihood measure of tr 0 7 based on the nash sutcliffe coefficient and η 70 proportion of observed data falling within the 90 uncertainty band of the simulated data distribution over the total number of observations are mostly satisfied for the particulate phase and least by the dissolved phase water quality parameters providing further evidence that the structure of the models are not universally applicable and that model results should be understood in the light of this difference comparisons between the bw and wo approaches showed similar levels of uncertainty irrespective of climate although this is consistent with other studies reported in the literature the antecedent dry period adp a key parameter in the buildup process was not significantly p 07 different between the temperate and tropical datasets this is likely an artifact of sampling especially for temperate catchments where field data is collected during the rainy season when adp is limited and similar with catchment in the tropics keywords uncertainty assessment generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue climatic classification buildup and washoff water quality modelling data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction models cannot predict with complete accuracy because of uncertainties in the modelling process gupta et al 2006 yang et al 2008 beven 2009 dotto et al 2012 therefore it is important to estimate the uncertainty associated with a model output so that the accuracy of the result can be quantified modelling uncertainty can be interpreted by producing a model s output as a range which is close to the true value of a simulated variable freni and mannina 2010a freni and mannina 2010b although studies have identified the potential sources of uncertainty in stormwater quality modelling the current state of knowledge regarding uncertainties in urban drainage models is poor deletic et al 2012 the sources of intrinsic uncertainty include model parameters model inputs data used and model structure evaluation of each source of uncertainty independently is not appropriate because of the strong connection between these sources there have been more research conducted on the uncertainty of rainfall runoff modelling kuczera and franks 2002 kavetski et al 2003 vrugt et al 2005 duan et al 1992 nandakumar and mein 1997 than runoff quality modelling freni and mannina 2010a freni and mannina 2010b tung et al 2006 harmel and smith 2007 gaume et al 1998 kanso et al 2003 kanso et al 2005 kanso et al 2006 dotto et al 2009 freni et al 2009 and willems 2008 showed that uncertainty is higher in water quality modelling compared to flow modelling in addition dotto et al 2012 also discussed the inherent problem with the structure of water quality models and inconsistencies in water quality predictions buildup and washoff models have been developed based on simplifications of the natural system and may be more appropriate for distinct and well defined catchments such as road and roof surfaces therefore results from the scaling up to the catchment scale are usually not guaranteed among the different sources of uncertainty in water quality modelling parameter uncertainty is arguably the most significant since the non uniqueness of parameter values can often result in different parameter sets capable of reproducing the same water quality response beven and binley 1992 gupta et al 2006 efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 gaume et al 1998 also showed that different calibration methods can produce different parameter sets demonstrating similarly good fits with the measured data in water quality modelling the state of knowledge regarding uncertainties in urban drainage models is poor in part due to a lack of clarity and or consensus on the way in which the results of model uncertainty analyses are obtained presented and used deletic et al 2012 other factors such as the lack of water quality data lack of knowledge of modelling uncertainty in the urban drainage modelling field and high computational effort have also been cited mannina and viviani 2010 past studies on uncertainty in water quality modelling have focused on comparing between model structures as it is more expedient to compare results between models using the data collected at a single study site freni et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 dotto et al 2010 kanso et al 2005 freni et al 2009 investigated eight different combination of buildup and washoff models with data collected from a residential area of bologna italy zhang et al 2015 assessed model uncertainty using 3 combinations of buildup and washoff models in shanghai china in general studies show that the exponential buildup and washoff model showed better performance than the power function buildup and washoff model it is also significant that most studies have been conducted using data collected from catchments in the temperate zone model parameters are usually calibrated based on field data calibration using measured data faces several limitations data is limited due to the difficulty and cost of the monitoring measurements are subjected to errors and may be at scales vastly different to that required in the model bertrand krajewski 2007 beven 2009 water quality parameters at a point may not reflect the heterogeneity in space and non stationarity in time of the process over the whole catchment beven 2009 the calibrated parameter values therefore represent effective values that provide agreement between predicted and observed outcomes in the model compensating for the heterogeneity in space and non stationary in time and factors not accounted for by the model studies conducted in different parts of the world have noted that the influence of rainfall characteristics on water quality modelling chow et al 2012 alias et al 2014 chaudhary et al 2021 avellaneda et al 2009 showed that modelling uncertainty is reduced if the model is used under the same rainfall conditions as during calibration gaume et al 1998 stated that uncertainty is high between rainfall events that have vastly different rainfall characteristics chaudhary et al 2021 showed that washoff parameters are sensitive to rainfall characteristics these studies reveal the influence of rainfall characteristics on modelling given the differences in rainfall behaviour it is reasonable to expect that modelling uncertainty will differ between catchments in different climate zones the uncertainty in water quality modelling is also complicated by model structure doubts have been cast on the validity of incorporating buildup models shaw et al 2010 egodawatta et al 2007 and lumping buildup with the washoff model may introduce greater uncertainty to the overall model performance the validity of buildup model based on adp in tropical catchments is also questioned gaut et al 2019 le et al 2017 chow et al 2012 due to the relatively short adp and increased erosive energy in the tropics and studies assessing model structure uncertainty in tropical catchments are lacking there is therefore evidence linking the sensitivity of model parameter set and structure with the rainfall properties therefore the objectives of this study were i synthesise washoff water quality and flow data reported in the literature collected from temperate and tropical zones for the purpose of uncertainty analysis ii assess model structure uncertainty and iii assess model parameter uncertainty in water quality modelling between different climatic conditions 2 methodology 2 1 generalized liklihood uncertainity estimation glue various techniques such as generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 the bayesian approach by the dynamic identifiability analysis dynia wagener et al 2003 and the shuffled complex evolution metropolis scem ua vrugt et al 2003 have been introduced to quantify uncertainty dotto et al 2012 conducted a study on the comparison of different parameter uncertainty assessment methods including classical bayesian techniques kanso et al 2003 2004 2005 kuczera et al 2006 lindblom et al 2007 mccarthy et al 2008 pseudo bayesian techniques beven and binley 1992 mannina et al 2006 thorndahl et al 2008 and reported that the prediction uncertainty is similar for all methods the authors suggested that modellers should select the method which is most suitable for the system modelled considering the complexity of the model s structure including the number of parameters skill or knowledge level the information available and the study purpose this study uses a pseudo bayesian technique the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation glue the basic idea of glue is given our inability to develop a mathematical model that represents nature exactly there will always be several different models that mimic the observed physical process equally well such equally acceptable or behavioural models are defined as equifinal the concept of equifinality represents the situation where several sets of parameters are capable of providing the same model outputs or at least outputs that cannot be discerned from one another the glue methodology makes no presumption that any one set of parameter values represents a true parameter set to be found by calibration beven and binley 1992 therefore the problem of searching for an optimum parameter set is transformed into a search for sets of parameter values that give reliable simulations glue is based on monte carlo simulation and applies random sampling of parameters from a probability distribution the simulated results are compared using the nash and sutcliffe efficiency index nash and sutcliffe 1970 chosen as a likelihood measure 1 ns 1 i 1 n x obs i x sim i 2 i 1 n x obs i x mean 2 where xobs i is the observed value at time step i xsim i is the simulated value xmean is the observed mean value and n is the total number of observations adopting ns as a likelihood measure the ns for all the calibration events are aggregated with equal weight to obtain the likelihood or sumns during the calibration phase model parameters from behavioural or acceptable simulation runs θi are retained and their likelihood weights e θi are re scaled so that their cumulative total sum is equal to 1 the re scaled likelihood weights sumns θi are obtained according to 2 s u m n s θ i e θ i j 1 n e θ j where n is the number of retained behavioural simulations a higher sumns means that the parameter set is able to simulate all the calibration events well a user defined acceptability threshold tr is chosen and parameter sets with poor likelihood sumns tr are regarded as non behavioral and rejected and all other parameter sets where sumns tr are regarded as behavioral in this study tr 0 7 was used where threshold is chosen as a trade off process between the maximum affordable computational cost and the amount of information that can be gained from the analysis represented by the uniformity of likelihood distributions freni et al 2008 who used tr 0 7 as the acceptability threshold of model uncertainty response for an integrated urban drainage model showed that results showed that adopting tr 0 7 enabled a better identification of the most important model parameters the posterior distributions of parameters were derived by weighting the sampled parameter values by the likelihood sumns the likelihood is scaled such that the cumulative likelihood over all 10 000 parameter sets is unity in the glue method the 5 and 95 cumulative likelihood distributions outline the 90 uncertainty band the average relative interval length aril is a measure of the width of the uncertainty band 3 aril 1 n i 1 n x ui x li x obs i where xui and xli are the upper and the lower boundary values of the 90 uncertainty band respectively n is the number of data points and xobs i is the ith observed value modelled results may still be rejected if the observed data fall outside the uncertainty bands the η criterion yang et al 2008 li et al 2010 is the proportion of observed data falling within the 90 uncertainty band of the simulated data distribution over the total number of observations the upper limit for this criterion is one meaning that the observations are all contained within the 90 band thus a higher value of η implies a higher confidence in the model prediction a model is considered to perform better if it shows a low aril and a large η in this study an initial value of η 70 was adopted as acceptable 2 2 model description two modelling approaches were used to study model structure uncertainty the first approach bw incorporates buildup function to estimate the initial mass bini followed by a washoff model to estimate the washoff load w the second approach wo treats bini as a calibration parameter of the washoff model and therefore does not require a buildup model to estimate bini the bw approach requires an additional buildup model and therefore more parameters compared to the wo approach potentially introducing greater uncertainty to the overall model prediction some have also questioned the validity of the buildup process pitt et al 2005 egodawatta et al 2007 shaw et al 2010 a comparison of the uncertainty of w estimated between these two approaches will therefore provide further information of the usefulness of buildup model the exponential buildup model huber et al 1988 is stated as b c 1 1 e x p a d p c 2 where b is the initial buildup kg c1 is the maximum buildup load kg ha c 2 is the buildup rate 1 days and adp is the antecedent dry period days for washoff a modified form of the expotential washoff model rossman 2009 was used 5 w c 3 q c 4 b where w is the washoff rate mg hr q is the measured runoff rate mm hr b is the mass of pollutant on the surface mg and c3 and c4 are the washoff coefficient and exponent respectively when the value of c4 is unity c3 has the same units as coefficient k per mm as proposed by sartor et al 1974 at time t 0 b bini and is either calculated from a buildup model eq 4 or calibrated the entire loadagraph for any given event can be constructed by successive application of eq 6 for all time intervals i 6 w i c 3 q i c 4 b i 1 w i 1 δ t where δt is the time step the model parameters to be calibrated and their recommended initial values thorndahl et al 2008 avellaneda et al 2009 freni et al 2009 mannina and viviani 2010 wang et al 2011 are listed in table 2 the bw approach uses 4 parameters c1 c 2 c3 and c4 and the wo approach uses only eq 5 in the modelling of washoff and has three calibration parameters c3 c4 and bini 2 3 monte carlo analysis to ensure that the range of parameters adequately covers the entire search space the monte carlo simulations were initially run with ranges table 2 that were about 5 wider than the lower and upper limits suggested in the literature thorndahl et al 2008 avellaneda et al 2009 freni et al 2009 mannina and viviani 2010 wang et al 2011 following this initial run the results were inspected if the best parameter sets behvioural sets were found to be at the boundaries of the predefined range the boundary was expanded and the monte carlo simulations repeated on the other hand if the best parameter sets were concentrated around a range that was smaller than the initially assumed upper and lower bounds the search space was narrowed this process was repeated until the maximum parameters sets showed reasonable fits within the bounds set an initial analysis was also conducted comparing results between 10 000 and 20 000 parameter sets this initial analysis was conducted on one randomly chosen event for each catchment monte carlo technique was used to generate either 10 000 or 20 000 random realizations and the model output was evaluated against the measured values using the sumns likelihood measure to check if the results were robust with respect to the number of model realizations the kolmogorov smirnov test was used the results show the cdfs of simulated w wsim from the given ranges of c1 c 2 c3 and c4 results from 10 000 parameter sets are not significantly different p 0 05 from that derived from 20 000 parameter sets thus 10 000 behavior parameter sets were considered sufficient to define the posterior distribution of the 4 parameters we did not test fewer that 10 000 parameter sets 2 4 statistical analyses where appropriate the shapiro wilk and lilliefors ghasemi and zahediasl 2012 tests for normality were used to understand the distribution of a dataset these tests assess the central tendency to enable the choice between parametric or non parametric statistical tests to be made either the mann whitney or independent t tests nachar 2008 were applied on paired data based on the distribution of data to analyze for differences in means all statistical tests were carried out using the statistical package for the social sciences or spss ibm 2020 statistical software package 3 study areas and data used time series datasets were collected from studies conducted around the world and reported in the literature the datasets were divided into two groups tropical and temperate catchments based on the köppen climate classification which utilizes temperature and precipitation data separating the world into specific climate zones data from a further three sites in geelong australia collected as part of this study were also analysed a summary of the study sites is provided in table 1 the 11 catchments comprise five in the tropical zone and six in the temperate zone a total of 131 storm events approximately 5000 samples analyzed were monitored at these sites out of which 59 events are from catchments in the tropics and 72 from catchments with a temperate climate le et al 2017 monitored a total of 46 rainfall events collecting about 550 samples from four residential catchments in singapore ccka cckn cckc and verde rainfall was measured on site using rimco 8020 tipping bucket rain gauges and an isco 2150 flow area velocity sensor was used to measure runoff at 1 min intervals runoff samples were collected using an automated sampler mattraw and sherwood 1977 conducted their studies at a residential site in pompano beach pampano b broward county florida a 0 01 in 1 in 25 4 mm tipping bucket rain gauge was used to measure rainfall and stage measurements upstream of a u shaped venturi flume were used to monitor discharge the results for 13 out of the 33 events that were monitored were used for this study ebbert et al 1985 measured discharge in two residential catchments surrey down surrey d and lake hills lake h in bellevue washington usa by converting stage observations in a v notch weir rainfall data were collected at 5 minute intervals using 0 01 in resolution tipping bucket rain gauges a total of 700 samples were analysed comprising 38 and 39 events monitored across surrey d and lake h respectively out of which 11 events for surrey d and 19 events for lake h were chosen to be analysed for this study morgan et al 2020 carried out investigations in kimmage kim dublin ireland runoff from 18 rain events was monitored with discharge measured with an isco 2150 area velocity sensor and rainfall with a tipping bucket rain gauge a total of 162 samples were analysed lastly flow and water quality data were collected from three residential catchments in geelong australia bellarine bel rita court rc and warralily war as part of this study the data set was collected between july 2017 and september 2021 and included rainfall water level velocity and stormwater samples for a total of 24 rain events rainfall was measured every 1 min with an isco rain gauge and recorded in 0 1 mm increments and velocity and water depth was measured with an isco 2150 area velocity sensor runoff samples were collected using an isco avalanche portable refrigerated sampler equipped with 14 950 ml bottles more information regarding the data used can be obtained from the references listed in table 1 fig 1 shows the rainfall characteristics of all the events that were selected to be used in the current study the box plots show the median 25 and 75 quartiles and the length of whiskers represent 1 5 times the inter quartile range of the dataset data points that lie beyond 1 5 times the inter quantile range are considered outliers and these are denoted by the symbols the rainfall characteristics are significantly higher in the tropical catchments compared to temperate catchments and the peak discharge is also higher in the tropics the data was used to calibrate the bw and wo models and parameter sets where ns tr were considered to be acceptable ten thousand monte carlo simulations were run adopting the ranges listed in table 2 as initial values uniform distributions were assumed during parameter sampling to represent the prior distribution of c1 c 2 c3 and c4 consistent with beven 2009 and freni and mannina 2010a freni and mannina 2010b 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration results the 90 prediction uncertainty band for tss using the bw approach is shown in fig 2 for events with the median ns plotted for each site plots for other stormwater quality parameters using the bw approach are shown in fig s1 supplementary material fig 3 shows the corresponding 90 prediction uncertainty band using the wo approach and the results for all water quality parameters using the wo approach are shown in fig s2 supplementary material surrey d and lake h do not have continuous time series rainfall data as only average rainfall intensity i av and duration t d for the individual events are reported fig 2 a and b and 3 a and b the data for florida are also not included in fig 2 as the adp was not reported for the florida dataset the temp and trop in fig 2 and 3 represents temperate and tropical climate respectively furthermore red and black lines shows 5 and 95 uncertainty estimation respectively and symbol o represents observed water quality parameters an observation of the median ns storm events in fig 2 and 3 show that the peak tss washoff loading rate is about an order of magnitude higher for sites in the tropics fig 2 g and 3 g and onwards washoff loading for tp tn op and nh4 n from tropical sites is also about 10 times higher than temperate sites fig 1s and 2s supplementary material given that the land use is similar this higher loading in the tropics is attributed to the higher rainfalls and discharge in addition to higher volumes higher rainfall intensity in the tropics result in higher rainfall impact energy which is better able to detach material from catchment surfaces increasing washoff load shaw et al 2010 the rainfall characteristics of the tropical and temperate sites were assessed independently to test if the rainfall data are from the same distribution the kruskal wallis test was chosen since shapiro wilk tests for normality revealed that the rainfall variables do not follow the normal distribution p 05 the test results indicate that d p 052 and 0 050 for tropical and temperate datasets respectively imax p 172 and 0 309 for tropical and temperate datasets respectively and iav p 072 and 0 393 for tropical and temperate datasets respectively were not significantly different mann whitney tests on rainfall data that were grouped by combining sites according to climate classification confirmed that d imax iav between the temperate and tropical datasets were statistically different p 05 the kruskal wallis test carried out on qp for sites with the same climatic classification differed significantly p 05 although rainfall for catchments with the same climate is expected to have similar characteristics flow may differ because runoff is influenced by the physical characteristics of the catchment subsequent mann whitney test conducted between the grouped tropical and temperate datasets shows that they are significantly different p 05 the threshold criterion of tr 0 7 was not achievable for the water quality parameters in dissolved op nh4 n form as there were insufficient behavioural realizations to obtain the 90 uncertainty band for parameters in the dissolved phase therefore the acceptability threshold was reduced to tr 0 5 with tr 0 7 retained for all other water quality parameters by applying these values of tr it was found that the criterion of η 70 was fulfilled mostly by tss 76 out of 131 events followed by tp and tn 57 out of 113 and 36 out of 113 events respectively and op and nh4 n 26 out of 113and 35 out of 105 events respectively the relaxation of the tr criterion for dissolved phase parameters suggests that the structure of both models is more suitable for parameters in particulate tss and mixed tn tp forms and least suitable for the dissolved phase op nh4 n there are many studies chaudhary et al 2021 gaut et al 2019 where results of the wash off model is more satisfactory for particulate pollutants moreover the model will not be able to capture the complex processes associated with the attenuation of these parameters in their entirety especially for dissolved pollutants as the concept of incipient motion mobilised by motion applies less to pollutants in dissolved forms such as op lastly it is observed in fig 1 and 2 that aril for the median ns storm event is larger for the tropical than the temperate catchments overall temperate catchment aril values for tss range between 0 7 and 6 1 with an average of 2 2 and standard deviation of 1 4 for the bw approach aril ranges between 0 5 and 5 5 with an average of 1 9 and standard deviation of 1 1 for the wo approach compared to the temperate catchments the aril for tropical sites vary from 2 1 to 341 with a higher average value of 42 1 and standard deviation of 69 2 for the bw model and average of 31 8 53 1 standard deviation for the wo model the aril values are also larger for other water quality parameters for the tropical study sites figs s1 and s2 supplementary material it is thus generally observed that in addition to load aril for both modelling approaches is also higher for tropical than temperate sites for all the water quality parameters investigated 4 2 comparison of uncertainty between modelling approaches the modelling uncertainty for tss between the two modelling approaches is compared in fig 4 which shows the distribution of aril for all events meeting the η 70 criterion aril for pampano b using the bw approach was not calculated since adp data for pampano b are not available the war catchment study did not include nh4 n results for the other water quality parameters are shown in fig s3 supplementary material also distribution of behavioural sets for all the water quality parameter were shown in fig s5 supplementary material this comparison shows that there is generally little difference in aril between the bw and the wo approaches in modelling tss when compared on an individual catchment basis similar observations are made for the other water quality parameters fig 3s supplementary material the aril values obtained from both modelling approaches for sites with the same climatic classification were pooled for further statistical analysis pooling of the data is justified since the rainfalls for sites with the same climatic classification were not statistically different kruskal wallis test comparison of the aril value between two modelling approaches were made using either the independent t test or mann whitney test depending on the distribution shapiro wilk test of the aril the tss aril values between the two modelling approaches are not statistically different with p 377 and 0 781 for tropical and temperate catchments respectively similar results were obtained for tp p 180 tn p 327 op p 261 nh4 n p 517 for the tropical catchments and p 586 0 697 0 894 and 0 992 for tp tn op and nh4 n respectively for temperate catchments this result shows that although the bw approach incorporates two models and has an additional calibration parameter the uncertainty in results is not significantly different to the wo approach this may imply that buildup does not have a significant influence on modelling uncertainty however most water quality data are collected during periods when rainfall is frequent irrespective of climate zone and as a result the adp during the sampling period may be limited this is an artifact of sampling although on average the adp in temperate regions is longer than the tropics however the actual adp the during the monitoring period is shorter a comparison of adp between the pooled datasets shows that the adp values between the temperate and tropical datasets are not significantly different mann whitney test p 07 previous research has shown that for events with adp less than 3 days the influence of adp is not obvious zhang et al 2015 this is the case for the data reported in the literature where the average adp 1 standard deviation for the pooled temperate site data is 3 4 3 7 days which is close to the average adp of 2 7 3 5 days for the tropical sites also comparison of behavioural sets between two modelling approaches for sites within the same climatic classification show that they are usually in the range from 100 to 1000 for both climatic classifications this reveal that climatic condition does not play an important factor for size of parameter ensemble 4 3 modelling uncertainty between catchments in temperate and tropical zones although aril is similar between the bw and wo modelling approaches previous section the main difference in aril however is between temperate versus the tropical catchments comparisons of modelling uncertainty between the temperate and tropical zones are focused only for the wo model since both modelling approaches yielded similar results the distribution of aril and η for all water quality variables are shown in fig 5 similar plots for the bw model are shown in fig s4 supplementary material for temperate catchments aril is less scattered compared to tropical catchments although the aril for the dissolved parameters op and nh4 n appear to be of the same order as the particulate and mixed phase parameters given that the tr criterion for op and nh4 n was relaxed from 0 7 to 0 5 this gives an indication that uncertainty increases as the model progress from making predictions from the particulate to the dissolved phase this observation is to be expected since washoff models are primarily intended to model the particulate phase the trend for the tropical dataset however is not as clear studies chaudhary et al 2021 chow et al 2012 egodawatta et al 2007 freni et al 2009 aronica et al 2005 manz et al 2013 have shown that the wo model parameters are dependent on rainfall characteristics and washoff parameters for tropical sites exhibit a less distinct trend with rainfall compared to temperate catchments fig 5 also shows that when comparing aril between climate zones the uncertainty is higher for the tropical dataset for any given water quality parameter the aril values from catchments in the two climate zones were pooled into temperate and tropical datasets for each water quality parameter the pooled temperate and tropical aril values did not follow the normal distribution shapiro wilk test p 0 05 for any of the water quality parameters subsequent mann whitney test revealed that aril between the temperate and tropical datasets were significantly different p 01 for all water quality parameters although pampano beach florida is categorized as tropical it belongs to a different sub category am with distinctly different rainfall patters to singapore af an inspection of the rain data shows that the rainfall characteristics are closer to the temperate catchments and thus is significant that it exhibits aril values that are more consistent with temperate catchments it has been shown that modelling uncertainty for tropics is larger than the temperate zone for all the water quality parameters studied if the same models are to be used for different climate zones it should be expected that applications in the tropics will yield results that are less accurate than in the temperate regions future efforts should be put into the development of models specific to tropical climate that account for the high rainfall intensities in addition to flow this is consistent with approaches taken by vaze and chiew 2003 and mccarthy et al 2012 who highlight the role of rainfall kinetic energy in the mobilisation and transport process 4 4 dependence of uncertainty on rainfall characteristics further insights into the dependence of uncertainties to different rainfall conditions were obtained from correlation analysis done on the pooled tropical and temperate datasets this will elucidate the dependence of aril of both buildup washoff model bw and washoff model wo on climatic classification as any difference in behaviour found may provide clarity on the physical significance of the model uncertainty prior to correlation analysis the lilliefors test ghasemi and zahediasl 2012 was first conducted on the pooled datasets to understand how the aril rainfall variables are distributed testing against the normal lognormal and exponential distributions the test results indicated that for the temperate and tropical dataset aril bw aril wo d imax iav and adp are log normally distributed for all water quality parameters the pearson correlation analysis was therefore used to investigate correlations between the aril for both model with rainfall variables the result of this analysis includes the pearson correlation coefficient r and p values in general the number of significant α 0 05 0 01 correlations between the rainfall variables with model parameters which are observed for both tropical and temperate datasets is higher for tss and reduces to at most two significant correlations for mixed tp and dissolved op forms this is expected since the washoff model is better suited for particulates gaut et al 2019 as understood by a particulate transport process governed by critical stress criteria comparing between temperate and tropical dataset for tss the temperate dataset has a larger number of significant correlations between the aril bw and aril wo with rainfall variable respectively uncertainty is strongly correlated with maximum 5 min intensity r 0 405 p 006 for aril bw and r 0 314 p 004 for aril wo respectively however no significant correlation was found for tropical dataset similar process was performed for tp where significant correlation was found between aril bw with d r 0 469 p 018 iav r 0 486 p 014 and aril wo with d r 0 579 p 004 iav r 0 538 p 008 imax r 0 439 p 0036 for temperate dataset however for tropical dataset only adp was significant correlation was found with aril bw r 0 370 p 048 in addition for tn in temperate dataset aril bw and aril wo are strongly correlated with imax r 0 428 p 029 and r 0 388 p 004 respectively and for tropical no significant correlation was found however for both op and nh4 n positive correlation was found between aril bw wo with adp for tropical dataset but no correlation was found for temperate dataset for both models the analysis shows that uncertainty in temperate climate is linked rainfall intensity whereas there is some evidence indicating that adp may play important role in uncertainty in tropical climate but the result is not conclusive 5 conclusions this study evaluated the uncertainty associated with urban water quality modelling for various residential sites located in temperate and tropical zones the washoff model approach is well used by practitioners and is conceptually simple to understand our approach has been to better explain a model that is already broadly accepted although widely used there are questions regarding the uncertainty about the washoff modelling approach by moving away from a black box approach and presenting a knowledge of uncertainty reliance to physical factors this research aimed to resolve some of these uncertainties to our knowledge this is the first study examining such dynamics across climatic zones and more research of this kind is required to understand the washoff model s applicability better the following are conclusions from this study i aril is higher for tropical than temperate catchments for all water quality parameters studied this result is true for both modelling approaches adopted and can therefore be considered independent of modelling approaches ii the threshold criterion of tr was reduced to 0 5 for parameters in dissolved op nh4 n form as there were insufficient behavioural realizations to obtain 90 uncertainty band based on this relaxation for op and nh4 n it is found that the structure of both model approaches is more suitable for particulate tss followed by parameters in mixed form iii comparison of uncertainties between the two modelling approach shows that both modelling approaches have similar level of uncertainty irrespective of climatic zones although the bw approach incorporates two models and has an additional calibration parameter the uncertainty in results is not significantly higher that the wo approach however this might be an artefact of the short adp especially for temperate sites of the data used iv the higher uncertainty of modelling results for tropical and temperate catchments highlights the need for model improvements taking into account higher rainfall intensities characteristic of these catchments credit authorship contribution statement shagun chaudhary conceptualization data curation

2524,more research has been done on the uncertainty of stormwater quantity as compared to quality modelling although the washoff model has been in use for decades there is a general lack of studies on the uncertainty associated with washoff modelling and how this uncertainty varies between catchments in different climate zones due to differences in rainfall conditions this study investigated model structure uncertainty in addition to gaining knowledge on model parameter uncertainty in water quality modelling of urban catchments located in two climate zones such a study not only adds to the body of knowledge but highlights the importance of distinguishing the difference in washoff behaviour and their results between catchments in different climate zones following an exhaustive search and assessment of data quality the rainfall discharge and water quality data sourced from 11 residential catchments which include 72 events from temperate catchments and 59 from tropical catchments were analysed comparison of uncertainty between buildup washoff model bw and washoff model wo results for particulate total suspended solids tss mixed total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn and dissolved ortho phosphate op ammonium nh4 n phase water quality parameters were carried by using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method higher average relative interval length aril values obtained for tropical catchments showed that uncertainty in model prediction is higher than temperate catchments this result is confirmed for both the bw and wo modelling approaches the threshold criteria for obtaining behavioural set chosen as likelihood measure of tr 0 7 based on the nash sutcliffe coefficient and η 70 proportion of observed data falling within the 90 uncertainty band of the simulated data distribution over the total number of observations are mostly satisfied for the particulate phase and least by the dissolved phase water quality parameters providing further evidence that the structure of the models are not universally applicable and that model results should be understood in the light of this difference comparisons between the bw and wo approaches showed similar levels of uncertainty irrespective of climate although this is consistent with other studies reported in the literature the antecedent dry period adp a key parameter in the buildup process was not significantly p 07 different between the temperate and tropical datasets this is likely an artifact of sampling especially for temperate catchments where field data is collected during the rainy season when adp is limited and similar with catchment in the tropics keywords uncertainty assessment generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue climatic classification buildup and washoff water quality modelling data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction models cannot predict with complete accuracy because of uncertainties in the modelling process gupta et al 2006 yang et al 2008 beven 2009 dotto et al 2012 therefore it is important to estimate the uncertainty associated with a model output so that the accuracy of the result can be quantified modelling uncertainty can be interpreted by producing a model s output as a range which is close to the true value of a simulated variable freni and mannina 2010a freni and mannina 2010b although studies have identified the potential sources of uncertainty in stormwater quality modelling the current state of knowledge regarding uncertainties in urban drainage models is poor deletic et al 2012 the sources of intrinsic uncertainty include model parameters model inputs data used and model structure evaluation of each source of uncertainty independently is not appropriate because of the strong connection between these sources there have been more research conducted on the uncertainty of rainfall runoff modelling kuczera and franks 2002 kavetski et al 2003 vrugt et al 2005 duan et al 1992 nandakumar and mein 1997 than runoff quality modelling freni and mannina 2010a freni and mannina 2010b tung et al 2006 harmel and smith 2007 gaume et al 1998 kanso et al 2003 kanso et al 2005 kanso et al 2006 dotto et al 2009 freni et al 2009 and willems 2008 showed that uncertainty is higher in water quality modelling compared to flow modelling in addition dotto et al 2012 also discussed the inherent problem with the structure of water quality models and inconsistencies in water quality predictions buildup and washoff models have been developed based on simplifications of the natural system and may be more appropriate for distinct and well defined catchments such as road and roof surfaces therefore results from the scaling up to the catchment scale are usually not guaranteed among the different sources of uncertainty in water quality modelling parameter uncertainty is arguably the most significant since the non uniqueness of parameter values can often result in different parameter sets capable of reproducing the same water quality response beven and binley 1992 gupta et al 2006 efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 gaume et al 1998 also showed that different calibration methods can produce different parameter sets demonstrating similarly good fits with the measured data in water quality modelling the state of knowledge regarding uncertainties in urban drainage models is poor in part due to a lack of clarity and or consensus on the way in which the results of model uncertainty analyses are obtained presented and used deletic et al 2012 other factors such as the lack of water quality data lack of knowledge of modelling uncertainty in the urban drainage modelling field and high computational effort have also been cited mannina and viviani 2010 past studies on uncertainty in water quality modelling have focused on comparing between model structures as it is more expedient to compare results between models using the data collected at a single study site freni et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 dotto et al 2010 kanso et al 2005 freni et al 2009 investigated eight different combination of buildup and washoff models with data collected from a residential area of bologna italy zhang et al 2015 assessed model uncertainty using 3 combinations of buildup and washoff models in shanghai china in general studies show that the exponential buildup and washoff model showed better performance than the power function buildup and washoff model it is also significant that most studies have been conducted using data collected from catchments in the temperate zone model parameters are usually calibrated based on field data calibration using measured data faces several limitations data is limited due to the difficulty and cost of the monitoring measurements are subjected to errors and may be at scales vastly different to that required in the model bertrand krajewski 2007 beven 2009 water quality parameters at a point may not reflect the heterogeneity in space and non stationarity in time of the process over the whole catchment beven 2009 the calibrated parameter values therefore represent effective values that provide agreement between predicted and observed outcomes in the model compensating for the heterogeneity in space and non stationary in time and factors not accounted for by the model studies conducted in different parts of the world have noted that the influence of rainfall characteristics on water quality modelling chow et al 2012 alias et al 2014 chaudhary et al 2021 avellaneda et al 2009 showed that modelling uncertainty is reduced if the model is used under the same rainfall conditions as during calibration gaume et al 1998 stated that uncertainty is high between rainfall events that have vastly different rainfall characteristics chaudhary et al 2021 showed that washoff parameters are sensitive to rainfall characteristics these studies reveal the influence of rainfall characteristics on modelling given the differences in rainfall behaviour it is reasonable to expect that modelling uncertainty will differ between catchments in different climate zones the uncertainty in water quality modelling is also complicated by model structure doubts have been cast on the validity of incorporating buildup models shaw et al 2010 egodawatta et al 2007 and lumping buildup with the washoff model may introduce greater uncertainty to the overall model performance the validity of buildup model based on adp in tropical catchments is also questioned gaut et al 2019 le et al 2017 chow et al 2012 due to the relatively short adp and increased erosive energy in the tropics and studies assessing model structure uncertainty in tropical catchments are lacking there is therefore evidence linking the sensitivity of model parameter set and structure with the rainfall properties therefore the objectives of this study were i synthesise washoff water quality and flow data reported in the literature collected from temperate and tropical zones for the purpose of uncertainty analysis ii assess model structure uncertainty and iii assess model parameter uncertainty in water quality modelling between different climatic conditions 2 methodology 2 1 generalized liklihood uncertainity estimation glue various techniques such as generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 the bayesian approach by the dynamic identifiability analysis dynia wagener et al 2003 and the shuffled complex evolution metropolis scem ua vrugt et al 2003 have been introduced to quantify uncertainty dotto et al 2012 conducted a study on the comparison of different parameter uncertainty assessment methods including classical bayesian techniques kanso et al 2003 2004 2005 kuczera et al 2006 lindblom et al 2007 mccarthy et al 2008 pseudo bayesian techniques beven and binley 1992 mannina et al 2006 thorndahl et al 2008 and reported that the prediction uncertainty is similar for all methods the authors suggested that modellers should select the method which is most suitable for the system modelled considering the complexity of the model s structure including the number of parameters skill or knowledge level the information available and the study purpose this study uses a pseudo bayesian technique the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation glue the basic idea of glue is given our inability to develop a mathematical model that represents nature exactly there will always be several different models that mimic the observed physical process equally well such equally acceptable or behavioural models are defined as equifinal the concept of equifinality represents the situation where several sets of parameters are capable of providing the same model outputs or at least outputs that cannot be discerned from one another the glue methodology makes no presumption that any one set of parameter values represents a true parameter set to be found by calibration beven and binley 1992 therefore the problem of searching for an optimum parameter set is transformed into a search for sets of parameter values that give reliable simulations glue is based on monte carlo simulation and applies random sampling of parameters from a probability distribution the simulated results are compared using the nash and sutcliffe efficiency index nash and sutcliffe 1970 chosen as a likelihood measure 1 ns 1 i 1 n x obs i x sim i 2 i 1 n x obs i x mean 2 where xobs i is the observed value at time step i xsim i is the simulated value xmean is the observed mean value and n is the total number of observations adopting ns as a likelihood measure the ns for all the calibration events are aggregated with equal weight to obtain the likelihood or sumns during the calibration phase model parameters from behavioural or acceptable simulation runs θi are retained and their likelihood weights e θi are re scaled so that their cumulative total sum is equal to 1 the re scaled likelihood weights sumns θi are obtained according to 2 s u m n s θ i e θ i j 1 n e θ j where n is the number of retained behavioural simulations a higher sumns means that the parameter set is able to simulate all the calibration events well a user defined acceptability threshold tr is chosen and parameter sets with poor likelihood sumns tr are regarded as non behavioral and rejected and all other parameter sets where sumns tr are regarded as behavioral in this study tr 0 7 was used where threshold is chosen as a trade off process between the maximum affordable computational cost and the amount of information that can be gained from the analysis represented by the uniformity of likelihood distributions freni et al 2008 who used tr 0 7 as the acceptability threshold of model uncertainty response for an integrated urban drainage model showed that results showed that adopting tr 0 7 enabled a better identification of the most important model parameters the posterior distributions of parameters were derived by weighting the sampled parameter values by the likelihood sumns the likelihood is scaled such that the cumulative likelihood over all 10 000 parameter sets is unity in the glue method the 5 and 95 cumulative likelihood distributions outline the 90 uncertainty band the average relative interval length aril is a measure of the width of the uncertainty band 3 aril 1 n i 1 n x ui x li x obs i where xui and xli are the upper and the lower boundary values of the 90 uncertainty band respectively n is the number of data points and xobs i is the ith observed value modelled results may still be rejected if the observed data fall outside the uncertainty bands the η criterion yang et al 2008 li et al 2010 is the proportion of observed data falling within the 90 uncertainty band of the simulated data distribution over the total number of observations the upper limit for this criterion is one meaning that the observations are all contained within the 90 band thus a higher value of η implies a higher confidence in the model prediction a model is considered to perform better if it shows a low aril and a large η in this study an initial value of η 70 was adopted as acceptable 2 2 model description two modelling approaches were used to study model structure uncertainty the first approach bw incorporates buildup function to estimate the initial mass bini followed by a washoff model to estimate the washoff load w the second approach wo treats bini as a calibration parameter of the washoff model and therefore does not require a buildup model to estimate bini the bw approach requires an additional buildup model and therefore more parameters compared to the wo approach potentially introducing greater uncertainty to the overall model prediction some have also questioned the validity of the buildup process pitt et al 2005 egodawatta et al 2007 shaw et al 2010 a comparison of the uncertainty of w estimated between these two approaches will therefore provide further information of the usefulness of buildup model the exponential buildup model huber et al 1988 is stated as b c 1 1 e x p a d p c 2 where b is the initial buildup kg c1 is the maximum buildup load kg ha c 2 is the buildup rate 1 days and adp is the antecedent dry period days for washoff a modified form of the expotential washoff model rossman 2009 was used 5 w c 3 q c 4 b where w is the washoff rate mg hr q is the measured runoff rate mm hr b is the mass of pollutant on the surface mg and c3 and c4 are the washoff coefficient and exponent respectively when the value of c4 is unity c3 has the same units as coefficient k per mm as proposed by sartor et al 1974 at time t 0 b bini and is either calculated from a buildup model eq 4 or calibrated the entire loadagraph for any given event can be constructed by successive application of eq 6 for all time intervals i 6 w i c 3 q i c 4 b i 1 w i 1 δ t where δt is the time step the model parameters to be calibrated and their recommended initial values thorndahl et al 2008 avellaneda et al 2009 freni et al 2009 mannina and viviani 2010 wang et al 2011 are listed in table 2 the bw approach uses 4 parameters c1 c 2 c3 and c4 and the wo approach uses only eq 5 in the modelling of washoff and has three calibration parameters c3 c4 and bini 2 3 monte carlo analysis to ensure that the range of parameters adequately covers the entire search space the monte carlo simulations were initially run with ranges table 2 that were about 5 wider than the lower and upper limits suggested in the literature thorndahl et al 2008 avellaneda et al 2009 freni et al 2009 mannina and viviani 2010 wang et al 2011 following this initial run the results were inspected if the best parameter sets behvioural sets were found to be at the boundaries of the predefined range the boundary was expanded and the monte carlo simulations repeated on the other hand if the best parameter sets were concentrated around a range that was smaller than the initially assumed upper and lower bounds the search space was narrowed this process was repeated until the maximum parameters sets showed reasonable fits within the bounds set an initial analysis was also conducted comparing results between 10 000 and 20 000 parameter sets this initial analysis was conducted on one randomly chosen event for each catchment monte carlo technique was used to generate either 10 000 or 20 000 random realizations and the model output was evaluated against the measured values using the sumns likelihood measure to check if the results were robust with respect to the number of model realizations the kolmogorov smirnov test was used the results show the cdfs of simulated w wsim from the given ranges of c1 c 2 c3 and c4 results from 10 000 parameter sets are not significantly different p 0 05 from that derived from 20 000 parameter sets thus 10 000 behavior parameter sets were considered sufficient to define the posterior distribution of the 4 parameters we did not test fewer that 10 000 parameter sets 2 4 statistical analyses where appropriate the shapiro wilk and lilliefors ghasemi and zahediasl 2012 tests for normality were used to understand the distribution of a dataset these tests assess the central tendency to enable the choice between parametric or non parametric statistical tests to be made either the mann whitney or independent t tests nachar 2008 were applied on paired data based on the distribution of data to analyze for differences in means all statistical tests were carried out using the statistical package for the social sciences or spss ibm 2020 statistical software package 3 study areas and data used time series datasets were collected from studies conducted around the world and reported in the literature the datasets were divided into two groups tropical and temperate catchments based on the köppen climate classification which utilizes temperature and precipitation data separating the world into specific climate zones data from a further three sites in geelong australia collected as part of this study were also analysed a summary of the study sites is provided in table 1 the 11 catchments comprise five in the tropical zone and six in the temperate zone a total of 131 storm events approximately 5000 samples analyzed were monitored at these sites out of which 59 events are from catchments in the tropics and 72 from catchments with a temperate climate le et al 2017 monitored a total of 46 rainfall events collecting about 550 samples from four residential catchments in singapore ccka cckn cckc and verde rainfall was measured on site using rimco 8020 tipping bucket rain gauges and an isco 2150 flow area velocity sensor was used to measure runoff at 1 min intervals runoff samples were collected using an automated sampler mattraw and sherwood 1977 conducted their studies at a residential site in pompano beach pampano b broward county florida a 0 01 in 1 in 25 4 mm tipping bucket rain gauge was used to measure rainfall and stage measurements upstream of a u shaped venturi flume were used to monitor discharge the results for 13 out of the 33 events that were monitored were used for this study ebbert et al 1985 measured discharge in two residential catchments surrey down surrey d and lake hills lake h in bellevue washington usa by converting stage observations in a v notch weir rainfall data were collected at 5 minute intervals using 0 01 in resolution tipping bucket rain gauges a total of 700 samples were analysed comprising 38 and 39 events monitored across surrey d and lake h respectively out of which 11 events for surrey d and 19 events for lake h were chosen to be analysed for this study morgan et al 2020 carried out investigations in kimmage kim dublin ireland runoff from 18 rain events was monitored with discharge measured with an isco 2150 area velocity sensor and rainfall with a tipping bucket rain gauge a total of 162 samples were analysed lastly flow and water quality data were collected from three residential catchments in geelong australia bellarine bel rita court rc and warralily war as part of this study the data set was collected between july 2017 and september 2021 and included rainfall water level velocity and stormwater samples for a total of 24 rain events rainfall was measured every 1 min with an isco rain gauge and recorded in 0 1 mm increments and velocity and water depth was measured with an isco 2150 area velocity sensor runoff samples were collected using an isco avalanche portable refrigerated sampler equipped with 14 950 ml bottles more information regarding the data used can be obtained from the references listed in table 1 fig 1 shows the rainfall characteristics of all the events that were selected to be used in the current study the box plots show the median 25 and 75 quartiles and the length of whiskers represent 1 5 times the inter quartile range of the dataset data points that lie beyond 1 5 times the inter quantile range are considered outliers and these are denoted by the symbols the rainfall characteristics are significantly higher in the tropical catchments compared to temperate catchments and the peak discharge is also higher in the tropics the data was used to calibrate the bw and wo models and parameter sets where ns tr were considered to be acceptable ten thousand monte carlo simulations were run adopting the ranges listed in table 2 as initial values uniform distributions were assumed during parameter sampling to represent the prior distribution of c1 c 2 c3 and c4 consistent with beven 2009 and freni and mannina 2010a freni and mannina 2010b 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration results the 90 prediction uncertainty band for tss using the bw approach is shown in fig 2 for events with the median ns plotted for each site plots for other stormwater quality parameters using the bw approach are shown in fig s1 supplementary material fig 3 shows the corresponding 90 prediction uncertainty band using the wo approach and the results for all water quality parameters using the wo approach are shown in fig s2 supplementary material surrey d and lake h do not have continuous time series rainfall data as only average rainfall intensity i av and duration t d for the individual events are reported fig 2 a and b and 3 a and b the data for florida are also not included in fig 2 as the adp was not reported for the florida dataset the temp and trop in fig 2 and 3 represents temperate and tropical climate respectively furthermore red and black lines shows 5 and 95 uncertainty estimation respectively and symbol o represents observed water quality parameters an observation of the median ns storm events in fig 2 and 3 show that the peak tss washoff loading rate is about an order of magnitude higher for sites in the tropics fig 2 g and 3 g and onwards washoff loading for tp tn op and nh4 n from tropical sites is also about 10 times higher than temperate sites fig 1s and 2s supplementary material given that the land use is similar this higher loading in the tropics is attributed to the higher rainfalls and discharge in addition to higher volumes higher rainfall intensity in the tropics result in higher rainfall impact energy which is better able to detach material from catchment surfaces increasing washoff load shaw et al 2010 the rainfall characteristics of the tropical and temperate sites were assessed independently to test if the rainfall data are from the same distribution the kruskal wallis test was chosen since shapiro wilk tests for normality revealed that the rainfall variables do not follow the normal distribution p 05 the test results indicate that d p 052 and 0 050 for tropical and temperate datasets respectively imax p 172 and 0 309 for tropical and temperate datasets respectively and iav p 072 and 0 393 for tropical and temperate datasets respectively were not significantly different mann whitney tests on rainfall data that were grouped by combining sites according to climate classification confirmed that d imax iav between the temperate and tropical datasets were statistically different p 05 the kruskal wallis test carried out on qp for sites with the same climatic classification differed significantly p 05 although rainfall for catchments with the same climate is expected to have similar characteristics flow may differ because runoff is influenced by the physical characteristics of the catchment subsequent mann whitney test conducted between the grouped tropical and temperate datasets shows that they are significantly different p 05 the threshold criterion of tr 0 7 was not achievable for the water quality parameters in dissolved op nh4 n form as there were insufficient behavioural realizations to obtain the 90 uncertainty band for parameters in the dissolved phase therefore the acceptability threshold was reduced to tr 0 5 with tr 0 7 retained for all other water quality parameters by applying these values of tr it was found that the criterion of η 70 was fulfilled mostly by tss 76 out of 131 events followed by tp and tn 57 out of 113 and 36 out of 113 events respectively and op and nh4 n 26 out of 113and 35 out of 105 events respectively the relaxation of the tr criterion for dissolved phase parameters suggests that the structure of both models is more suitable for parameters in particulate tss and mixed tn tp forms and least suitable for the dissolved phase op nh4 n there are many studies chaudhary et al 2021 gaut et al 2019 where results of the wash off model is more satisfactory for particulate pollutants moreover the model will not be able to capture the complex processes associated with the attenuation of these parameters in their entirety especially for dissolved pollutants as the concept of incipient motion mobilised by motion applies less to pollutants in dissolved forms such as op lastly it is observed in fig 1 and 2 that aril for the median ns storm event is larger for the tropical than the temperate catchments overall temperate catchment aril values for tss range between 0 7 and 6 1 with an average of 2 2 and standard deviation of 1 4 for the bw approach aril ranges between 0 5 and 5 5 with an average of 1 9 and standard deviation of 1 1 for the wo approach compared to the temperate catchments the aril for tropical sites vary from 2 1 to 341 with a higher average value of 42 1 and standard deviation of 69 2 for the bw model and average of 31 8 53 1 standard deviation for the wo model the aril values are also larger for other water quality parameters for the tropical study sites figs s1 and s2 supplementary material it is thus generally observed that in addition to load aril for both modelling approaches is also higher for tropical than temperate sites for all the water quality parameters investigated 4 2 comparison of uncertainty between modelling approaches the modelling uncertainty for tss between the two modelling approaches is compared in fig 4 which shows the distribution of aril for all events meeting the η 70 criterion aril for pampano b using the bw approach was not calculated since adp data for pampano b are not available the war catchment study did not include nh4 n results for the other water quality parameters are shown in fig s3 supplementary material also distribution of behavioural sets for all the water quality parameter were shown in fig s5 supplementary material this comparison shows that there is generally little difference in aril between the bw and the wo approaches in modelling tss when compared on an individual catchment basis similar observations are made for the other water quality parameters fig 3s supplementary material the aril values obtained from both modelling approaches for sites with the same climatic classification were pooled for further statistical analysis pooling of the data is justified since the rainfalls for sites with the same climatic classification were not statistically different kruskal wallis test comparison of the aril value between two modelling approaches were made using either the independent t test or mann whitney test depending on the distribution shapiro wilk test of the aril the tss aril values between the two modelling approaches are not statistically different with p 377 and 0 781 for tropical and temperate catchments respectively similar results were obtained for tp p 180 tn p 327 op p 261 nh4 n p 517 for the tropical catchments and p 586 0 697 0 894 and 0 992 for tp tn op and nh4 n respectively for temperate catchments this result shows that although the bw approach incorporates two models and has an additional calibration parameter the uncertainty in results is not significantly different to the wo approach this may imply that buildup does not have a significant influence on modelling uncertainty however most water quality data are collected during periods when rainfall is frequent irrespective of climate zone and as a result the adp during the sampling period may be limited this is an artifact of sampling although on average the adp in temperate regions is longer than the tropics however the actual adp the during the monitoring period is shorter a comparison of adp between the pooled datasets shows that the adp values between the temperate and tropical datasets are not significantly different mann whitney test p 07 previous research has shown that for events with adp less than 3 days the influence of adp is not obvious zhang et al 2015 this is the case for the data reported in the literature where the average adp 1 standard deviation for the pooled temperate site data is 3 4 3 7 days which is close to the average adp of 2 7 3 5 days for the tropical sites also comparison of behavioural sets between two modelling approaches for sites within the same climatic classification show that they are usually in the range from 100 to 1000 for both climatic classifications this reveal that climatic condition does not play an important factor for size of parameter ensemble 4 3 modelling uncertainty between catchments in temperate and tropical zones although aril is similar between the bw and wo modelling approaches previous section the main difference in aril however is between temperate versus the tropical catchments comparisons of modelling uncertainty between the temperate and tropical zones are focused only for the wo model since both modelling approaches yielded similar results the distribution of aril and η for all water quality variables are shown in fig 5 similar plots for the bw model are shown in fig s4 supplementary material for temperate catchments aril is less scattered compared to tropical catchments although the aril for the dissolved parameters op and nh4 n appear to be of the same order as the particulate and mixed phase parameters given that the tr criterion for op and nh4 n was relaxed from 0 7 to 0 5 this gives an indication that uncertainty increases as the model progress from making predictions from the particulate to the dissolved phase this observation is to be expected since washoff models are primarily intended to model the particulate phase the trend for the tropical dataset however is not as clear studies chaudhary et al 2021 chow et al 2012 egodawatta et al 2007 freni et al 2009 aronica et al 2005 manz et al 2013 have shown that the wo model parameters are dependent on rainfall characteristics and washoff parameters for tropical sites exhibit a less distinct trend with rainfall compared to temperate catchments fig 5 also shows that when comparing aril between climate zones the uncertainty is higher for the tropical dataset for any given water quality parameter the aril values from catchments in the two climate zones were pooled into temperate and tropical datasets for each water quality parameter the pooled temperate and tropical aril values did not follow the normal distribution shapiro wilk test p 0 05 for any of the water quality parameters subsequent mann whitney test revealed that aril between the temperate and tropical datasets were significantly different p 01 for all water quality parameters although pampano beach florida is categorized as tropical it belongs to a different sub category am with distinctly different rainfall patters to singapore af an inspection of the rain data shows that the rainfall characteristics are closer to the temperate catchments and thus is significant that it exhibits aril values that are more consistent with temperate catchments it has been shown that modelling uncertainty for tropics is larger than the temperate zone for all the water quality parameters studied if the same models are to be used for different climate zones it should be expected that applications in the tropics will yield results that are less accurate than in the temperate regions future efforts should be put into the development of models specific to tropical climate that account for the high rainfall intensities in addition to flow this is consistent with approaches taken by vaze and chiew 2003 and mccarthy et al 2012 who highlight the role of rainfall kinetic energy in the mobilisation and transport process 4 4 dependence of uncertainty on rainfall characteristics further insights into the dependence of uncertainties to different rainfall conditions were obtained from correlation analysis done on the pooled tropical and temperate datasets this will elucidate the dependence of aril of both buildup washoff model bw and washoff model wo on climatic classification as any difference in behaviour found may provide clarity on the physical significance of the model uncertainty prior to correlation analysis the lilliefors test ghasemi and zahediasl 2012 was first conducted on the pooled datasets to understand how the aril rainfall variables are distributed testing against the normal lognormal and exponential distributions the test results indicated that for the temperate and tropical dataset aril bw aril wo d imax iav and adp are log normally distributed for all water quality parameters the pearson correlation analysis was therefore used to investigate correlations between the aril for both model with rainfall variables the result of this analysis includes the pearson correlation coefficient r and p values in general the number of significant α 0 05 0 01 correlations between the rainfall variables with model parameters which are observed for both tropical and temperate datasets is higher for tss and reduces to at most two significant correlations for mixed tp and dissolved op forms this is expected since the washoff model is better suited for particulates gaut et al 2019 as understood by a particulate transport process governed by critical stress criteria comparing between temperate and tropical dataset for tss the temperate dataset has a larger number of significant correlations between the aril bw and aril wo with rainfall variable respectively uncertainty is strongly correlated with maximum 5 min intensity r 0 405 p 006 for aril bw and r 0 314 p 004 for aril wo respectively however no significant correlation was found for tropical dataset similar process was performed for tp where significant correlation was found between aril bw with d r 0 469 p 018 iav r 0 486 p 014 and aril wo with d r 0 579 p 004 iav r 0 538 p 008 imax r 0 439 p 0036 for temperate dataset however for tropical dataset only adp was significant correlation was found with aril bw r 0 370 p 048 in addition for tn in temperate dataset aril bw and aril wo are strongly correlated with imax r 0 428 p 029 and r 0 388 p 004 respectively and for tropical no significant correlation was found however for both op and nh4 n positive correlation was found between aril bw wo with adp for tropical dataset but no correlation was found for temperate dataset for both models the analysis shows that uncertainty in temperate climate is linked rainfall intensity whereas there is some evidence indicating that adp may play important role in uncertainty in tropical climate but the result is not conclusive 5 conclusions this study evaluated the uncertainty associated with urban water quality modelling for various residential sites located in temperate and tropical zones the washoff model approach is well used by practitioners and is conceptually simple to understand our approach has been to better explain a model that is already broadly accepted although widely used there are questions regarding the uncertainty about the washoff modelling approach by moving away from a black box approach and presenting a knowledge of uncertainty reliance to physical factors this research aimed to resolve some of these uncertainties to our knowledge this is the first study examining such dynamics across climatic zones and more research of this kind is required to understand the washoff model s applicability better the following are conclusions from this study i aril is higher for tropical than temperate catchments for all water quality parameters studied this result is true for both modelling approaches adopted and can therefore be considered independent of modelling approaches ii the threshold criterion of tr was reduced to 0 5 for parameters in dissolved op nh4 n form as there were insufficient behavioural realizations to obtain 90 uncertainty band based on this relaxation for op and nh4 n it is found that the structure of both model approaches is more suitable for particulate tss followed by parameters in mixed form iii comparison of uncertainties between the two modelling approach shows that both modelling approaches have similar level of uncertainty irrespective of climatic zones although the bw approach incorporates two models and has an additional calibration parameter the uncertainty in results is not significantly higher that the wo approach however this might be an artefact of the short adp especially for temperate sites of the data used iv the higher uncertainty of modelling results for tropical and temperate catchments highlights the need for model improvements taking into account higher rainfall intensities characteristic of these catchments credit authorship contribution statement shagun chaudhary conceptualization data curation
