17765,harmful cyanobacterial blooms consisting of toxic taxa can produce a wide variety of toxins to threaten water quality ecosystem functions and services of greater concern was the changing patterns of cyanobacterial assemblage were not well understood due to the lack of long term monitoring data over the temporal scale biodiversity change in cyanobacterial community and paleoenvironmental variables over the past 170 years in lake chenghai were investigated based on sedimentary ancient dna metabarcoding and traditional paleolimnological analysis the results showed species richness and homogenization of cyanobacterial assemblage increased in the most recent decades which were synchronized with the growth of artificial fertilization and decline in precipitation cyanobacterial co occurrence network analysis revealed more complex interactions and weak community stability after the change point of 1987 while the rare cyanobacterial genera such as anabaena planktothrix oscillatoria and microcystis were identified to be keystone taxa affecting cyanobacterial assemblage furthermore an increase of toxin producing cyanobacterial taxa was significantly and positively associated with tn and tp as well as tn ip and tn tp which was verified by quantitative real time pcr of mcya and rpoc1 genes threshold in total nitrogen tn concentration should be targeted no more than 0 60 mg l to alleviate nuisance cyanobacterial blooms in lake chenghai these findings reinforce the comprehensive understanding for the long term dynamics of cyanobacterial assemblage responding to environmental change which could contribute to proactively regulate environmental conditions for avoiding undesirable ecological consequences graphical abstract image 1 keywords sedimentary ancient dna metabarcoding cyanobacterial community change point ecological threshold 1 introduction eutrophication has induced the deterioration of ecosystems and biodiversity loss in the current context of increasing anthropogenic activities on natural ecosystems vitousek et al 1997 scherer and pfister 2016 monchamp et al 2018 this is of globally particular concern in the plateau lake ecosystems where combined eutrophication and climate warming has favored an increase in the frequency and intensity of harmful cyanobacterial blooms over the past few decades monchamp et al 2016 2018 tse et al 2018 escalas et al 2019 it is known that cyanobacterial blooms are often dominated by toxic taxa as they can produce a wide variety of toxins to potentially degrade water quality ecosystem functions and services o neil et al 2012 rigosi et al 2014 cao et al 2017 monchamp et al 2018 during the process of degradation once a tipping point of environmental pressures such as nutrient concentration is exceeded an algae dominated state shifted from macrophyte dominated state will inevitably maintain over a long period which is almost irreversible may 1977 scheffer 2004 scheffer and jeppesen 2007 cao et al 2016 therefore a comprehensive understanding for long term decadal to centennial ecological dynamics of lake ecosystems is necessary for conservation and management smol 2010 tse et al 2018 however one of the greatest challenges faced by managers and stakeholders in lake ecosystems that the lack of long term and high resolution information limited our understanding of ecological dynamics monchamp et al 2016 traditional paleolimnological analysis with multiple paleo proxies such as pollen pigment and other physicochemical elements smol and cumming 2000 battarbee et al 2001 heinzelmann et al 2015 pal et al 2015 balint et al 2018 wan et al 2019 wang et al 2019 from lake sediment archives has been reconstructed for the historical trends of aquatic organisms and explored the effects of human activities and climate change to lake ecosystems monchamp et al 2016 although cyanobacteria in lake ecosystems have been extensively studied in recent history classic paleoecological indicators are not possible to unveil the community composition and structure domaizon et al 2017 the long term patterns of species richness and diversity of phylum cyanobacteria in natural assemblages still remain unclear sedimentary ancient dna sedadna extracted from lake sediment core provides a temporally integrated way to shed light on the historic dynamics of harmful cyanobacterial communities tse et al 2018 li et al 2019 yan et al 2019 anoxic hypoxic and cold conditions on the lake bottom have been suggested to be highly suitable for dna preservation against degradation coolen and gibson 2009 kirkpatrick et al 2016 monchamp et al 2016 especially in a high alpine environment parducci et al 2017 therefore with the rapid development of high throughput next generation sequencing techniques environmental dna edna metabarcoding is uniquely positioned to identify diverse taxonomic groups chariton et al 2010 laramie et al 2015 reid et al 2019 however so far as we know combining sedadna metabarcoding and other multiple paleoenvironmental proxies to track the regime shift and variability of biodiversity with relevance for the definition of conservation goals in plateau lakes is still poorly understood the objectives of present study were to i reconstruct the temporal trends of cyanobacterial community and other paleoenvironmental variables ii detect the change point of potential cyanobacterial blooms iii assess the responses from individuals to cyanobacterial communities and the presence of threshold levels associated with historical environmental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sediment core sampling lake chenghai 26 27 n 26 38 n 100 38 e 100 42 e is located in the conjunction of the qinghai tibet plateau and the yunnan guizhou plateau in china which has a surface area of 74 6 km2 an average depth of 26 5 m and a water volume of 1 92 billion m3 with the water level of 1501m there are no perennial surface inlet or outlet streams so the lake is fed by precipitation surface runoff from the 318 km2 catchment and groundwater inflow wu et al 2004 in 1942 ad a large number of people immigrated and settled in the lake chenghai basin since the mid 1980s the lake watershed has experienced greater usage by humans and increased application of agricultural fertilizer to enhance farm production wu et al 2004 duplicate sediment cores were collected from the center of lake chenghai fig 1 in august 2018 using a gravity corer uwitec austria with an internal diameter of 86 mm equipped with a 60 cm pvc tube in length the sediment cores were sectioned into 8 mm intervals using a core cutter and then one was freeze dried and transferred to a centrifuge tube for further chronology and paleophysico chemical analysis another one was stored at 80 c until ancient dna extraction 2 2 sediment core chronology and paleophysico chemical variables sediment core was dated using excess 210pb and fallout

barcode ambiguous nucleotides or reads with a low q 20 average quality score or homopolymers of more than 8 bp were discarded the generated high quality sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at 97 sequence similarity using the uparse workflow edgar 2013 the representative sequences were selected from each otu and aligned against the greengenes v13 5 database using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier v 2 11 non cyanobacterial otus chloroplast and mitochondria otus were removed from the dataset and were not considered for further analysis on cyanobacterial assemblage 2 5 quantitative real time pcr for sedimentary mcya and rpoc1 genes sedimentary mcya and rpoc1 genes were used to detect the presence of microcystin and cylindrospermopsin producing cyanobacterial taxa cylindrospermopsin has been considered to be the most widely occurring hepatotoxin produced by cyanobacteria after microsystin falconer 2005 moreira et al 2011 the primers mcya cd

consisted of initial denaturation at 95 c for 5 min 40 cycles of 95 c for 30 s 60 c for 30 s and extension at 72 c for 40 s melting curves were obtained to confirm the specificity of the amplifications based on the standard curves and the mean threshold cycle ct values the absolute abundance of mcya and rpoc1 genes was expressed as copies per gram of wet sediments 3 numerical analysis 3 1 alpha and beta biodiversity in order to display the historic trends of cyanobacterial community composition in sediment core alpha diversity based on otu level was calculated with the observed species richness sobs chao1 richness index ace richness index shannon wiener diversity index and simpson diversity index in mothur v1 31 2 schloss et al 2009 jaccard similarity was calculated using taxonomic based jaccard distance faith et al 1987 to quantify the homogenization of cyanobacterial assemblage biotic homogenization generally refers to the gradual replacement of local biotas by widespread non natives mckinney and lockwood 1999 olden et al 2004 variation in beta diversity was visualized using principal coordinate analysis pcoa on the basis of bray curtis distances in r package vegan permutational multivariate analysis of variance test permanova n 999 was subsequently examined the statistical significance of differences among the following defined sampling groups anderson 2001 while mann whitney u test with false discovery rate fdr correction was used to unveil the individual cyanobacteria genera with significant differences in abundance 3 2 change point analysis the presence and timing of change points in cyanobacterial dynamics over the temporal dimension could be indicative of a regime shift which was carried out using the change point analyzer taylor 2000 a combination of cumulative sum charts cusum and bootstrapping technique 1000 repetitions was used to verify statistically significance of the identified change points at the level of 5 on the strength of segmented package a segmented method was also performed to estimate thresholds levels of nutrient concentration inducing the abrupt change of beta diversity in cyanobacterial community muggeo 2008 2015 the davies test was conducted to test whether there was a significant difference in slope davies 1977 cao et al 2017 3 3 co occurrence network to better understand community structure before and after the change point characterize intra community interactions the co occurrence network analysis was conducted on the gephi v 0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 the co occurrence network was inferred based on the pairwise spearman correlation matrix which was calculated using the psych r package revelle 2017 the correlation coefficient r 0 6 with statistically significant at p 0 05 widder et al 2014 was available in the co occurrence network network visualization and module detection of co occurrence patterns were presented using fruchterman reingold placement algorithm bastian et al 2009 average node degree average path length and clustering coefficient were calculated to characterize the topology of resulting networks potential keystone genera were identified from each co occurrence network which was disclosed by the high centrality and node degree newman 2003 2006 barberán et al 2012 redundancy analysis rda was applied to identify the driving paleoenvironmental variables with statistical significance that affect cyanobacteria community structure using vegan package v 2 5 6 in r 3 5 3 r development core team 2019 correlations between key variables related to trophic status abundance of mcya and rpoc1 genes and bloom forming or toxin producing cyanobacteria genera were explored using the linear ordinary least squares ols regression in statistica 10 software 4 results and discussion 4 1 chronology age dating based on the crs model in unsupported 210pb activities for lake chenghai indicated significant dry mass accumulation with an average rate of 0 260 0 051 g cm2y and it ranged from 1850 to 2017 in the upper sediment depth of 42 8 cm the crs model estimated the 1963 7 ad 8 6 thermonuclear weapons testing peak at the mass depth of 17 09 9 g cm2 depth 28 4 cm showing relative agreement with the distinct peak of 137cs observed at a depth of 25 2 cm the results demonstrated a reliable age model with a characteristic exponential decline r2 0 90 suppl fig s1 4 2 temporal trends of paleophysico chemical characteristics the toc content of lake chenghai ranged from 7 89 mg g to 36 50 mg g which was relatively constant prior to the late 1980s and then rapidly increased until the present compared to the toc profiles the tn content showed similar variations ranging from 0 20 mg g to 3 33 mg g but enriched earlier in the 1970s values of tp and ip gradually varied from 0 39 0 16 mg g to 0 87 0 55 mg g with an average of 0 66 and 0 41 mg g and rapidly increased over the top 14 cm while op content was fluctuations in the past moreover there was a steady increase in tn tp tn ip and tn op in parallel with tn and toc trends fig 2 on the whole the increasing trends of toc tn and tp contents in the sediment core demonstrated the high trophic condition and productivity of lake chenghai in the recent 40 years which was consistent with zan et al 2012 increasing n p ratios were dominated by unceasing anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus emeis et al 2000 δ13c δ15n and c n as available indicators have been extensively used to assess the origins of sedimentary organic matter in aquatic environment meyers and lallier vergès 1999 routh et al 2004 the sediment core also showed a reduction in δ13c values from the bottom to 1990s fig 2 therefore diagenesis was possible to have a significant effect on the c isotopes spiker and hatcher 1984 herczeg et al 2001 while a distinct increase ranging from 27 20 to 25 78 in the upper part of the sediment core was indicative of increased amounts of terrestrial matter herczeg et al 2001 cloern et al 2002 ruiz fernández et al 2002 the variation of δ15n content in lake chenghai followed a similar trend in δ13c specifically δ15n content varied from 5 09 to 6 28 averaging 5 82 after the 1990s which means that δ15n content was contributed by synthetic fertilizers herczeg et al 2001 ruiz fernández et al 2002 the decline of δ15n content also indicated that n2 fixing cyanobacteria accounted for the trend in recent years in addition the temporal trend of c n ratio forecasted that the sharp decrease of c n ratio was associated with increased accumulation of aquatic organic matters in the lake sediment suggesting increased primary productivity in the lake wan et al 2019 it seems that sedimentary organic matter derived from phytoplanktonic sources largely because c n ratio was slightly above 10 over the last 50 years ruiz fernández et al 2002 generally heavy precipitation enhanced soil erosion and increased the transport capacity of rivers and streams over the lake basin thus smaller particle size should indicate lower precipitation peng et al 2005 nahm et al 2010 based on the inference the decreasing trend of average particle size and median particle size the increasing trend of clay content reflected relatively low precipitation rates over the lake chenghai basin after the 1970s which was in concordance with meteorological observation yan et al 2019 temporal differences of cyanobacterial communities mcya and rpoc1 genes abundance a total of 1206506 high quality sequences were obtained from the sediment core and then were assigned to 100 011 otus spanning the phylum cyanobacteria in lake chenghai the rarefaction curves based on observed otus and shannon wiener index illustrated that the produced sequences were well captured to represent the majority of biodiversity suppl fig s2 14 sequences from the negative control were assigned to genus enterococcus which was not included in cyanobacteria and then was removed identification of the 100 011 otus belonged to 20 species in 18 genera of cyanobacteria between 1886 and 2017 unclassified cyanobacterial 16s rrna genes were dominant with the average relative abundance of 34 9 followed by synechococcus 25 5 and anabaenopsis 17 9 over the sediment core the genus prochlorococcus 10 1 accounted for 0 52 2 of the relative abundance where sphaerospermopsis 7 6 cylindrospermopsis 1 7 and microcystis 1 0 were less than 10 fig 3 a range of toxin producing cyanobacteria genera including anabaena anabaenopsis planktothrix and dolichospermum was also identified by sediment ancient dna metabarcoding in lake chenghai specifically more anabaenopsis was recovered from the sediment core compared with the previous study yan et al 2019 although the average relative abundance of aphanizomenon was 0 2 share of the total abundance from 1886 to 2017 most of the toxin producing cyanobacteria genera like the one with high relative abundance occurred in the last two decades this trend was confirmed by qpcr amplification of mcya and rpoc1 genes the highest abundance of mcya genes was observed in 1999 while the abundance of rpoc1 genes was peaked in 2016 followed by 2008 especially showing the coincidence with the relative abundance of cylindrospermopsis figs 2 and 3 the sum of mcya and rpoc1 genes abundance presented a trend similar to the number of cyanobacterial otus fig 2 suggesting the occurrence of microcystin and cylindrospermopsin in recent two decades may be mostly correlated with the increasing of anabaenopsis cylindrospermopsis and anabaena fig 3 to date several studies exist which had reconstructed the occurrence of toxin producing cyanobacterial taxa using qpcr in dated sediment cores with a century timescale ye et al 2011 pal et al 2015 monchamp et al 2016 pilon et al 2019 interestingly tse et al 2018 demonstrated that abundance of mcya genes supported the occurrence of dolichospermum in lake diefenbaker while the dominance of microcystis aeruginosa in lake greifensee and planktothrix rubescens in lake zurich was also verified by mcya genes monchamp et al 2016 however cylindrospermopsis cannot be detected if only mcya primers were used in the lake chenghai similarly legrand et al 2017 found that anatoxin a genes appeared only in the more modern sediments while mcya genes were presented in a eutrophic lake over the last 220 years pilon et al 2019 indicated that an inadequate matching of the primer of mcyd genes reflected a much smaller rise of gene copies in baqtiste lake therefore one pair of specific primers should be effectively designed or several pairs of primers should be chosen to highlight potential toxin producers through considering empirical data in recent years alpha diversity consisting of the sobs chao1 ace shannon wiener diversity index appeared to exhibit an increasing trend and simpson diversity index showed the opposite pattern fig 2 suggesting the relative higher diversity in the top than the bottom of sediment core however there was an increasing change in jaccard similarity reflecting a general homogenization in cyanobacterial community structure which was considered to be a loss of beta diversity monchamp et al 2018 evidence in the literature dornelas et al 2014 magurran et al 2015 mcgill et al 2015 monchamp et al 2018 2019 has supported that human activities can lead to the homogenization of species composition in fact the understanding of the complicated cyanobacterial biodiversity patterns over the temporal scale still remains scarce in freshwater ecosystems based on the sedadna the significant changes p 0 05 both in the otu richness of cyanobacteria and the corresponding cumulative sum during the period of 1886 2017 were obtained as different shades of the output suppl fig s3 the point where a sudden shift or change was detected in 1987 with a 100 level of confidence interval 1983 and 1994 the performance of change point analysis revealed that otu richness of cyanobacteria remained relatively constant from 1886 to 1987 named state i after which otu richness fluctuated and gradually increased throughout the period of 1987 2017 named state ii fig 2 at the genus level individual cyanobacteria genera in state ii exhibited a distinct increase in abundance of anabaenopsis fdr corrected p 0 001 prochlorococcus fdr corrected p 0 001 sphaerospermopsis fdr corrected p 0 001 cylindrospermopsis fdr corrected p 0 001 aphanizomenon fdr corrected p 0 001 anabaena fdr corrected p 0 001 planktothrix fdr corrected p 0 001 oscillatoria fdr corrected p 0 01 dolichospermum fdr corrected p 0 05 and a significant decrease in abundance of unclassified cyanobacteria fdr corrected p 0 001 compared to state i fig 4 of further concern pcoa based on 16s rrna sequences using the bray curtis distance metrics demonstrated the strong differences between state i and state ii fig 5 the permanova test determined that cyanobacterial communities diverged significantly before and after 1987 of the change point r2 0 43 p 0 001 complex interactions depicted by co occurrence networks further demonstrated that cyanobacterial relationships differentiated significantly before and after 1987 of the change point fig 6 the resulting co occurrence network in state i consisted of 13 nodes and 7 edges while there were 17 nodes and 15 edges in state ii in terms of average node degree state ii exhibited higher value 1 765 compared to state i 1 077 which was considered to be small world network humphries and gurney 2008 escalas et al 2019 the average path length 3 321 in state ii was higher than 1 300 of average path length in state i indicating more interactions across taxa in recent decades faust et al 2012 besides 85 and 71 88 of positive linkages were assigned to state i and state ii respectively although otus from the unclassified cyanobacteria were dominant in state i cylindrospermopsis prochlorococcus and dolichospermum comprising one module was most likely to be keystone taxa specifically those with high centrality and node degree fig 6 strong linkages within two dominant modules were presented with anabaena cylindrospermopsis and aphanizomenon constituting one module planktothrix microcystis anabaenopsis oscillatoria sphaerospermopsis aphanocapsa synechococcus dolichospermum prochlorococcus and unclassified consisting of another module in state ii fig 6 obviously the shift of the keystone taxa had been demonstrated to cause a dramatic shift in cyanobacterial structure and functioning over the temporal scale banerjee et al 2018 most of the keystone taxa with less than 1 of relative abundance have been recognized as rare genera and played a vital role in community assembly campbell et al 2011 liao et al 2017 in addition more negative linkages 28 12 occurred in state ii indicating an increasing mutual exclusion between cyanobacterial taxa escalas et al 2019 and maybe resulted in weak community stability lawes et al 2017 under the elevated environmental disturbance fig 2 after 1987 this point was further verified by lower clustering coefficient 0 517 in state ii contrasting with 0 750 of clustering coefficient in state i in this context although the change point has been identified and revealed the significant difference between state i and state ii we concluded that lake chenghai still in the unstable transition period from macrophyte dominated state to algae dominated state scheffer 2004 scheffer and jeppesen 2007 cao et al 2016 moreover several different proportions of negative correlations have been reported ranging from 5 to 50 in the co occurrence networks under cyanobacterial dominance at the spatial scale escalas et al 2019 however our results revealed previously unreported negative patterns in shaping cyanobacterial co occurrence network over the temporal scale therefore which can provide some insights for understanding the role of co occurrence networks responding to environmental conditions correlations of paleoenvironmental variables related to nutrients and bloom forming or toxin producing cyanobacterial genera 10 cyanobacteria genera have presented the significant difference of state i and state ii fig 4 most of which including anabaenopsis sphaerospermopsis cylindrospermopsis dolichospermum aphanizomenon anabaena planktothrix oscillatoria kurmayer et al 2002 saker et al 2007 o neil et al 2012 dittmann et al 2013 wood et al 2017 monchamp et al 2018 budzyńska et al 2019 have been described to produce a variety of cyanotoxins with hepatotoxins neurotoxins and cytotoxins cirés and ballot 2016 the increasing trends of mcya and rpoc1 genes in abundance were similar to the long term change of paleoenvironmental variables related to nutrients except for op fig 2 the ols model results demonstrated that the abundance of mcya genes was significantly correlated with the paleoenvironmental variables related to tn while the positive associations between the abundance of rpoc1 genes and six paleoenvironmental variables were totally significant and higher fig 7 pointing out that nutrient enrichment potential affected the production of cyanobacterial toxins the connections were also established by a few previous studies wilhelm et al 2011 ye et al 2011 tse et al 2018 rda showed that measured paleophysico chemical variables related to trophic status explained 31 78 of total variation in cyanobacteria community assemblage which uncovered that tp r2 0 55 p 0 001 and tn r2 0 49 p 0 001 were the most significant environmental drivers enabling the increasing occurrence of cyanobacterial community suppl fig s4 taken together therefore increases in tn and tp contents were linearly associated with the growth of cyanobacterial genera fig 8 suppl figs s5 and s6 the relative abundance of cyanobacterial genera followed this notably positive trends along the tn ip and tn tp gradient fig 8 suppl figs s7 and s8 although nonsignificant relationships e g anabaena anabaenopsis and oscillatoria suppl fig s6 dolichospermum suppl figs s7 and s8 planktothrix suppl figs s6 and s8 were also found the findings were also consistent with other emerging evidence to support a triggering role of nutrient enrichment in cyanobacterial blooms paerl 2008 conley et al 2009 o neil et al 2012 however to the best of our knowledge although prochlorococcus was not previously reported as a toxin producing cyanobacterial genus tn tp tn ip and tn tp strongly affected the dominance of prochlorococcus as well as sphaerospermopsis and cylindrospermopsis anabaenopsis with the highest relative abundance 17 9 was markedly dominated by tn tp and tn ip interestingly it was not significantly correlated with tn and tp suppl figs s5 and s6 whereas that of dolichospermum followed the opposite pattern fig 8 suppl figs s5 s8 in addition aphanizomenon anabaena planktothrix and oscillatoria were mostly detected in the sediments after the 1980s suggesting that these cyanobacterial genera were able to colonize a eutrophic lake where tn concentration obviously raised fig 2 for instance dolman et al 2012 reported the aphanizomenon gracile blooms in 102 german lakes with nitrogen enrichment while only one species of aphanizomenon gracile was observed in the sediment core overall these results presented the long term changes of cyanobacterial taxa and their different responses along the nutrient gradient that were unknown to date over the temporal scale and also provided increasing knowledge for the debate to explain which one was the main factor among tn tp and n p ratios driving the dynamics of cyanobacterial populations conley et al 2009 o neil et al 2012 cao et al 2016 cirés and ballot 2016 monchamp et al 2018 it is noteworthy that microcystis in the sediment core was rare and did not exhibit a significant increase over the temporal scale figs 3 and 4 although it was identified to be keystone taxa in the co occurrence networks fig 6 yet in this study anabaenopsis dominated in recent decades which was different from general understanding in other lake ecosystems that microcystis is the most prevalent cyanobacterial bloom forming genera o neil et al 2012 one possibility was that microcystis had an increasing competition with sphaerospermopsis fig 6 the other one maybe because the special natural background with alkalinity and ph was high in lake chenghai yan et al 2019 besides previous evidence demonstrated that the growth of microcystis was associated with higher concentrations of dissolved phosphorus otten et al 2012 tromas et al 2018 although an increasing trend of phosphorus was presented in sediment core fig 2 tp content in sediment and tp concentration in water were relatively lower fig 2 suppl fig s10 compared to microcystis dominated lake taihu xu et al 2014 unfortunately there was no historical data of dissolved phosphorus that further hindered our understanding for its relationship with microcystis ecological thresholds and implication to lake ecosystem management ecological thresholds for lake ecosystem management have been identified to develop nutrient criteria based on the nonlinear response of phytoplankton communities to water quality based on the relationship between pco 1 bray curtis distances and sediment tn tp suppl fig s9 the segmented method detected the change points for tn and tp contents affecting the cyanobacterial community structure at the threshold level of 1 81 0 33 mg g and 0 792 2 057 mg g respectively although the davies test gave the significance of two change points at p 0 001 and p 0 003 wide confidence intervals of tp threshold indicated considerable uncertainty in terms of the trophic classification scheme for lake waters proposed by the oecd 1982 this was probably because tp concentration with an average concentration of 0 027 mg l in water was still at a mesotrophic level during 1988 2017 suppl fig s10 where was insufficient to induce a nonlinear change of the cyanobacterial community structure even though tp content in sediment core has been gradually increasing over the past 170 years fig 2 in contrast to tp except for the distinct change point of tn there was a strongly exponential relationship between tn concentration in water and tn content in sediment r2 0 534 p 0 001 suppl figs s9 and s11 in this case we concluded that tn concentration in water should be no more than 0 60 mg l for supporting lake protection and remediation so far as we know this is the first investigation to achieve a quantitative threshold combining sedadna metabarcoding and paleoenvironmental proxies and empirical data at the temporal scale due to the lack of century data some numeric nutrient criteria have been established using monitoring data in phytoplankton community or chlorophyll a concentration over the spatial or short time scales us epa 2010 huo et al 2014 2015 cao et al 2016 but the nutrient criteria were either higher xu et al 2014 or more conservative huo et al 2014 than 0 60 mg l of tn this difference in nutrient criteria could be attributed to spatially environmental heterogeneity and seasonal variations in order to alleviate and control harmful cyanobacterial blooms we think that cyanobacteria are more specific and targeted than phytoplankton or chlorophyll a as the response variable to identify nutrient thresholds 5 conclusions we used sedimentary ancient dna metabarcoding and traditional paleolimnological analysis approaches to successfully reconstruct the long term dynamic trends of cyanobacterial assemblage and environmental conditions which provided empirical evidence on the cause of degraded lake ecosystem the increasing change in alpha diversity and homogenization in species composition the abrupt change of cyanobacterial communities at the temporal scale was identified and resulted in a distinct difference in species abundance and beta biodiversity cyanobacterial co occurrence network analysis indicated that more interactions among toxin producing cyanobacterial genera occurred after the change point the presence of cyanobacterial toxin producers over recent years was also confirmed by mcya and rpoc1 genes moreover significant and positive correlations emphasized the potential role of nutrient enrichment inducing the growth of bloom forming or toxin producing cyanobacterial genera however there is no efficient way to directly reconstruct the dissolved phosphorus content in the sediment core based on traditional paleolimnological techniques which is a barrier for further deciphering the relationships between long term cyanobacterial dynamics and environmental conditions finally in consideration of scientific and technical feasibility coupling high throughput sequencing of sedadna and empirical data would offer new thinking for establishing nutrient criteria declaration of competing interest the

17765,harmful cyanobacterial blooms consisting of toxic taxa can produce a wide variety of toxins to threaten water quality ecosystem functions and services of greater concern was the changing patterns of cyanobacterial assemblage were not well understood due to the lack of long term monitoring data over the temporal scale biodiversity change in cyanobacterial community and paleoenvironmental variables over the past 170 years in lake chenghai were investigated based on sedimentary ancient dna metabarcoding and traditional paleolimnological analysis the results showed species richness and homogenization of cyanobacterial assemblage increased in the most recent decades which were synchronized with the growth of artificial fertilization and decline in precipitation cyanobacterial co occurrence network analysis revealed more complex interactions and weak community stability after the change point of 1987 while the rare cyanobacterial genera such as anabaena planktothrix oscillatoria and microcystis were identified to be keystone taxa affecting cyanobacterial assemblage furthermore an increase of toxin producing cyanobacterial taxa was significantly and positively associated with tn and tp as well as tn ip and tn tp which was verified by quantitative real time pcr of mcya and rpoc1 genes threshold in total nitrogen tn concentration should be targeted no more than 0 60 mg l to alleviate nuisance cyanobacterial blooms in lake chenghai these findings reinforce the comprehensive understanding for the long term dynamics of cyanobacterial assemblage responding to environmental change which could contribute to proactively regulate environmental conditions for avoiding undesirable ecological consequences graphical abstract image 1 keywords sedimentary ancient dna metabarcoding cyanobacterial community change point ecological threshold 1 introduction eutrophication has induced the deterioration of ecosystems and biodiversity loss in the current context of increasing anthropogenic activities on natural ecosystems vitousek et al 1997 scherer and pfister 2016 monchamp et al 2018 this is of globally particular concern in the plateau lake ecosystems where combined eutrophication and climate warming has favored an increase in the frequency and intensity of harmful cyanobacterial blooms over the past few decades monchamp et al 2016 2018 tse et al 2018 escalas et al 2019 it is known that cyanobacterial blooms are often dominated by toxic taxa as they can produce a wide variety of toxins to potentially degrade water quality ecosystem functions and services o neil et al 2012 rigosi et al 2014 cao et al 2017 monchamp et al 2018 during the process of degradation once a tipping point of environmental pressures such as nutrient concentration is exceeded an algae dominated state shifted from macrophyte dominated state will inevitably maintain over a long period which is almost irreversible may 1977 scheffer 2004 scheffer and jeppesen 2007 cao et al 2016 therefore a comprehensive understanding for long term decadal to centennial ecological dynamics of lake ecosystems is necessary for conservation and management smol 2010 tse et al 2018 however one of the greatest challenges faced by managers and stakeholders in lake ecosystems that the lack of long term and high resolution information limited our understanding of ecological dynamics monchamp et al 2016 traditional paleolimnological analysis with multiple paleo proxies such as pollen pigment and other physicochemical elements smol and cumming 2000 battarbee et al 2001 heinzelmann et al 2015 pal et al 2015 balint et al 2018 wan et al 2019 wang et al 2019 from lake sediment archives has been reconstructed for the historical trends of aquatic organisms and explored the effects of human activities and climate change to lake ecosystems monchamp et al 2016 although cyanobacteria in lake ecosystems have been extensively studied in recent history classic paleoecological indicators are not possible to unveil the community composition and structure domaizon et al 2017 the long term patterns of species richness and diversity of phylum cyanobacteria in natural assemblages still remain unclear sedimentary ancient dna sedadna extracted from lake sediment core provides a temporally integrated way to shed light on the historic dynamics of harmful cyanobacterial communities tse et al 2018 li et al 2019 yan et al 2019 anoxic hypoxic and cold conditions on the lake bottom have been suggested to be highly suitable for dna preservation against degradation coolen and gibson 2009 kirkpatrick et al 2016 monchamp et al 2016 especially in a high alpine environment parducci et al 2017 therefore with the rapid development of high throughput next generation sequencing techniques environmental dna edna metabarcoding is uniquely positioned to identify diverse taxonomic groups chariton et al 2010 laramie et al 2015 reid et al 2019 however so far as we know combining sedadna metabarcoding and other multiple paleoenvironmental proxies to track the regime shift and variability of biodiversity with relevance for the definition of conservation goals in plateau lakes is still poorly understood the objectives of present study were to i reconstruct the temporal trends of cyanobacterial community and other paleoenvironmental variables ii detect the change point of potential cyanobacterial blooms iii assess the responses from individuals to cyanobacterial communities and the presence of threshold levels associated with historical environmental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sediment core sampling lake chenghai 26 27 n 26 38 n 100 38 e 100 42 e is located in the conjunction of the qinghai tibet plateau and the yunnan guizhou plateau in china which has a surface area of 74 6 km2 an average depth of 26 5 m and a water volume of 1 92 billion m3 with the water level of 1501m there are no perennial surface inlet or outlet streams so the lake is fed by precipitation surface runoff from the 318 km2 catchment and groundwater inflow wu et al 2004 in 1942 ad a large number of people immigrated and settled in the lake chenghai basin since the mid 1980s the lake watershed has experienced greater usage by humans and increased application of agricultural fertilizer to enhance farm production wu et

species richness sobs chao1 richness index ace richness index shannon wiener diversity index and simpson diversity index in mothur v1 31 2 schloss et al 2009 jaccard similarity was calculated using taxonomic based jaccard distance faith et al 1987 to quantify the homogenization of cyanobacterial assemblage biotic homogenization generally refers to the gradual replacement of local biotas by widespread non natives mckinney and lockwood 1999 olden et al 2004 variation in beta diversity was visualized using principal coordinate analysis pcoa on the basis of bray curtis distances in r package vegan permutational multivariate analysis of variance test permanova n 999 was subsequently examined the statistical significance of differences among the following defined sampling groups anderson 2001 while mann whitney u test with false discovery rate fdr correction was used to unveil the individual cyanobacteria genera with significant differences in abundance 3 2 change point analysis the presence and timing of change points in cyanobacterial dynamics over the temporal dimension could be indicative of a regime shift which was carried out using the change point analyzer taylor 2000 a combination of cumulative sum charts cusum and bootstrapping technique 1000 repetitions was used to verify statistically significance of the identified change points at the level of 5 on the strength of segmented package a segmented method was also performed to estimate thresholds levels of nutrient concentration inducing the abrupt change of beta diversity in cyanobacterial community muggeo 2008 2015 the davies test was conducted to test whether there was a significant difference in slope davies 1977 cao et al 2017 3 3 co occurrence network to better understand community structure before and after the change point characterize intra community interactions the co occurrence network analysis was conducted on the gephi v 0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 the co occurrence network was inferred based on the pairwise spearman correlation matrix which was calculated using the psych r package revelle 2017 the correlation coefficient r 0 6 with statistically significant at p 0 05 widder et al 2014 was available in the co occurrence network network visualization and module detection of co occurrence patterns were presented using fruchterman reingold placement algorithm bastian et al 2009 average node degree average path length and clustering coefficient were calculated to characterize the topology of resulting networks potential keystone genera were identified from each co occurrence network which was disclosed by the high centrality and node degree newman 2003 2006 barberán et al 2012 redundancy analysis rda was applied to identify the driving paleoenvironmental variables with statistical significance that affect cyanobacteria community structure using vegan package v 2 5 6 in r 3 5 3 r development core team 2019 correlations between key variables related to trophic status abundance of mcya and rpoc1 genes and bloom forming or toxin producing cyanobacteria genera were explored using the linear ordinary least squares ols regression in statistica 10 software 4 results and discussion 4 1 chronology age dating based on the crs model in unsupported 210pb activities for lake chenghai indicated significant dry mass accumulation with an average rate of 0 260 0 051 g cm2y and it ranged from 1850 to 2017 in the upper sediment depth of 42 8 cm the crs model estimated the 1963 7 ad 8 6 thermonuclear weapons testing peak at the mass depth of 17 09 9 g cm2 depth 28 4 cm showing relative agreement with the distinct peak of 137cs observed at a depth of 25 2 cm the results demonstrated a reliable age model with a characteristic exponential decline r2 0 90 suppl fig s1 4 2 temporal trends of paleophysico chemical characteristics the toc content of lake chenghai ranged from 7 89 mg g to 36 50 mg g which was relatively constant prior to the late 1980s and then rapidly increased until the present compared to the toc profiles the tn content showed similar variations ranging from 0 20 mg g to 3 33 mg g but enriched earlier in the 1970s values of tp and ip gradually varied from 0 39 0 16 mg g to 0 87 0 55 mg g with an average of 0 66 and 0 41 mg g and rapidly increased over the top 14 cm while op content was fluctuations in the past moreover there was a steady increase in tn tp tn ip and tn op in parallel with tn and toc trends fig 2 on the whole the increasing trends of toc tn and tp contents in the sediment core demonstrated the high trophic condition and productivity of lake chenghai in the recent 40 years which was consistent with zan et al 2012 increasing n p ratios were dominated by unceasing anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus emeis et al 2000 δ13c δ15n and c n as available indicators have been extensively used to assess the origins of sedimentary organic matter in aquatic environment meyers and lallier vergès 1999 routh et al 2004 the sediment core also showed a reduction in δ13c values from the bottom to 1990s fig 2 therefore diagenesis was possible to have a significant effect on the c isotopes spiker and hatcher 1984 herczeg et al 2001 while a distinct increase ranging from 27 20 to 25 78 in the upper part of the sediment core was indicative of increased amounts of terrestrial matter herczeg et al 2001 cloern et al 2002 ruiz fernández et al 2002 the variation of δ15n content in lake chenghai followed a similar trend in δ13c specifically δ15n content varied from 5 09 to 6 28 averaging 5 82 after the 1990s which means that δ15n content was contributed by synthetic fertilizers herczeg et al 2001 ruiz fernández et al 2002 the decline of δ15n content also indicated that n2 fixing cyanobacteria accounted for the trend in recent years in addition the temporal trend of c n ratio forecasted that the sharp decrease of c n ratio was associated with increased accumulation of aquatic organic matters in the lake sediment suggesting increased primary productivity in the lake wan et al 2019 it seems that sedimentary organic matter derived from phytoplanktonic sources largely because c n ratio was slightly above 10 over the last 50 years ruiz fernández et al 2002 generally heavy precipitation enhanced soil erosion and increased the transport capacity of rivers and streams over the lake basin thus smaller particle size should indicate lower precipitation peng et al 2005 nahm et al 2010 based on the inference the decreasing trend of average particle size and median particle size the increasing trend of clay content reflected relatively low precipitation rates over the lake chenghai basin after the 1970s which was in concordance with meteorological observation yan et al 2019 temporal differences of cyanobacterial communities mcya and rpoc1 genes abundance a total of 1206506 high quality sequences were obtained from the sediment core and then were assigned to 100 011 otus spanning the phylum cyanobacteria in lake chenghai the rarefaction curves based on observed otus and shannon wiener index illustrated that the produced sequences were well captured to represent the majority of biodiversity suppl fig s2 14 sequences from the negative control were assigned to genus enterococcus which was not included in cyanobacteria and then was removed identification of the 100 011 otus belonged to 20 species in 18 genera of cyanobacteria between 1886 and 2017 unclassified cyanobacterial 16s rrna genes were dominant with the average relative abundance of 34 9 followed by synechococcus 25 5 and anabaenopsis 17 9 over the sediment core the genus prochlorococcus 10 1 accounted for 0 52 2 of the relative abundance where sphaerospermopsis 7 6 cylindrospermopsis 1 7 and microcystis 1 0 were less than 10 fig 3 a range of toxin producing cyanobacteria genera including anabaena anabaenopsis planktothrix and dolichospermum was also identified by sediment ancient dna metabarcoding in lake chenghai specifically more anabaenopsis was recovered from the sediment core compared with the previous study yan et al 2019 although the average relative abundance of aphanizomenon was 0 2 share of the total abundance from 1886 to 2017 most of the toxin producing cyanobacteria genera like the one with high relative abundance occurred in the last two decades this trend was confirmed by qpcr amplification of mcya and rpoc1 genes the highest abundance of mcya genes was observed in 1999 while the abundance of rpoc1 genes was peaked in 2016 followed by 2008 especially showing the coincidence with the relative abundance of cylindrospermopsis figs 2 and 3 the sum of mcya and rpoc1 genes abundance presented a trend similar to the number of cyanobacterial otus fig 2 suggesting the occurrence of microcystin and cylindrospermopsin in recent two decades may be mostly correlated with the increasing of anabaenopsis cylindrospermopsis and anabaena fig 3 to date several studies exist which had reconstructed the occurrence of toxin producing cyanobacterial taxa using qpcr in dated sediment cores with a century timescale ye et al 2011 pal et al 2015 monchamp et al 2016 pilon et al 2019 interestingly tse et al 2018 demonstrated that abundance of mcya genes supported the occurrence of dolichospermum in lake diefenbaker while the dominance of microcystis aeruginosa in lake greifensee and planktothrix rubescens in lake zurich was also verified by mcya genes monchamp et al 2016 however cylindrospermopsis cannot be detected if only mcya primers were used in the lake chenghai similarly legrand et al 2017 found that anatoxin a genes appeared only in the more modern sediments while mcya genes were presented in a eutrophic lake over the last 220 years pilon et al 2019 indicated that an inadequate matching of the primer of mcyd genes reflected a much smaller rise of gene copies in baqtiste lake therefore one pair of specific primers should be effectively designed or several pairs of primers should be chosen to highlight potential toxin producers through considering empirical data in recent years alpha diversity consisting of the sobs chao1 ace shannon wiener diversity index appeared to exhibit an increasing trend and simpson diversity index showed the opposite pattern fig 2 suggesting the relative higher diversity in the top than the bottom of sediment core however there was an increasing change in jaccard similarity reflecting a general homogenization in cyanobacterial community structure which was considered to be a loss of beta diversity monchamp et al 2018 evidence in the literature dornelas et al 2014 magurran et al 2015 mcgill et al 2015 monchamp et al 2018 2019 has supported that human activities can lead to the homogenization of species composition in fact the understanding of the complicated cyanobacterial biodiversity patterns over the temporal scale still remains scarce in freshwater ecosystems based on the sedadna the significant changes p 0 05 both in the otu richness of cyanobacteria and the corresponding cumulative sum during the period of 1886 2017 were obtained as different shades of the output suppl fig s3 the point where a sudden shift or change was detected in 1987 with a 100 level of confidence interval 1983 and 1994 the performance of change point analysis revealed that otu richness of cyanobacteria remained relatively constant from 1886 to 1987 named state i after which otu richness fluctuated and gradually increased throughout the period of 1987 2017 named state ii fig 2 at the genus level individual cyanobacteria genera in state ii exhibited a distinct increase in abundance of anabaenopsis fdr corrected p 0 001 prochlorococcus fdr corrected p 0 001 sphaerospermopsis fdr corrected p 0 001 cylindrospermopsis fdr corrected p 0 001 aphanizomenon fdr corrected p 0 001 anabaena fdr corrected p 0 001 planktothrix fdr corrected p 0 001 oscillatoria fdr corrected p 0 01 dolichospermum fdr corrected p 0 05 and a significant decrease in abundance of unclassified cyanobacteria fdr corrected p 0 001 compared to state i fig 4 of further concern pcoa based on 16s rrna sequences using the bray curtis distance metrics demonstrated the strong differences between state i and state ii fig 5 the permanova test determined that cyanobacterial communities diverged significantly before and after 1987 of the change point r2 0 43 p 0 001 complex interactions depicted by co occurrence networks further demonstrated that cyanobacterial relationships differentiated significantly before and after 1987 of the change point fig 6 the resulting co occurrence network in state i consisted of 13 nodes and 7 edges while there were 17 nodes and 15 edges in state ii in terms of average node degree state ii exhibited higher value 1 765 compared to state i 1 077 which was considered to be small world network humphries and gurney 2008 escalas et al 2019 the average path length 3 321 in state ii was higher than 1 300 of average path length in state i indicating more interactions across taxa in recent decades faust et al 2012 besides 85 and 71 88 of positive linkages were assigned to state i and state ii respectively although otus from the unclassified cyanobacteria were dominant in state i cylindrospermopsis prochlorococcus and dolichospermum comprising one module was most likely to be keystone taxa specifically those with high centrality and node degree fig 6 strong linkages within two dominant modules were presented with anabaena cylindrospermopsis and aphanizomenon constituting one module planktothrix microcystis anabaenopsis oscillatoria sphaerospermopsis aphanocapsa synechococcus dolichospermum prochlorococcus and unclassified consisting of another module in state ii fig 6 obviously the shift of the keystone taxa had been demonstrated to cause a dramatic shift in cyanobacterial structure and functioning over the temporal scale banerjee et al 2018 most of the keystone taxa with less than 1 of relative abundance have been recognized as rare genera and played a vital role in community assembly campbell et al 2011 liao et al 2017 in addition more negative linkages 28 12 occurred in state ii indicating an increasing mutual exclusion between cyanobacterial taxa escalas et al 2019 and maybe resulted in weak community stability lawes et al 2017 under the elevated environmental disturbance fig 2 after 1987 this point was further verified by lower clustering coefficient 0 517 in state ii contrasting with 0 750 of clustering coefficient in state i in this context although the change point has been identified and revealed the significant difference between state i and state ii we concluded that lake chenghai still in the unstable transition period from macrophyte dominated state to algae dominated state scheffer 2004 scheffer and jeppesen 2007 cao et al 2016 moreover several different proportions of negative correlations have been reported ranging from 5 to 50 in the co occurrence networks under cyanobacterial dominance at the spatial scale escalas et al 2019 however our results revealed previously unreported negative patterns in shaping cyanobacterial co occurrence network over the temporal scale therefore which can provide some insights for understanding the role of co occurrence networks responding to environmental conditions correlations of paleoenvironmental variables related to nutrients and bloom forming or toxin producing cyanobacterial genera 10 cyanobacteria genera have presented the significant difference of state i and state ii fig 4 most of which including anabaenopsis sphaerospermopsis cylindrospermopsis dolichospermum aphanizomenon anabaena planktothrix oscillatoria kurmayer et al 2002 saker et al 2007 o neil et al 2012 dittmann et al 2013 wood et al 2017 monchamp et al 2018 budzyńska et al 2019 have been described to produce a variety of cyanotoxins with hepatotoxins neurotoxins and cytotoxins cirés and ballot 2016 the increasing trends of mcya and rpoc1 genes in abundance were similar to the long term change of paleoenvironmental variables related to nutrients except for op fig 2 the ols model results demonstrated that the abundance of mcya genes was significantly correlated with the paleoenvironmental variables related to tn while the positive associations between the abundance of rpoc1 genes and six paleoenvironmental variables were totally significant and higher fig 7 pointing out that nutrient enrichment potential affected the production of cyanobacterial toxins the connections were also established by a few previous studies wilhelm et al 2011 ye et al 2011 tse et al 2018 rda showed that measured paleophysico chemical variables related to trophic status explained 31 78 of total variation in cyanobacteria community assemblage which uncovered that tp r2 0 55 p 0 001 and tn r2 0 49 p 0 001 were the most significant environmental drivers enabling the increasing occurrence of cyanobacterial community suppl fig s4 taken together therefore increases in tn and tp contents were linearly associated with the growth of cyanobacterial genera fig 8 suppl figs s5 and s6 the relative abundance of cyanobacterial genera followed this notably positive trends along the tn ip and tn tp gradient fig 8 suppl figs s7 and s8 although nonsignificant relationships e g anabaena anabaenopsis and oscillatoria suppl fig s6 dolichospermum suppl figs s7 and s8 planktothrix suppl figs s6 and s8 were also found the findings were also consistent with other emerging evidence to support a triggering role of nutrient enrichment in cyanobacterial blooms paerl 2008 conley et al 2009 o neil et al 2012 however to the best of our knowledge although prochlorococcus was not previously reported as a toxin producing cyanobacterial genus tn tp tn ip and tn tp strongly affected the dominance of prochlorococcus as well as sphaerospermopsis and cylindrospermopsis anabaenopsis with the highest relative abundance 17 9 was markedly dominated by tn tp and tn ip interestingly it was not significantly correlated with tn and tp suppl figs s5 and s6 whereas that of dolichospermum followed the opposite pattern fig 8 suppl figs s5 s8 in addition aphanizomenon anabaena planktothrix and oscillatoria were mostly detected in the sediments after the 1980s suggesting that these cyanobacterial genera were able to colonize a eutrophic lake where tn concentration obviously raised fig 2 for instance dolman et al 2012 reported the aphanizomenon gracile blooms in 102 german lakes with nitrogen enrichment while only one species of aphanizomenon gracile was observed in the sediment core overall these results presented the long term changes of cyanobacterial taxa and their different responses along the nutrient gradient that were unknown to date over the temporal scale and also provided increasing knowledge for the debate to explain which one was the main factor among tn tp and n p ratios driving the dynamics of cyanobacterial populations conley et al 2009 o neil et al 2012 cao et al 2016 cirés and ballot 2016 monchamp et al 2018 it is noteworthy that microcystis in the sediment core was rare and did not exhibit a significant increase over the temporal scale figs 3 and 4 although it was identified to be keystone taxa in the co occurrence networks fig 6 yet in this study anabaenopsis dominated in recent decades which was different from general understanding in other lake ecosystems that microcystis is the most prevalent cyanobacterial bloom forming genera o neil et al 2012 one possibility was that microcystis had an increasing competition with sphaerospermopsis fig 6 the other one maybe because the special natural background with alkalinity and ph was high in lake chenghai yan et al 2019 besides previous evidence demonstrated that the growth of microcystis was associated with higher concentrations of dissolved phosphorus otten et al 2012 tromas et al 2018 although an increasing trend of phosphorus was presented in sediment core fig 2 tp content in sediment and tp concentration in water were relatively lower fig 2 suppl fig s10 compared to microcystis dominated lake taihu xu et al 2014 unfortunately there was no historical data of dissolved phosphorus that further hindered our understanding for its relationship with microcystis ecological thresholds and implication to lake ecosystem management ecological thresholds for lake ecosystem management have been identified to develop nutrient criteria based on the nonlinear response of phytoplankton communities to water quality based on the relationship between pco 1 bray curtis distances and sediment tn tp suppl fig s9 the segmented method detected the change points for tn and tp contents affecting the cyanobacterial community structure at the threshold level of 1 81 0 33 mg g and 0 792 2 057 mg g respectively although the davies test gave the significance of two change points at p 0 001 and p 0 003 wide confidence intervals of tp threshold indicated considerable uncertainty in terms of the trophic classification scheme for lake waters proposed by the oecd 1982 this was probably because tp concentration with an average concentration of 0 027 mg l in water was still at a mesotrophic level during 1988 2017 suppl fig s10 where was insufficient to induce a nonlinear change of the cyanobacterial community structure even though tp content in sediment core has been gradually increasing over the past 170 years fig 2 in contrast to tp except for the distinct change point of tn there was a strongly exponential relationship between tn concentration in water and tn content in sediment r2 0 534 p 0 001 suppl figs s9 and s11 in this case we concluded that tn concentration in water should be no more than 0 60 mg l for supporting lake protection and remediation so far as we know this is the first investigation to achieve a quantitative threshold combining sedadna metabarcoding and paleoenvironmental proxies and empirical data at the temporal scale due to the lack of century data some numeric nutrient criteria have been established using monitoring data in phytoplankton community or chlorophyll a concentration over the spatial or short time scales us epa 2010 huo et al 2014 2015 cao et al 2016 but the nutrient criteria were either higher xu et al 2014 or more conservative huo et al 2014 than 0 60 mg l of tn this difference in nutrient criteria could be attributed to spatially environmental heterogeneity and seasonal variations in order to alleviate and control harmful cyanobacterial blooms we think that cyanobacteria are more specific and targeted than phytoplankton or chlorophyll a as the response variable to identify nutrient thresholds 5 conclusions we used sedimentary ancient dna metabarcoding and traditional paleolimnological analysis approaches to successfully reconstruct the long term dynamic trends of cyanobacterial assemblage and environmental conditions which provided empirical evidence on the cause of degraded lake ecosystem the increasing change in alpha diversity and homogenization in species composition the abrupt change of cyanobacterial communities at the temporal scale was identified and resulted in a distinct difference in species abundance and beta biodiversity cyanobacterial co occurrence network analysis indicated that more interactions among toxin producing cyanobacterial genera occurred after the change point the presence of cyanobacterial toxin producers over recent years was also confirmed by mcya and rpoc1 genes moreover significant and positive correlations emphasized the potential role of nutrient enrichment inducing the growth of bloom forming or toxin producing cyanobacterial genera however there is no efficient way to directly reconstruct the dissolved phosphorus content in the sediment core based on traditional paleolimnological techniques which is a barrier for further deciphering the relationships between long term cyanobacterial dynamics and environmental conditions finally in consideration of scientific and technical feasibility coupling high throughput sequencing of sedadna and empirical data would offer new thinking for establishing nutrient criteria declaration of competing interest the

employed to treat cbds derco et al 2013 2015 lee et al 2016 due to the electron withdrawing effects of chlorine substituents ozone o3 and ho react selectively with cbds and the rate constants of o3

this and the reactivity of ho with cbds uv chlorine process is expected to be an alternative approach for cbds elimination however the removal efficiency of cbds in uv chlorine process is unknown the role of rcs contributing to cbd s removal is poorly understood the objectives of this work are to investigate the kinetics and mechanisms during cbds degradation by uv chlorine treatment eight cbds were investigated in this study including five tcbds two pcbds and hcbd firstly the degradation behaviors of the selected cbds in uv chlorine treatment were evaluated and also compared with those in uv irradiation and chlorination alone secondly roles of the reactive species on cbds degradation were examined through experiments with quenchers or varying ph values thirdly the transformation products were identified and a transformation pathway was proposed finally the effects of water matrix and degradation efficiency in natural water samples were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1

society srnom stock solution was prepared by dissolving srnom into ultrapure water and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane a natural water sample was collected from the beijiang river bjr in guangdong province of china it was filtered with 0 45 μm membrane filters and stored at 4 c and no detectable cbds were found in this water the other chemicals used in this work were provided in text s1 2 2 experimental procedures the setup of the uv irradiation apparatus is shown in fig s1 one 10 w low pressure mercury lamp was applied to provide monochromatic uv irradiation at 253 7 nm the uv fluence rate was determined to be 2 10 8 e s 1 via iodide iodate chemical actinometry rahn et al 2010 and the corresponding average uv254nm fluence rate was calculated to be 0 21 mw cm 2 uv light was vertically directed downward to a cylindrical quartz reactor 7 5 cm diameter 0 5 cm high volume 22 ml the reactor contained a port 1 5 cm in diameter for sampling and a grinding stopper for prevention of evaporation the solution containing 10 μg l 1 cbds and 5 mm phosphate buffer was firstly mixed for uv chlorine tests a baseline chlorine dose of 10 mg l 1 was spiked into the solutions and the uv irradiation was started simultaneously after a determined reaction time 0 10 min 10 ml solution was collected and quenched with 0 21 mm sodium sulfite then the samples were extracted by hexane with 1 2 dichlorobenzene 50 μg l 1 used as a surrogate standard and the recovery rate 95 after extraction the extract was subjected to analysis on a gas chromatograph the residual chlorine was analyzed by using separate tests quenching experiments were conducted by adding different quenchers e g tert butanol tba bicarbonate ions separately to the solutions before spiking chlorine solutions were buffered at ph 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 by 5 mm phosphate buffer the effects of the water matrix components were studied by spiking certain concentrations of nahco3 nom and nabr the control tests with chlorination alone or uv irradiation alone were performed following the same method as described above to identify the transformation products during cbds degradation the initial concentration of cbds was increased to 5 mg l 1 and the chlorine dosage was accordingly increased to 1 g l 1 2 3 calculation for the contribution of reactive species the degradation of cbds during uv chlorine treatment included contribution from direct uv photolysis along with oxidation by free chlorine ho and rcs thus the degradation of cbds can be expressed as 7 k obs cbds k uv cbds k cl 2 cbds k ho cbds k rcs cbds where k obs cbds represents the pseudo first order decay rate constant of cbds under uv chlorine treatment k uv cbds represents the contribution from direct uv photolysis k cl 2 cbds k ho cbds and k rcs cbds represent the contributions from oxidation by free chlorine ho and rcs respectively k uv cbds used the pseudo first order decay rate constant of cbds under uv irradiation alone directly because the absorbance of the added chlorine was less than 3 of the total absorbance after adding chlorine to the solutions k cl 2 cbds was 0 s 1 as free chlorine hardly reacted with cbds fig 1 k ho cbds was obtained by eq 8 8 k ho cbds k ho cbds ho ss where k ho cbds are the secondary order reaction rate constants of ho with cbds and the values are listed in table 1 lee et al 2016 ho ss represents the steady state concentrations of ho which was analyzed by using nitrobenzene nb 0 2 μm as a probe compound with details provided in text s2 then k rcs cbds can be calculated by subtracting k uv cbds k cl 2 cbds and k ho cbds from the observed degradation rates k obs cbds using eq 9 9 k rcs cbds k obs cbds k uv cbds k cl 2 cbds k ho cbds the second order rate constants for the reactions of clo with cbds were determined based on competition kinetics using caffeine and carbamazepine as reference compounds with details shown in text s3 2 4 analytical methods cbds and 1 2 dichlorobenzene were detected on a gas chromatogaph 7890a agilent technologies photoisomers and intermediates of cbds degradation were examined by gas chromatograph mass spectrometer trace 1300 thermo fisher organic acid was determined by ion chromatograph ics 600 thermo scientific details about these analytical methods were described in text s1 chlorine concentrations were analyzed through the diethyl p phenylene diamine dpd ferrous titration apha awwa wef 2012 quantum chemical calculations were conducted by the gaussian 09 program package frisch et al 2009 the geometry optimizations and harmonic frequency calculations for the reactants including cbds and clo were performed at the m06 2x 6 311g d level with the smd continuum solvation model frisch et al 1984 ribeiro et al 2011 su 2014 the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest occupied molecular orbital lumo of each cbd were generated and displayed by multiwfn software version 3 7 lu and chen 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of cbds degradation the time dependent abatement of cbds by chlorination alone uv photolysis alone and uv chlorine process is shown in fig 1 the removal efficiency of cbds in chlorination alone was quite low 10 uv irradiation was effective to reduce cbds and about 45 2 90 8 of cbds were degraded after 10 min uv irradiation 128 2 mj cm 2 their degradation kinetics followed the first order kinetics with the degradation rate constants listed in table 1 z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd had the highest degradation rate constant 10 52 0 12 10 3 s 1 followed by e 1 1 2 4 tcbd 4 59 0 31 10 3 s 1 and z 1 1 3 4 tcbd 4 36 0 18 10 3 s 1 whereas 1 1 2 3 tcbd and 1 1 4 4 tcbd had much lower degradation rates at 1 15 0 01 10 3 s 1 and 1 32 0 25 10 3 s 1 respectively based on the molar absorption coefficients of cbds ε 254 nm determined by lee s group lee et al 2016 the quantum yields of cbds φ254nm were calculated and provided in table 1 details in text s5 bolton and stefan 2002 canonica et al 2008 for z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd the φ254nm were 0 62 0 007 while for 1 1 2 3 tcbd and 1 1 4 4 tcbd the φ254nm were 0 18 0 002 and 0 04 0 007 respectively the values were in good consistence with previously reported ones lee et al 2016 in comparison with uv treatment alone the addition of free chlorine 10 mg l 1 to uv irradiation led to the increase of the first order rate constants k obs by 1 03 0 05 3 48 0 14 10 3 s 1 for tcbds with the exception of z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd 0 63 0 14 10 3 s 1 0 68 0 13 0 71 0 03 10 3 s 1 for pcbds and 0 07 0 03 10 3 s 1 for hcbd respectively e 1 1 3 4 tcbd was mostly enhanced by the increase of 3 48 0 14 10 3 s 1 in k obs this clearly indicates that the degradation enhancement of adding free chlorine to uv irradiation is closely related to the number of chlorine substituents for cbds following the order of tcbds pcbds hcbd with the exception of z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd exhibiting similar increases as pcbds the results suggest that the chlorine substituents numbers can influence the interactions between cbds and reactive oxidant species in uv chlorine treatment a separate study using uv h2o2 treatment was also compared at a h2o2 dose of 140 μm the removal efficiency of 1 1 4 4 tcbd was about 37 6 less than that in uv chlorine treatment at chlorine dose of 140 μm fig s5 this was attributed to the lower quantum yield of h2o2 photolysis under uv irradiation than that of hocl clo herrmann 2007 watts and linden 2007 besides rcs may also contribute to the degradation of cbds in uv chlorine process the roles of ho and rcs were explored further in the next part 3 2 the role of reactive species 3 2 1 the contribution of reactive species the contributions of reactive species to eight cbds degradation were summarized in fig 2 a free chlorine contributed little to cbds degradation uv irradiation contributed 32 8 97 6 to the degradation of cbds with hcbd 97 6 and z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd 93 0 having the highest contribution this can be due to the high φ254nm of hcbd 0 99 0 002 and z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd 0 60 0 016 table 1 the ho ss was measured at the level of 8 12 1 29 14 38 0 73 10 14 m by using nb as the probe compound the elimination of cbds by the contribution of ho was observed to be 2 6 14 4 ho had the highest contribution to the degradation of 1 1 4 4 tcbd 14 4 followed by 1 1 2 3 tcbd 12 6 and 1 1 2 4 4 pcbd 12 3 z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd had the fastest reaction rate constant with ho at 7 1 1 5 109 m 1s 1 and 5 2 of its degradation was attributed to ho meanwhile ho only contributed 2 6 to the degradation of hcbd due to its low reaction rate constant 0 9 0 7 109 m 1s 1 rcs contributed negligibly to the degradation of z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd 1 8 and hcbd 0 5 by contrast rcs contributed 25 1 42 3 to the degradation of the other four tcbds and 13 2 15 1 to two pcbds interestingly the contribution of rcs to cbds degradation seemed to be influenced by both the numbers and the positions of chlorine substituents in cbds for cbds with different numbers of chlorine substituents the degradation rate led by rcs for tcbds was higher than that for pcbds and hcbd based on eq 9 the k rcs cbds was 0 75 0 003 3 02 0 07 10 3 s 1 for tcbds except z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd and 0 39 0 03 0 52 0 08 10 3 s 1 for pcbds additionally for cbds with the same number of chlorine atoms the percentages of rcs contribution were also affected by the positions of chlorine atoms for example the contribution percentages by rcs for tcbds follows the order 1 1 4 4 tcbd 42 3 z 1 1 3 4 tcbd 38 5 1 1 2 3 tcbd 34 5 e 1 1 2 4 tcbd 25 1 z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd 0 5 regarding pcbds the contribution percentage by rcs was comparable for 1 1 2 4 4 pcbd 15 1 and z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd 13 2 the reasons were discussed hereafter cl cl2 and clo were the main rcs which may account for cbds degradation to clarify their roles e 1 1 2 4 tcbd was used as a representative cbd for further tests meanwhile different radical quenchers such as chloride tba and bicarbonate were used for differentiation of the contribution of rcs which has been used in previous studies cheng et al 2018 fang et al 2014 wu et al 2016 cl2 being mainly formed from the reactions of cl with cl fang et al 2014 lei et al 2019 was found to play a negligible role in the degradation of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd as the addition of 20 mm cl didn t enhance its degradation fig 2 b the addition of tba 50 mm completely inhibited the radical induced cbd degradation and the addition of bicarbonate hco3 100 mm led to only 14 7 reduction in cbd degradation fig 2 b tba quenches ho 6 108 m 1s 1 cl 3 108 m 1s 1 and clo 1 3 107 m 1s 1 wu et al 2017 hco3 reacts with ho 8 5 106 m 1s 1 cl 2 2 108 m 1s 1 and cl2 8 0 107 m 1s 1 but reacts slowly with clo 600 m 1s 1 matthew and anastasio 2006 it seemed that clo was the dominant rcs contributing to cbd degradation kong et al 2018 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2016 to make further confirmation the degradation of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd was tracked at different phs as shown in fig 3 with ph increasing from 6 0 to 8 0 the degradation of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd contributed by rcs showed an increasing trend based on previous literatures the concentrations of cl decreased with increasing ph due to the faster consumption rates of cl with ocl than hocl eq 6 and the concentrations of clo increased from ph 6 0 to 8 0 instead wu et al 2016 yin et al 2018 which was consistent with the trends of rcs contribution fig 3 b thus clo was the dominant rcs contributing to cbd s degradation 3 2 2 the reactions of clo with cbds the reaction rate constants of clo with cbds were determined and presented in table 1 the determined k clo cbds for tcbds were higher than 2 107 m 1s 1 except z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd 1 106 m 1s 1 lower reaction rate constants with clo were found for the two pcbds which were 1 31 0 12 107 m 1s 1 for z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd and 1 48 0 21 107 m 1s 1 for 1 1 2 4 4 pcbd respectively hcbd had no observable reaction with clo 1 106 m 1s 1 clearly the rate constants of cbds with clo generally followed the order of k clo tcbds except z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd k clo pcbds k clo hcbd being consistent with the results of k rcs cbds additionally the reaction rates of clo with cbds bearing the same numbers of chlorine atoms also varied for example z 1 1 3 4 tcbd reacted with clo at the highest rate constant of 4 98 0 16 107 m 1s 1 followed by 1 1 2 3 tcbd 3 08 0 51 107 m 1s 1 e 1 1 2 4 tcbd 2 22 0 77 107 m 1s 1 1 1 4 4 tcbd 2 07 0 25 107 m 1s 1 and z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd 106 m 1s 1 for the two pcbds the determined k clo 1 1 2 4 4 pcbd 1 48 0 21 106 m 1s 1 was comparable to that of k clo z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd 1 31 0 12 106 m 1s 1 it should be noted that k clo tcbds generally followed the same order as k rcs tcbds except 1 1 2 3 tcbd 0 75 0 003 10 3 s 1 that is z 1 1 3 4 tcbd 3 02 0 07 10 3 s 1 e 1 1 2 4 tcbd 1 70 0 21 10 3 s 1 1 1 4 4 tcbd 1 29 0 15 10 3 s 1 z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd 0 20 0 13 10 3 s 1 the results further supported that clo was the predominant rcs in degrading cbds in uv chlorine process it should be noted that uv irradiation not only directly degrades cbd to some photo products that are irreversible but also transforms into photoisomers that are connected each other in equilibrium and are reversible during reaction as illustrated in the later section 3 4 thus the k clo values for the cbds in the presence of photoisomers are not elementary and species specific but apparent rate constants single electron transfer set pathway was an important pathway in clo reaction with organic compounds alfassi et al 1988 guo et al 2017 li et al 2007 mertens and sonntag 1995 to help explain why cbds react with clo differently the homos of cbds were calculated to evaluate the set pathway between clo and cbds and the computed results were displayed in fig s6 the distribution of molecular orbital preferred to butadiene cc cc and chlorine atoms the electron transfer should be from the homo of cbds and to the lumo of clo the orbital energy gap between homo and lumo orbitals δe δ e e lumo clo 0 608 ev e homo cbds refers to the capacity of electron transfer and the lower orbital energy gap indicates that electron withdrawing from cbds to clo is more readily herein e homo of tcbds pcbds and hcbd were 8 213 8 678 ev 8 541 8 683 ev and 8 906 ev table s3 respectively thus the order of the orbital energy gaps of these cbds was as follows δ e clo tcbds except z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd δ e clo pcbds δ e clo hcbd an exact opposite order to the reaction rate constants of clo with cbds for further investigating the reaction between cbds and clo we calculated the natural population npa charge to determine the reaction sites and the electron donating capacity of cbds to clo as shown in table s3 the atom with the lowest npa charge potentially reflects the reaction sites of cbds note that the reaction sites of cbds vary in c1 c4 and are all the c atom of c h herein the npa charge of tcbds pcbds and hcbd were generally 0 3389 0 2038 0 2784 0 1947 0 1299 respectively the order of the npa charge of cbds also follows the opposite order of the reaction rate constants of clo with cbds it should be noted that the limitation of above theoretical analysis lies in the calculation based on the parent cbds without considering their photoisomers the elementary and specie specific rate constant of certain cbd with clo is not able to be obtained due to the consistent presence of photoisomers under uv irradiation this could also be the reason for the absence of relationship between the orbital energy gap or npa charge of parent tcbds and pcbds and their reaction rate constants with clo 3 3 effects of ph on cbds degradation 1 1 4 4 tcbd e 1 1 2 4 tcbd and z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd were selected as representative cbds to study the effects of ph on the degradation of cbds in uv chlorine treatment as shown in fig 3 a and b the k obs for 1 1 4 4 tcbd and e 1 1 2 4 tcbd degradation increased distinctly with ph increasing from 6 0 to 8 0 but decreased slightly at ph 9 0 by contrast the k obs for z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd decreased continuously with ph increasing from 6 0 to 9 0 fig 3 c this significant dependence of cbds degradation under uv chlorine process was most likely attributed to the shift in chlorine speciation from hocl toward ocl with increasing ph dodd and huang 2007 wang et al 2020 leading to the enhanced scavenging of ho and cl and the increasing yields of clo fang et al 2014 wu et al 2016 as the solution ph increased from 6 0 to 8 0 the concentration of ho decreased from 1 41 0 04 2 48 0 18 10 13 m to 2 55 0 13 3 38 0 01 10 14 m and correspondingly the degradation of 1 1 4 4 tcbd e 1 1 2 4 tcbd and z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd contributed from ho was reduced by 83 4 72 6 and 88 7 respectively by contrast the contribution of rcs k rcs cbds mainly clo to the degradation of 1 1 4 4 tcbd e 1 1 2 4 tcbd and z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd increased instead specifically from 0 27 0 01 10 3 s 1 to 2 19 0 16 10 3 s 1 from 0 to 2 54 0 17 10 3 s 1 and from 0 69 0 11 10 3 s 1 to 0 77 0 004 10 3 s 1 respectively when ph increased from 8 0 to 9 0 the rcs contributions decreased for the three cbds this was attributed to the increased concentrations of oh in the solution which consumed clo rapidly k 2 5 109 m 1s 1 guo et al 2017 kläning and wolff 1985 the different ph dependent degradation trend of z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd from 1 1 4 4 tcbd and e 1 1 2 4 tcbd was mainly due to its much lower reaction rate constants with clo 1 106 m 1s 1 thus the degradation trends was mainly governed by ho not clo 3 4 transformation products and reaction pathways 3 4 1 identification of transformation products fig 4 displays the evolution of four cbds and their photoisomers under uv irradiation and uv chlorine treatment it should be pointed out that these photoisomers were observed to have identical fragment patterns as the precursor cbds and they were just semi quantified as their standards are not commercially available as presented in fig 4 a and d one photoisomer was observed in e 1 1 2 4 tcbd and z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd solutions upon uv irradiation and uv chlorine treatment they were predicted to undergo e z and z e photoisomerization reaction upon uv irradiation in the stock solution of z 1 1 3 4 tcbd before irradiation its photoisomer e 1 1 3 4 tcbd was also observed and the relative response was about 35 of the initial z 1 1 3 4 tcbd fig 4 b for z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd two photoisomers were detected fig 4 c z z z e and z e e e photoisomerization reactions may occur under uv irradiation lee et al 2016 additionally the observed photoisomers all had lower concentrations in uv chlorine treatment than uv irradiation alone the photoisomers formed quickly upon uv irradiation and then decomposed with prolonging reaction time during uv chlorine treatment the photoisomers were further decomposed by the reactive species such as ho and rcs resulting in reduced level of photoisomers the other products from uv chlorine treatment of z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd was also explored two products at m z 209 p1 and m z 223 p2 were observed fig s7 they both contained four chlorine atoms and were assigned to be 2 3 4 4 tetrachloro 3 enol and 2 3 4 4 tetrachloro 3 enoic acid respectively it should be noted that p1 was detected in both uv and uv chlorine systems with response higher in uv irradiation alone and p2 was only detected in uv chlorine system fig s7 in addition formic acid and oxalic acid were also detected in both systems and more oxalic acid was generated in uv chlorine system fig s8 3 4 2 the proposed degradation pathways of cbds the degradation pathways of cbds in uv chlorine treatment using z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd as an example are illustrated in fig 5 uv irradiation and clo oxidation pathways were presented and ho reaction pathway was not drawn as it contributed to less than 4 0 to the degradation of z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd clo can abstract an electron from z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd to form structure i 1 and then it transferred a proton to h2o to produce a carbon centered radical i 2 i 2 had high reactivity toward dissolved oxygen k 109 m 1s 1 li et al 2004 generating a peroxyl radical i 3 this peroxyl radical may decay via self or cross termination reactions mertens and sonntag 1995 a tetroxide structure i 4 may form via self termination reactions a dioxide structure i 5 may form from the reactions of the peroxyl radical with i 2 coote 2010 smith et al 2018 the two structures can further decompose to i 6 and subsequently transfer to p2 via an unstable ketene structure i 7 in aquatic phase sonntag and schuchmann 1998 meanwhile another carbon centered radical i 8 can be generated through the homolytic cleavage of c cl bond at c4 under uv irradiation li et al 2004 mertens and sonntag 1995 this carbon centered radical can react with water to form p1 which also reacted with clo to form p2 p2 produced from the two above pathways can undergo further photodegradation oxidation and hydrolysis to generate small molecular weight acids including formic acid and oxalic acid li et al 2007 luo et al 2011 additionally the carbon centered radical i 12 formed by the homolytic cleavage of c cl bond at c3 can also react with dissolved oxygen yielding a peroxyl radical this peroxyl radical could be transferred to formic acid and oxalic acid through a series of reactions including bimolecular decaying oxidation and hydrolysis li et al 2004 mertens and sonntag 1995 3 5 effects of water matrix and degradation in natural water the effects of water matrix components including bromide alkalinity and nom were evaluated using e 1 1 2 4 tcbd as a representative cbd and the results are shown in fig 6 a hco3 co3 2 slightly inhibited e 1 1 2 4 tcbd degradation in uv chlorine treatment the k obs of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd degradation decreased from 6 78 0 02 10 3 s 1 to 6 34 0 1 10 3 s 1 with the addition of hco3 increasing from 0 to 5 mm at ph 7 0 although co3 can be generated by hco3 co3 2 reacting with ho and cl it has a less reactivity with cbds 106 m 1s 1 table 1 which accounted for the inhibition of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd degradation the presence of nom inhibited e 1 1 2 4 tcbd degradation under uv chlorine significantly fig 6 a the k obs decreased to the value similar as that of uv irradiation alone with spiking 5 mg c l 1 nom this was attributed to the radical scavenging effect by nom which was able to react with clo rapidly 4 5 104 mg l 1 1s 1 guo et al 2017 liang et al 2007 br had a slight promoting effect about 10 on the degradation of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd in uv chlorine process with the addition concentration at both 2 5 μm and 5 μm fig 6 a by adding 2 5 μm br to the chlorination alone system the k obs of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd under chlorination alone was observed to accelerate from 0 to 0 3 0 053 10 3 s 1 fig s9 the results show that hobr can react with e 1 1 2 4 tcbd as br is quickly convert to hobr by hocl 1 55 103 m 1s 1 kumar and margerum 2002 additionally br could also shift the reactive species to bromine radicals through the reaction with ho and cl and the photolysis of hobr cheng et al 2018 thus lower concentrations of ho and clo were expected with the increasing br levels which may result in decreasing contribution to cbds degradaton wu et al 2017 thus the increased degradation for e 1 1 2 4 tcbd in the presence of br may be mainly due to the enhanced contribution from hobr the degradation of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd 1 1 4 4 tcbd and z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd by uv chlorine process in beijiang river bjr water was shown in fig 6 b at a uv dose of 64 mj cm 2 and chlorine dose of 10 mg l 1 the removal efficiency of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd 1 1 4 4 tcbd and z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd was 80 0 34 4 and 69 5 respectively which was 8 7 11 9 and 7 4 higher than that under uv irradiation alone similarly as in di water the addition of free chlorine had more benefits on the degradation of tcbds than that of pcbds to achieve 80 degradation in bjr water the uv dose of 76 279 and 96 mj cm 2 was required for e 1 1 2 4 tcbd 1 1 4 4 tcbd and z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd respectively by using uv irradiation alone with the addition of 10 mg l 1 free chlorine the required uv dose can be reduced to 64 242 and 86 mj cm 2 saving 15 9 12 9 and 11 0 separately comparably for cbds degradation in di water the required uv dose to achieve 80 removal for e 1 1 2 4 tcbd 1 1 4 4 tcbd and z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd can be reduced by 47 138 and 21 respectively with the addition of 10 mg l 1 free chlorine the results indicate the potential application of uv chlorine treatment in eliminating tcbds and pcbds in real water matrix but the efficiency was much less than that in di water again uv chlorine treatment didn t enhance hbcd degradation data not shown 4 conclusions uv chlorine treatment was demonstrated to be effective for cbds elimination in this study about 71 7 97 8 cbds could be removed within 10 min with a uv dose of 128 mj cm 2 and a chlorine dose of 10 mg l 1 uv irradiation ho and rcs accounted 32 8 97 6 2 6 14 4 and 0 5 42 3 respectively for cbds removal clo was proven to be the dominant rcs which reacts with cbds except z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd and hcbd 106 m 1s 1 at 107 m 1s 1 following an order k clo t c b d s k clo pcbds k clo hcbd for cbds with a z or e configuration photoisomers could be formed and the levels would be reduced due to the further decomposition by ho and rcs during uv chlorine treatment based on the identification of the products of z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd pathways including single electron transfer dechlorination and hydrolysis reactions were proposed for cbds abatement in uv chlorine process although different water characteristics impacted the treatment efficiency of cbds differently uv chlorine brought benefits for reduction of tcbds but to lesser extent for pcbds and virtually no benefit for hcbd similarly as in di water declaration of

17766,polychoro 1 3 butadienes cbds were widely found in aqueous environment and resistant to conventional water treatment in this study the abatement of cbds during uv chlorine treatment was investigated in comparison to uv irradiation alone free chlorine addition brought benefits for the reduction of tetra cbds tcbds but to lesser extent for penta cbds pcbds and virtually no benefit for hexa cbd hcbd at a uv dose of 128 mj cm 2 and a chlorine dose of 10 mg l 1 about 71 7 97 8 cbds were degraded by uv chlorine treatment within 10 min uv irradiation contributed 32 8 97 6 ho contributed 2 6 14 4 and reactive chlorine species rcs contributed less than 0 5 42 3 to cbds degradation the percentages of rcs contribution generally followed the order of tcbds except z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd pcbds hcbd the chlorine oxide radical clo was the dominant rcs contributing to the degradation of cbds the second order reaction rate constants of clo with cbds k clo cbds were at 107 m 1s 1 except z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd and hcbd 106 m 1s 1 k clo cbds generally decreased with increasing numbers of chlorine atoms and was also affected by the positions of chlorine atoms in cbds a distinct reaction pathway of clo with z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd as a representative cbd was proposed photoisomers of cbds from z or e configuration were observed at lower concentrations in uv chlorine treatment than under uv irradiation alone due to the radical involved oxidation but more organic acids including oxalic acid were observed in a natural water sample uv chlorine treatment also exhibited a good performance in abatement of tcbds and pcbds but not in abatement of hcbd graphical abstract image 1 keywords polychoro 1 3 butadienes cbds uv chlorine chlorine oxide radical clo hcbd water treatment 1 introduction polychoro 1 3

brüschweiler et al 2010 as some tcbds and pcbds have also been found to show clastogenic activity brüschweiler s group has proposed that the sum of tcbds and pcbds can t exceed 75 ng l 1 in drinking

employed to treat cbds derco et al 2013 2015 lee et al 2016 due to the electron withdrawing effects of chlorine substituents ozone o3 and ho react selectively with cbds and the rate constants of o3

been reported to contribute 21 3 zhang et al 2019b additionally chlorinated olefin compounds such as trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene have also been confirmed to be reactive with cl with reaction rate constants at 4 88 1010 m 1s 1 and 2 8 108 m 1s 1 respectively li et al 2004 mertens and sonntag 1995 based on these evidences we propose that cbds may be susceptible to rcs combining this and the reactivity of ho with cbds uv chlorine process is expected to be an alternative approach for cbds elimination however the removal efficiency of cbds in uv chlorine process is unknown the role of rcs contributing to cbd s removal is poorly understood the objectives of this work are to investigate the kinetics and mechanisms during cbds degradation by uv chlorine treatment eight cbds were investigated in this study including five tcbds two pcbds and hcbd firstly the degradation behaviors of the selected cbds in uv chlorine treatment were evaluated and also compared with those in uv irradiation and chlorination alone secondly roles of the reactive species on cbds degradation were examined through experiments with quenchers or varying ph values thirdly the transformation products were identified and a transformation pathway was proposed finally the effects of water matrix and degradation efficiency in natural water samples were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals five tcbds 1 1 2 3 e 1 1 2 4 z 1 1 3 4 1 1 4 4 and z z 1 2 3 4 and two pcbds z 1 1 2 3 4 and 1 1 2 4 4 96 100 mg l 1 in methanol were obtained from neochema gmbh co kg bodenheim germany hcbd

society srnom stock solution was prepared by dissolving srnom into ultrapure water and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane a natural water sample was collected from the beijiang river bjr in guangdong province of china it was filtered with 0 45 μm membrane filters and stored at 4 c and no detectable cbds were found in this water the other chemicals used in this work were provided in text s1 2 2 experimental procedures the setup of the uv irradiation apparatus is shown in fig s1 one 10 w low pressure mercury lamp was applied to provide monochromatic uv irradiation at 253 7 nm the uv fluence rate was determined to be 2 10 8 e s 1 via iodide iodate chemical actinometry rahn et al 2010 and the corresponding average uv254nm fluence rate was calculated to be 0 21 mw cm 2 uv light was vertically directed downward to a cylindrical quartz reactor 7 5 cm diameter 0 5 cm high volume 22 ml the reactor contained a port 1 5 cm in diameter for sampling and a grinding stopper for prevention of evaporation the solution containing 10 μg l 1 cbds and 5 mm phosphate buffer was firstly mixed for uv chlorine tests a baseline chlorine dose of 10 mg l 1 was spiked into the solutions and the uv irradiation was started simultaneously after a determined reaction time 0 10 min 10 ml solution was collected and quenched with 0 21 mm sodium sulfite then the samples were extracted by hexane with 1 2 dichlorobenzene 50 μg l 1 used as a surrogate standard and the recovery rate 95 after extraction the extract was subjected to analysis on a gas chromatograph the residual chlorine was analyzed by using separate tests quenching experiments were conducted by adding different quenchers e g tert butanol tba bicarbonate ions separately to the solutions before spiking chlorine solutions were buffered at ph 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 by 5 mm phosphate buffer the effects of the water matrix components were studied by spiking certain concentrations of nahco3 nom and nabr the control tests with chlorination alone or uv irradiation alone were performed following the same method as described above to identify the transformation products during cbds degradation the initial concentration of cbds was increased to 5 mg l 1 and the chlorine dosage was accordingly increased to 1 g l 1 2 3 calculation for the contribution of reactive species the degradation of cbds during uv chlorine treatment included contribution from direct uv photolysis along with oxidation by free chlorine ho and rcs thus the degradation of cbds can be expressed as 7 k obs cbds k uv cbds k cl 2 cbds k ho cbds k rcs cbds where k obs cbds represents the pseudo first order decay rate constant of cbds under uv chlorine treatment k uv cbds represents the contribution from direct uv photolysis k cl 2 cbds k ho cbds and k rcs cbds represent the contributions from oxidation by free chlorine ho and rcs respectively k uv cbds used the pseudo first order decay rate constant of cbds under uv irradiation alone directly because the absorbance of the added chlorine was less than 3 of the total absorbance after adding chlorine to the solutions k cl 2 cbds was 0 s 1 as free chlorine hardly reacted with cbds fig 1 k ho cbds was obtained by eq 8 8 k ho cbds k ho cbds ho ss where k ho cbds are the secondary order reaction rate constants of ho with cbds and the values are listed in table 1 lee et al 2016 ho ss represents the steady state concentrations of ho which was analyzed by using nitrobenzene nb 0 2 μm as a probe compound with details provided in text s2 then k rcs cbds can be calculated by subtracting k uv cbds k cl 2 cbds and k ho cbds from the observed degradation rates k obs cbds using eq 9 9 k rcs cbds k obs cbds k uv cbds k cl 2 cbds k ho cbds the second order rate constants for the reactions of clo with cbds were determined based on competition kinetics using caffeine and carbamazepine as reference compounds with details shown in text s3 2 4 analytical methods cbds and 1 2 dichlorobenzene were detected on a gas chromatogaph 7890a agilent technologies photoisomers and intermediates of cbds degradation were examined by gas chromatograph mass spectrometer trace 1300 thermo fisher organic acid was determined by ion chromatograph ics 600 thermo scientific details about these analytical methods were described in text s1 chlorine concentrations were analyzed through the diethyl p phenylene diamine dpd ferrous titration apha awwa wef 2012 quantum chemical calculations were conducted by the gaussian 09 program package frisch et al 2009 the geometry optimizations and harmonic frequency calculations for the reactants including cbds and clo were performed at the m06 2x 6 311g d level with the smd continuum solvation model frisch et al 1984 ribeiro et al 2011 su 2014 the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest occupied molecular orbital lumo of each cbd were generated and displayed by multiwfn software version 3 7 lu and chen 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of cbds degradation the time dependent abatement of cbds by chlorination alone uv photolysis alone and uv chlorine process is shown in fig 1 the removal efficiency of cbds in chlorination alone was quite low 10 uv irradiation was effective to reduce cbds and about 45 2 90 8 of cbds were degraded after 10 min uv irradiation 128 2 mj cm 2 their degradation kinetics followed the first order kinetics with the degradation rate constants listed in table 1 z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd had the highest degradation rate constant 10 52 0 12 10 3 s 1 followed by e 1 1 2 4 tcbd 4 59 0 31 10 3 s 1 and z 1 1 3 4 tcbd 4 36 0 18 10 3 s 1 whereas 1 1 2 3 tcbd and 1 1 4 4 tcbd had much lower degradation rates at 1 15 0 01 10 3 s 1 and 1 32 0 25 10 3 s 1 respectively based on the molar absorption coefficients of cbds ε 254 nm determined by lee s group lee et al 2016 the quantum yields of cbds φ254nm were calculated and provided in table 1 details in text s5 bolton and stefan 2002 canonica et al 2008 for z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd the φ254nm were 0 62 0 007 while for 1 1 2 3 tcbd and 1 1 4 4 tcbd the φ254nm were 0 18 0 002 and 0 04 0 007 respectively the values were in good consistence with previously reported ones lee et al 2016 in comparison with uv treatment alone the addition of free chlorine 10 mg l 1 to uv irradiation led to the increase of the first order rate constants k obs by 1 03 0 05 3 48 0 14 10 3 s 1 for tcbds with the exception of z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd 0 63 0 14 10 3 s 1 0 68 0 13 0 71 0 03 10 3 s 1 for pcbds and 0 07 0 03 10 3 s 1 for hcbd respectively e 1 1 3 4 tcbd was mostly enhanced by the increase of 3 48 0 14 10 3 s 1 in k obs this clearly indicates that the degradation enhancement of adding free chlorine to uv irradiation is closely related to the number of chlorine substituents for cbds following the order of tcbds pcbds hcbd with the exception of z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd exhibiting similar increases as pcbds the results suggest that the chlorine substituents numbers can influence the interactions between cbds and reactive oxidant species in uv chlorine treatment a separate study using uv h2o2 treatment was also compared at a h2o2 dose of 140 μm the removal efficiency of 1 1 4 4 tcbd was about 37 6 less than that in uv chlorine treatment at chlorine dose of 140 μm fig s5 this was attributed to the lower quantum yield of h2o2 photolysis under uv irradiation than that of hocl clo herrmann 2007 watts and linden 2007 besides rcs may also contribute to the degradation of cbds in uv chlorine process the roles of ho and rcs were explored further in the next part 3 2 the role of reactive species 3 2 1 the contribution of reactive species the contributions of reactive species to eight cbds degradation were summarized in fig 2 a free chlorine contributed little to cbds degradation uv irradiation contributed 32 8 97 6 to the degradation of cbds with hcbd 97 6 and z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd 93 0 having the highest contribution this can be due to the high φ254nm of hcbd 0 99 0 002 and z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd 0 60 0 016 table 1 the ho ss was measured at the level of 8 12 1 29 14 38 0 73 10 14 m by using nb as the probe compound the elimination of cbds by the contribution of ho was observed to be 2 6 14 4 ho had the highest contribution to the degradation of 1 1 4 4 tcbd 14 4 followed by 1 1 2 3 tcbd 12 6 and 1 1 2 4 4 pcbd 12 3 z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd had the fastest reaction rate constant with ho at 7 1 1 5 109 m 1s 1 and 5 2 of its degradation was attributed to ho meanwhile ho only contributed 2 6 to the degradation of hcbd due to its low reaction rate constant 0 9 0 7 109 m 1s 1 rcs contributed negligibly to the degradation of z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd 1 8 and hcbd 0 5 by contrast rcs contributed 25 1 42 3 to the degradation of the other four tcbds and 13 2 15 1 to two pcbds interestingly the contribution of rcs to cbds degradation seemed to be influenced by both the numbers and the positions of chlorine substituents in cbds for cbds with different numbers of chlorine substituents the degradation rate led by rcs for tcbds was higher than that for pcbds and hcbd based on eq 9 the k rcs cbds was 0 75 0 003 3 02 0 07 10 3 s 1 for tcbds except z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd and 0 39 0 03 0 52 0 08 10 3 s 1 for pcbds additionally for cbds with the same number of chlorine atoms the percentages of rcs contribution were also affected by the positions of chlorine atoms for example the contribution percentages by rcs for tcbds follows the order 1 1 4 4 tcbd 42 3 z 1 1 3 4 tcbd 38 5 1 1 2 3 tcbd 34 5 e 1 1 2 4 tcbd 25 1 z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd 0 5 regarding pcbds the contribution percentage by rcs was comparable for 1 1 2 4 4 pcbd 15 1 and z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd 13 2 the reasons were discussed hereafter cl cl2 and clo were the main rcs which may account for cbds degradation to clarify their roles e 1 1 2 4 tcbd was used as a representative cbd for further tests meanwhile different radical quenchers such as chloride tba and bicarbonate were used for differentiation of the contribution of rcs which has been used in previous studies cheng et al 2018 fang et al 2014 wu et al 2016 cl2 being mainly formed from the reactions of cl with cl fang et al 2014 lei et al 2019 was found to play a negligible role in the degradation of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd as the addition of 20 mm cl didn t enhance its degradation fig 2 b the addition of tba 50 mm completely inhibited the radical induced cbd degradation and the addition of bicarbonate hco3 100 mm led to only 14 7 reduction in cbd degradation fig 2 b tba quenches ho 6 108 m 1s 1 cl 3 108 m 1s 1 and clo 1 3 107 m 1s 1 wu et al 2017 hco3 reacts with ho 8 5 106 m 1s 1 cl 2 2 108 m 1s 1 and cl2 8 0 107 m 1s 1 but reacts slowly with clo 600 m 1s 1 matthew and anastasio 2006 it seemed that clo was the dominant rcs contributing to cbd degradation kong et al 2018 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2016 to make further confirmation the degradation of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd was tracked at different phs as shown in fig 3 with ph increasing from 6 0 to 8 0 the degradation of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd contributed by rcs showed an increasing trend based on previous literatures the concentrations of cl decreased with increasing ph due to the faster consumption rates of cl with ocl than hocl eq 6 and the concentrations of clo increased from ph 6 0 to 8 0 instead wu et al 2016 yin et al 2018 which was consistent with the trends of rcs contribution fig 3 b thus clo was the dominant rcs contributing to cbd s degradation 3 2 2 the reactions of clo with cbds the reaction rate constants of clo with cbds were determined and presented in table 1 the determined k clo cbds for tcbds were higher than 2 107 m 1s 1 except z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd 1 106 m 1s 1 lower reaction rate constants with clo were found for the two pcbds which were 1 31 0 12 107 m 1s 1 for z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd and 1 48 0 21 107 m 1s 1 for 1 1 2 4 4 pcbd respectively hcbd had no observable reaction with clo 1 106 m 1s 1 clearly the rate constants of cbds with clo generally followed the order of k clo tcbds except z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd k clo pcbds k clo hcbd being consistent with the results of k rcs cbds additionally the reaction rates of clo with cbds bearing the same numbers of chlorine atoms also varied for example z 1 1 3 4 tcbd reacted with clo at the highest rate constant of 4 98 0 16 107 m 1s 1 followed by 1 1 2 3 tcbd 3 08 0 51 107 m 1s 1 e 1 1 2 4 tcbd 2 22 0 77 107 m 1s 1 1 1 4 4 tcbd 2 07 0 25 107 m 1s 1 and z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd 106 m 1s 1 for the two pcbds the determined k clo 1 1 2 4 4 pcbd 1 48 0 21 106 m 1s 1 was comparable to that of k clo z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd 1 31 0 12 106 m 1s 1 it should be noted that k clo tcbds generally followed the same order as k rcs tcbds except 1 1 2 3 tcbd 0 75 0 003 10 3 s 1 that is z 1 1 3 4 tcbd 3 02 0 07 10 3 s 1 e 1 1 2 4 tcbd 1 70 0 21 10 3 s 1 1 1 4 4 tcbd 1 29 0 15 10 3 s 1 z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd 0 20 0 13 10 3 s 1 the results further supported that clo was the predominant rcs in degrading cbds in uv chlorine process it should be noted that uv irradiation not only directly degrades cbd to some photo products that are irreversible but also transforms into photoisomers that are connected each other in equilibrium and are reversible during reaction as illustrated in the later section 3 4 thus the k clo values for the cbds in the presence of photoisomers are not elementary and species specific but apparent rate constants single electron transfer set pathway was an important pathway in clo reaction with organic compounds alfassi et al 1988 guo et al 2017 li et al 2007 mertens and sonntag 1995 to help explain why cbds react with clo differently the homos of cbds were calculated to evaluate the set pathway between clo and cbds and the computed results were displayed in fig s6 the distribution of molecular orbital preferred to butadiene cc cc and chlorine atoms the electron transfer should be from the homo of cbds and to the lumo of clo the orbital energy gap between homo and lumo orbitals δe δ e e lumo clo 0 608 ev e homo cbds refers to the capacity of electron transfer and the lower orbital energy gap indicates that electron withdrawing from cbds to clo is more readily herein e homo of tcbds pcbds and hcbd were 8 213 8 678 ev 8 541 8 683 ev and 8 906 ev table s3 respectively thus the order of the orbital energy gaps of these cbds was as follows δ e clo tcbds except z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd δ e clo pcbds δ e clo hcbd an exact opposite order to the reaction rate constants of clo with cbds for further investigating the reaction between cbds and clo we calculated the natural population npa charge to determine the reaction sites and the electron donating capacity of cbds to clo as shown in table s3 the atom with the lowest npa charge potentially reflects the reaction sites of cbds note that the reaction sites of cbds vary in c1 c4 and are all the c atom of c h herein the npa charge of tcbds pcbds and hcbd were generally 0 3389 0 2038 0 2784 0 1947 0 1299 respectively the order of the npa charge of cbds also follows the opposite order of the reaction rate constants of clo with cbds it should be noted that the limitation of above theoretical analysis lies in the calculation based on the parent cbds without considering their photoisomers the elementary and specie specific rate constant of certain cbd with clo is not able to be obtained due to the consistent presence of photoisomers under uv irradiation this could also be the reason for the absence of relationship between the orbital energy gap or npa charge of parent tcbds and pcbds and their reaction rate constants with clo 3 3 effects of ph on cbds degradation 1 1 4 4 tcbd e 1 1 2 4 tcbd and z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd were selected as representative cbds to study the effects of ph on the degradation of cbds in uv chlorine treatment as shown in fig 3 a and b the k obs for 1 1 4 4 tcbd and e 1 1 2 4 tcbd degradation increased distinctly with ph increasing from 6 0 to 8 0 but decreased slightly at ph 9 0 by contrast the k obs for z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd decreased continuously with ph increasing from 6 0 to 9 0 fig 3 c this significant dependence of cbds degradation under uv chlorine process was most likely attributed to the shift in chlorine speciation from hocl toward ocl with increasing ph dodd and huang 2007 wang et al 2020 leading to the enhanced scavenging of ho and cl and the increasing yields of clo fang et al 2014 wu et al 2016 as the solution ph increased from 6 0 to 8 0 the concentration of ho decreased from 1 41 0 04 2 48 0 18 10 13 m to 2 55 0 13 3 38 0 01 10 14 m and correspondingly the degradation of 1 1 4 4 tcbd e 1 1 2 4 tcbd and z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd contributed from ho was reduced by 83 4 72 6 and 88 7 respectively by contrast the contribution of rcs k rcs cbds mainly clo to the degradation of 1 1 4 4 tcbd e 1 1 2 4 tcbd and z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd increased instead specifically from 0 27 0 01 10 3 s 1 to 2 19 0 16 10 3 s 1 from 0 to 2 54 0 17 10 3 s 1 and from 0 69 0 11 10 3 s 1 to 0 77 0 004 10 3 s 1 respectively when ph increased from 8 0 to 9 0 the rcs contributions decreased for the three cbds this was attributed to the increased concentrations of oh in the solution which consumed clo rapidly k 2 5 109 m 1s 1 guo et al 2017 kläning and wolff 1985 the different ph dependent degradation trend of z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd from 1 1 4 4 tcbd and e 1 1 2 4 tcbd was mainly due to its much lower reaction rate constants with clo 1 106 m 1s 1 thus the degradation trends was mainly governed by ho not clo 3 4 transformation products and reaction pathways 3 4 1 identification of transformation products fig 4 displays the evolution of four cbds and their photoisomers under uv irradiation and uv chlorine treatment it should be pointed out that these photoisomers were observed to have identical fragment patterns as the precursor cbds and they were just semi quantified as their standards are not commercially available as presented in fig 4 a and d one photoisomer was observed in e 1 1 2 4 tcbd and z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd solutions upon uv irradiation and uv chlorine treatment they were predicted to undergo e z and z e photoisomerization reaction upon uv irradiation in the stock solution of z 1 1 3 4 tcbd before irradiation its photoisomer e 1 1 3 4 tcbd was also observed and the relative response was about 35 of the initial z 1 1 3 4 tcbd fig 4 b for z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd two photoisomers were detected fig 4 c z z z e and z e e e photoisomerization reactions may occur under uv irradiation lee et al 2016 additionally the observed photoisomers all had lower concentrations in uv chlorine treatment than uv irradiation alone the photoisomers formed quickly upon uv irradiation and then decomposed with prolonging reaction time during uv chlorine treatment the photoisomers were further decomposed by the reactive species such as ho and rcs resulting in reduced level of photoisomers the other products from uv chlorine treatment of z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd was also explored two products at m z 209 p1 and m z 223 p2 were observed fig s7 they both contained four chlorine atoms and were assigned to be 2 3 4 4 tetrachloro 3 enol and 2 3 4 4 tetrachloro 3 enoic acid respectively it should be noted that p1 was detected in both uv and uv chlorine systems with response higher in uv irradiation alone and p2 was only detected in uv chlorine system fig s7 in addition formic acid and oxalic acid were also detected in both systems and more oxalic acid was generated in uv chlorine system fig s8 3 4 2 the proposed degradation pathways of cbds the degradation pathways of cbds in uv chlorine treatment using z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd as an example are illustrated in fig 5 uv irradiation and clo oxidation pathways were presented and ho reaction pathway was not drawn as it contributed to less than 4 0 to the degradation of z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd clo can abstract an electron from z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd to form structure i 1 and then it transferred a proton to h2o to produce a carbon centered radical i 2 i 2 had high reactivity toward dissolved oxygen k 109 m 1s 1 li et al 2004 generating a peroxyl radical i 3 this peroxyl radical may decay via self or cross termination reactions mertens and sonntag 1995 a tetroxide structure i 4 may form via self termination reactions a dioxide structure i 5 may form from the reactions of the peroxyl radical with i 2 coote 2010 smith et al 2018 the two structures can further decompose to i 6 and subsequently transfer to p2 via an unstable ketene structure i 7 in aquatic phase sonntag and schuchmann 1998 meanwhile another carbon centered radical i 8 can be generated through the homolytic cleavage of c cl bond at c4 under uv irradiation li et al 2004 mertens and sonntag 1995 this carbon centered radical can react with water to form p1 which also reacted with clo to form p2 p2 produced from the two above pathways can undergo further photodegradation oxidation and hydrolysis to generate small molecular weight acids including formic acid and oxalic acid li et al 2007 luo et al 2011 additionally the carbon centered radical i 12 formed by the homolytic cleavage of c cl bond at c3 can also react with dissolved oxygen yielding a peroxyl radical this peroxyl radical could be transferred to formic acid and oxalic acid through a series of reactions including bimolecular decaying oxidation and hydrolysis li et al 2004 mertens and sonntag 1995 3 5 effects of water matrix and degradation in natural water the effects of water matrix components including bromide alkalinity and nom were evaluated using e 1 1 2 4 tcbd as a representative cbd and the results are shown in fig 6 a hco3 co3 2 slightly inhibited e 1 1 2 4 tcbd degradation in uv chlorine treatment the k obs of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd degradation decreased from 6 78 0 02 10 3 s 1 to 6 34 0 1 10 3 s 1 with the addition of hco3 increasing from 0 to 5 mm at ph 7 0 although co3 can be generated by hco3 co3 2 reacting with ho and cl it has a less reactivity with cbds 106 m 1s 1 table 1 which accounted for the inhibition of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd degradation the presence of nom inhibited e 1 1 2 4 tcbd degradation under uv chlorine significantly fig 6 a the k obs decreased to the value similar as that of uv irradiation alone with spiking 5 mg c l 1 nom this was attributed to the radical scavenging effect by nom which was able to react with clo rapidly 4 5 104 mg l 1 1s 1 guo et al 2017 liang et al 2007 br had a slight promoting effect about 10 on the degradation of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd in uv chlorine process with the addition concentration at both 2 5 μm and 5 μm fig 6 a by adding 2 5 μm br to the chlorination alone system the k obs of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd under chlorination alone was observed to accelerate from 0 to 0 3 0 053 10 3 s 1 fig s9 the results show that hobr can react with e 1 1 2 4 tcbd as br is quickly convert to hobr by hocl 1 55 103 m 1s 1 kumar and margerum 2002 additionally br could also shift the reactive species to bromine radicals through the reaction with ho and cl and the photolysis of hobr cheng et al 2018 thus lower concentrations of ho and clo were expected with the increasing br levels which may result in decreasing contribution to cbds degradaton wu et al 2017 thus the increased degradation for e 1 1 2 4 tcbd in the presence of br may be mainly due to the enhanced contribution from hobr the degradation of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd 1 1 4 4 tcbd and z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd by uv chlorine process in beijiang river bjr water was shown in fig 6 b at a uv dose of 64 mj cm 2 and chlorine dose of 10 mg l 1 the removal efficiency of e 1 1 2 4 tcbd 1 1 4 4 tcbd and z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd was 80 0 34 4 and 69 5 respectively which was 8 7 11 9 and 7 4 higher than that under uv irradiation alone similarly as in di water the addition of free chlorine had more benefits on the degradation of tcbds than that of pcbds to achieve 80 degradation in bjr water the uv dose of 76 279 and 96 mj cm 2 was required for e 1 1 2 4 tcbd 1 1 4 4 tcbd and z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd respectively by using uv irradiation alone with the addition of 10 mg l 1 free chlorine the required uv dose can be reduced to 64 242 and 86 mj cm 2 saving 15 9 12 9 and 11 0 separately comparably for cbds degradation in di water the required uv dose to achieve 80 removal for e 1 1 2 4 tcbd 1 1 4 4 tcbd and z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd can be reduced by 47 138 and 21 respectively with the addition of 10 mg l 1 free chlorine the results indicate the potential application of uv chlorine treatment in eliminating tcbds and pcbds in real water matrix but the efficiency was much less than that in di water again uv chlorine treatment didn t enhance hbcd degradation data not shown 4 conclusions uv chlorine treatment was demonstrated to be effective for cbds elimination in this study about 71 7 97 8 cbds could be removed within 10 min with a uv dose of 128 mj cm 2 and a chlorine dose of 10 mg l 1 uv irradiation ho and rcs accounted 32 8 97 6 2 6 14 4 and 0 5 42 3 respectively for cbds removal clo was proven to be the dominant rcs which reacts with cbds except z z 1 2 3 4 tcbd and hcbd 106 m 1s 1 at 107 m 1s 1 following an order k clo t c b d s k clo pcbds k clo hcbd for cbds with a z or e configuration photoisomers could be formed and the levels would be reduced due to the further decomposition by ho and rcs during uv chlorine treatment based on the identification of the products of z 1 1 2 3 4 pcbd pathways including single electron transfer dechlorination and hydrolysis reactions were proposed for cbds abatement in uv chlorine process although different water characteristics impacted the treatment efficiency of cbds differently uv chlorine brought benefits for reduction of tcbds but to lesser extent for pcbds and virtually no benefit for hcbd similarly as in di water declaration of

17767,cyanobacterial blooms change benthic nitrogen n cycling in eutrophic lake ecosystems by affecting organic carbon oc delivery and changing in nutrients availability denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra are critical dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways that determine n removal and n recycling in aquatic environments a mechanistic understanding of the influence of algal accumulations on partitioning among these pathways is currently lacking in the present study a manipulative experiment in aquarium tanks was conducted to determine the response of dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways to changes in algal biomass and the interactive effects of oc and nitrate potential dinitrogen n2 production and dnra rates and related functional gene abundances were determined during incubation of 3 4 weeks the results indicated that high algal biomass promoted dnra but not n2 production the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon were the primary factor affecting dnra rates low nitrate availability limited n2 production rates in treatments with algal pellets and without nitrate addition meanwhile the aoaamoa gene abundance was significantly correlated with the nrfa and nirs gene abundances suggesting that coupled nitrification denitrification dnra was prevalent partitioning between n2 production and dnra was positively correlated with the ratios of dissolved organic carbon to nitrate correspondingly in lake taihu during summer to fall the relatively high organic carbon nitrate might favorably facilitate dnra over denitrification subsequently sustaining cyanobacterial blooms graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrification dnra cyanobacterial bloom nitrogen cycling organic carbon 1 introduction denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and dnra are crucial important pathways of dissimilatory nitrate reduction in aquatic ecosystems domangue and mortazavi 2018 denitrification and anammox can reduce nitrate no3 to n2 under anaerobic conditions seitzinger 1988 and are the primary means of n removal from ecosystems roland et al 2018 alternatively dnra can directly transfer no3 to ammonium nh4 rutting et al 2011 and plays a different role than denitrification and anammox by retaining more bioavailable n contributing to n recycling murphy et al 2016 yin et al 2017 knowledge of the controls of n removal and retention has important implications for understanding predicting and managing the nutrient balance of ecosystems in aquatic ecosystems oc and no3 concentrations are considered the most important factors regulating these pathways roland et al 2018 yin et al 2002 cumulatively previous studies indicate that anammox will be favored at the lowest oc loads denitrification at intermediate loads and dnra at the highest loads burgin and hamilton 2007 in addition the interactive effects between oc and no3 may significantly modify the prevalence of these pathways and many studies indicate that a high oc no3 generally favors dnra over n2 production roland et al 2018 giblin et al 2013 however there are exceptions to this pattern for example dnra exceeded in situ denitrification even in the presence of abundant water column no3 in eutrophic weeks bay domangue and mortazavi 2018 the study of dong et al 2011 indicated that no3 addition accelerated dnra more than denitrification in several tropical estuaries in the past few decades eutrophication has caused lake ecosystem degradation resulting in frequent cyanobacterial blooms and a marked degradation of aquatic vegetation zhang et al 2016 these changes in the primary producers of shallow lakes significantly affect the quantity and quality of organic matter that releases and sinks to benthos herndl and reinthaler 2013 simon et al 2002 the transformation decomposition and sinking of organic matter drives the relative processes of biogeochemical cycles and leads to the redistribution of nutrients herndl and reinthaler 2013 arístegui et al 2002 numerous studies have indicated that algal accumulations can enhance n2 production by providing a large amount of labile oc in eutrophic lakes chen et al 2016 2018 peng et al 2017 however the impact of algal accumulations on dnra remains unclear aquatic ecosystems will show an increasing propensity for n limitation due to the persistence of cyanobacterial blooms paerl et al 2015 gardner et al 2017 the experiments of zhu et al 2020 indicated that increased algal accumulations were associated with decreased sediment denitrification due to a break in coupled nitrification denitrification algal accumulations drive the increase in labile oc and decrease in no3 availability and may provide favorable conditions for dnra over n2 production in eutrophic lakes cyanobacterial blooms persist in lake taihu during summer and autumn shi et al 2018 tang et al 2009 dense algal accumulations have been frequently observed in the downwind northwestern region during the algal bloom periods qin et al 2010 there are wide variations in the algal biomass nutrient and particulate organic carbon poc concentrations in northern lake taihu and the lake provides an ideal environment for investigating the influences of algal accumulations on partitioning n2 production and dnra in the present study we undertook a manipulative experiment to address these uncertainties in controls of partitioning based on annual observations in northern lake taihu we incubated sediment thin discs in large volumn aquaria for 3 4 weeks slurry incubations incorporating the 15n isotope tracing technique were conducted periodically to measure potential n2 production and dnra rates meanwhile the abundance of functional genes of nitrification denitrification and dnra enzymes were determined this study provides insights into the influence of environmental conditions derived from cyanobacterial blooms on the partitioning between n2 production and dnra 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection lake taihu located in jiangsu province in eastern china is the third largest freshwater lake in china qin et al

sealed subsequently preincubation was conducted at 25 c on a shaker table 200 rpm for 24 h to eliminate residual no3 and oxygen after preincubation 1 ml of a na15no3 99 atom solution was injected into

the differences between group means at the 95 confidence interval p 0 05 3 results 3 1 dynamics of the physicochemical parameters in water and sediment the addition of algal pellets and no3 influenced the physicochemical parameters in aquarium tanks table 1 the do concentrations significantly decreased with the increase in added algal pellets p 0 05 the decomposition of algal pellets increased oxygen consumption as expected intensifying the effects of algal pellets addition the addition of algal pellets did not significantly change the other physicochemical parameters of table 1 p 0 05 the values of do ph ec and loi presented a downward trend with the addition of no3 but the differences were not significant p 0 05 3 2 the variation in nutrient concentrations the large amount of doc and nh4 were released into water column with the addition of algal pellets fig 2 the doc and nh4 concentrations in the c1 n c2 n and c3 n treatments were significantly higher than the value in the c n treatment p 0 05 the doc concentration presented a downward trend during the incubation in the c n treatment and was different from other treatments the nh4 concentrations in aquarium tanks generally presented an increasing at first days and then decreasing trend in experiment one unlike doc and nh4 the addition of algal pellets did not result in the increase of no3 concentration the no3 concentrations were low and stable in treatments c2 n and c3 n during the incubation instead the no3 concentrations increased by the 2nd and 12th day in c n and c1 n treatments respectively overall the nutrient concentrations presented a downward trend during the incubation with the addition of no3 contrary to the trend of experiment one the doc concentrations gradually decreased in treatment c n and fluctuated in treatment c2 n in treatment c n initial increase in the nh4 concentration was followed by a gradual decrease over the next few days and then remained stable meanwhile no3 concentration gradually decreased during the incubation in treatment c2 n the nh4 concentration slowly increased and peak occurred on the 8th day in the next 16 days the nh4 concentration decreased dramatically and then gradually stabilized correspondingly the no3 concentration dramatically decreased in the first 10 days and then briefly increased with the decrease in nh4 subsequently the no3 concentration gradually decreased 3 3 potential dnra and n2 production rates the addition of algal pellets significantly influenced the potential dnra rates but n2 production rates were not fig 3 a and b it was clear that the potential dnra rates increased as the amount of added algal pellets increased the mean values of dnra rates in treatments c1 n c2 n and c3 n were approximately 1 5 2 2 and 2 7 times greater than the mean value of treatment c n respectively however the addition of algal pellets did not change significantly the magnitude of n2 production compared to treatments with only algal pellets the potential dnra and n2 production rates were changed when no3 and algal pellets were added together fig 4 a and b the potential dnra rates in treatments c2 n were significantly lower than those in treatment c2 n although the difference was not significant between treatment c2 n and c2 n in the first 6 days the highest n2 production rates were encountered in treatment c2 n after day 6 3 4 abundance of functional genes the response of functional genes to the addition of algal pellets was more subdued than the response of potential dissimilatory nitrate reduction rates fig 3c and d the abundance of the nrfa gene in treatment c3 n was significantly higher than the abundance in treatment c n and c1 n the significant difference was mainly attributed to the increase in treatment c3 n occurred on the 18th day the abundance of nirs exceeded the abundance of nirk by at least one order of magnitude suggesting that bacterial nirs was dominant in the present study there were no significant differences in the abundance of nirs gene among all treatments the response of functional genes to no3 addition were different form the response to the addition of algal pellets the influence of no3 addition were not significant for abundances of nrfa gene the nirs gene abundances were significant higher in treatments with no3 addition than in treatments without no3 addition during the incubation fig 4c and d 4 discussion 4 1 the influence of algal accumulations on n2 production and dnra natural particulate organic matter pom plays a key role in regulating ecosystem structure and functions newcomer et al 2012 the decomposition and sinking of pom derived from algal accumulations drives the relative processes of biogeochemical cycles which are also expected to impact key pathways in n cycling such as n2 production and dnra in experiment one algal pellets were exhausted during the first six days in all treatments correspondingly the doc and nh4 levels significantly increased with addition of algal pellets however there were no significant differences in the organic matter content of sediments among all treatments these results indicated that algae derived pom released a large amount of dissolved nutrients into the water column in most heterotrophic bacteria organic substrates are directly utilized in the dissolved form through transmembrane transport zeng et al 2019 many studies have suggested that denitrification or dnra is associated with doc concentrations newcomer et al 2012 weyhenmeyer and jeppesen 2010 li et al 2019 thus doc was assumed to be the primary carbon source for dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways in our systems in experiment one potential dnra rates were significantly correlated with doc and nh4 concentrations but n2 production rates were not table 2 similarly it was found that the addition of natural organic matter such as chlorella vulgaris and juncus stimulated dnra more than n2 production rahman et al 2019 brin et al 2015 hardison et al 2015 the fermentation is the main pathway of dnra which can be favored under high organic matter conditions rahman et al 2019 meanwhile dnra is promoted over denitrification and anammox in high oc environments brin et al 2015 tiedje et al 1982 hardison et al 2015 thought that high oc loading is a prerequisite for dnra to be favored over n2 production however these phenomena were not corroborated with variations in functional gene in our systems table 2 the abundances of nrfa gene were not correlated with potential dnra rates in the present study the influence of environmental factors may be greater than that of microbial abundances which is consistence with the statement that the environmental conditions that govern the end products of bacterial nitrate respiration kraft et al 2014 it is worth noting that an increasing trend of nrfa gene with increasing algal pellets was found in the last sampling this result perhaps indicated that there was a delay in which the addition of algal pellets first promoted dnra activity and then changed the dnra bacterial abundance in the systems the nitrite reductase nrfa catalyzes nitrite reduction to ammonium is encoded by the nrfa gene in a broad phylogeny of bacteria welsh et al 2014 cannon et al 2019 the early pcr primers were designed that were based on a limited set of genomic sequences mohan et al 2004 smith et al 2007 especially little is known about the key enzymes catalyzing chemolithotrophic dnra welsh et al 2014 the biogeochemical importance of nitrate use by sulfur oxidizing bacteria was recognized in recent research about freshwater lakes pang and ji 2019 in the present study the contribution of some chemolithotrophic microorganisms to dnra may have been overlooked due to the limitation of selected primer in addition few bacteria might present higher gene expression of nitrite reductase which may be another reason that resulting in inconsistent between activities and abundances of dnra bactiria therefore future works are required to identify the genes involved in the chemolithoautotrophic dnra pathway and quantify gene transcripts 4 2 the limitation of no3 availability for n2 production it was puzzling that n2 production rates and gene abundances for denitrification did not significantly change across treatments in experiment one although we expected addition of algal pellets at this level to stimulate denitrification the study of hardison et al 2015 indicated that n2 production may be more dependent on no3 availability than dnra the initial concentration of no3 in aquarium tanks without no3 addition was low as the experiment continued there was a strong increase in no3 in treatment c n during the incubation meanwhile n2 production rates and doc concentrations presented a downward trend in treatment c n figs 2 and 3 the consistent no3 production with doc consumption suggested that nitrate reduction was limited by the absence of any new oc inputs however the no3 concentrations in treatments with c2 n and c3 n were stable no3 availability in these treatments might have been more important than oc availability in limiting n2 production this explanation was validated in the treatment with no3 addition n2 production rates in the c2 n treatment were highest among all treatments after day 6 of incubation fig 4b in addition low no3 concentrations indicated that both n2 production and dnra were strongly reliant on nitrification for no3 supply our results showed that the aoaamoa gene abundance was significantly correlated with the nrfa and nirs gene abundances in experiment one table 2 meanwhile the aoaamoa gene abundance was positively correlated with doc and nh4 concentrations mineralization and nitrification rates will be fuelled by organic matter addition peng et al 2017 nitrifiers are generally microaerophilic and grow and oxidize nh4 under low do concentrations kalvelage et al 2011 nitrification was promoted by the decomposition of algal pellets and not limited by low do concentrations in our systems n2 production rates did not change across treatments despite increases in the functional gene abundance of nitrifiers with addition of algal pellets a possible further explanation for this result is the presence of dnra and the cycling of n between nitrification and dnra the biomass yield of the dnra culture was higher than that of the denitrification culture per mole no3 and dnra bacteria have a higher affinity for no3 than the denitrifying bacteria under no3 limitation van den berg et al 2015 low no3 concentrations maintain the competitive advantage of dnra against denitrification thereby resulting in internal n cycling between nitrification and dnra this relationship had also been shown in a study of sydney rock oyster farming in which much of the dnra was fuelled by no3 derived from nitrification erler et al 2017 4 3 the ratios of doc to no3 drive the partitioning between n2 production and dnra in the present study we tested whether algae derived oc concentrations no3 availability or the ratio of the two were related to partitioning between n2 production and dnra tiedje et al 1982 hypothesized that dnra is favored over denitrification in environments with a high ratio of electron donors to electron acceptor our results demonstrated the importance of the doc no3 ratio as a factor influencing partitioning between dnra and n2 production as shown in fig 5 and supported tiedje et al s original hypothesis this result indicates a direct physiological mechanism influencing partitioning is that dnra is energetically favored over denitrification 597 versus 559 kj mol 1 no3 at 30 c under high oc no3 conditions algar and vallino 2014 it is worth noting that the doc concentration was the primary factor affecting the partitioning rather than the doc no3 ratio in treatments without no3 addition this relationship can be understood from two aspects on the one hand the addition of algal pellets provided a large amount of liable oc enabling dnra to be favored over n2 production and on the other hand algal accumulations promote the coupled nitrification dnra the nitrate availability included no3 in the water column and no3 derived from mineralization and nitrification the export of particulate and dissolved organic matter is the ultimate source of the required no3 in systems with severe n deficits thus it is not enough to estimate no3 availability by measuring no3 concentrations only in the water column especially when coupled nitrification denitrification dnra is prevalent few studies have experimentally demonstrated or quantified a relationship between dnra and the oc no3 ratio domangue and mortazavi 2018 algar and vallino 2014 porubsky et al 2009 domangue and mortazavi 2018 found that a c n ratio of 12 21 favored dnra over denitrification in weeks bay while the study of algar and vallino 2014 found that dnra exceeded n2 production at c n ratios of approximately 3 these ratios were much lower than in the present study the presence of sulfides in weeks bay sediments most likely limited nitrification and denitrification and was also an important factor that affected dnra domangue and mortazavi 2018 a modeling study by algar and vallino 2014 was used to predict microbial nitrate reduction pathways the differences in experimental approaches may explain the difference in results our result is similar to the study of porubsky et al 2009 who found c n ratios between approximately 50 and 200 favored dnra over denitrification in two tidal creek bank sites in georgia and south carolina usa 4 4 environmental implications of dnra in eutrophic lakes cyanobacterial blooms are major challenges for eutrophic lake management worldwide yan et al 2017 moe et al 2016 cyanobacterial blooms change benthic n cycling in shallow lake ecosystems either through the effects of particulate or dissolved organic matter delivery chen et al 2018 or through effects mediated by changes in nutrient availability wu et al 2019 in the north of lake taihu there was a significant correlation between poc and chl a concentrations fig s5 cyanobacterial blooms introduced substantial amounts of organic matter into the water column in summer and autumn shi et al 2018 correspondingly maximum no3 values occurred in winter and spring whereas minimum values were observed in summer and autumn when the extent and nutrient demands of blooms were highest the lake shifted from low doc no3 ratios in winter spring to high doc no3 ratios in algae dominated summer and fall months fig 6 the ratios of doc no3 ranged from 9 4 to 205 4 in the present experiment and represented the spectrum of the doc no3 ratios in lake taihu from the low end in winter spring to the high and extreme end in summer fall in lake taihu ambient no3 concentrations are very high and meet algal growth requirements during winter to spring as blooms mature and persist through summer into fall high oc loads and n limitation tend to become more commonplace jiang et al 2019 gardner et al 2017 the recurrence and persistence of cyanobacterial blooms drive high c n and facilitate dnra over n2 production in addition there were close relationships between wt and dissimilatory nitrate reduction rates a previous study indicated that dnra dominates under higher temperatures bu et al 2017 dnra may play a more important role in the stage of bloom maintenance than in the stage of algal growth in bloom maintenance periods dnra retains n for recycling and sustains cyanobacterial blooms by competing with denitrification and anammox many studies have indicated that the internal n cycling of previously loaded nutrients must be sustains blooms paerl et al 2015 mccarthy et al 2007 there is positive feedback between cyanobacterial blooms and dnra which perhaps it is an important self maintainer of blooms the study of dnra has important implications for understanding how lake ecosystems respond to elevated eutrophication however it is worth noting that other factors such as dissolved oxygen sulfide concentrations and perhaps even fe2 availability are known to affect dissimilatory nitrate reduction processes in the field burgin and hamilton 2007 many of these factors often covary in the field compared to experimental systems it is difficult to attribute the influence of a single factor as a driver of n2 production and dnra thus more studies in the field are required to provide the information on the interactive relationship between cyanobacterial blooms and dissimilatory nitrate reduction in eutrophic lakes 5 conclusions in the present study we investigated the influence of algal accumulations on dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways and examined the role of algae derived oc to no3 ratios on the partitioning between n2 production and dnra the results indicated that the addition of algal pellets promoted dnra rates but not n2 production a high concentration of oc was a prerequisite for dnra to be favored over n2 production while n2 production was more dependent than dnra on no3 levels partitioning between n2 production and dnra was positively correlated with the ratios of doc to no3 lake taihu shifted from low doc no3 ratios in winter spring to high doc no3 ratios in summer and fall with the persistence of cyanobacterial blooms this may have led to a disproportionate increase in internal n recycling compared to n removal during serious bloom periods declaration of competing interest the

17767,cyanobacterial blooms change benthic nitrogen n cycling in eutrophic lake ecosystems by affecting organic carbon oc delivery and changing in nutrients availability denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra are critical dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways that determine n removal and n recycling in aquatic environments a mechanistic understanding of the influence of algal accumulations on partitioning among these pathways is currently lacking in the present study a manipulative experiment in aquarium tanks was conducted to determine the response of dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways to changes in algal biomass and the interactive effects of oc and nitrate potential dinitrogen n2 production and dnra rates and related functional gene abundances were determined during incubation of 3 4 weeks the results indicated that high algal biomass promoted dnra but not n2 production the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon were the primary factor affecting dnra rates low nitrate availability limited n2 production rates in treatments with algal pellets and without nitrate addition meanwhile the aoaamoa gene abundance was significantly correlated with the nrfa and nirs gene abundances suggesting that coupled nitrification denitrification dnra was prevalent partitioning between n2 production and dnra was positively correlated with the ratios of dissolved organic carbon to nitrate correspondingly in lake taihu during summer to fall the relatively high organic carbon nitrate might favorably facilitate dnra over denitrification subsequently sustaining cyanobacterial blooms graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrification dnra cyanobacterial bloom nitrogen cycling organic carbon 1 introduction denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and dnra are crucial important pathways of dissimilatory nitrate reduction in aquatic ecosystems domangue and mortazavi 2018 denitrification and anammox can reduce nitrate no3 to n2 under anaerobic conditions seitzinger 1988 and are the primary means of n removal from ecosystems roland et al 2018 alternatively dnra can directly transfer no3 to ammonium nh4 rutting et al 2011 and plays a different role than denitrification and anammox by retaining more bioavailable n contributing to n recycling murphy et al 2016 yin et al 2017 knowledge of the controls of n removal and retention has important implications for understanding predicting and managing the nutrient balance of ecosystems in aquatic ecosystems oc and no3 concentrations are considered the most important factors regulating these pathways roland et al 2018 yin et al 2002 cumulatively previous studies indicate that anammox will be favored at the lowest oc loads denitrification at intermediate loads and dnra at the highest loads burgin and hamilton 2007 in addition the interactive effects between oc and no3 may significantly modify the prevalence of these pathways and many studies indicate that a high oc no3 generally favors dnra over n2 production roland et al 2018 giblin et al 2013 however there are exceptions to this pattern for example dnra exceeded in situ denitrification even in the presence of abundant water column no3 in eutrophic weeks bay domangue and mortazavi 2018 the study of dong et al 2011 indicated that no3 addition accelerated dnra more than denitrification in several tropical estuaries in the past few decades eutrophication has caused lake ecosystem degradation resulting in frequent cyanobacterial blooms and a marked degradation of aquatic vegetation zhang et al 2016 these changes in the primary producers of shallow lakes significantly affect the quantity and quality of organic matter that releases and sinks to benthos herndl and reinthaler 2013 simon et al 2002 the transformation decomposition and sinking of organic matter drives the relative processes of biogeochemical cycles and leads to the redistribution of nutrients herndl and reinthaler 2013 arístegui et al 2002 numerous studies have indicated that algal accumulations can enhance n2 production by providing a large amount of labile oc in eutrophic lakes chen et al 2016 2018 peng et al 2017 however the impact of algal accumulations on dnra remains unclear aquatic ecosystems will show an increasing propensity for n limitation due to the persistence of cyanobacterial blooms paerl et al 2015 gardner et al 2017 the experiments of zhu et al 2020 indicated that increased algal accumulations were associated with decreased sediment denitrification due to a break in coupled nitrification denitrification algal accumulations drive the increase in labile oc and decrease in no3 availability and may provide favorable conditions for dnra over n2 production in eutrophic lakes cyanobacterial blooms persist in lake taihu during summer and autumn shi et al 2018 tang et al 2009 dense algal accumulations have been frequently observed in the downwind northwestern region during the algal bloom periods qin et al 2010 there are wide variations in the algal biomass nutrient and particulate organic carbon poc concentrations in northern lake taihu and the lake provides an ideal environment for investigating the influences of algal accumulations on partitioning n2 production and dnra in the present study we undertook a manipulative experiment to address these uncertainties in controls of partitioning based on annual observations in northern lake taihu we incubated sediment thin discs in large volumn aquaria for 3 4 weeks slurry incubations incorporating the 15n isotope tracing technique were conducted periodically to measure potential n2 production and dnra rates meanwhile the abundance of functional genes of nitrification denitrification and dnra enzymes were determined this study provides insights into the influence of environmental conditions derived from cyanobacterial blooms on the partitioning between n2 production and dnra 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection lake taihu located in jiangsu province in eastern china is the third largest freshwater lake in china qin et al

an acrylic tube into the sediment with minimal disturbance the lake water was collected in several 50 l plastic barrels algal bloom samples were harvested by sieving surface water from the lake through a fine mesh plankton net 64 μm 2 2 experimental setup the experiments with thin disc approach were conducted to examine the influence of algal accumulations on partitioning between dnra and n2 production fig 1 the top 3 cm of sediment cores were mixed well and spread carefully into thin discs 0 3 cm height 9 cm diameter discs were carefully placed into aquarium tanks 30 cm width 45 cm

pellets and no3 as kno3 before the addition algal samples were rinsed with deionized water to remove possible nutrients and debris and then were freeze dried and simply grinded resulting in algal pellets 51 c 10 n according to the monitoring statistics of poc and no3 concentrations in the north of lake taihu throughout the year fig s2 the experiments one and two were designed in experiment one

sealed subsequently preincubation was conducted at 25 c on a shaker table 200 rpm for 24 h to eliminate residual no3 and oxygen after preincubation 1 ml of a na15no3 99 atom solution was injected into each vial to give a final concentration of 100 μmol l 1 six of the vials were randomly selected and immediately preserved with the addition of 200 μl zncl2 as the initial samples for the measurement of n2 production and dnra rates the remaining vials were incubated under the same conditions for 2 h 4 h 6 h and 8 h and then sacrificed to measure the production of 29n2 30n2 and 15nh4 in the vials the fraction of 15n in the no3 pool was approximately 95 99 throughout the experiments so 29n2 and 30n2 production were nearly equivalent to the anammox and denitrification rates dissolved 29n2 and

the differences between group means at the 95 confidence interval p 0 05 3 results 3 1 dynamics of the physicochemical parameters in water and sediment the addition of algal pellets and no3 influenced the physicochemical parameters in aquarium tanks table 1 the do concentrations significantly decreased with the increase in added algal pellets p 0 05 the decomposition of algal pellets increased oxygen consumption as expected intensifying the effects of algal pellets addition the addition of algal pellets did not significantly change the other physicochemical parameters of table 1 p 0 05 the values of do ph ec and loi presented a downward trend with the addition of no3 but the differences were not significant p 0 05 3 2 the variation in nutrient concentrations the large amount of doc and nh4 were released into water column with the addition of algal pellets fig 2 the doc and nh4 concentrations in the c1 n c2 n and c3 n treatments were significantly higher than the value in the c n treatment p 0 05 the doc concentration presented a downward trend during the incubation in the c n treatment and was different from other treatments the nh4 concentrations in aquarium tanks generally presented an increasing at first days and then decreasing trend in experiment one unlike doc and nh4 the addition of algal pellets did not result in the increase of no3 concentration the no3 concentrations were low and stable in treatments c2 n and c3 n during the incubation instead the no3 concentrations increased by the 2nd and 12th day in c n and c1 n treatments respectively overall the nutrient concentrations presented a downward trend during the incubation with the addition of no3 contrary to the trend of experiment one the doc concentrations gradually decreased in treatment c n and fluctuated in treatment c2 n in treatment c n initial increase in the nh4 concentration was followed by a gradual decrease over the next few days and then remained stable meanwhile no3 concentration gradually decreased during the incubation in treatment c2 n the nh4 concentration slowly increased and peak occurred on the 8th day in the next 16 days the nh4 concentration decreased dramatically and then gradually stabilized correspondingly the no3 concentration dramatically decreased in the first 10 days and then briefly increased with the decrease in nh4 subsequently the no3 concentration gradually decreased 3 3 potential dnra and n2 production rates the addition of algal pellets significantly influenced the potential dnra rates but n2 production rates were not fig 3 a and b it was clear that the potential dnra rates increased as the amount of added algal pellets increased the mean values of dnra rates in treatments c1 n c2 n and c3 n were approximately 1 5 2 2 and 2 7 times greater than the mean value of treatment c n respectively however the addition of algal pellets did not change significantly the magnitude of n2 production compared to treatments with only algal pellets the potential dnra and n2 production rates were changed when no3 and algal pellets were added together fig 4 a and b the potential dnra rates in treatments c2 n were significantly lower than those in treatment c2 n although the difference was not significant between treatment c2 n and c2 n in the first 6 days the highest n2 production rates were encountered in treatment c2 n after day 6 3 4 abundance of functional genes the response of functional genes to the addition of algal pellets was more subdued than the response of potential dissimilatory nitrate reduction rates fig 3c and d the abundance of the nrfa gene in treatment c3 n was significantly higher than the abundance in treatment c n and c1 n the significant difference was mainly attributed to the increase in treatment c3 n occurred on the 18th day the abundance of nirs exceeded the abundance of nirk by at least one order of magnitude suggesting that bacterial nirs was dominant in the present study there were no significant differences in the abundance of nirs gene among all treatments the response of functional genes to no3 addition were different form the response to the addition of algal pellets the influence of no3 addition were not significant for abundances of nrfa gene the nirs gene abundances were significant higher in treatments with no3 addition than in treatments without no3 addition during the incubation fig 4c and d 4 discussion 4 1 the influence of algal accumulations on n2 production and dnra natural particulate organic matter pom plays a key role in regulating ecosystem structure and functions newcomer et al 2012 the decomposition and sinking of pom derived from algal accumulations drives the relative processes of biogeochemical cycles which are also expected to impact key pathways in n cycling such as n2 production and dnra in experiment one algal pellets were exhausted during the first six days in all treatments correspondingly the doc and nh4 levels significantly increased with addition of algal pellets however there were no significant differences in the organic matter content of sediments among all treatments these results indicated that algae derived pom released a large amount of dissolved nutrients into the water column in most heterotrophic bacteria organic substrates are directly utilized in the dissolved form through transmembrane transport zeng et al 2019 many studies have suggested that denitrification or dnra is associated with doc concentrations newcomer et al 2012 weyhenmeyer and jeppesen 2010 li et al 2019 thus doc was assumed to be the primary carbon source for dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways in our systems in experiment one potential dnra rates were significantly correlated with doc and nh4 concentrations but n2 production rates were not table 2 similarly it was found that the addition of natural organic matter such as chlorella vulgaris and juncus stimulated dnra more than n2 production rahman et al 2019 brin et al 2015 hardison et al 2015 the fermentation is the main pathway of dnra which can be favored under high organic matter conditions rahman et al 2019 meanwhile dnra is promoted over denitrification and anammox in high oc environments brin et al 2015 tiedje et al 1982 hardison et al 2015 thought that high oc loading is a prerequisite for dnra to be favored over n2 production however these phenomena were not corroborated with variations in functional gene in our systems table 2 the abundances of nrfa gene were not correlated with potential dnra rates in the present study the influence of environmental factors may be greater than that of microbial abundances which is consistence with the statement that the environmental conditions that govern the end products of bacterial nitrate respiration kraft et al 2014 it is worth noting that an increasing trend of nrfa gene with increasing algal pellets was found in the last sampling this result perhaps indicated that there was a delay in which the addition of algal pellets first promoted dnra activity and then changed the dnra bacterial abundance in the systems the nitrite reductase nrfa catalyzes nitrite reduction to ammonium is encoded by the nrfa gene in a broad phylogeny of bacteria welsh et al 2014 cannon et al 2019 the early pcr primers were designed that were based on a limited set of genomic sequences mohan et al 2004 smith et al 2007 especially little is known about the key enzymes catalyzing chemolithotrophic dnra welsh et al 2014 the biogeochemical importance of nitrate use by sulfur oxidizing bacteria was recognized in recent research about freshwater lakes pang and ji 2019 in the present study the contribution of some chemolithotrophic microorganisms to dnra may have been overlooked due to the limitation of selected primer in addition few bacteria might present higher gene expression of nitrite reductase which may be another reason that resulting in inconsistent between activities and abundances of dnra bactiria therefore future works are required to identify the genes involved in the chemolithoautotrophic dnra pathway and quantify gene transcripts 4 2 the limitation of no3 availability for n2 production it was puzzling that n2 production rates and gene abundances for denitrification did not significantly change across treatments in experiment one although we expected addition of algal pellets at this level to stimulate denitrification the study of hardison et al 2015 indicated that n2 production may be more dependent on no3 availability than dnra the initial concentration of no3 in aquarium tanks without no3 addition was low as the experiment continued there was a strong increase in no3 in treatment c n during the incubation meanwhile n2 production rates and doc concentrations presented a downward trend in treatment c n figs 2 and 3 the consistent no3 production with doc consumption suggested that nitrate reduction was limited by the absence of any new oc inputs however the no3 concentrations in treatments with c2 n and c3 n were stable no3 availability in these treatments might have been more important than oc availability in limiting n2 production this explanation was validated in the treatment with no3 addition n2 production rates in the c2 n treatment were highest among all treatments after day 6 of incubation fig 4b in addition low no3 concentrations indicated that both n2 production and dnra were strongly reliant on nitrification for no3 supply our results showed that the aoaamoa gene abundance was significantly correlated with the nrfa and nirs gene abundances in experiment one table 2 meanwhile the aoaamoa gene abundance was positively correlated with doc and nh4 concentrations mineralization and nitrification rates will be fuelled by organic matter addition peng et al 2017 nitrifiers are generally microaerophilic and grow and oxidize nh4 under low do concentrations kalvelage et al 2011 nitrification was promoted by the decomposition of algal pellets and not limited by low do concentrations in our systems n2 production rates did not change across treatments despite increases in the functional gene abundance of nitrifiers with addition of algal pellets a possible further explanation for this result is the presence of dnra and the cycling of n between nitrification and dnra the biomass yield of the dnra culture was higher than that of the denitrification culture per mole no3 and dnra bacteria have a higher affinity for no3 than the denitrifying bacteria under no3 limitation van den berg et al 2015 low no3 concentrations maintain the competitive advantage of dnra against denitrification thereby resulting in internal n cycling between nitrification and dnra this relationship had also been shown in a study of sydney rock oyster farming in which much of the dnra was fuelled by no3 derived from nitrification erler et al 2017 4 3 the ratios of doc to no3 drive the partitioning between n2 production and dnra in the present study we tested whether algae derived oc concentrations no3 availability or the ratio of the two were related to partitioning between n2 production and dnra tiedje et al 1982 hypothesized that dnra is favored over denitrification in environments with a high ratio of electron donors to electron acceptor our results demonstrated the importance of the doc no3 ratio as a factor influencing partitioning between dnra and n2 production as shown in fig 5 and supported tiedje et al s original hypothesis this result indicates a direct physiological mechanism influencing partitioning is that dnra is energetically favored over denitrification 597 versus 559 kj mol 1 no3 at 30 c under high oc no3 conditions algar and vallino 2014 it is worth noting that the doc concentration was the primary factor affecting the partitioning rather than the doc no3 ratio in treatments without no3 addition this relationship can be understood from two aspects on the one hand the addition of algal pellets provided a large amount of liable oc enabling dnra to be favored over n2 production and on the other hand algal accumulations promote the coupled nitrification dnra the nitrate availability included no3 in the water column and no3 derived from mineralization and nitrification the export of particulate and dissolved organic matter is the ultimate source of the required no3 in systems with severe n deficits thus it is not enough to estimate no3 availability by measuring no3 concentrations only in the water column especially when coupled nitrification denitrification dnra is prevalent few studies have experimentally demonstrated or quantified a relationship between dnra and the oc no3 ratio domangue and mortazavi 2018 algar and vallino 2014 porubsky et al 2009 domangue and mortazavi 2018 found that a c n ratio of 12 21 favored dnra over denitrification in weeks bay while the study of algar and vallino 2014 found that dnra exceeded n2 production at c n ratios of approximately 3 these ratios were much lower than in the present study the presence of sulfides in weeks bay sediments most likely limited nitrification and denitrification and was also an important factor that affected dnra domangue and mortazavi 2018 a modeling study by algar and vallino 2014 was used to predict microbial nitrate reduction pathways the differences in experimental approaches may explain the difference in results our result is similar to the study of porubsky et al 2009 who found c n ratios between approximately 50 and 200 favored dnra over denitrification in two tidal creek bank sites in georgia and south carolina usa 4 4 environmental implications of dnra in eutrophic lakes cyanobacterial blooms are major challenges for eutrophic lake management worldwide yan et al 2017 moe et al 2016 cyanobacterial blooms change benthic n cycling in shallow lake ecosystems either through the effects of particulate or dissolved organic matter delivery chen et al 2018 or through effects mediated by changes in nutrient availability wu et al 2019 in the north of lake taihu there was a significant correlation between poc and chl a concentrations fig s5 cyanobacterial blooms introduced substantial amounts of organic matter into the water column in summer and autumn shi et al 2018 correspondingly maximum no3 values occurred in winter and spring whereas minimum values were observed in summer and autumn when the extent and nutrient demands of blooms were highest the lake shifted from low doc no3 ratios in winter spring to high doc no3 ratios in algae dominated summer and fall months fig 6 the ratios of doc no3 ranged from 9 4 to 205 4 in the present experiment and represented the spectrum of the doc no3 ratios in lake taihu from the low end in winter spring to the high and extreme end in summer fall in lake taihu ambient no3 concentrations are very high and meet algal growth requirements during winter to spring as blooms mature and persist through summer into fall high oc loads and n limitation tend to become more commonplace jiang et al 2019 gardner et al 2017 the recurrence and persistence of cyanobacterial blooms drive high c n and facilitate dnra over n2 production in addition there were close relationships between wt and dissimilatory nitrate reduction rates a previous study indicated that dnra dominates under higher temperatures bu et al 2017 dnra may play a more important role in the stage of bloom maintenance than in the stage of algal growth in bloom maintenance periods dnra retains n for recycling and sustains cyanobacterial blooms by competing with denitrification and anammox many studies have indicated that the internal n cycling of previously loaded nutrients must be sustains blooms paerl et al 2015 mccarthy et al 2007 there is positive feedback between cyanobacterial blooms and dnra which perhaps it is an important self maintainer of blooms the study of dnra has important implications for understanding how lake ecosystems respond to elevated eutrophication however it is worth noting that other factors such as dissolved oxygen sulfide concentrations and perhaps even fe2 availability are known to affect dissimilatory nitrate reduction processes in the field burgin and hamilton 2007 many of these factors often covary in the field compared to experimental systems it is difficult to attribute the influence of a single factor as a driver of n2 production and dnra thus more studies in the field are required to provide the information on the interactive relationship between cyanobacterial blooms and dissimilatory nitrate reduction in eutrophic lakes 5 conclusions in the present study we investigated the influence of algal accumulations on dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways and examined the role of algae derived oc to no3 ratios on the partitioning between n2 production and dnra the results indicated that the addition of algal pellets promoted dnra rates but not n2 production a high concentration of oc was a prerequisite for dnra to be favored over n2 production while n2 production was more dependent than dnra on no3 levels partitioning between n2 production and dnra was positively correlated with the ratios of doc to no3 lake taihu shifted from low doc no3 ratios in winter spring to high doc no3 ratios in summer and fall with the persistence of cyanobacterial blooms this may have led to a disproportionate increase in internal n recycling compared to n removal during serious bloom periods declaration of competing interest the

demand while meeting effluent requirements are gaining interest limiting the oxidation of organics during the aeration process is being welcomed as a strategy to lower aeration costs while increasing carbon harvesting as useable energy thus improving the overall carbon footprint jimenez et al 2015 meerburg et al 2015a miller 2015 this improvement is achieved through the combination of very short solids retention times srt with high sludge specific organic loading rates which increases the sorption capacity of activated sludge short srts limit the oxidation of easily oxidizable organic fractions while capturing colloidal and particulate fractions through adsorption into the microbial flocs which can then be further harvested as biogas resource jimenez et al 2015 bioflocculation or floc production due to extracellular polymeric substances eps is essential in the solids liquid separation phase during secondary settling forster 1985 liao et al 2001 nielsen et al 1996 urbain et al 1993 but it also plays a key role in determining the adsorption capacity of flocs more et al 2014 rahman et al 2016 schuler et al 2001 new strategies based on maximizing bioflocculation and its concurrent adsorption capacity in high rate activated sludge hras systems are aimed at overcoming some of the current limitations arising from short srts i e bioflocculation are being developed meerburg et al 2015b miller et al 2017 rahman et al 2016 van winckel et al 2019 a few strategies were described to enhance bioflocculation and settling and were shown to be highly dependent on the loading conditions of the system indicating that highly loaded systems at lab scale 10 kg cod m3 day can enhance bioflocculation i e settling adsorption capacity etc with an adequate f m ratio rahman et al 2017b van winckel et al 2019 on the other hand low loaded systems benefit from implementing strategic feast famine configurations van winckel et al 2019 winckel et al 2016 even if different operational strategies are required to maximize bioflocculation according to the loading conditions of the system all alternatives seem to indicate that bioflocculation is promoted by sustaining a minimum amount of eps and especially by an adequate quality of the flocs mancell egala et al 2016 sesay et al 2006 while no correlation between the eps concentration and bioflocculation has been consistently proven in literature there is evidence that eps quality and composition i e content ratio of protein to polysaccharide glycoprotein content etc is key to the formation of flocs and their adsorption capacity durmaz and sanin 2001 liao et al 2001 sesay et al 2006 yu et al 2008 adsorption enhancing strategies can alter floc composition either by adjusting critical processes i e stabilization phases promotion of feast famine regimen modification of solid retention time etc or by the addition of a selected microbial population with its intrinsic eps properties i e bioaugmentation bioaugmentation is one of the sorption enhancing strategies that is gaining interest due to its recent consideration as a cost effective method to increase process stability settling and enhance flocculation adsorption capacity and even for being able to lower the required volumes for treatment limbergen et al 1998 mikhailova et al 2014 plaza et al 2001 stenström and la cour jansen 2016 bioaugmentation refers to the addition of specialized strains mixed cultures i e nitrifying denitrifying bacteria to wastewater reactors herrero and stuckey 2015 jianlong et al 2002 limbergen et al 1998 a bioaugmentation strategy consisting of the addition of waste activated sludge returns from the nitrifying denitrifying reactors performing biological nutrient removal bnr to the upstream high rate activated sludge process hras was implemented to increase the nitrogen removal and to minimize the cost of external carbon dosing methanol for the downstream bnr process bailey et al 2007 where otherwise the short srt would be limiting nitrification improved settling and lower tss after the implementation of the bioaugmentation strategy was observed in addition to the nitrogen removal intended the improvements indicated an increase in bioflocculation suggesting an enhanced potential for adsorption van winckel et al 2019 trapping oxygen transfer inhibitors onto the floc i e surface active agents or surfactants and some of the cod fractions may have been impacting positively the overall oxygen transfer efficiency as suggested in recent literature stenström and la cour jansen 2017 stenström and la cour jansen 2016 tomczak wandzel et al 2009 contact stabilization is among these new strategies aimed to enhanced sorption meerburg et al 2016 sarioğlu et al 2004 vasquez sarria et al 2011 the feast famine conditions induced in a contact stabilization layout are recognized as strategy to regulate eps production and bioflocculation meerburg et al 2016 rahman et al 2017a the famine period during the stabilization phase is meant to induce starvation conditions for bacteria turning them into the oxidation of the more easily available adsorbed material in the floc this oxidation will free new sorption sites able to capture during feast conditions those substances associated with the reduction of oxygen transfer however the integrity and composition of the eps forming the floc is also expected to suffer from bacteria scavenging during the starvation period as under stress famine conditions bacteria can used floc structural polymeric substances as substrate meerburg et al 2016 later during the contact phase the arriving biodegradable cod is expected to be transformed into new eps adding new sorption sites to the already obtained during the stabilization phase therefore while the addition of a stabilization phase has proven to benefit biosorption is still unclear the final balance on the overall production of sorption sites the present study was designed to determine the potential to improve oxygen transfer in those cases or configurations with maximized bioflocculation adsorption e g contact stabilization anaerobic selectors while also trying to identify through a set of specific experiments the underlying mechanisms impacting oxygen transfer in wwrfs enhanced removal of oxygen transfer depressors by sorption enhancing strategies could be considered a potential venue to improve aeration efficiency and reduce the concurrent operational costs maximizing sorption in activated sludge systems might then have two relevant direct beneficial impacts on aeration 1 reduction of the overall oxygen requirements for only the oxidation of readily biodegradable organics fraction is targeted 2 maximization of the oxygen transfer efficiency as increased adsorption lowered the concentrations of mass transfer depressors i e surfactants colloids their collateral and untapped potential to maximize aeration savings should not be overlooked as supplying oxygen during the biological oxidation is recognized as the highest energy use in wastewater treatment accounting for more than 50 75 of the net power demand reardon 1995 rosso

transfer rate otr kgo2 h 1 govern operating costs garrido baserba et al 2016 rosso and stenstrom 2007 the low efficiency is mainly caused by the effect of contaminants in wastewater with surfactants being the most known contributors at depressing oxygen transfer eckenfelder and barnhart 1961 gillot and héduit 2008 hebrard et al 2009 henkel et al 2009 sardeing et al 2006 wagner and pöpel 1996 other compounds of composition not characterized or unknown such as the colloidal constituents which have been traditionally overlooked and aggregated with dissolved compounds are also theorized to play an active role in the decrease of mass transfer efficiency in wastewater and its potential impact should be incorporated within the analysis the exact relation between the degradation adsorption of oxygen transfer depressors i e surfactants colloids due to sorption enhancing technologies and the corresponding improvement in transfer efficiency is still unclear this research compiled the impact of the sorption enhancing strategy of bioaugmentation deployed at full scale over a 5 year period the observed improvement in bioflocculation and the overall wrrf performance was further assessed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms increasing oxygen transfer when biosorption enhancing strategies were applied the objective of this study was to quantify the effect of the wastewater

logged in at 1 min intervals this meter employed a polarographic sensor appropriate for clean water tests baquero rodríguez and lara borrero 2016 philichi and stenstrom 1989 the off gas measurements were conducted from a pilot reactor using the same procedure described in section 2 4 2 3 pilot scale reactor experiments for investigating sorption enhancement and oxygen transfer efficiency under contact stabilization the same pilot reactor was used to evaluate the impact of a contact stabilization reactor configuration on surfactant removal and aeration efficiency indicators the pilot scale batch reactor consisted of a 230 l cylindrical reactor column with diameter of 0 25 m and depth of 4 57 m a epdm fine pore disc 0 23 m or 9in was flanged at the bottom of the reactor column i e 100 floor coverage to replicate microbial starvation 113 l of the bioaugmented hras sludge from the full scale plant hras reactor was collected and aerated for 3 and 6 h in a 230 l pilot reactor column at a do 6 mgo2 l 1 without the addition of substrate at the end of the corresponding stabilization period the air was turned off and 113 l of cept effluent was added to the pilot reactor column to mimic the contactor phase the contactor mixture was re aerated to maintain the do above 2 mgo2 l 1 for carbon oxidation and to maintain aerobic conditions for the 1 h duration of the contact phase an air blower was used to supply air to the diffuser during the stabilization phase and also during the 1 h contact phase of aeration in the experiments the contactor column was covered with a lid to collect the off gas for analysis see 2 5 the airflow was regulated at a rate of 0 28 m3 h 1 by acrylic rotameters range 0 05 0 5 m3 h 1 supplied by cole parmer an ysi pro plus do meter with the probe placed at 50 of the water depth was used to measure do concentrations logged in at 1 min intervals controlled experiments were also performed using the conventional hras configuration with only cept wastewater and hras without pre aeration contact phase to compare the conventional plug flow hras configuration to the cs system both experiments were repeated under anaerobic conditions to serve as the sorption control system samples were collected at 5 30 and 60 min and at the end of the stabilization period the same procedure was applied during the contactor phase in each sample cod fractions tss and surfactants concentrations were measured 2 4 pilot scale batch reactor experiments for investigating sorption enhancement and oxygen transfer efficiency using anaerobic selector configuration the 230 l pilot scale batch reactor was filled with a mixture of chemically enhanced primary treatment effluent and bioaugmented high rate activated sludge hras in a ratio of 50 50 with final reactor mixture tss level of 100 110 mg tss l 1 three different hrt times for the anaerobic selector phase were used 15 30 and 45 min anaerobic conditions were created by purging the reactor sample mixture with nitrogen gas to maintain do at zero for 15 30 and 45 min correspondingly thereafter air was added for 1 additional hour to restore aerobic conditions while also performing off gas measurements as described in 2 5 2 5 off gas analysis oxygen transfer in process conditions was measured using the off gas method following the asce testing protocol asce 1997 off gas analysis relies on a mass balance around the water column where the air is flowing redmond et al 1992 schuchardt et al 2007 the measurements of oxygen partial pressure are used to calculate the standardized oxygen transfer efficiency in wastewater αsote the standardized oxygen transfer rate in wastewater αsotr kgo2 h 1 and of their respective airflow weighted averages when clean water tests are available α can be calculated a posteriori as the ratio of αsote and sote the α factor was calculated as the ratio of process water αsote and clean water sote the latter was obtained for each diffuser from their corresponding manufacturers as clean water tests are unlikely at full scale 2 6 analytics the hach tntplus cuvette test tnt874 loveland co was used for the measurement of anionic surfactants which are a heterogeneous mixture of single components linear alkyl sulfonates las are anionic surfactants that are extracted in chloroform and evaluated photometrically a cuvette test tnt874 was calibrated with sodium dodecyl sulfate sds for the 0 1 4 0 mg l 1 and the results were reported as mglas l 1 tss was measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 cod was determined using hach loveland colorado usa kits 2 7 statistics statistical significance between treatments was determined with an unpaired t test where unequal variances were assumed due to the small sample size to determine the significance between slopes three different slopes were calculated using linear regression and an unpaired t test was performed on the resulting slopes 3 results and discussions 3 1 αsote in bioaugmented and non bioaugmented full scale reactors 3 1 1 impact of different degrees of bioaugmentation on oxygen transfer to determine the influence of the bioaugmentation process aeration efficiency indicators i e α factor and αsote were monitored in the full scale reactor during three key periods associated with 3 different bioaugmentation levels over a 5 year span conditions were altered between the east and west reactors to exclude the impact of potential differences in wastewater characterization both reactors operated under full bioaugmentation mode 0 7 0 15 kg tsswns kg tsshras 1 day 1 for west 0 6 0 07 kg tsswns kg tsshras 1 d 1 for east partial bioaugementation mode 0 35 0 16 kg tsswns kg tsshras 1 day 1 for both and without bioaugmentation off gas tests along the reactor system in bioaugmented passes consistently yielded an approximate 30 38 improved aeration efficiency in comparison to non bioaugmented passes a 37 2 improvement in alpha factor was reported when the west reactor was fully bioaugmented the latter was a little higher than the period where the east reactor was full bioaugmented fig 2 which reported a 25 4 higher aeration efficiency coinciding with the improvement of the aeration efficiency due to full bioaugementation decreased surfactant levels of 4 6 0 7 mg sds l 1 and 5 2 0 5 mg sds l 1 for west and east reactors respectively were observed when bioaugemented fig 3 non bioaugmented passes yield an average concentration of non ionic and anionic surfactants of 9 2 1 mg l 1 and 8 7 2 mg l 1 respectively during the sampling period a 10 15 surfactant removal along non bioaugmented channels was observed on the other hand surfactant concentrations in bioaugmented channels decreased an approximate 40 50 from the beginning of the first channel to the end removals from 57 to 90 for the non ionic and 95 99 of the anionic surfactants were measured in the effluent of the secondary clarifier for non bioaugmented and bioaugmented respectively during the third period 50 50 when the waste nitrifying sludge was equally split between the west and east reactors both alpha factors and surfactant removal improved in comparison to non bioaugmented periods 7 1 and 20 3 respectively in west and 6 1 and 26 4 in east it should be noted that under partial bioaugmentation regimens similar improved results for alpha and surfactant concentrations were obtained when compared to full bioaugmentation periods the threshold of flocculation tof and sludge volume index svi reported for the bioaugmentation condition improved by 31 2 and 43 4 respectively as reported by van winckel et al 2019 this confirmed that the addition of activated sludge from long srt configurations enhanced the bioflocculation properties of the system operating at long srt to allow nitrification denitrification is recognized to have positive effects on oxygen transfer in wrrfs rosso 2018 rosso and stenstrom 2007 traditionally it has been assumed that longer srt enhances the removal of refractory substrates germain et al 2007 gillot and héduit 2008 groves et al 1992 henkel et al 2011 soliman et al 2007 the addition of nitrifying sludge 12 d has shown in previous studies to improve the catabolism of specific compounds e g surfactants sheng et al 2017 stenström and la cour jansen 2017 van der gast et al 2004 nevertheless this may not be the case for short srt at hras systems 2 d where the limited time may hamper the complete metabolization of refractory organics more likely almost instant physical chemical processes such as sorption would better explain the removal of surfactants in the liquid phase at short srt systems this aspect was further studied in controlled experiments see 3 3 3 1 2 influence of aeration equipment on improvements due to bioaugmentation four different types of diffusers were analyzed to quantify the impact on aeration efficiency indicators and their relationship with full bioaugmentation conditions transfer efficiencies in the bioaugmented testing column ranged from 5 2 αsote to 13 4 αsote while the non bioaugmented stalled between 2 and 6 αsote fig 4 similarly the α factors for bioaugmented ranged from 0 67 to 0 73 which is more than 35 higher in relative terms than for the non bioaugmented reactors the high α factors for the fine pore diffusers did not include any effects from fouling since they were all new it should be noted that differences between the two biological regimens bioaugmentation vs non bioaugmentation were minimal when coarse bubble diffusers were used the observed α factors in bioaugmented passes were significantly higher approximately 30 in relative terms compared to those expected values for low srt processes 0 40 0 08 with carbon only treatment rosso et al 2005 indicating the impact of bioaugmented sludge on the other hand the oxygen transfer rates measured in the column fed by non bioaugmented sludge 0 42 0 07 were closer to those expected values for carbon only treatment in both coarse and fine pore diffusers therefore efficiency indicators i e α factor and αsote showed that bioaugmented sludge experienced an increase in efficiency of nearly 36 0 5 in relative terms for the α factor and 45 1 in relative terms for αsote this result although obtained in an open reactor was similar to the results obtained at full scale see 3 1 1 the type of diffuser did not reveal significant impacts on the aeration efficiency when the two types of sludge were compared thus indicating that the wastewater characterization variations due to bioaugmentation were the main cause for improved oxygen transfer 3 2 impact of wastewater characterization on ote fig 5 shows the progressive removal of organics along the main process stages with the concurrent improvement in α to determine the exact influence of each of the wastewater constituents cod fractions and surfactants on oxygen transfer efficiency a set of experiments in controlled environments were conducted fig 6 using the following model compounds acetate as soluble cod source starch as colloidal cod source sodium dodecyl sulfate as surfactant and harvested surfactant from the east reactor as collected foam to exclude the impact of suspended solids all wastewater mixtures were diluted to have a tss lower than 100 10 mg l 1 and were then spiked with the model compounds surfactant addition of both as synthetic as well as harvested form decreased oxygen transfer significantly fig 6a while the addition of 1 mg sds l 1 resulted in a decrease in alpha factor 35 3 and 36 2 in relative terms for synthetic and harvested surfactant respectively increasing the surfactant concentration 10 fold 10 mg sds l 1 had little impact 47 3 in relative terms the obtained measurements are in accordance with previous studies reporting the inhibition of surfactants on mass transfer at the gas liquid interface dereszewska et al 2015 liwarska bizukojc and bizukojc 2006 tomczak wandzel et al 2009 wagner and pöpel 1996 the fitting of a reverse monod type inhibition curve to the data resulted in an inhibition coefficient ki expressing the concentration to obtain an inhibition of 50 of 2 5 0 5 mg sds l 1 r2 0 99 the p values associated with the unpaired student s t test for synthetic and harvested surfactants were 3 57 10 4 and 8 40 10 3 respectively indicating a statistically significant correlation p 0 05 between surfactants and oxygen transfer efficiency on the other hand whilst still significant the colloidal cod presented a much lower statistically correlation with aeration transfer efficiency 3 96 10 2 all estimated parameters for the reverse monod inhibition fit of the data for both synthetic and harvested surfactant are given in table 2 the reproducibility of controlled experiments using surfactants can be considered challenging as surfactants are very sensitive to background interferences and they need extremely pure solutions for the correct quantification nasiru et al 2011 racaud et al 2010 therefore caution should be taken when compared to site specific wastewater full scale conditions i e fibers colloidal matter microbial flocs unknown saa adhering constituents etc the reverse monod curve was used to calculate the theoretical change in alpha factor considering the surfactants concentrations sampled during previous periods table 1 before and after the full bioaugmentation system the calculations show a theoretical improvement in alpha of 0 23 0 05 in relative terms from 0 29 to 0 38 in absolute terms when reducing the surfactants concentration from non bioaugmented 8 5 0 04 mg sds l 1 to bioaugmented conditions 5 4 0 06 mg sds l 1 this theoretical improvement is similar to the measured at full scale 19 1 in relative terms fig 2 this confirmed the validity of the estimated ki value ki values ranging from less than 1 13 mg l 1 were recorded in literature for certain anionic surfactants chauhan and sharma 2014 hait et al 2003 zhang et al 2003 the obtain ki in this study was towards the low compared to existing literature fig 6b showed a decline of 42 3 in relative terms for alpha driven by the additions of colloidal material a similar monod inhibition model fitted the data table 2 and resulted in an estimated ki of 7 1 mg cod l 1 for colloidal material the effect of colloidal material on oxygen transfer has been largely overlooked in literature with some studies suggesting no relevant effect on kla with the addition of a highly colloidal substances hwang and stenstrom 1985 conversely in this study we could confirm that colloidal and particulate material impacted oxygen transfer efficiency by changing wastewater rheological properties this findings are in agreement with previous research reporting that an increased density or liquid viscosity by colloidal material can hinder the volumetric transfer rate as the movement of gaseous molecules is reduced amaral et al 2016 durán et al 2016 nittami et al 2013 moreover since colloidal and particulate cod are slowly biodegradable they could result in a potential suppression of oxygen transfer by inducing low oxygen uptake rate conditions reiber and stensel 1985 no impact of soluble cod on the alpha factor was observed although it cannot be discarded that other types of soluble compounds found in wastewater can exert a detrimental effect on alpha the current experimental setup demonstrated that none of the acetate concentrations applied 2 200 mg l 1 had a significant impact on decreasing alpha 3 3 increased sorption improves wastewater characteristics and aeration efficiency two alternative strategies to improve sorption other than bioaugmentation of long srt sludge were evaluated application of contact stabilization and application of anaerobic selectors to improve sorption of surfactants and colloidal cod were proposed and tested in detail in pilot scale batch tests 3 3 1 high rate contact stabilization as a strategy for improved oxygen transfer without any stabilization time an alpha of 0 48 0 20 and surfactant level of 2 8 0 2 6 mg sds l 1 was observed fig 7 b adding a stabilization time of 3 h resulted in an increase in α and surfactants removal by 16 and 22 5 in relative terms fig 7b these results are in accordance with previous studies demonstrating that the presence of a stabilization famine phase followed by low do contact with the influent feast could improve biosorption capacity and obtain higher bioflocculation affinity and settleability meerburg et al 2015a rahman et al 2016 vasquez sarria et al 2011 the increase in biosorption was not only suggested by an enhanced removal of surfactants but also with a correlated increase in eps production suggesting improved bioflocculation rahman et al 2017a when increased stabilization times were used decreased aeration efficiency and surfactant removal were observed while the extension of the contact stabilization time to 6 h resulted in a significantly lower surfactant removal in comparison 12 1 0 extending the cs time to 15 h showed no improvement fig 7b similarly alpha values were even lower than those reported when there was no contact stabilization time 0 45 0 06 and 0 39 0 04 in relative terms although the depletion of biodegradable cod freeing sorption sites was expected to be further boosted during famine conditions by the release of microbial exocellular enzymes improving the hydrolysis stage benefield and randall 1976 sarioğlu et al 2004 excessive stabilization periods may have induced the consumption of the required eps for sorption hampering the capacity to capture surfactant or other substances hindering oxygen transfer 3 3 2 anaerobic selectors as a strategy for improved oxygen transfer to investigate the potential of anaerobic sorption of surfactants rather than a combination of sorption and oxidation an anaerobic selector was applied the implementation of an anaerobic contact phase with hydraulic retention times of 15 30 and 45 min in the pilot scale resulted in surfactant removal efficiencies of 74 5 87 3 and 86 7 respectively and alpha factor values of 0 52 0 62 and 0 58 respectively fig 7a this configuration yielded the highest results for both surfactants removal and alpha factor about 117 improvement on surfactant removal was obtained in the anaerobic selector system when compared to the conventional hras system while about 74 and 49 when compared to the bioaugmented reactor system and the cs configuration respectively similarly when compared to conventional hras bioaugmented hras 50 50 and cs the alpha factor improved 63 35 and 20 in relative terms respectively the higher removal of surfactants obtained with the presence of an anaerobic selector indicates a clear increase in the biosorption capacity of the biomass as discussed previously the observed biosorption capacity increase in the cs configuration may have corresponded to the enmeshment of surfactants and colloidal substances in the floc structure due to the increase in sorption sites or free surface area during the stabilization phase nevertheless extended stabilization phases or famine periods may debilitate existing eps as scavenging bacteria potentially turned to eps in search for available substrate when the f m in the reactor decreased during the famine period rahman et al 2016 the anaerobic selector configuration on the other hand may have benefited from a similar sorption mechanism while a series of other physicochemical processes might have helped to further increase the sorption capacity full scale plants except biop configurations usually locate anaerobic selectors after the returns of mixed liquor suspended solids coming from the recirculating activated sludge the ras is under famine conditions end of aerobic zones and had expectedly suffered minor losses of eps as the anaerobic conditions in the clarifiers might have reduced the degradation rates of the eps in comparison to aerobic conditions similarly this study used bioaugmented sludge also under famine conditions with potentially more free sorption sites that in contact with rich influent may have maximized the concurrent adsorption of mass transfer reducing substances while the anaerobic conditions might have maintained the integrity if the eps to preserve biosorption some recent studies albeit under different operational conditions have pointed out that the addition of anaerobic phases can increase not only the quantity but also the quality of the eps by increasing the protein content in the eps composition yao et al 2019 the increase in protein concentration which can require longer residence time can decrease the effective critical potential on the surface of microorganisms and promote bioflocculation enhancing both settling characteristics and sorption liu et al 2014 miao et al 2018 yao et al 2019 nevertheless rahman et al 2016 reported no fresh eps production during anaerobic phases and suggested that the eps production was only improved when aerobically stabilized sludge famine condition was exposed to feast conditions without significant changes on the eps c n ratio the present study seems to align with the rahman et al 2016 as not relative increase in the eps production was observed odize 2018 however it must to be noted that even if anaerobic conditions have the ability to increase eps production and modify eps characteristics the rate of these changes under an anaerobic phase might have been too slow to have any significant impact sorption in the short term batstone and keller 2001 nielsen et al 1996 another factor that may have contributed to the highest observed surfactants removal although to a minor extent due the short time of the hydraulic retention time i e 30 min is the intracellular storage of surfactants under anaerobic condition recent studies have shown that anaerobic conditions can promote the production of storage compounds as triacylglycerides as bacteria accumulates them at low do conditions as they limit β oxidation alvarez et al 1997 kinyua et al 2017b similarly other studies based on granular sludge have observed that anaerobic selectors might enhance storage mechanisms leading to increased density and settling stability basis of granular reactors especially when the f m ratio reach a sufficient threshold mcswain et al 2005 2004 sludge with those mechanisms often exhibit increased protein content kinyua et al 2017a 2017b similarly even at lesser extent is the potential biodegradation on of some non ionic surfactants surfactants metabolization by bacteria is a slow process with degradation rates ranging from hours to a few days chang et al 2005 lu et al 2008 which may have had little impact this type of short experiment as discussed in the following section 3 3 3 determination of surfactants removal mechanism the removal of surfactants in secondary treatment conditions has been consistently reported de wever et al 2004 terzic et al 2005 surfactants are assumed to either break down due to aerobic processes and or being adsorbed on the activated sludge flocs several authors indicated that the mechanism of the breakdown for anionic surfactants i e las involves several relatively complex steps perales et al 1999 these required steps may hamper the quick oxidation of surfactant in short srt systems indicating that surfactant removals in sorption enhancing strategies systems is primarily due to adsorption phenomena this suggests that removal during the contact phase or due to bioaugmentation is governed by physicochemical mechanisms such as sorption and flocculation discarding any significant role of biodegradation as a removal mechanism indeed it has been demonstrated that sorption of activated sludge is essentially 99 complete within 10 min wahlberg et al 2012 the cs configuration under optimized stabilization time and longer contact time on the other hand achieved 60 removal within the first 15 min suggesting that biodegradation may have played a bigger role the impact of biodegradation was already expected to be slightly higher under the anaerobic conditions as the selector provided favorable conditions for bacteria to metabolize soluble material nevertheless it is still unlikely that the 40 removal difference between the cs and the anaerobic selector configurations hrt 15 and 30 min is due to enhanced biodegradation rather than potential sampling errors for this type of reactor configuration surfactants samples could only be taken at the end of the selector phase 3 4 research applicability on full scale systems the implementation of biosorption enhancing strategies such as bioaugmentation contact stabilization and anaerobic selectors have already shown their capacity to improve bioflocculation and settling characteristics mancell egala et al 2017 2016 this study confirmed that increasing sorption potential has clear benefits on the overall oxygen transfer efficiency and the concurrent operational costs helping wrrfs to advance toward energy positive wastewater treatments the latter strategies mainly result in improvements of the wastewater matrix through surfactant and colloidal material sorption this research provided evidence that aeration in the secondary system at blue plains benefitted from the implementation of a bioaugmentation strategy while its unique setup this bioaugmentation approach is not widely applicable to other resource recovery facilities nevertheless the mechanism behind the success of bioaugmentation could be achieved to alternatives such as contact stabilization and related configurations i e addition of an anaerobic selector phase the necessary adjustments to adopt the discussed sorption enhancing strategies in any wrrf will have to consider site specific characteristics and wastewater characterization 4 conclusions the link between aeration efficiency in wrrfs and wastewater characteristics with a special emphasis on biosorption capacity was extensively investigated the biosorption of surfactants and colloidal cod fractions impacted the oxygen transfer significantly this study provided ki 50 relative decrease in alpha levels for both surfactants and colloidal organics at 2 5 0 6 mg sds l 1 and 23 4 mg cod l 1 respectively this showed the high sensitivity of alpha towards these wastewater fractions in addition bioaugmentation of long srt sludge application of contact stabilization and implementation of anaerobic selectors all promoted biosorption of surfactants and therefore significantly increased oxygen transfer rates this study showed the convergence of strategies applied to improve settleability with improved aeration

17768,the link between aeration efficiency and biosorption capacity in water resource recovery facilities was extensively investigated with special emphasis on wastewater characteristics and the development of strategies to maximize adsorption biosorption of oxygen transfer inhibitors i e surfactants colloidal and soluble fractions was examined by a series of pilot batch scale experiments and full scale studies the impact of a sorption enhancing strategy i e bioaugmentation deployed at full scale over a five year period was evaluated bench scale experiments determined the inhibition

selector resulted in significant improvements in both aeration efficiency indicators αsote and surfactants removals αsote improvements of 46 and 54 in comparison to conventional high rate activated sludge process hras were reported similarly the removal of surfactants was increased by 27 and 56 using optimized enhancing sorption strategies further analyses helped elucidate the underlying mechanisms of surfactants removal findings are expected to help full scale applications increase their sorption potential as well as the concurrent aeration efficiency which helps wrrfs to advance toward energy positive wastewater treatments graphical abstract image 1 keywords aeration efficiency bioaugmentation surfactants surface active agents saa activated sludge contact stabilization anaerobic selector 1 introduction with the objective of achieving energy neutrality for water resource recovery facilities wrrfs new technologies and operational strategies aimed to reduce energy demand while meeting effluent requirements are gaining interest limiting the oxidation of organics during the aeration process is being welcomed as a strategy to lower aeration costs while increasing carbon harvesting as useable energy thus improving the overall carbon footprint jimenez et al 2015 meerburg et al 2015a miller 2015 this improvement is achieved through the combination of very short solids retention times srt with high sludge specific organic loading rates which increases the sorption capacity of activated sludge short srts limit the oxidation of easily oxidizable organic fractions while capturing colloidal and particulate fractions through adsorption into the microbial flocs which can then be further harvested as biogas resource jimenez et al 2015 bioflocculation or floc production due to extracellular polymeric substances eps is essential in the solids liquid separation phase during secondary settling forster 1985 liao et al 2001 nielsen et al 1996 urbain et al 1993 but it also plays a key role in determining the adsorption capacity of flocs more et al 2014 rahman et al 2016 schuler et al 2001 new strategies based on maximizing bioflocculation and its concurrent adsorption capacity in high rate activated sludge hras systems are aimed at overcoming some of the current limitations arising from short srts i e bioflocculation are being developed meerburg et al 2015b miller et al 2017 rahman et al 2016 van winckel et al 2019 a few strategies were described to enhance bioflocculation and settling and were shown to be highly dependent on the loading conditions of the system indicating that highly loaded systems at lab scale 10 kg cod m3 day can enhance bioflocculation i e settling adsorption capacity etc with an adequate f m ratio rahman et al 2017b van winckel et al 2019 on the other hand low loaded systems benefit from implementing strategic feast famine configurations van winckel et al 2019 winckel et al 2016 even if different operational strategies are required to maximize bioflocculation according to the loading conditions of the system all alternatives seem to indicate that bioflocculation is promoted by sustaining a minimum amount of eps and especially by an adequate quality of the flocs mancell egala et al 2016 sesay et al 2006 while no correlation between the eps concentration and bioflocculation has been consistently proven in literature there is evidence that eps quality and composition i e content ratio of protein to polysaccharide glycoprotein content etc is key to the formation of flocs and their adsorption capacity durmaz and sanin 2001 liao et al 2001 sesay et al 2006 yu et al 2008 adsorption enhancing strategies can alter floc composition either by adjusting critical processes i e stabilization phases promotion of feast famine regimen modification of solid retention time etc or by the addition of a selected microbial population with its intrinsic eps properties i e bioaugmentation bioaugmentation is one of the sorption enhancing strategies that is gaining interest due to its recent consideration as a cost effective method to increase process stability settling and enhance flocculation adsorption capacity and even for being able to lower the required volumes for treatment limbergen et al 1998 mikhailova et al 2014 plaza et al 2001 stenström and la cour jansen 2016 bioaugmentation refers to the addition of specialized strains mixed cultures i e nitrifying denitrifying bacteria to wastewater reactors herrero and stuckey 2015 jianlong et al 2002 limbergen et al 1998 a bioaugmentation strategy consisting of the addition of waste activated sludge returns from the nitrifying denitrifying reactors performing biological nutrient removal bnr to the upstream high rate activated sludge process hras was implemented to increase the nitrogen removal and to minimize the cost of external carbon dosing methanol for the downstream bnr process bailey et al 2007 where otherwise the short srt would be limiting nitrification improved settling and lower tss after the implementation of the bioaugmentation strategy was observed in addition to the nitrogen removal intended the improvements indicated an increase in bioflocculation suggesting an enhanced potential for adsorption van winckel et al 2019 trapping oxygen transfer inhibitors onto the floc i e surface active agents or surfactants and some of the cod fractions may have been impacting positively the overall oxygen transfer efficiency as suggested in recent literature stenström and la cour jansen 2017 stenström and la cour jansen 2016 tomczak wandzel et al 2009 contact stabilization is among these new strategies aimed to enhanced sorption meerburg et al 2016 sarioğlu et al 2004 vasquez sarria et al 2011 the feast famine conditions induced in a contact stabilization layout are recognized as strategy to regulate eps production and bioflocculation meerburg et al 2016 rahman et al 2017a the famine period during the stabilization phase is meant to induce starvation conditions for bacteria turning them into the oxidation of the more easily available adsorbed material in the floc this oxidation will free new sorption sites able to capture during feast conditions those substances associated with the reduction of oxygen transfer however the integrity and composition of the eps forming the floc is also expected to suffer from bacteria scavenging during the starvation period as under stress famine conditions bacteria can used floc structural polymeric substances as substrate meerburg et al 2016 later during the contact phase the arriving biodegradable cod is expected to be transformed into new eps adding new sorption sites to the already obtained during the stabilization phase therefore while the addition of a stabilization phase has proven to benefit biosorption is still unclear the final balance on the overall production of sorption sites the present study was designed to determine the potential to improve oxygen transfer in those cases or configurations with maximized bioflocculation adsorption e g contact stabilization anaerobic selectors while also trying to identify through a set of specific experiments the underlying mechanisms impacting oxygen transfer in wwrfs enhanced removal of oxygen transfer depressors by sorption enhancing strategies could be considered a potential venue to improve aeration efficiency and reduce the concurrent operational costs maximizing sorption in activated sludge systems might then have two relevant direct beneficial impacts on aeration 1 reduction of the overall oxygen requirements for only the oxidation of readily biodegradable organics fraction is targeted 2 maximization of the oxygen transfer efficiency as increased adsorption lowered the concentrations of mass transfer depressors i e surfactants colloids their collateral and untapped potential to maximize aeration savings should not be overlooked as supplying oxygen during the biological oxidation is recognized as the highest energy use in wastewater treatment accounting for more than 50 75 of the net power demand reardon 1995 rosso

transfer rate otr kgo2 h 1 govern operating costs garrido baserba et al 2016 rosso and stenstrom 2007 the low efficiency is mainly caused by the effect of contaminants in wastewater with surfactants being the most known contributors at depressing oxygen transfer eckenfelder and barnhart 1961 gillot and héduit 2008 hebrard et al 2009 henkel et al 2009 sardeing et al 2006 wagner and pöpel 1996 other compounds of composition not characterized or unknown such as the colloidal constituents which have been traditionally overlooked and aggregated with dissolved compounds are also theorized to play an active role in the decrease of mass transfer efficiency in wastewater and its potential impact should be incorporated within the analysis the exact relation between the degradation adsorption of oxygen transfer depressors i e surfactants colloids due to sorption enhancing technologies and the corresponding improvement in transfer efficiency is still unclear this research compiled the impact of the sorption enhancing strategy of bioaugmentation deployed at full scale over a 5 year period the observed improvement in bioflocculation and the overall wrrf performance was further assessed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms increasing oxygen transfer when biosorption enhancing strategies were applied the objective of this study was to quantify the effect of the wastewater

sidestream column studies were conducted to determine and compare oxygen transfer between different reactor channels one column study was performed in a channel of reactor operated as a step feed reactor receiving waste sludge from the nitrification system bioaugmentation while the second study was performed in a plug flow reactor being fed 100 at the beginning of the first pass without bioaugmentation both studies were performed in a column with 3 0 m of side water depth and 2 7 m of diffuser submergence fig 1 the column was 0 80 m in diameter and 3 6 m deep in total i e with a freeboard of 0 60 m five different fine pore diffusers and one coarse bubble were tested in each column mixed liquor was continuously pumped through the column at constant rate to produce a steady state column do concentration of 1 3 mg l 1 with the air diffuser operating within the range of air flows recommended by their respective manufacturers the pump to feed continuously the column with mixed liquor was centrifugal grainger catalogue number 4hu75 delivering 265 l min 1 at 4 6 m of head and 250 l min 1 at 6 0 m of head initial clean water transfer efficiencies sote were measured in situ using the asce 2007 clean water testing standard protocol for both studies sote ranged from 2 4 m for the coarse bubble to 5 2 6 5 m 2 2 pilot reactor experiments to investigate the impact of surfactant and cod fractions on ote this study was performed in a pilot system consisted of cylindrical reactors 227 l secondary clarifiers 306 l and a return activated sludge ras buffer tank 50 l aeration and mixing were achieved with coarse bubble diffusers and a blower the detailed description of the pilot reactor and the schematic diagrams of the investigated configurations are described in supplementary information s 2 different synthetic wastewater mixtures were prepared by adding different concentrations of surfactants colloidal cod surrogate and soluble cod surrogate surfactant concentrations of 0 1 5 10 and 15 mg l 1 of sodium dodecyl sulfate were added to the 227 l bulk volume of the pilot reactor as a particulate colloidal cod surrogate concentration of 5 10 20 50 100 and 200 mg cod l 1 of powdered potato starch were used and as a soluble cod surrogate acetate the concentrations ranged from 5 10 20 50 100 200 mg cod l 1 the reactor was mixed with 113 5 l of hras collected from a full scale secondary reactor and 113 5 l of nitrification denitrification effluent collected from full scale bnr reactors to reach the total volume of 227 l and a final tss concentration of 100 mg tss l 1 the batch procedure consisted in the aeration of a total volume of 273l consisting in a mixture of 3l of sludge plus 270l of primary influent to ensure the right food to mass ratio f m for the biomass or tss target of 150 mg l 1 the pilot reactor mixture was constantly aerated using an air blower which supplied air for 2 h during the experiment the air flow was controlled at 0 28 m3 h 1 by acrylic rotameters 0 05 0 5 m3 h 1 range supplied by cole parmer a ysi pro plus do meter with probe placed at 50 of the water depth was used to measure do concentrations logged in at 1 min intervals this meter employed a polarographic sensor appropriate for clean water tests baquero rodríguez and lara borrero 2016 philichi and stenstrom 1989 the off gas measurements were conducted from a pilot reactor using the same procedure described in section 2 4 2 3 pilot scale reactor experiments for investigating sorption enhancement and oxygen transfer efficiency under contact stabilization the same pilot reactor was used to evaluate the impact of a contact stabilization reactor configuration on surfactant removal and aeration efficiency indicators the pilot scale batch reactor consisted of a 230 l cylindrical reactor column with diameter of 0 25 m and depth of 4 57 m a epdm fine pore disc 0 23 m or 9in was flanged at the bottom of the reactor column i e 100 floor coverage to replicate microbial starvation 113 l of the bioaugmented hras sludge from the full scale plant hras reactor was collected and aerated for 3 and 6 h in a 230 l pilot reactor column at a do 6 mgo2 l 1 without the addition of substrate at the end of the corresponding stabilization period the air was turned off and 113 l of cept effluent was added to the pilot reactor column to mimic the contactor phase the contactor mixture was re aerated to maintain the do above 2 mgo2 l 1 for carbon oxidation and to maintain aerobic conditions for the 1 h duration of the contact phase an air blower was used to supply air to the diffuser during the stabilization phase and also during the 1 h contact phase of aeration in the experiments the contactor column was covered with a lid to collect the off gas for analysis see 2 5 the airflow was regulated at a rate of 0 28 m3 h 1 by acrylic rotameters range 0 05 0 5 m3 h 1 supplied by cole parmer an ysi pro plus do meter with the probe placed at 50 of the water depth was used to measure do concentrations logged in at 1 min intervals controlled experiments were also performed using the conventional hras configuration with only cept wastewater and hras without pre aeration contact phase to compare the conventional plug flow hras configuration to the cs system both experiments were repeated under anaerobic conditions to serve as the sorption control system samples were collected at 5 30 and 60 min and at the end of the stabilization period the same procedure was applied during the contactor phase in each sample cod fractions tss and surfactants concentrations were measured 2 4 pilot scale batch reactor experiments for investigating sorption enhancement and oxygen transfer efficiency using anaerobic selector configuration the 230 l pilot scale batch reactor was filled with a mixture of chemically enhanced primary treatment effluent and bioaugmented high rate activated sludge hras in a ratio of 50 50 with final reactor mixture tss level of 100 110 mg tss l 1 three different hrt times for the anaerobic selector phase were used 15 30 and 45 min anaerobic conditions were created by purging the reactor sample mixture with nitrogen gas to maintain do at zero for 15 30 and 45 min correspondingly thereafter air was added for 1 additional hour to restore aerobic conditions while also performing off gas measurements as described in 2 5 2 5 off gas analysis oxygen transfer in process conditions was measured using the off gas method following the asce testing protocol asce 1997 off gas analysis relies on a mass balance around the water column where the air is flowing redmond et al 1992 schuchardt et al 2007 the measurements of oxygen partial pressure are used to calculate the standardized oxygen transfer efficiency in wastewater αsote the standardized oxygen transfer rate in wastewater αsotr kgo2 h 1 and of their respective airflow weighted averages when clean water tests are available α can be calculated a posteriori as the ratio of αsote and sote the α factor was calculated as the ratio of process water αsote and clean water sote the latter was obtained for each diffuser from their corresponding manufacturers as clean water tests are unlikely at full scale 2 6 analytics the hach tntplus cuvette test tnt874 loveland co was used for the measurement of anionic surfactants which are a heterogeneous mixture of single components linear alkyl sulfonates las are anionic surfactants that are extracted in chloroform and evaluated photometrically a cuvette test tnt874 was calibrated with sodium dodecyl sulfate sds for the 0 1 4 0 mg l 1 and the results were reported as mglas l 1 tss was measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 cod was determined using hach loveland colorado usa kits 2 7 statistics statistical significance between treatments was determined with an unpaired t test where unequal variances were assumed due to the small sample size to determine the significance between slopes three different slopes were calculated using linear regression and an unpaired t test was performed on the resulting slopes 3 results and discussions 3 1 αsote in bioaugmented and non bioaugmented full scale reactors 3 1 1 impact of different degrees of bioaugmentation on oxygen transfer to determine the influence of the bioaugmentation process aeration efficiency indicators i e α factor and αsote were monitored in the full scale reactor during three key periods associated with 3 different bioaugmentation levels over a 5 year span conditions were altered between the east and west reactors to exclude the impact of potential differences in wastewater characterization both reactors operated under full bioaugmentation mode 0 7 0 15 kg tsswns kg tsshras 1 day 1 for west 0 6 0 07 kg tsswns kg tsshras 1 d 1 for east partial bioaugementation mode 0 35 0 16 kg tsswns kg tsshras 1 day 1 for both and without bioaugmentation off gas tests along the reactor system in bioaugmented passes consistently yielded an approximate 30 38 improved aeration efficiency in comparison to non bioaugmented passes a 37 2 improvement in alpha factor was reported when the west reactor was fully bioaugmented the latter was a little higher than the period where the east reactor was full bioaugmented fig 2 which reported a 25 4 higher aeration efficiency coinciding with the improvement of the aeration efficiency due to full bioaugementation decreased surfactant levels of 4 6 0 7 mg sds l 1 and 5 2 0 5 mg sds l 1 for west and east reactors respectively were observed when bioaugemented fig 3 non bioaugmented passes yield an average concentration of non ionic and anionic surfactants of 9 2 1 mg l 1 and 8 7 2 mg l 1 respectively during the sampling period a 10 15 surfactant removal along non bioaugmented channels was observed on the other hand surfactant concentrations in bioaugmented channels decreased an approximate 40 50 from the beginning of the first channel to the end removals from 57 to 90 for the non ionic and 95 99 of the anionic surfactants were measured in the effluent of the secondary clarifier for non bioaugmented and bioaugmented respectively during the third period 50 50 when the waste nitrifying sludge was equally split between the west and east reactors both alpha factors and surfactant removal improved in comparison to non bioaugmented periods 7 1 and 20 3 respectively in west and 6 1 and 26 4 in east it should be noted that under partial bioaugmentation regimens similar improved results for alpha and surfactant concentrations were obtained when compared to full bioaugmentation periods the threshold of flocculation tof and sludge volume index svi reported for the bioaugmentation condition improved by 31 2 and 43 4 respectively as reported by van winckel et al 2019 this confirmed that the addition of activated sludge from long srt configurations enhanced the bioflocculation properties of the system operating at long srt to allow nitrification denitrification is recognized to have positive effects on oxygen transfer in wrrfs rosso 2018 rosso and stenstrom 2007 traditionally it has been assumed that longer srt enhances the removal of refractory substrates germain et al 2007 gillot and héduit 2008 groves et al 1992 henkel et al 2011 soliman et al 2007 the addition of nitrifying sludge 12 d has shown in previous studies to improve the catabolism of specific compounds e g surfactants sheng et al 2017 stenström and la cour jansen 2017 van der gast et al 2004 nevertheless this may not be the case for short srt at hras systems 2 d where the limited time may hamper the complete metabolization of refractory organics more likely almost instant physical chemical processes such as sorption would better explain the removal of surfactants in the liquid phase at short srt systems this aspect was further studied in controlled experiments see 3 3 3 1 2 influence of aeration equipment on improvements due to bioaugmentation four different types of diffusers were analyzed to quantify the impact on aeration efficiency indicators and their relationship with full bioaugmentation conditions transfer efficiencies in the bioaugmented testing column ranged from 5 2 αsote to 13 4 αsote while the non bioaugmented stalled between 2 and 6 αsote fig 4 similarly the α factors for bioaugmented ranged from 0 67 to 0 73 which is more than 35 higher in relative terms than for the non bioaugmented reactors the high α factors for the fine pore diffusers did not include any effects from fouling since they were all new it should be noted that differences between the two biological regimens bioaugmentation vs non bioaugmentation were minimal when coarse bubble diffusers were used the observed α factors in bioaugmented passes were significantly higher approximately 30 in relative terms compared to those expected values for low srt processes 0 40 0 08 with carbon only treatment rosso et al 2005 indicating the impact of bioaugmented sludge on the other hand the oxygen transfer rates measured in the column fed by non bioaugmented sludge 0 42 0 07 were closer to those expected values for carbon only treatment in both coarse and fine pore diffusers therefore efficiency indicators i e α factor and αsote showed that bioaugmented sludge experienced an increase in efficiency of nearly 36 0 5 in relative terms for the α factor and 45 1 in relative terms for αsote this result although obtained in an open reactor was similar to the results obtained at full scale see 3 1 1 the type of diffuser did not reveal significant impacts on the aeration efficiency when the two types of sludge were compared thus indicating that the wastewater characterization variations due to bioaugmentation were the main cause for improved oxygen transfer 3 2 impact of wastewater characterization on ote fig 5 shows the progressive removal of organics along the main process stages with the concurrent improvement in α to determine the exact influence of each of the wastewater constituents cod fractions and surfactants on oxygen transfer efficiency a set of experiments in controlled environments were conducted fig 6 using the following model compounds acetate as soluble cod source starch as colloidal cod source sodium dodecyl sulfate as surfactant and harvested surfactant from the east reactor as collected foam to exclude the impact of suspended solids all wastewater mixtures were diluted to have a tss lower than 100 10 mg l 1 and were then spiked with the model compounds surfactant addition of both as synthetic as well as harvested form decreased oxygen transfer significantly fig 6a while the addition of 1 mg sds l 1 resulted in a decrease in alpha factor 35 3 and 36 2 in relative terms for synthetic and harvested surfactant respectively increasing the surfactant concentration 10 fold 10 mg sds l 1 had little impact 47 3 in relative terms the obtained measurements are in accordance with previous studies reporting the inhibition of surfactants on mass transfer at the gas liquid interface dereszewska et al 2015 liwarska bizukojc and bizukojc 2006 tomczak wandzel et al 2009 wagner and pöpel 1996 the fitting of a reverse monod type inhibition curve to the data resulted in an inhibition coefficient ki expressing the concentration to obtain an inhibition of 50 of 2 5 0 5 mg sds l 1 r2 0 99 the p values associated with the unpaired student s t test for synthetic and harvested surfactants were 3 57 10 4 and 8 40 10 3 respectively indicating a statistically significant correlation p 0 05 between surfactants and oxygen transfer efficiency on the other hand whilst still significant the colloidal cod presented a much lower statistically correlation with aeration transfer efficiency 3 96 10 2 all estimated parameters for the reverse monod inhibition fit of the data for both synthetic and harvested surfactant are given in table 2 the reproducibility of controlled experiments using surfactants can be considered challenging as surfactants are very sensitive to background interferences and they need extremely pure solutions for the correct quantification nasiru et al 2011 racaud et al 2010 therefore caution should be taken when compared to site specific wastewater full scale conditions i e fibers colloidal matter microbial flocs unknown saa adhering constituents etc the reverse monod curve was used to calculate the theoretical change in alpha factor considering the surfactants concentrations sampled during previous periods table 1 before and after the full bioaugmentation system the calculations show a theoretical improvement in alpha of 0 23 0 05 in relative terms from 0 29 to 0 38 in absolute terms when reducing the surfactants concentration from non bioaugmented 8 5 0 04 mg sds l 1 to bioaugmented conditions 5 4 0 06 mg sds l 1 this theoretical improvement is similar to the measured at full scale 19 1 in relative terms fig 2 this confirmed the validity of the estimated ki value ki values ranging from less than 1 13 mg l 1 were recorded in literature for certain anionic surfactants chauhan and sharma 2014 hait et al 2003 zhang et al 2003 the obtain ki in this study was towards the low compared to existing literature fig 6b showed a decline of 42 3 in relative terms for alpha driven by the additions of colloidal material a similar monod inhibition model fitted the data table 2 and resulted in an estimated ki of 7 1 mg cod l 1 for colloidal material the effect of colloidal material on oxygen transfer has been largely overlooked in literature with some studies suggesting no relevant effect on kla with the addition of a highly colloidal substances hwang and stenstrom 1985 conversely in this study we could confirm that colloidal and particulate material impacted oxygen transfer efficiency by changing wastewater rheological properties this findings are in agreement with previous research reporting that an increased density or liquid viscosity by colloidal material can hinder the volumetric transfer rate as the movement of gaseous molecules is reduced amaral et al 2016 durán et al 2016 nittami et al 2013 moreover since colloidal and particulate cod are slowly biodegradable they could result in a potential suppression of oxygen transfer by inducing low oxygen uptake rate conditions reiber and stensel 1985 no impact of soluble cod on the alpha factor was observed although it cannot be discarded that other types of soluble compounds found in wastewater can exert a detrimental effect on alpha the current experimental setup demonstrated that none of the acetate concentrations applied 2 200 mg l 1 had a significant impact on decreasing alpha 3 3 increased sorption improves wastewater characteristics and aeration efficiency two alternative strategies to improve sorption other than bioaugmentation of long srt sludge were evaluated application of contact stabilization and application of anaerobic selectors to improve sorption of surfactants and colloidal cod were proposed and tested in detail in pilot scale batch tests 3 3 1 high rate contact stabilization as a strategy for improved oxygen transfer without any stabilization time an alpha of 0 48 0 20 and surfactant level of 2 8 0 2 6 mg sds l 1 was observed fig 7 b adding a stabilization time of 3 h resulted in an increase in α and surfactants removal by 16 and 22 5 in relative terms fig 7b these results are in accordance with previous studies demonstrating that the presence of a stabilization famine phase followed by low do contact with the influent feast could improve biosorption capacity and obtain higher bioflocculation affinity and settleability meerburg et al 2015a rahman et al 2016 vasquez sarria et al 2011 the increase in biosorption was not only suggested by an enhanced removal of surfactants but also with a correlated increase in eps production suggesting improved bioflocculation rahman et al 2017a when increased stabilization times were used decreased aeration efficiency and surfactant removal were observed while the extension of the contact stabilization time to 6 h resulted in a significantly lower surfactant removal in comparison 12 1 0 extending the cs time to 15 h showed no improvement fig 7b similarly alpha values were even lower than those reported when there was no contact stabilization time 0 45 0 06 and 0 39 0 04 in relative terms although the depletion of biodegradable cod freeing sorption sites was expected to be further boosted during famine conditions by the release of microbial exocellular enzymes improving the hydrolysis stage benefield and randall 1976 sarioğlu et al 2004 excessive stabilization periods may have induced the consumption of the required eps for sorption hampering the capacity to capture surfactant or other substances hindering oxygen transfer 3 3 2 anaerobic selectors as a strategy for improved oxygen transfer to investigate the potential of anaerobic sorption of surfactants rather than a combination of sorption and oxidation an anaerobic selector was applied the implementation of an anaerobic contact phase with hydraulic retention times of 15 30 and 45 min in the pilot scale resulted in surfactant removal efficiencies of 74 5 87 3 and 86 7 respectively and alpha factor values of 0 52 0 62 and 0 58 respectively fig 7a this configuration yielded the highest results for both surfactants removal and alpha factor about 117 improvement on surfactant removal was obtained in the anaerobic selector system when compared to the conventional hras system while about 74 and 49 when compared to the bioaugmented reactor system and the cs configuration respectively similarly when compared to conventional hras bioaugmented hras 50 50 and cs the alpha factor improved 63 35 and 20 in relative terms respectively the higher removal of surfactants obtained with the presence of an anaerobic selector indicates a clear increase in the biosorption capacity of the biomass as discussed previously the observed biosorption capacity increase in the cs configuration may have corresponded to the enmeshment of surfactants and colloidal substances in the floc structure due to the increase in sorption sites or free surface area during the stabilization phase nevertheless extended stabilization phases or famine periods may debilitate existing eps as scavenging bacteria potentially turned to eps in search for available substrate when the f m in the reactor decreased during the famine period rahman et al 2016 the anaerobic selector configuration on the other hand may have benefited from a similar sorption mechanism while a series of other physicochemical processes might have helped to further increase the sorption capacity full scale plants except biop configurations usually locate anaerobic selectors after the returns of mixed liquor suspended solids coming from the recirculating activated sludge the ras is under famine conditions end of aerobic zones and had expectedly suffered minor losses of eps as the anaerobic conditions in the clarifiers might have reduced the degradation rates of the eps in comparison to aerobic conditions similarly this study used bioaugmented sludge also under famine conditions with potentially more free sorption sites that in contact with rich influent may have maximized the concurrent adsorption of mass transfer reducing substances while the anaerobic conditions might have maintained the integrity if the eps to preserve biosorption some recent studies albeit under different operational conditions have pointed out that the addition of anaerobic phases can increase not only the quantity but also the quality of the eps by increasing the protein content in the eps composition yao et al 2019 the increase in protein concentration which can require longer residence time can decrease the effective critical potential on the surface of microorganisms and promote bioflocculation enhancing both settling characteristics and sorption liu et al 2014 miao et al 2018 yao et al 2019 nevertheless rahman et al 2016 reported no fresh eps production during anaerobic phases and suggested that the eps production was only improved when aerobically stabilized sludge famine condition was exposed to feast conditions without significant changes on the eps c n ratio the present study seems to align with the rahman et al 2016 as not relative increase in the eps production was observed odize 2018 however it must to be noted that even if anaerobic conditions have the ability to increase eps production and modify eps characteristics the rate of these changes under an anaerobic phase might have been too slow to have any significant impact sorption in the short term batstone and keller 2001 nielsen et al 1996 another factor that may have contributed to the highest observed surfactants removal although to a minor extent due the short time of the hydraulic retention time i e 30 min is the intracellular storage of surfactants under anaerobic condition recent studies have shown that anaerobic conditions can promote the production of storage compounds as triacylglycerides as bacteria accumulates them at low do conditions as they limit β oxidation alvarez et al 1997 kinyua et al 2017b similarly other studies based on granular sludge have observed that anaerobic selectors might enhance storage mechanisms leading to increased density and settling stability basis of granular reactors especially when the f m ratio reach a sufficient threshold mcswain et al 2005 2004 sludge with those mechanisms often exhibit increased protein content kinyua et al 2017a 2017b similarly even at lesser extent is the potential biodegradation on of some non ionic surfactants surfactants metabolization by bacteria is a slow process with degradation rates ranging from hours to a few days chang et al 2005 lu et al 2008 which may have had little impact this type of short experiment as discussed in the following section 3 3 3 determination of surfactants removal mechanism the removal of surfactants in secondary treatment conditions has been consistently reported de wever et al 2004 terzic et al 2005 surfactants are assumed to either break down due to aerobic processes and or being adsorbed on the activated sludge flocs several authors indicated that the mechanism of the breakdown for anionic surfactants i e las involves several relatively complex steps perales et al 1999 these required steps may hamper the quick oxidation of surfactant in short srt systems indicating that surfactant removals in sorption enhancing strategies systems is primarily due to adsorption phenomena this suggests that removal during the contact phase or due to bioaugmentation is governed by physicochemical mechanisms such as sorption and flocculation discarding any significant role of biodegradation as a removal mechanism indeed it has been demonstrated that sorption of activated sludge is essentially 99 complete within 10 min wahlberg et al 2012 the cs configuration under optimized stabilization time and longer contact time on the other hand achieved 60 removal within the first 15 min suggesting that biodegradation may have played a bigger role the impact of biodegradation was already expected to be slightly higher under the anaerobic conditions as the selector provided favorable conditions for bacteria to metabolize soluble material nevertheless it is still unlikely that the 40 removal difference between the cs and the anaerobic selector configurations hrt 15 and 30 min is due to enhanced biodegradation rather than potential sampling errors for this type of reactor configuration surfactants samples could only be taken at the end of the selector phase 3 4 research applicability on full scale systems the implementation of biosorption enhancing strategies such as bioaugmentation contact stabilization and anaerobic selectors have already shown their capacity to improve bioflocculation and settling characteristics mancell egala et al 2017 2016 this study confirmed that increasing sorption potential has clear benefits on the overall oxygen transfer efficiency and the concurrent operational costs helping wrrfs to advance toward energy positive wastewater treatments the latter strategies mainly result in improvements of the wastewater matrix through surfactant and colloidal material sorption this research provided evidence that aeration in the secondary system at blue plains benefitted from the implementation of a bioaugmentation strategy while its unique setup this bioaugmentation approach is not widely applicable to other resource recovery facilities nevertheless the mechanism behind the success of bioaugmentation could be achieved to alternatives such as contact stabilization and related configurations i e addition of an anaerobic selector phase the necessary adjustments to adopt the discussed sorption enhancing strategies in any wrrf will have to consider site specific characteristics and wastewater characterization 4 conclusions the link between aeration efficiency in wrrfs and wastewater characteristics with a special emphasis on biosorption capacity was extensively investigated the biosorption of surfactants and colloidal cod fractions impacted the oxygen transfer significantly this study provided ki 50 relative decrease in alpha levels for both surfactants and colloidal organics at 2 5 0 6 mg sds l 1 and 23 4 mg cod l 1 respectively this showed the high sensitivity of alpha towards these wastewater fractions in addition bioaugmentation of long srt sludge application of contact stabilization and implementation of anaerobic selectors all promoted biosorption of surfactants and therefore significantly increased oxygen transfer rates this study showed the convergence of strategies applied to improve settleability with improved aeration

cells remain viable dietersdorfer et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 in this viable but nonculturable vbnc state e coli o157 h7 cells maintain membrane integrity low metabolic activity and reduced nutrient transport and can retain expression of toxin genes and toxin production liu et al 2009 2010 other pathogens that produce adverse effects by toxin production may also pose a similar concern importantly vbnc cells are resistant to various fatal stresses fakruddin et al 2013 hou et al 2019 in the environment e coli o157 h7 cells can enter the vbnc state in response to nutrient starvation liu et al 2009 low temperature dinu and bach 2011 wei and zhao 2018 and osmotic imbalance asakura et al 2005 induction of e coli o157 h7 into the vbnc state was also observed during drinking water disinfection processes such as chloramination liu et al 2009 2019 li et al 2013 chen et al 2018 as well as during non thermal food pasteurization including treatments with high pressure co2 zhao et al 2016 or electrolyzed oxidizing water afari and hung 2018 vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells have been shown to be capable of resuscitation under conditions similar to those within the human intestine liu et al 2009 this raises a concern of potential human health effects related to vbnc exposure the resuscitation of vbnc e coli o157 h7 and their resulting culturability are facilitated by the presence of bacterial autoinducers liu et al 2009 reissbrodt et al 2002 pinto et al 2011 autoinducers are extracellular signalling molecules that aid in regulation of cell differentiation and virulence factor expression kell et al 1995 miller and bassler 2001 the majority of gram negative bacteria strains including e coli o157 h7 and commensal e coli inhabiting the human intestine walters et al 2006 can produce autoinducers in the presence of the hormone norepinephrine thus the human intestinal tract presents a hospitable environment for the potential resuscitation of vbnc e coli o157 h7 and the presence of vbnc cells in food and water pose a hidden risk of contamination this concern is supported by an e coli o157 h7 outbreak in japan caused by contaminated salted salmon roe which was suspected to be due to cells in the vbnc state makino et al 2000 microbial pathogens in drinking water are normally inactivated by disinfection treatments with the effectiveness of disinfection commonly monitored using e coli as an indicator organism jacangelo et al 1991 li et al 2017a 2017b waterborne outbreaks are caused when disinfection fails completely or is inadequate for the level of contamination challenge from the source water when there is failure in adequate disinfection the typical course of action is the commencement of a boil water advisory or order rather than the total shutdown of the water system boil water advisories or orders can have incomplete or ineffective compliance hyllestad et al 2019 jones bitton et al 2016 vedachalam et al 2016 and are not usually implemented until an epidemic is already underway hrudey and hrudey 2014 2004 unfortunately boil water advisories are too often put and or left in place rather than dealing with underlying contamination risks eggerton 2008 hrudey 2008 for point of use drinking water treatment using heat the world health organization who recommends bringing water to a rolling boil and then removing it from heat to allow it to cool naturally prior to storage no specific time for boiling is provided and the efficacy of the method against e coli o157 h7 is based on the results of studies that use a temperature range of 60 65 c for inactivation of culturable cells measured by log10 reductions over time no consideration of vbnc cells is indicated in any of the cited studies who 2015 thus it is unclear whether boiling is sufficient to inactivate vbnc e coli o157 h7 to generate pathogen free drinking water in addition to gas or electric cooktop heating microwave oven use is a widely adopted method of heating due to its considerable advantages over conventional techniques including reduced energy consumption and cooking time puligundla et al 2013 tang describes microwave heating as combining the effects of several processes the conversion of electric energy into thermal energy heat transfer through temperature gradients and interactions between microwaves and the heated material tang 2015 the efficacy of microwave heating against a variety of pathogens is well documented anantheswaran and ramaswamy 2001 a study of sponges soaked in 104 cfu of non pathogenic e coli reported that 30 s of microwaving on full power 2 450 mhz and 1 100 w was sufficient for complete inactivation measured using plate counts park et al 2006 because plate counts cannot detect vbnc bacteria it is unclear whether pathogenic e coli o157 h7 can persist in microwave heated drinking water by entering a vbnc state in the present study we aimed to investigate the efficacy of boiling and microwaving to inactivate e coli o157 h7 and prevent the resuscitation of vbnc e coli o157 h7 the presence of vbnc e coli o157 h7 after heat treatment was determined by the assessment of culturability and viability standard plating techniques were used to measure culturability while viability was assessed using two distinct assays a live dead baclight viability kit testing membrane integrity and a calcein acetoxymethyl ester am cell viability kit testing both enzyme activity and membrane integrity furthermore we investigated the resuscitation potential of the induced vbnc cells in the presence of autoinducers generated by non pathogenic e coli the results of this study show the existence and resuscitation of vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells after boiling or microwaving demonstrating the importance of adequate drinking water disinfection especially during boil water advisories to protect human health 2 material and methods 2 1 bacterial cultures and growth conditions three e coli o157 h7 isolates comprising one bovine isolate adriv241 supplied by the agri food laboratories branch alberta agriculture and rural development edmonton alberta canada and two clinical isolates md8249 and md8344 supplied by the alberta provincial laboratory of public health edmonton alberta canada and one non pathogenic e coli american type culture collection atcc 32518 atcc manassas va strain were used in this study each bacterium was streaked on a non selective tryptic soy agar tsa becton dickinson and company bd franklin lakes nj plate along with a negative control the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 c after 24 h a single colony was selected inoculated into 3 ml of tryptic soy broth tsb bd and incubated on a shaker 125 rpm for 12 h at 37 c the growth of the inoculated e coli o157 h7 was monitored using a smartspec 3000 spectrophotometer biorad hercules ca at 600 nm od600 optical density at 600 nm after overnight incubation the culture was diluted 50 times with tsb and incubated on the shaker 125 rpm for an additional 3 5 h at 37 c to reach an od600 value of approximately 0 9 indicating late log phase growth 2 2 treatment of e coli o157 h7 with boiling or microwaving cultures of e coli o157 h7 in late log phase growth each contained approximately 3 109 cells in 30 ml tsb the cells were harvested by centrifugation allegra 25r beckman coulter indianapolis in at 4000 rpm for 25 min and washed three times using autoclaved milli q water to eliminate excess nutrients from the culture media the washed cells were resuspended in 10 ml of sterile tap water conductivity 398 3 6 μs or autoclaved saline conductivity 15980 45 μs with conductivity measured using a traceable conductivity meter thermo fisher scientific waltham ma sterile tap water was prepared by vacuum filtering cold tap water through 0 22 μm pore size membranes millipore stericup gp vacuum filter units milliporesigma oakville on canada the tap water was collected from a tap at the university of alberta in edmonton alberta canada where tap water is treated with chlorine and chloramines the total residual chloramine in the collected tap water was 2 0 mg l determined using an autocat 9000 chlorine amperometric titrator hach loveland co saline 0 85 nacl milliporesigma was prepared in deionized water and autoclaved for sterilization isotonic saline 0 85 was selected as a control to ensure osmotic protection of the cells the washed and resuspended cells were transferred to a 500 ml erlenmeyer flask and topped up with either tap water or saline to a final volume of 200 ml resulting in a final concentration of 3 109 cells in 200 ml 1 5 107 cells ml resuspended e coli o157 h7 samples were boiled on a hot plate for 1 10 or 15 min boiling temperature 97 8 c resuspended e coli o157 h7 samples in a separate flask were microwaved for 1 5 min which was the amount of time required to reach boiling using a standard microwave oven model nn sd664w 2450 mhz 1200 w panasonic mississauga on canada after boiling or microwaving the treated cells were centrifuged and concentrated in 300 μl of saline and these samples were used for the investigation of culturability cell viability and resuscitation 2 3 determination of e coli o157 h7 culturability culturability was assessed by plating 50 μl of the concentrated sample of treated e coli o157 h7 cells 5 108 onto tsa plates which were incubated for 24 h at 37 c culturability was determined based on the formation of colonies on the tsa plates all experiments were performed three times with duplicate samples n 3 2 4 detection of e coli o157 h7 viability two different assays were used in parallel to test the viability of the cells treated by boiling or microwaving a live dead baclight bacterial viability assay molecular probes thermo fisher scientific was first used to evaluate cell membrane integrity this assay utilizes a mixture of green fluorescent nucleic acid stain syto 9 and red fluorescent nucleic acid stain propidium iodide pi syto 9 is a small molecule dye that can label all bacteria in a population with intact membranes or damaged membranes in contrast pi is a large molecule dye that penetrates only the bacteria with damaged membranes thus in this assay live cells appear in green whereas dead cells appear in red under fluorescence microscopy according to the manufacturer s protocol an aliquot of 10 μl of the concentrated cells 108 was mixed with 987 5 μl of 0 85 nacl solution and 2 5 μl of the dye mixture followed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature in the dark a 10 μl aliquot of the prepared sample was then pipetted onto a slide and covered with a coverslip viable cells were determined using an inverted fluorescence microscope axioobserver z1 zeiss oberkochen germany for each sample pictures were taken of 25 fields of view to determine the number of viable cells on three separate slides each treatment condition was tested in duplicate in three independent experiments n 3 to confirm the presence of viable cells the calcein am cell viability assay r d systems minneapolis mn was also used calcein am is a hydrophobic dye that readily passes through cell membranes into live cells when inside the dye is cleaved by intracellular esterases to release the hydrophilic and fluorescent calcein which has excitation emission maxima at 495 515 nm calcein is retained in the cytoplasm as long as the cell membrane is intact according to the manufacturer s protocol a 10 μl aliquot of the treated and concentrated cells 108 was resuspended in 85 μl of 1 calcein buffer and incubated with 5 μl of 10 μm calcein am working solution at 37 c for 30 min in the dark viable cells were determined using an inverted fluorescence microscope axioobserver z1 a 10 μl sample was pipetted onto a slide and coverslipped for each sample pictures of 25 fields of view were taken to determine the number of viable cells from each of three slides each treatment condition was tested in duplicate in three independent experiments n 3 2 5 preparation of autoinducers using non pathogenic e coli an overnight culture of the non pathogenic e coli strain 32158 was diluted 50 times with eagle s minimal essential medium emem gibco grand island ny containing 20 v v fetal bovine serum fbs gibco 10 mm hepes gibco and 50 μm l norepinephrine milliporesigma the cultures were incubated at 37 c on a shaker 125 rpm for 4 5 h negative controls containing no bacteria were prepared and incubated in parallel after 4 5 h incubation the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 25 min beckman coulter allegra 25r to isolate the autoinducers the culture supernatant and negative control supernatant were collected and sterilized by passage through a 0 22 μm syringe filter unit millex gs milliporesigma twice 2 6 resuscitation of vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells a 10 μl aliquot of each of the boiled or microwaved e coli o157 h7 cell 108 treatment groups were inoculated into resuscitation media 990 μl resuscitation media consisted of emem supplemented with 20 fbs v v 10 mm hepes 50 μm l norepinephrine and 1 10 v v of the culture supernatant containing autoinducers produced by the non pathogenic e coli described above the inoculated microcosms were maintained in 15 ml screw cap conical tubes corning inc corning ny at 37 c for 14 days without shaking duplicate samples were prepared for each test duplicate positive and negative controls were prepared and tested in parallel the positive control contained one or two culturable cells obtained by diluting late log phase e coli o157 h7 cultures while the negative control included resuscitation media without any cells a medium only negative control was also prepared and contained treated cells approximately 109 in 1 ml of tsb with no autoinducers and norepinephrine all experiments were performed independently three times n 3 2 7 reverse transcription and multiplex pcr rt mpcr rna extraction and rt mpcr reactions have been described previously in detail morin et al 2004 briefly total rna was extracted from cell pellets using trizol reagent invitrogen carlsbad ca the purity of the rna extracts was assessed by the a 260 to a 280 ratio which was determined using a nanovue plus spectrophotometer ge healthcare chicago il all rna extracts were found to have a ratio within the range of 1 8 2 0 indicating high purity rna extracts were treated with dnase i invitrogen to remove any contaminating dna and ensure that only rna would be amplified the rt reaction mixture contained 1 μg of total rna 250 ng of random primer 1 μl of 10 mm dntp mix 4 μl of 5 first strand buffer 2 μl of 0 1 m dithiothreitol 1 μl of rnaseout 1 μl of superscript ii reverse transcriptase 200 u μl 1 invitrogen and rnase free water to a final volume of 20 μl the rt reactions were performed in a geneamp pcr 2700 system applied biosystems thermo fisher scientific at 25 c for 10 min followed by heating at 70 c for 15 min controls were also prepared a negative control for the rt reactions containing all the reagents except for the rna template and a dnase control for each bacterium containing the rna template and all reagents except the superscript ii reverse transcriptase an aliquot of 5 μl of each rt reaction mixture was used as the cdna template for the subsequent mpcr reactions mpcr was performed using a multiplex pcr kit qiagen valencia ca as described previously morin et al 2004 primers were diluted with tris edta te buffer to generate a 10 primer mixture with 2 μm for the rfbe gene and 4 μm for the flic gene an mpcr reaction mixture was prepared containing 25 μl of qiagen mpcr master mix 5 μl of the 10 primer mixture containing primers of the rfbe and flic genes 5 μl from the rt reaction of each resuscitated bacterium and nuclease free water added to a final volume of 50 μl in parallel for each bacterium a dnase mpcr control containing all the mpcr reagents and 5 μl of the dnase control of each bacterium as template was prepared in addition two other negative controls were prepared an rt mpcr negative control which contained all the mpcr reagents including 5 μl of the rt negative control product as template and an mpcr negative control containing mpcr reagents and no template mpcr was performed in a geneamp pcr 2700 system using an initial denaturation at 95 c for 15 min amplification for 45 cycles with denaturation at 95 c for 30 s annealing at 60 c for 90 s and extension at 72 c for 90 s followed by a final extension at 72 c for 10 min 2 8 data analysis the effects of boiling duration and water type saline or tap water on induction of vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells were analyzed with an unpaired t test the effect of isolate type on induction of vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells were analyzed with one way analysis of variance anova graphpad prism 8 0 was used for the data analysis with significance set at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 survival of e coli o157 h7 after boiling both the culturability and viability of the boiled cells were examined to determine whether the tested conditions induce e coli 0157 h7 cells into a vbnc state fig s1b top image in the supporting information shows the tsa plate plated with e coli o157 h7 cells of the bovine isolate after boiling in tap water for 10 min no visible colonies were present on the plate indicating that the boiled cells were nonculturable the same result was observed for all three bacterial isolates in tap water or saline treated with boiling for 1 10 or 15 min plates not shown thus all three bacterial isolates in any of the boiled water samples were nonculturable two commercial kits were selected to examine the viability of the e coli o157 h7 cells after boiling fig s2 shows an example of the fluorescence data generated using the live dead baclight bacterial viability assay here the tap water samples containing cells of the md8249 isolate were boiled for 10 min fig s2a or 15 min fig s2b in fig s2a the green fluorescence indicates live cells were present in the boiled tap water among dead or damaged cells that fluoresced red both live and dead cells of each bacterial isolate were observed in all tap water and saline samples boiled for 1 or 10 min pictures not shown however in the tap water or saline samples boiled for 15 min only red fluorescence was observed fig s2b indicating 15 min is sufficient to inactivate all e coli o157 h7 cells of each isolate fig 1 shows the percentage of viable cells detected by the baclight assay in the treated tap water or saline samples after boiling for 1 or 10 min the viable cells green fluorescence accounted for as much as 2 5 approximately 2 106 5 5 106 cells of the initial cell population 108 cells after boiling because these viable cells were not culturable it is clear that a small number of cells were induced into the vbnc state thus boiling the contaminated tap water or saline for up to 10 min did not completely inactivate all e coli o157 h7 cells present statistical analysis of the results in fig 1 demonstrates that the bovine isolate had significantly fewer viable cells remaining in tap water than in saline after 10 min of boiling t test p 0 001 this indicates that chemicals present in the tap water such as the disinfectant chloramines may have enhanced damage to the bovine isolate cells as the tap water used was found to contain 2 0 mg l chloramine alternatively because the conductivity of saline was measured to be 40 higher than that of the tap water the lower osmotic pressure of the tap water could have influenced the ability of the cells to maintain membrane integrity however no significant difference between the tap water and saline samples was observed in either of the clinical isolates suggesting that bovine and clinical e coli o157 h7 isolates may have differing sensitivities to different treatments as has been observed with other microorganisms ma and bibby 2017 highmore et al 2018 increasing the boiling time from 1 to 10 min also significantly inactivated more cells of the clinical isolate md8344 t test p 0 01 and the bovine isolate t test p 0 01 in tap water with 15 min of boiling sufficient for complete inactivation of all three strains fig s2b overall these results suggest that a combination of longer boiling times the presence of chloramines or other chemicals in tap water and decreased osmotic pressure are likely to be more effective in damaging the cellular membranes of e coli o157 h7 resulting in cell death to confirm the presence of vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells in the boiled water samples we used a second viability assay the calcein am cell viability assay to further examine both enzymatic activity and membrane integrity fig s3 shows a representative example of the fluorescence data generated using the assay again using the tap water sample containing cells of the md8249 isolate boiled for 10 min the presence of cells that fluoresce green indicates viable cells were present in the tap water sample after boiling similarly a small number of viable cells in the saline and other tap water samples boiled for 1 or 10 min were also observed for all three bacterial isolates pictures not shown no green fluorescence was observed in any of the tap water or saline samples boiled for 15 min pictures not shown further supporting that 15 min of boiling is sufficient to inactivate e coli o157 h7 cells fig 2 shows the quantified fluorescence data determined using the calcein am assay representing the number of viable cells present in each boiled water sample these results support that although boiling for 1 or 10 min inactivated nearly all the cells 108 of the bovine and clinical isolates a very small number of cells 100 remained viable supporting the presence of cells in the vbnc state among the isolates the boiled tap water samples contained significantly fewer viable cells than their corresponding boiled saline samples fig 2 t test p 0 05 or p 0 01 the only exception was observed in the bovine isolate samples boiled for 10 min although fewer of these viable cells were detected in the tap water samples no significant difference between the water types was found nevertheless these results further suggest that disinfectants or other chemicals present in tap water or osmotic pressure effects may enhance damage to cell membranes and affect enzyme activity of the e coli o157 h7 isolates as well as the differing sensitivities to treatment among the isolates interestingly the number of viable cells determined using the calcein am assay approximately 28 87 were dramatically lower than that determined by the baclight assay 2 106 5 5 106 this is likely due to the fact that vbnc cells have significantly lower metabolic activity than culturable cells li et al 2014 thus some vbnc cells may not have sufficient metabolic function for intracellular esterase activity preventing a detectable signal with the calcein am assay though the cells are still viable however because enzyme activity is an indicator of metabolic activity díaz et al 2010 these detected cells are likely more metabolically active and the calcein am assay may be a more specific method for the detection of vbnc cells that pose the more immediate human health risk metabolically active vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells have been shown to be capable of producing verotoxin dinu and bach 2011 and thus may present a higher risk of virulence and pathogenicity nonetheless the results of both viability assays demonstrate that a small number of viable e coli o157 h7 cells survived within the vbnc state after boiling for 1 or 10 min with up to 15 min boiling required for complete inactivation 3 2 survival of e coli o157 h7 after microwaving microwave ovens are used to boil water for heated beverages or to heat food in the household thus in addition to boiling it is another means by which drinking water is heated in the home that may be erroneously assumed to achieve complete disinfection fig s1b bottom image shows a tsa plate plated with cells of the bovine isolate microwaved for 1 5 min in saline as observed in the boiled water samples all cells lost culturability 0 1 cfu ml in tap water or saline after microwaving plates not shown the viability of treated cells in the microwaved water samples was measured using both the baclight and the calcein am assays in parallel as was done with the boiled water samples fig 3 shows the number of viable cells present within the tap water and saline samples after microwaving detected using the baclight assay for all three isolates of e coli o157 h7 approximately 6 10 6 106 1 107 of the initial cells treated 108 remained viable which is roughly twice the number of viable cells detected in the water samples boiled for 1 or 10 min 2 106 5 5 106 2 5 contrary to what was observed with the boiled water treatments no significant difference between the number of viable cells in the microwaved tap water or saline samples was observed between any of the tested isolates these differences were likely influenced by the selected times for heating via the hotplate 1 min or 10 min boiling or the microwave 1 5 min total as the inconsistent heating times would result in differing effects on the viability of e coli o157 h7 cells fig 4 shows that the microwaved samples contained 21 to 108 viable cells out of the initial 108 cells when detected using the calcein am assay here the number of remaining viable cells of the bovine isolate in both the saline and tap water samples are significantly higher than that of the two clinical isolates anova p 0 001 thus the bovine isolate of e coli o157 h7 may be less susceptible to microwave treatment than human isolates of the bacteria indicating differences in isolate sensitivities compared to the number of viable cells present 28 87 after boiling for 1 or 10 min the number of viable cells 21 108 after microwaving are consistent for each isolate as determined using the calcein am assay although the tested heating methods had differing effects on viability these results support that a small number of vbnc cells are present in both tap water and saline samples after boiling or microwaving 3 3 resuscitation of vbnc e coli o157 h7 to assess the potential health risk of vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells induced by boiling or microwaving we investigated the resuscitation of vbnc cells in the presence of autoinducers produced by common non pathogenic e coli treated samples contained approximately 108 e coli o157 h7 cells including both vbnc cells and dead cells and were inoculated into resuscitation media containing autoinducers and norepinephrine as shown in fig 5 the resuscitation mixtures containing vbnc cells tube 3 became turbid with a significant color change observed after incubation for 5 days at 37 c the negative controls without treated cells remained clear showing no growth tube 2 likewise the media negative controls containing only tsb plus 109 treated cells without autoinducers or norepinephrine remained clear tube 4 with no observable growth even after 14 days incubation thus both norepinephrine and non pathogenic e coli derived autoinducers are necessary for resuscitation to confirm the resuscitated cells as e coli o157 h7 rt mpcr was used to assess the expression of rfbe and flic genes in all the tubes showing marked turbidity table s1 rfbe represents the e coli o157 lipopolysaccharide gene while flic represents the h7 flagellin gene morin et al 2004 both genes are specific markers of e coli o157 h7 fig s4 shows that the rt mpcr products of rfbe and flic genes were only detected in the resuscitated samples and not in any of the corresponding dnase mpcr controls confirming their origin from mrna the detection of mrna in the resuscitated samples supports the positive resuscitation of vbnc e coli o157 h7 and that it was not a result of contamination or carryover from the dna of dead cells the negative controls and the turbid solutions were separately cultured onto tsa plates to confirm resuscitation via culturability the turbid solutions from the md8249 isolate in tap water boiled for 10 min fig s1d top and the bovine isolate in saline boiled for 10 min fig s1d bottom clearly produced colonies whereas the negative controls did not form any colonies fig s1c likewise all other turbid samples of each of the three isolates receiving the different treatment conditions produced colonies on tsa plates plates not shown confirming their culturability the color change turbidity genetic expression of rfbe and flic and colony formation support that the vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells induced after boiling or microwaving can successfully resuscitate table 1 summarizes the resuscitation results of the vbnc cells generated by either boiling or microwaving in tap water or saline for the boiled samples only those boiled for 10 min were examined for resuscitation because no significant difference in the number of vbnc cells remaining was observed between the 1 min and 10 min boiling treatment groups for each isolate fig 2 determined using the calcein am assay moreover there were significantly fewer vbnc cells detected in both the clinical isolate md8344 and the bovine isolate in tap water after boiling for 10 min in comparison to the 1 min boiling treatment groups fig 1 as detected using the baclight assay all samples after boiling for 10 min showed at least one positive resuscitation with the highest resuscitation rates found for isolate md8249 5 out of 6 samples in saline and the bovine isolate 3 out of 6 samples in tap water in contrast the resuscitation rate of the vbnc cells generated by microwaving is much less frequent only three positive resuscitations were observed among the three isolates in either tap water or saline our results suggest that microwaving may be a more effective method to prevent the resuscitation of e coli o157 h7 in comparison to the more traditionally used method of boiling water via hot plate this was an unexpected result as more viable cells with intact membranes were detected in the microwaved water samples than the boiled water samples figs 1 and 3 thus microwaving may more strongly affect the reproductive viability of vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells though the cells remain viable they may be too damaged to reproduce under conditions that promote resuscitation while the evidence for thermal effects of microwave heating on microorganisms is clear some evidence exists supporting enhanced thermal and or non thermal effects in comparison to conventional heating microwave heating is much more uneven causing a non uniform temperature distribution within the heated product that can result in bacterial heat injury anantheswaran and ramaswamy 2001 koutchma et al 2001 enzyme inactivation has also been reported as a result of microwave energy kermasha et al 1993a 1993b porcelli et al 1997 which may be sufficient to disrupt non covalent bonds in a study of e coli shamis et al 2011 found that microwaving cells at non lethal temperatures resulted in reversible damage to cellular membranes causing a temporary leakage of cytosolic fluids hence it is plausible that the microwaved vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells experienced minor or reversible cellular damage that allowed them to retain viability but not reproductive viability nevertheless microwaving may be an effective method to prevent resuscitation of vbnc cells and further research is necessary to understand the implications of microwaving for point of use water disinfection as mentioned previously the who only recommends bringing water to a rolling boil prior to cooling while the cdc suggests boiling for 1 3 min prior to cooling cdc 2020b the results of this study demonstrate that vbnc e coli o157 h7 induced by boiling or microwaving successfully regained growth when cultured in resuscitation media containing autoinducers produced by non pathogenic e coli and norepinephrine because both norepinephrine and non pathogenic e coli in large numbers exist in the human intestine walters et al 2006 freestone et al 1999 vbnc e coli o157 h7 present in the human intestine could potentially resuscitate if ingested previous reports have shown that vbnc vibrio cholera o1 could be recovered in the human intestine colwell et al 1996 and vbnc e coli o157 h7 may have contributed to an outbreak in japan in salted salmon roe makino et al 2000 suggesting the vbnc cells retain virulence our previous study of e coli o157 h7 demonstrated that vbnc cells retain expression of shiga like toxin stx genes and proteins and once resuscitated are infective and cytotoxic to mammalian kidney cells liu et al 2010 the number of viable and metabolically active vbnc cells detected in our water samples after heat treatment were on the same order of magnitude as the known infectious dose 10 100 cfu of e coli o157 h7 lim et al 2010 although a much higher concentration of culturable cells 1 5 107 cells ml were inoculated into the water samples prior to boiling than would be expected during a waterborne outbreak in municipally treated water however with super shedder cattle capable of shedding 107 cfu of e coli o157 h7 g of feces chase topping et al 2007 a significant risk may remain for the estimated two billion people globally using drinking water contaminated with feces who 2017 han et al 2020 altogether this study demonstrates that vbnc cells appear to undermine confidence in the efficacy of boiling water for managing the risk of pathogen exposure in drinking water because these methods may not be adequate to fully inactivate e coli o157 h7 cells due to their ability to hide within the vbnc state at point of use water disinfection using heat treatment boiling water for 15 min may be necessary to completely inactive this pathogen 4 conclusions this study has presented evidence of the survival of a small number of e coli o157 h7 cells of one bovine and two clinical isolates in the vbnc state even after boiling for 1 10 min or microwaving for 1 5 min in tap water or saline importantly these vbnc cells can be resuscitated under suitable conditions consisting of non pathogenic e coli autoinducers and norepinephrine to eliminate this potential risk when drinking water is suspected to be contaminated boiling the water for 15 min may be needed for complete inactivation of this waterborne pathogen boiling is simple and effective but only when it is well

17769,we report the existence and resuscitation of viable but nonculturable vbnc escherichia coli o157 h7 cells in drinking water induced by the common point of use disinfection treatments of boiling or microwaving tap water and saline samples containing e coli o157 h7 culturable cells from a bovine isolate or two clinical isolates were boiled 1 10 or 15 min on a hot plate or microwaved 1 5 min to reach boiling no culturable e coli o157 h7 cells were observed in the treated samples using conventional plating methods in samples boiled for 1 or 10 min two viability assays separately detected that 2 5 5 of the cells retained an intact membrane while 28 to 87 cells out of the initial 108 cells retained both measurable intracellular esterase activity and membrane integrity in samples boiled for 15 min no viable cells were detected the microwaved samples contained 6 10 of cells with an intact membrane while 21 to 108 cells out of the initial 108 cells retained both membrane integrity and esterase activity the number of viable cells retaining both metabolic activity and membrane integrity were consistent in all samples supporting the survival of a small number of e coli o157 h7 cells in the vbnc state after boiling for 1 or 10 min or microwaving furthermore the vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells regained growth at 37 c in culture media containing autoinducers produced by common non pathogenic e coli commonly present in the human intestine and norepinephrine the resuscitated cells were culturable on conventional plates and expressed mrna encoding the e coli o157 lipopolysaccharide gene rfbe and the h7 flagellin gene flic this study highlights potential concerns for public health risk management of vbnc e coli o157 h7 in drinking water disinfected by heat treatment at point of use the public health significance of these concerns warrants further investigation graphical abstract image 1 keywords e coli o157 h7 viable but nonculturable vbnc disinfection boiling microwave resuscitation 1 introduction escherichia coli o157 h7 infection is an important global health issue in both developing and developed countries it has a low infectious dose of 10 100 colony forming units cfu and can cause bloody diarrhea hemolytic uremic syndrome hus and even death in humans lim et al 2010 healthy carrier cattle are a major reservoir of e coli o157 h7 pruimboom brees et al 2000 and transmission from cattle to humans occurs primarily via foodborne and in some cases by waterborne routes pruimboom brees et al 2000 lee et al 2002 food products such as ground beef and raw milk and fresh produce including spinach lettuce and radish sprouts are the most common sources for disease outbreaks lim et al 2010 doyle 1991 gagliardi and karns 2000 tyagi et al 2019 several waterborne outbreaks in drinking water caused by e coli o157 h7 have been reported including cabool missouri usa 1989 saitama japan 1990 freuchie scotland 1995 alpine wyoming usa 1998 washington county new york usa 1999 walkerton ontario canada 2000 hrudey and hrudey 2004 waterborne disease outbreaks are not uniformly reported but these publicly documented outbreaks collectively caused 15 deaths about 70 cases of hus and more than 8 000 cases of gastrointestinal disease the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc has estimated that e coli o157 infections cause roughly 97 000 illnesses 3 300 hospitalizations and 30 deaths annually in the united states scallan et al 2011 clinical treatment for e coli o157 h7 infection is limited to supportive therapy as the use of antibiotics can increase the risk of hus cdc 2020a management of exposure to this pathogen is essential to prevent and control infection a significant challenge for risk management is that monitoring e coli o157 h7 in the environment is undermined by the ability of the pathogen to enter a dormant state that results in the loss of culturability on conventional culture media though the cells remain viable dietersdorfer et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 in this viable but nonculturable vbnc state e coli o157 h7 cells maintain membrane integrity low metabolic activity and reduced nutrient transport and can retain expression of toxin genes and toxin production liu et al 2009 2010 other pathogens that produce adverse effects by toxin production may also pose a similar concern importantly vbnc cells are resistant to various fatal stresses fakruddin et al 2013 hou et al 2019 in the environment e coli o157 h7 cells can enter the vbnc state in response to nutrient starvation liu et al 2009 low temperature dinu and bach 2011 wei and zhao 2018 and osmotic imbalance asakura et al 2005 induction of e coli o157 h7 into the vbnc state was also observed during drinking water disinfection processes such as chloramination liu et al 2009 2019 li et al 2013 chen et al 2018 as well as during non thermal food pasteurization including treatments with high pressure co2 zhao et al 2016 or electrolyzed oxidizing water afari and hung 2018 vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells have been shown to be capable of resuscitation under conditions similar to those within the human intestine liu et al 2009 this raises a concern of potential human health effects related to vbnc exposure the resuscitation of vbnc e coli o157 h7 and their resulting culturability are facilitated by the presence of bacterial autoinducers liu et al 2009 reissbrodt et al 2002 pinto et al 2011 autoinducers are extracellular signalling molecules that aid in regulation of cell differentiation and virulence factor expression kell et al 1995 miller and bassler 2001 the majority of gram negative bacteria strains including e coli o157 h7 and commensal e coli inhabiting the human intestine walters et al 2006 can produce autoinducers in the presence of the hormone norepinephrine thus the human intestinal tract presents a hospitable environment for the potential resuscitation of vbnc e coli o157 h7 and the presence of vbnc cells in food and water pose a hidden risk of contamination this concern is supported by an e coli o157 h7 outbreak in japan caused by contaminated salted salmon roe which was suspected to be due to cells in the vbnc state makino et al 2000 microbial pathogens in drinking water are normally inactivated by disinfection treatments with the effectiveness of disinfection commonly monitored using e coli as an indicator organism jacangelo et al 1991 li et al 2017a 2017b waterborne outbreaks are caused when disinfection fails completely or is inadequate for the level of contamination challenge from the source water when there is failure in adequate disinfection the typical course of action is the commencement of a boil water advisory or order rather than the total shutdown of the water system boil water advisories or orders can have incomplete or ineffective compliance hyllestad et al 2019 jones bitton et al 2016 vedachalam et al 2016 and are not usually implemented until an epidemic is already underway hrudey and hrudey 2014 2004 unfortunately boil water advisories are too often put and or left in place rather than dealing with underlying contamination risks eggerton 2008 hrudey 2008 for point of use drinking water treatment using heat the world health organization who recommends bringing water to a rolling boil and then removing it from heat to allow it to cool naturally prior to storage no specific time for boiling is provided and the efficacy of the method against e coli o157 h7 is based on the results of studies that use a temperature range of 60 65 c for inactivation of culturable cells measured by log10 reductions over time no consideration of vbnc cells is indicated in any of the cited studies who 2015 thus it is unclear whether boiling is sufficient to inactivate vbnc e coli o157 h7 to generate pathogen free drinking water in addition to gas or electric cooktop heating microwave oven use is a widely adopted method of heating due to its considerable advantages over conventional techniques including reduced energy consumption and cooking time puligundla et al 2013 tang describes microwave heating as combining the effects of several processes the conversion of electric energy into thermal energy heat transfer through temperature gradients and interactions between microwaves and the heated material tang 2015 the efficacy of microwave heating against a variety of pathogens is well documented anantheswaran and ramaswamy 2001 a study of sponges soaked in 104 cfu of non pathogenic e coli reported that 30 s of microwaving on full power 2 450 mhz and 1 100 w was sufficient for complete inactivation measured using plate counts park et al 2006 because plate counts cannot detect vbnc bacteria it is unclear whether pathogenic e coli o157 h7 can persist in microwave heated drinking water by entering a vbnc state in the present study we aimed to investigate the efficacy of boiling and microwaving to inactivate e coli o157 h7 and prevent the resuscitation of vbnc e coli o157 h7 the presence of vbnc e coli o157 h7 after heat treatment was determined by the assessment of culturability and viability standard plating techniques were used to measure culturability while viability was assessed using two distinct assays a live dead baclight viability kit testing membrane integrity and a calcein acetoxymethyl ester am cell viability kit testing both enzyme activity and membrane integrity furthermore we investigated the resuscitation potential of the induced vbnc cells in the presence of autoinducers generated by non pathogenic e coli the results of this study show the existence and resuscitation of vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells after boiling or microwaving demonstrating the importance of adequate drinking water disinfection especially during boil water advisories to protect human health 2 material and methods 2 1 bacterial cultures and growth conditions three e coli o157 h7 isolates comprising one bovine isolate adriv241 supplied by the agri food laboratories branch alberta agriculture and rural development edmonton alberta canada and two clinical isolates md8249 and md8344 supplied by the alberta provincial laboratory of public health edmonton alberta canada and one non pathogenic e coli american type culture collection atcc 32518 atcc manassas va strain were used in this study each bacterium was streaked on a non selective tryptic soy agar tsa becton dickinson and company bd franklin lakes nj plate along with a negative control the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 c after 24 h a single colony was selected inoculated into 3 ml of tryptic soy broth tsb bd and incubated on a shaker 125 rpm for 12 h at 37 c the growth of the inoculated e coli o157 h7 was monitored using a smartspec 3000 spectrophotometer biorad hercules ca at 600 nm od600 optical density at 600 nm after overnight incubation the culture was diluted 50 times with tsb and incubated on the shaker 125 rpm for an additional 3 5 h at 37 c to reach an od600 value of approximately 0 9 indicating late log phase growth 2 2 treatment of e coli o157 h7 with boiling or microwaving cultures of e coli o157 h7 in late log phase growth each contained approximately 3 109 cells in 30 ml tsb the cells were harvested by centrifugation allegra 25r beckman coulter indianapolis in at 4000 rpm for 25 min and washed three times using autoclaved milli q water to eliminate excess nutrients from the culture media the washed cells were resuspended in 10 ml of sterile tap water conductivity 398 3 6 μs or autoclaved saline conductivity 15980 45 μs with conductivity measured using a traceable conductivity meter thermo fisher scientific waltham ma sterile tap water was prepared by vacuum filtering cold tap water through 0 22 μm pore size membranes millipore stericup gp vacuum filter units milliporesigma oakville on canada the tap water was collected from a tap at the university of alberta in edmonton alberta canada where tap water is treated with chlorine and chloramines the total residual chloramine in the collected tap water was 2 0 mg l determined using an autocat 9000 chlorine amperometric titrator hach loveland co saline 0 85 nacl milliporesigma was prepared in deionized water and autoclaved for sterilization isotonic saline 0 85 was selected as a control to ensure osmotic protection of the cells the washed and resuspended cells were transferred to a 500 ml erlenmeyer flask and topped up with either tap water or saline to a final volume of 200 ml resulting in a final concentration of 3 109 cells in 200 ml 1 5 107 cells ml resuspended e coli o157 h7 samples were boiled on a hot plate for 1 10 or 15 min boiling temperature 97 8 c resuspended e coli o157 h7 samples in a separate flask were microwaved for 1 5 min which was the amount of time required to reach boiling using a standard microwave oven model nn sd664w 2450 mhz 1200 w panasonic mississauga on canada after boiling or microwaving the treated cells were centrifuged and concentrated in 300 μl of saline and these samples were used for the investigation of culturability cell viability and resuscitation 2 3 determination of e coli o157 h7 culturability culturability was assessed by plating 50 μl of the concentrated sample of treated e coli o157 h7 cells 5 108 onto tsa plates which were incubated for 24 h at 37 c culturability was determined based on the formation of colonies on the tsa plates all experiments were performed three times with duplicate samples n 3 2 4 detection of e coli o157 h7 viability two different assays were used in parallel to test the viability of the cells treated by boiling or microwaving a live dead baclight bacterial viability assay molecular probes thermo fisher scientific was first used to evaluate cell membrane integrity this assay utilizes a mixture of green fluorescent nucleic acid stain syto 9 and red fluorescent nucleic acid stain propidium iodide pi syto 9 is a small molecule dye that can label all bacteria in a population with intact membranes or damaged membranes in contrast pi is a large molecule dye that penetrates only the bacteria with damaged membranes thus in this assay live cells appear in green whereas dead cells appear in red under fluorescence microscopy according to the manufacturer s protocol an aliquot of 10 μl of the concentrated cells 108 was mixed with 987 5 μl of 0 85 nacl solution and 2 5 μl of the dye mixture followed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature in the dark a 10 μl aliquot of the prepared sample was then pipetted onto a slide and covered with a coverslip viable cells were determined using an inverted fluorescence microscope axioobserver z1 zeiss oberkochen germany for each sample pictures were taken of 25 fields of view to determine the number of viable cells on three separate slides each treatment condition was tested in duplicate in three independent experiments n 3 to confirm the presence of viable cells the calcein am cell viability assay r d systems minneapolis mn was also used calcein am is a hydrophobic dye that readily passes through cell membranes into live cells when inside the dye is cleaved by intracellular esterases to release the hydrophilic and fluorescent calcein which has excitation emission maxima at 495 515 nm calcein is retained in the cytoplasm as long as the cell membrane is intact according to the manufacturer s protocol a 10 μl aliquot of the treated and concentrated cells 108 was resuspended in 85 μl of 1 calcein buffer and incubated with 5 μl of 10 μm calcein am working solution at 37 c for 30 min in the dark viable cells were determined using an inverted fluorescence microscope axioobserver z1 a 10 μl sample was pipetted onto a slide and coverslipped for each sample pictures of 25 fields of view were taken to determine the number of viable cells from each of three slides each treatment condition was tested in duplicate in three independent experiments n 3 2 5 preparation of autoinducers using non pathogenic e coli an overnight culture of the non pathogenic e coli strain 32158 was diluted 50 times with eagle s minimal essential medium emem gibco grand island ny containing 20 v v fetal bovine serum fbs gibco 10 mm hepes gibco and 50 μm l norepinephrine milliporesigma the cultures were incubated at 37 c on a shaker 125 rpm for 4 5 h negative controls containing no bacteria were prepared and incubated in parallel after 4 5 h incubation the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 25 min beckman coulter allegra 25r to isolate the autoinducers the culture supernatant and negative control supernatant were collected and sterilized by passage through a 0 22 μm syringe filter unit millex gs milliporesigma twice 2 6 resuscitation of vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells a 10 μl aliquot of each of the boiled or microwaved e coli o157 h7 cell 108 treatment groups were inoculated into resuscitation media 990 μl resuscitation media consisted of emem supplemented with 20 fbs v v 10 mm hepes 50 μm l norepinephrine and 1 10 v v of the culture supernatant containing autoinducers produced by the non pathogenic e coli described above the inoculated microcosms were maintained in 15 ml screw cap conical tubes corning inc corning ny at 37 c for 14 days without shaking duplicate samples were prepared for each test duplicate positive and negative controls were prepared and tested in parallel the positive control contained one or two culturable cells obtained by diluting late log phase e coli o157 h7 cultures while the negative control included resuscitation media without any cells a medium only negative control was also prepared and contained treated cells approximately 109 in 1 ml of tsb with no autoinducers and norepinephrine all experiments were performed independently three times n 3 2 7 reverse transcription and multiplex pcr rt mpcr rna extraction and rt mpcr reactions have been described previously in detail morin et al 2004 briefly total rna was extracted from cell pellets using trizol reagent invitrogen carlsbad ca the purity of the rna extracts was assessed by the a 260 to a 280 ratio which was determined using a nanovue plus spectrophotometer ge healthcare chicago il all rna extracts were found to have a ratio within the range of 1 8 2 0 indicating high purity rna extracts were treated with dnase i invitrogen to remove any contaminating dna and ensure that only rna would be amplified the rt reaction mixture contained 1 μg of total rna 250 ng of random primer 1 μl of 10 mm dntp mix 4 μl of 5 first strand buffer 2 μl of 0 1 m dithiothreitol 1 μl of rnaseout 1 μl of superscript ii reverse transcriptase 200 u μl 1 invitrogen and rnase free water to a final volume of 20 μl the rt reactions were performed in a geneamp pcr 2700 system applied biosystems thermo fisher scientific at 25 c for 10 min followed by heating at 70 c for 15 min controls were also prepared a negative control for the rt reactions containing all the reagents except for the rna template and a dnase control for each bacterium containing the rna template and all reagents except the superscript ii reverse transcriptase an aliquot of 5 μl of each rt reaction mixture was used as the cdna template for the subsequent mpcr reactions mpcr was performed using a multiplex pcr kit qiagen valencia ca as described previously morin et al 2004 primers were diluted with tris edta te buffer to generate a 10 primer mixture with 2 μm for the rfbe gene and 4 μm for the flic gene an mpcr reaction mixture was prepared containing 25 μl of qiagen mpcr master mix 5 μl of the 10 primer mixture containing primers of the rfbe and flic genes 5 μl from the rt reaction of each resuscitated bacterium and nuclease free water added to a final volume of 50 μl in parallel for each bacterium a dnase mpcr control containing all the mpcr reagents and 5 μl of the dnase control of each bacterium as template was prepared in addition two other negative controls were prepared an rt mpcr negative control which contained all the mpcr reagents including 5 μl of the rt negative control product as template and an mpcr negative control containing mpcr reagents and no template mpcr was performed in a geneamp pcr 2700 system using an initial denaturation at 95 c for 15 min amplification for 45 cycles with denaturation at 95 c for 30 s annealing at 60 c for 90 s and extension at 72 c for 90 s followed by a final extension at 72 c for 10 min 2 8 data analysis the effects of boiling duration and water type saline or tap water on induction of vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells were analyzed with an unpaired t test the effect of isolate type on induction of vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells were analyzed with one way analysis of variance anova graphpad prism 8 0 was used for the data analysis with significance set at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 survival of e coli o157 h7 after boiling both the culturability and viability of the boiled cells were examined to determine whether the tested conditions induce e coli 0157 h7 cells into a vbnc state fig s1b top image in the supporting information shows the tsa plate plated with e coli o157 h7 cells of the bovine isolate after boiling in tap water for 10 min no visible colonies were present on the plate indicating that the boiled cells were nonculturable the same result was observed for all three bacterial isolates in tap water or saline treated with boiling for 1 10 or 15 min plates not shown thus all three bacterial isolates in any of the boiled water samples were nonculturable two commercial kits were selected to examine the viability of the e coli o157 h7 cells after boiling fig s2 shows an example of the fluorescence data generated using the live dead baclight bacterial viability assay here the tap water samples containing cells of the md8249 isolate were boiled for 10 min fig s2a or 15 min fig s2b in fig s2a the green fluorescence indicates live cells were present in the boiled tap water among dead or damaged cells that fluoresced red both live and dead cells of each bacterial isolate were observed in all tap water and saline samples boiled for 1 or 10 min pictures not shown however in the tap water or saline samples boiled for 15 min only red fluorescence was observed fig s2b indicating 15 min is sufficient to inactivate all e coli o157 h7 cells of each isolate fig 1 shows the percentage of viable cells detected by the baclight assay in the treated tap water or saline samples after boiling for 1 or 10 min the viable cells green fluorescence accounted for as much as 2 5 approximately 2 106 5 5 106 cells of the initial cell population 108 cells after boiling because these viable cells were not culturable it is clear that a small number of cells were induced into the vbnc state thus boiling the contaminated tap water or saline for up to 10 min did not completely inactivate all e coli o157 h7 cells present statistical analysis of the results in fig 1 demonstrates that the bovine isolate had significantly fewer viable cells remaining in tap water than in saline after 10 min of boiling t test p 0 001 this indicates that chemicals present in the tap water such as the disinfectant chloramines may have enhanced damage to the bovine isolate cells as the tap water used was found to contain 2 0 mg l chloramine alternatively because the conductivity of saline was measured to be 40 higher than that of the tap water the lower osmotic pressure of the tap water could have influenced the ability of the cells to maintain membrane integrity however no significant difference between the tap water and saline samples was observed in either of the clinical isolates suggesting that bovine and clinical e coli o157 h7 isolates may have differing sensitivities to different treatments as has been observed with other microorganisms ma and bibby 2017 highmore et al 2018 increasing the boiling time from 1 to 10 min also significantly inactivated more cells of the clinical isolate md8344 t test p 0 01 and the bovine isolate t test p 0 01 in tap water with 15 min of boiling sufficient for complete inactivation of all three strains fig s2b overall these results suggest that a combination of longer boiling times the presence of chloramines or other chemicals in tap water and decreased osmotic pressure are likely to be more effective in damaging the cellular membranes of e coli o157 h7 resulting in cell death to confirm the presence of vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells in the boiled water samples we used a second viability assay the calcein am cell viability assay to further examine both enzymatic activity and membrane integrity fig s3 shows a representative example of the fluorescence data generated using the assay again using the tap water sample containing cells of the md8249 isolate boiled for 10 min the presence of cells that fluoresce green indicates viable cells were present in the tap water sample after boiling similarly a small number of viable cells in the saline and other tap water samples boiled for 1 or 10 min were also observed for all three bacterial isolates pictures not shown no green fluorescence was observed in any of the tap water or saline samples boiled for 15 min pictures not shown further supporting that 15 min of boiling is sufficient to inactivate e coli o157 h7 cells fig 2 shows the quantified fluorescence data determined using the calcein am assay representing the number of viable cells present in each boiled water sample these results support that although boiling for 1 or 10 min inactivated nearly all the cells 108 of the bovine and clinical isolates a very small number of cells 100 remained viable supporting the presence of cells in the vbnc state among the isolates the boiled tap water samples contained significantly fewer viable cells than their corresponding boiled saline samples fig 2 t test p 0 05 or p 0 01 the only exception was observed in the bovine isolate samples boiled for 10 min although fewer of these viable cells were detected in the tap water samples no significant difference between the water types was found nevertheless these results further suggest that disinfectants or other chemicals present in tap water or osmotic pressure effects may enhance damage to cell membranes and affect enzyme activity of the e coli o157 h7 isolates as well as the differing sensitivities to treatment among the isolates interestingly the number of viable cells determined using the calcein am assay approximately 28 87 were dramatically lower than that determined by the baclight assay 2 106 5 5 106 this is likely due to the fact that vbnc cells have significantly lower metabolic activity than culturable cells li et al 2014 thus some vbnc cells may not have sufficient metabolic function for intracellular esterase activity preventing a detectable signal with the calcein am assay though the cells are still viable however because enzyme activity is an indicator of metabolic activity díaz et al 2010 these detected cells are likely more metabolically active and the calcein am assay may be a more specific method for the detection of vbnc cells that pose the more immediate human health risk metabolically active vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells have been shown to be capable of producing verotoxin dinu and bach 2011 and thus may present a higher risk of virulence and pathogenicity nonetheless the results of both viability assays demonstrate that a small number of viable e coli o157 h7 cells survived within the vbnc state after boiling for 1 or 10 min with up to 15 min boiling required for complete inactivation 3 2 survival of e coli o157 h7 after microwaving microwave ovens are used to boil water for heated beverages or to heat food in the household thus in addition to boiling it is another means by which drinking water is heated in the home that may be erroneously assumed to achieve complete disinfection fig s1b bottom image shows a tsa plate plated with cells of the bovine isolate microwaved for 1 5 min in saline as observed in the boiled water samples all cells lost culturability 0 1 cfu ml in tap water or saline after microwaving plates not shown the viability of treated cells in the microwaved water samples was measured using both the baclight and the calcein am assays in parallel as was done with the boiled water samples fig 3 shows the number of viable cells present within the tap water and saline samples after microwaving detected using the baclight assay for all three isolates of e coli o157 h7 approximately 6 10 6 106 1 107 of the initial cells treated 108 remained viable which is roughly twice the number of viable cells detected in the water samples boiled for 1 or 10 min 2 106 5 5 106 2 5 contrary to what was observed with the boiled water treatments no significant difference between the number of viable cells in the microwaved tap water or saline samples was observed between any of the tested isolates these differences were likely influenced by the selected times for heating via the hotplate 1 min or 10 min boiling or the microwave 1 5 min total as the inconsistent heating times would result in differing effects on the viability of e coli o157 h7 cells fig 4 shows that the microwaved samples contained 21 to 108 viable cells out of the initial 108 cells when detected using the calcein am assay here the number of remaining viable cells of the bovine isolate in both the saline and tap water samples are significantly higher than that of the two clinical isolates anova p 0 001 thus the bovine isolate of e coli o157 h7 may be less susceptible to microwave treatment than human isolates of the bacteria indicating differences in isolate sensitivities compared to the number of viable cells present 28 87 after boiling for 1 or 10 min the number of viable cells 21 108 after microwaving are consistent for each isolate as determined using the calcein am assay although the tested heating methods had differing effects on viability these results support that a small number of vbnc cells are present in both tap water and saline samples after boiling or microwaving 3 3 resuscitation of vbnc e coli o157 h7 to assess the potential health risk of vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells induced by boiling or microwaving we investigated the resuscitation of vbnc cells in the presence of autoinducers produced by common non pathogenic e coli treated samples contained approximately 108 e coli o157 h7 cells including both vbnc cells and dead cells and were inoculated into resuscitation media containing autoinducers and norepinephrine as shown in fig 5 the resuscitation mixtures containing vbnc cells tube 3 became turbid with a significant color change observed after incubation for 5 days at 37 c the negative controls without treated cells remained clear showing no growth tube 2 likewise the media negative controls containing only tsb plus 109 treated cells without autoinducers or norepinephrine remained clear tube 4 with no observable growth even after 14 days incubation thus both norepinephrine and non pathogenic e coli derived autoinducers are necessary for resuscitation to confirm the resuscitated cells as e coli o157 h7 rt mpcr was used to assess the expression of rfbe and flic genes in all the tubes showing marked turbidity table s1 rfbe represents the e coli o157 lipopolysaccharide gene while flic represents the h7 flagellin gene morin et al 2004 both genes are specific markers of e coli o157 h7 fig s4 shows that the rt mpcr products of rfbe and flic genes were only detected in the resuscitated samples and not in any of the corresponding dnase mpcr controls confirming their origin from mrna the detection of mrna in the resuscitated samples supports the positive resuscitation of vbnc e coli o157 h7 and that it was not a result of contamination or carryover from the dna of dead cells the negative controls and the turbid solutions were separately cultured onto tsa plates to confirm resuscitation via culturability the turbid solutions from the md8249 isolate in tap water boiled for 10 min fig s1d top and the bovine isolate in saline boiled for 10 min fig s1d bottom clearly produced colonies whereas the negative controls did not form any colonies fig s1c likewise all other turbid samples of each of the three isolates receiving the different treatment conditions produced colonies on tsa plates plates not shown confirming their culturability the color change turbidity genetic expression of rfbe and flic and colony formation support that the vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells induced after boiling or microwaving can successfully resuscitate table 1 summarizes the resuscitation results of the vbnc cells generated by either boiling or microwaving in tap water or saline for the boiled samples only those boiled for 10 min were examined for resuscitation because no significant difference in the number of vbnc cells remaining was observed between the 1 min and 10 min boiling treatment groups for each isolate fig 2 determined using the calcein am assay moreover there were significantly fewer vbnc cells detected in both the clinical isolate md8344 and the bovine isolate in tap water after boiling for 10 min in comparison to the 1 min boiling treatment groups fig 1 as detected using the baclight assay all samples after boiling for 10 min showed at least one positive resuscitation with the highest resuscitation rates found for isolate md8249 5 out of 6 samples in saline and the bovine isolate 3 out of 6 samples in tap water in contrast the resuscitation rate of the vbnc cells generated by microwaving is much less frequent only three positive resuscitations were observed among the three isolates in either tap water or saline our results suggest that microwaving may be a more effective method to prevent the resuscitation of e coli o157 h7 in comparison to the more traditionally used method of boiling water via hot plate this was an unexpected result as more viable cells with intact membranes were detected in the microwaved water samples than the boiled water samples figs 1 and 3 thus microwaving may more strongly affect the reproductive viability of vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells though the cells remain viable they may be too damaged to reproduce under conditions that promote resuscitation while the evidence for thermal effects of microwave heating on microorganisms is clear some evidence exists supporting enhanced thermal and or non thermal effects in comparison to conventional heating microwave heating is much more uneven causing a non uniform temperature distribution within the heated product that can result in bacterial heat injury anantheswaran and ramaswamy 2001 koutchma et al 2001 enzyme inactivation has also been reported as a result of microwave energy kermasha et al 1993a 1993b porcelli et al 1997 which may be sufficient to disrupt non covalent bonds in a study of e coli shamis et al 2011 found that microwaving cells at non lethal temperatures resulted in reversible damage to cellular membranes causing a temporary leakage of cytosolic fluids hence it is plausible that the microwaved vbnc e coli o157 h7 cells experienced minor or reversible cellular damage that allowed them to retain viability but not reproductive viability nevertheless microwaving may be an effective method to prevent resuscitation of vbnc cells and further research is necessary to understand the implications of microwaving for point of use water disinfection as mentioned previously the who only recommends bringing water to a rolling boil prior to cooling while the cdc suggests boiling for 1 3 min prior to cooling cdc 2020b the results of this study demonstrate that vbnc e coli o157 h7 induced by boiling or microwaving successfully regained growth when cultured in resuscitation media containing autoinducers produced by non pathogenic e coli and norepinephrine because both norepinephrine and non pathogenic e coli in large numbers exist in the human intestine walters et al 2006 freestone et al 1999 vbnc e coli o157 h7 present in the human intestine could potentially resuscitate if ingested previous reports have shown that vbnc vibrio cholera o1 could be recovered in the human intestine colwell et al 1996 and vbnc e coli o157 h7 may have contributed to an outbreak in japan in salted salmon roe makino et al 2000 suggesting the vbnc cells retain virulence our previous study of e coli o157 h7 demonstrated that vbnc cells retain expression of shiga like toxin stx genes and proteins and once resuscitated are infective and cytotoxic to mammalian kidney cells liu et al 2010 the number of viable and metabolically active vbnc cells detected in our water samples after heat treatment were on the same order of magnitude as the known infectious dose 10 100 cfu of e coli o157 h7 lim et al 2010 although a much higher concentration of culturable cells 1 5 107 cells ml were inoculated into the water samples prior to boiling than would be expected during a waterborne outbreak in municipally treated water however with super shedder cattle capable of shedding 107 cfu of e coli o157 h7 g of feces chase topping et al 2007 a significant risk may remain for the estimated two billion people globally using drinking water contaminated with feces who 2017 han et al 2020 altogether this study demonstrates that vbnc cells appear to undermine confidence in the efficacy of boiling water for managing the risk of pathogen exposure in drinking water because these methods may not be adequate to fully inactivate e coli o157 h7 cells due to their ability to hide within the vbnc state at point of use water disinfection using heat treatment boiling water for 15 min may be necessary to completely inactive this pathogen 4 conclusions this study has presented evidence of the survival of a small number of e coli o157 h7 cells of one bovine and two clinical isolates in the vbnc state even after boiling for 1 10 min or microwaving for 1 5 min in tap water or saline importantly these vbnc cells can be resuscitated under suitable conditions consisting of non pathogenic e coli autoinducers and norepinephrine to eliminate this potential risk when drinking water is suspected to be contaminated boiling the water for 15 min may be needed for complete inactivation of this waterborne pathogen boiling is simple and effective but only when it is well
