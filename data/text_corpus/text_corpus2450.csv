this sub watershed falls in thuraiyur musiri manachanallur and lalgudi taluks of tiruchirappalli district in the southern part and alathur perambalur taluks of perambalur district in the northern part of the research area the sub watershed lies between 10 54 and 11 15 north latitudes and 78 36 and 78 49 east longitudes and it forms a part of the survey of india soi topographic sheets 58 i 12 58 i 16 58 j 9 and 58 j 13 in 1 50 000 scale the sub watershed covers a total geographical area of about 520 38 sq km the annual average rainfall in the study area is 823 76 mm the maximum temperature of the study area is 45 c and a minimum temperature is 29 c the topography of the study area is an undulating plain with irregular charnockitic hillocks and hornblende biotite gneissic rocks the relief of the area varies between 600 and 400 m above mean sea level fig 1 2 2 administrative divisions the study area comprises of two districts tiruchirappalli and perambalur districts fig 2 the details of taluks and blocks are furnished in table 1 2 3 methodology drastic model and gis have been applied to determine the degree of susceptibility to groundwater pollution in uppar odai sub watershed drastic was developed in usa by the environmental protection agency in 1987 to evaluate the potential for groundwater contamination aller et al 1987 table 2 this method is adopted for the first time in uppar odai sub watershed where the entire population s water demand is extracted from the aquifers due to lack of surface water sources considering the significant dependence on aquifers it is critical to assess the vulnerability of groundwater for its sustainable use each parameter has been assigned a rating between 1 and 10 based on their relative impact on the pollution potential weights have been assigned to each parameter ranging from 1 to 5 depending on their relative importance as given in table 3 2 4 drastic model drastic model with gis has been applied to determine the degree of susceptibility to groundwater pollution of uppar odai sub watershed in this study arcgis10 3 software was used to create hydrogeological characteristic maps and vulnerability maps of the aquifer this

geology lithology is major factor controlling the quantity and quality of groundwater occurrence in a given area it is represented by the distribution of different rock units characterizing the area under study various lithological units exposed in the area belong to charnockite group belonging to southern granulite complex of archaean age and peninsular gneissic complex ii of archaean to paleoproterozoic age in general the hills in the northwest part of the study area are made up of hard resistant rock namely charnockite hornblende biotite gneisses are spread almost in central part of the study area fig 3 around 37 per cent of the total area is covered with hornblende biotite gneisses followed by charnockite 3 results and discussions 3 1 depth to water the depth to water is important primarily because it determines the depth of material through which a contaminant must travel before reaching the aquifer and it may help to determine the amount of time during which contact with the surrounding media is maintained in general there is a greater chance for attenuation to occur as the depth to water increases because deeper water levels infer longer travel times table 3 shows the relative importance of depth to water aller et al 1987 the pre monsoon and post monsoon data of forty observation wells is added together and the average groundwater level data is estimated for both the seasons fig 4 from the figure it could be observed that the groundwater level varies from 2 02 to 7 56 m in the study area it is also observed that a moderate level of groundwater is noticed in most parts of the study area these point data were interpolated by rbf method and divided in to five categories i e 1 5 1 5 3 3 4 5 4 5 6 and 6 m and assigned the variable ratings of 10 9 5 3 and 1 and then it was converted into grid to make it raster data for gis operation the depth to water table interval range drastic rating weight and resulting index are portrayed in table 3 areas with high water tables are vulnerable because pollutants have short distances to travel before contacting the groundwater so the deeper ground water level are low vulnerable and smaller the rating value 3 2 net recharge net recharge indicates the amount of water per unit area of land which penetrates through the ground surface and reaches the water table this recharge water is thus available to transport contaminant vertically within the aquifer aller et al 1987 net recharge can be described as the amount of water that meets with groundwater which is the main tool for contaminant transportation water is the vehicle that carries contaminants this transportation is controlled by environmental and geological settings much water means many vehicles to carry contaminants gravity is the driving force for vertical movement of water net recharge is defined in units of mm per year the study area is drained by the non perennial streams of uppar odai the average annual rainfall of the study area is 823 mm however a considerable deviation from this average rainfall is observed in several parts of the study area where it ranges from a minimum of 525 mm in pulivalam to 1061 mm in pullambadi rainfall is observed to be relatively high 1000 mm in siddhamalai and pullambadi the rest of the sub watershed receives rainfall of less than 900 mm net recharge was divided in to three categories i e than 600 600 700 and than 700 mm and assigned the variable ratings of 6 8 and 10 respectively fig 5 3 3 aquifer media aquifer media refers to the nature of geologic formation which serves as aquifer like sand and gravel in case of alluvium while weathered zone and secondary porosities fracture joint in case of hard rock the nature and rate of ﬂow hydraulic conductivity of an aquifer is controlled by its framework material called media the media also exert a major control over the pollutant s route and path length saha and alam 2014 fig 6 aquifer media is used to produce a rating based on the permeability of each layer of media high permeability allows more water and therefore more contaminants to enter the aquifer the aquifer medium exerts the major control over the route and path length which a contaminant must follow the path length is an important control along with hydraulic conductivity and gradient in determining the time available for attenuation processes such as sorption reactivity and dispersion and also the amount of effective surface area of materials contacted in the aquifer therefore a high permeability will yield a high vulnerability rating usman 2009 the high rating to the aquifer media has been assigned to calc granulate with limestone and the rating 8 has been assigned to sand stone the typical value 4 has been assigned to the aquifer media quartz vein and rest of the aquifer media have been assigned the rating of 3which have low yields 3 4 soil media soil has a significant impact on the amount of recharge that can infiltrate into the ground and have the ability of a contaminant to move vertically into the vadose zone chitsazan and akhtari 2009 soil media could be described as the layer over the unsaturated vadose zone generally the thickness of the soil media varies from zero to 1 5 m in depth all the vegetation and farming activities are done in soil media which controls the contaminant passage to the vadose media during infiltration process contaminants are carried by recharge depending on the thickness and content of soil media the process of attenuation occurs moreover where the soil zone is fairly thick the attenuation processes of filtration biodegradation sorption and volatilisation may be quite significant aller et al 1987 there are five types of soil present in the study area the analysis of the soil type reveals that the study area is predominantly covered by clayey soil 56 7 per cent with black clayey soil 16 6 per cent gravelly soil 14 4 per cent red loamy soil 9 8 per cent and loamy soil 2 3 per cent at some places as shown in fig 7 3 5 topography the slope of land surface and its variation is referred as topography in areas with low slope runoff water is retained for longer periods allowing higher inﬁltration thus having a greater pollution potential amit ghosh et al 2015 topography map has been generated from aster dem based on the slope values the study area is divided into six zones viz areas with below 1 per cent slope nearly level 1 3 per cent very gently sloping 3 5 per cent gentle slope 5 10 per cent moderate slope 10 15 per cent steep slope and 15 35 per cent very steep slope in general the slope gradually decreases towards south the palamalai hill located in the northern part of the study area are found to possess steeper slope the slope varying from nearly level to very gentle has been assigned maximum rating of 10 where at least value has been assigned to very steep slope fig 8 3 6 the impact of vadose zone the unsaturated zone lying between the ground surface and water level is termed as vadose zone this zone has an important role on percolating water the type of material in vadose zone determines the pollution attenuation characteristics like biodegradation mechanical filtration sorption volatilisation and dispersion aller et al 1987 vadose zone is expanded to include both the vadose zone and any saturated zones which overlie the aquifer the significantly restrictive zone above the aquifer which forms the confining layer is used as the type of media which has the most significant impact the information on vadose zone was extracted from the lithological logs of 40 borewells collected from government departments and have been mapped as shown in fig 9 3 7 hydraulic conductivity groundwater always remains under movement and hydraulic conductivity expresses the ability of aquifer to transmit water saha and alam 2014 this component thus determines at which rate the pollutants move through an aquifer aller et al 1987 hydraulic conductivity values were calculated after calculating transmissibility from pumping test data and have been mapped as shown in fig 10 hydraulic conductivity mapping is done by having five classes fig 10 such as very high conductivity more than 75 m2 day high conductivity between 70 and 75 m2 day moderate conductivity between 65 and 70 m2 day low conductivity between 60 and 65 m2 day very low conductivity less than 60 m2 day the areas of low conductivity are in fact less productive in terms of groundwater than areas of either medium to very high conductivity values the different hydraulic conductivity zones in the area were deﬁned and assigned ratings according to drastic rating 3 8 drastic vulnerability map the drastic method allows for easy interpretation of data by non technical experts and in particular can be used for education purposes amit et al 2015 the sums of seven drastic thematic parameters were used to find the groundwater vulnerable zones all of included parameters have already been multiplied by its designated weighting factor and then the final vulnerability map has been prepared as shown in fig 11 the vulnerability of uppar odai sub watershed has been classified in to three categories such as low moderate and high while 2 per cent of the study area was classified as low risk 62 per cent as moderately risk and 36 per cent as high risk area 4 conclusion an attempt has been made to assess the groundwater vulnerability in uppar odai sub watershed nandiyar cauvery basin tamil nadu drastic model with gis were used to accomplish the task based on the result the vulnerable areas were classiﬁed into three zone namely low moderate and high vulnerable zones the study area has shown that 2 per cent of the total area was under low risk 62 per cent as moderately risk and 36per cent as high risk area high vulnerability is found due to shallow depth of water level permeable vadose zone and high net recharge rate in and around the uppar odai sub watershed the groundwater vulnerability map can be utilized as an economical tool to identify the zones of concern and as a tool to overcome problems regarding the haphazard and uncontrolled development of land and undesirable activities that can affect groundwater quality in the study area appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia

12251,the inhabitants of nabogo basin in the northern region of ghana rely on surface water sources for their daily water needs these sources are however unreliable throughout the year due to semi arid conditions of the area leading to water scarcity in the dry season redundancy of farmers and thereby affecting their livelihoods although there is groundwater use in the basin it is mostly at isolated areas and mainly for domestic purposes hence this study seeks to assess the sustainability of utilizing groundwater in the basin for irrigation in the dry season in addition to the basic water demands for domestic and livestock use in doing so borehole logging data were obtained and used to estimate the thickness of the aquifer formation which together with the specific yields of the different formations were exported to a gis environment to estimate the groundwater storage volume of the basin the water demands on the other hand were estimated using a combination of the population and livestock data of the basin alongside their respective per capita water demands as well as the crop water requirements for dry season irrigation the study estimates the available groundwater storage volume of the basin to be 1073 mcm million cubic meters whereas the current and 30 year future basic water demands were estimated to be 10 5 mcm and 39 4 mcm respectively the results further show that the remaining groundwater storage volume in the basin after meeting the basic water demands and taking net recharge into consideration could potentially irrigate up to 28 000 ha of farms in the dry season without compromising the baseflow to streams thus the groundwater in the basin could be utilised to curb the water scarcity problems and ensure farming all year round to increase productivity and improve the livelihoods of the inhabitants graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater storage water supply dry season irrigation livestock nabogo basin 1 introduction groundwater remains an essential and reliable source of water supply in the face of depleting surface water bodies and unreliable precipitation in arid and semi arid areas it has become an essential resource for improving water scarcity problems and livelihoods of many in the rural areas of developing countries cawma 2007 and provides over half of the total drinking water globally world water assessment programme wwap 2009 additionally it is a prominent resource for agriculture in drought prone regions where surface waters are unavailable siebert et al 2010 in recent times there has been a global surge in the abstraction of groundwater for irrigation supplying water to almost 40 of all irrigated lands gwp 2013 for instance groundwater irrigation has improved food security increased yields twice more than rain fed agriculture and helped farmers mostly in asia south east asia and the middle east to diversify to high value crops that require water all year round shah 2009 calzadilla et al 2009 in bangladesh and vietnam groundwater has revolutionized the agricultural sector by transforming their import dependent economies into world leading exporters in pepper coffee and rice zhu et al 2007 likewise in india which is the third largest producer of grain about 40 of its agricultural output comes from groundwater irrigated areas contributing about 9 to its gross domestic product gdp sampat 2000 despite the advantages and benefits most countries derive from groundwater irrigation sub saharan africa is responding slowly to this green revolution and utilizing groundwater in only 5 8 of its total irrigable lands despite the availability of the resource siebert et al 2010 world water assessment programme wwap 2009 in ghana the use of groundwater has grown significantly but 95 of the groundwater abstraction in the country is mostly for domestic purposes this is due to efforts of the government to increase rural water supply through boreholes to achieve the millennium development goals gyau boakye et al 2008 on the other hand groundwater irrigation in ghana is mainly practised on the subsistence level on farmlands less than 2 ha kortatsi 1994 ghana statistical service gss 2014 obuobie and barry 2012 and it s limited to the southern mainly in the accra plains and keta basin and upper regions of ghana kortatsi 1994 for instance irrigation with groundwater in the keta basin is from shallow hand dug wells with depths up to 5 m and 1 5 m in diameter fitted with low powered irrigation pumps similarly in the upper regions dugouts are excavated along ephemeral stream channels for irrigation of vegetable farms less than 2 ha in the dry season kortatsi 1994 obuobie and barry 2012 in developing groundwater for human use it is essential to maintain a balance between the exploitation and recharge to ensure its sustainability hence to effectively develop groundwater to supplement water use in any community estimation of groundwater quantity recharge and abstraction are prerequisites the conventional method of getting insight into aquifer capacity involves ground surveys and exploratory drilling followed by hours of pumping test over the aquifer area these processes are time consuming expensive and uneconomical loaiciga 2008 hence different approaches have been proposed to offset the need for extensive drilling and ground survey to acquire aquifer parameters one such approach is the transient water balance loaiciga 2008 which is a modification of the graphical mass curve method used in sizing surface water reservoirs to estimate groundwater storage volumes loaiciga 2008 loaiciga 2008 used the transient water balance approach to estimate the groundwater storage volume of the edwards aquifer system in texas akudago et al 2009 also used the same approach to estimate the storage volume of the aquifer system in northern ghana however the transient water balance requires long term time series of recharge pumping discharge and evaporation data which are mostly not available for some basins on the other hand geographic information system gis tools have also been used in hydrogeological studies to assess groundwater vulnerability babiker et al 2005 hamza et al 2007 aydi 2018 hasan et al 2019 groundwater potential nagarajan and singh 2009 kumar et al 2016 murmu et al 2019 and groundwater storage wahyuni et al 2008 pandey et al 2013 dixon 2003 in the gis estimation of groundwater storage volume relatively few data of aquifer parameters are exported to a gis environment and interpolated across a given basin to make up for any extensive drilling the prerequisite data for interpolation in a gis environment for groundwater storage volume estimation are the specific yield and aquifer thickness of a study area wahyuni et al 2008 utilised gis to estimate groundwater storage and its spatial distribution in aquifers in uzbekistan taking the thickness as the distance from the top of the water table to the top of the underlying bedrock pandey et al 2013 also estimated groundwater volume using gis in a quest to delineate groundwater potential areas of the kathmandu valley in nepal macdonald et al 2012 also estimated the spatial distribution of groundwater in africa with the aid of gis using secondary data furthermore dixon 2003 used gis tools to estimate groundwater storage volumes in the entiat river valley in washington by manually digitizing the aquifer basin before exporting to the gis environment likewise hinaman 2005 assessed the accuracy of specific yield and porosity in estimating groundwater storage volume in the powder river basin in wyoming using gis tools this study therefore seeks to estimate groundwater storage volume in the nabogo basin from the specific yield aquifer thickness and areal extent of the aquifer in a gis environment and determine its sustainability for agriculture alongside the domestic water demands of the basin groundwater is solely utilised for domestic purposes in parts of the basin whereas the majority of the populace in the basin rely on rainfall and surface water dugouts ponds and small dams for domestic and agriculture use however due to the semiarid conditions of the basin surface water sources run dry at the onset of the dry season resulting in water scarcity especially for agriculture which employs about 89 of the economically active population in the basin ghana statistical service gss 2014 and thereby affects their livelihoods thus estimating the quantity of available groundwater and the annual recharge in the basin is necessary for assessing its potential as a reliable alternative water source for domestic and irrigation needs in the dry season and ensure its sustainable use 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the nabogo basin is a sub catchment of the white volta basin which is a tributary of the volta basin and encompasses the savelugu nanton karaga and parts of the gushegu districts in the northern region of ghana the nabogo river upon which the basin is named is a confluence of smaller tributaries just before the nabogo township the basin drains an approximate area of 2909 km2 within latitudes 9 32 n to 10 01 n and longitudes 0 59 w to 0 15 w the topography of the basin ranges from 67 to 282 m above sea level msl the basin experiences a unimodal rainfall system starting from april and ending in october with august september being the peak months annual average precipitation computed from a 30 year historical data acquired from ghana meteorological agency is 1094 mm with mean minimum and maximum temperatures of 22 9 c and 34 5 c respectively commonly within a year 87 of the rain falls within the months may to october however most of the rains within these months end up as runoff with minimal recharge about 13 of the annual rainfall to the groundwater krautstrunk 2012 carrier et al 2011 the relative humidity in the rainy season ranges from 70 to 81 but falls to 28 in the dry season annual evapotranspiration of 1898 mm year computed using the fao recommended penman monteith method is witnessed within the basin the intense temperatures in the basin result in drying up of surface waters causing water scarcity and hardening of soils which may limit infiltration and thereby reduce recharge into the underlying aquifer formation the nabogo basin is underlained by palaeozoic sedimentary rocks known locally as the voltaian formation comprising of interbedded mudstones siltstones shale conglomerate and sandstones fig 1 dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 this formation has undergone reconsolidation over the years resulting in loss of its primary porosity therefore groundwater occurrence in the basin is controlled by secondary porosity arising from weathering and rock deformation resulting in a localized and fractured type aquifer system under unconfined and confined conditions carrier et al 2008 due to the complexity of geology in the basin aquifer parameters vary across the basin for instance as shown in fig 1 borehole yield in the basin could be as low as 2 l min and as high as 700 l min whereas the depth to water level across the basin ranges from 2 to 30 m with an average of 9 m below ground level nsiah et al 2018 the existing groundwater level data in the basin spans four years from 2006 to 2009 and shows an average annual rise of 17 mm across the observation wells krautstrunk 2012 2 2 groundwater volume estimation generally the volume of groundwater storage in aquifers is controlled by aquifer thickness b storativity s which is largely equivalent to the specific yield sy in unconfined aquifers and areal extent a of aquifers thus the groundwater storage volume gwv of aquifers could be estimated using equation 1 given as 1 g w v a x s y x b in the study basin the aquifer is classified as unconfined with some areas described as semi confined due to the presence of clay layers known as plinthosols krautstrunk 2012 hence the use of specific yield sy as in equation 1 since there are no laboratory and pumping test measurements of sy in the basin proxies from research work in the white volta basin krautstrunk 2012 obuobie et al 2012 pelig ba 2009 and the karoo basin sibanda et al 2009 of zimbabwe were selected as high and low end values respectively the sy values from the karoo basin were used for the study due to its similar lithologic and climatic conditions as that of the voltaian basin for instance like the voltaian basin the karoo basin was formed through deposition of sediments and it is composed of intercalations of shale mudstone siltstone and sandstone and it is also described as semi arid experiencing low precipitation and high evapotranspiration of around 2000 mm year smith 1984 sy values of 0 002 and 0 008 sibanda et al 2009 taken from the karoo basin in zimbabwe were assigned to areas characterized by plinthosols semi confining clay layers where the likelihood of the aquifer to release water is very low whereas the sy values of 0 05 and 0 08 used by obuobie et al 2012 and pelig ba 2009 in the white volta basin were assigned to the other areas in the basin where the aquifer is likely to release more water to an abstracting well generally the productive areas for groundwater development in the basin are the weathered and fractured zones since the groundwater flow is controlled by secondary porosity thus in order to determine the aquifer zones of the basin borehole data with information on depth to water strike transmissivity static water level borehole depth and borehole yields were obtained from world vision and water resources commission outfits in ghana the data was used to estimate the aquifer thickness in the basin by subtracting the depth to groundwater level from the depth to unweathered bedrock under the assumption that the groundwater controlling factors fractures and regolith are laterally extensive in terms of groundwater occurrence furthermore the aquifer thickness b and specific yield sy were exported to arcgis 10 3 for the estimation of groundwater volume fig 2 illustrates the processes followed in the groundwater volume estimation in the arcgis 10 3 software in the arcgis the boundary of the basin was delineated from a 30 by 30 m digital elevation model dem downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs website the delineation involved the use of the fill flow direction flow accumulation and stream delineation tools to extract stream networks from the dem from the extracted streams an outlet was identified and the delineate watershed tool was used to extract the basin boundary next the specific yield sy and aquifer thickness b fig 3 were exported to the gis environment and spatially interpolated to create spatial layers using the inverse distance weighting idw technique in the geostatistical analyst tool the generated layers were then intersected with a 20 by 20 m grid cell the resulting layer was then used to estimate the groundwater volume by multiplying each grid area by its corresponding thickness and specific yield i e g w v g r i d a r e a x s y x b using the field calculator tool 2 2 1 recharge estimation in the nabogo basin rainfall is the main source of recharge hence the rainfall infiltration factor rif method gec 1997 chatterjee et al 2009 shekhar et al 2015 was used to estimate the recharge in the basin according to gec 1997 the estimated recharge from rainfall infiltration factor should be compared to estimates from water level fluctuation method in selecting the appropriate value for recharge if long term groundwater level data is available however long term water level data was not available for the basin hence only the rif method was used to estimate the recharge in the basin as in equation 2 2 r f x a x r f where f is the infiltration factor a is the area of computation of recharge and r f is the normal rainfall infiltration factor of 0 06 was selected for the study area based on gec 1997 recommended value for consolidated sandstone since it best represents the geology of the basin the average normal rainfall in the basin computed from historical data spanning 1987 2016 is 1094 mm over the basin area of 2909 km2 a field visit to the basin showed the existence of some perennial streams which presupposes a possible baseflow contribution to streams therefore baseflow was considered in this study however due to the paucity of information on groundwater contribution to surface water in ghana baseflow data in the basin is highly uncertain gec 1997 recommends 10 of annual recharge as baseflow when rif method is used in recharge computation whereas pavelic et al 2013 used 30 50 of annual recharge as baseflow based on a sensitivity analysis of groundwater balance of discharge to recharge in estimating areas that can be irrigated with groundwater in sub saharan africa ssa in the study by pavelic et al 2013 ghana was among the countries with a lower discharge flux making 30 of annual recharge as baseflow an appropriate natural discharge value therefore 30 of annual recharge to the aquifer was used as a suitable baseflow d in estimating the net annual recharge nr with the aid of equation 3 3 n r r d thus the available groundwater in the basin for abstraction would be the sum of the net recharge and the groundwater storage volume to account for extreme conditions due to climate variability a drought scenario was computed drought is a complex phenomenon whose occurrence is imperceptible it has many definitions but for the purpose of this paper drought is defined as a period of dry weather of enough duration where the seasonal rainfall is below a threshold the indian meteorological department set this threshold at 75 of the long term average rainfall kant et al 2014 hence 75 of the 30 year average rainfall i e 1094 mm which is 820 mm was used to estimate recharge for the drought scenario 2 3 water demands estimation in the nabogo basin water for domestic and livestock watering is a priority in the dry season therefore groundwater would be used to satisfy that demand before considering irrigation assuming that the population would have access to groundwater current groundwater abstraction in the basin is solely for domestic and livestock watering thus the yields of all functional boreholes totalling 86 were multiplied by an average pumping duration of 8 h martin and van de giesen 2005 to determine the current groundwater abstraction in the basin boreholes in the basin commonly have troughs 10 m away with spillways where water spilled from the boreholes are collected to feed the livestock hence the current groundwater abstraction for domestic and livestock use in the basin was considered as a lump sum in order to better understand how groundwater could be used to support the basin the domestic and livestock water demands in the basin were estimated up to 2048 i e 30 years from 2018 by multiplying the population data of the inhabitants and livestock ghana statistical service gss 2014 by the daily clean water requirement gleick 1996 taking into consideration the growth rate and assuming a constant daily water need table 1 up to 2048 for this future estimation the system of animal rearing in the basin would be intensive hence the livestock water demand was estimated separately from the domestic water demand as compared to the lump sum for the current abstraction the major crops cultivated in the dry season within the basin are rice pepper eggplant and tomato thus to quantify the volume of water required for dry season irrigation climate data for the tamale weather station was used to estimate the crop water requirement of the major dry season crops in the basin the climate data was acquired from the meteorological service department of ghana and the selection of the tamale weather station was because of its proximity to the nabogo basin and availability of uninterrupted data from 1987 to 2016 the data included 30 year monthly averages of minimum and maximum temperatures relative humidity minimum and maximum wind speed sunshine hours and rainfall as well as the geographic coordinates latitude longitude and elevation of the station which were prerequisite parameters for the penman monteith method equation 4 employed in determining

spatial distribution of groundwater volume in the basin in all the total groundwater volume in the basin is estimated to be 1221 million cubic meters mcm the areas with low and moderate groundwater storage contain 148 mcm equivalent to 0 17 m water depth and 314 mcm equivalent to 0 3 m water depth respectively while the high volume area contains 759 mcm equivalent to 0 75 m water depth the groundwater storage volume depths were determined based on a classification by martin and van de giesen 2005 in the volta basin in that classification storage depths less than 0 17 m are deemed susceptible to drought and unsustainable for water supply hence boreholes drilled in these zones may not last more than 6 months therefore in considering sustainable groundwater volume available for abstraction for the basin the low groundwater storage zones shown in fig 4 were ignored since boreholes sited in such areas are unlikely to withstand the prolonged drought conditions in the basin this means taking into consideration only volumes greater than 171 m3 grid area i e water depth greater than 0 17 m the total sustainable groundwater volume available for abstraction in the nabogo basin is estimated to be 1073 mcm also since borehole yields have direct relation with storage in the aquifers the yield of boreholes in the study area were categorized into yields greater than 85 l min i e yield above which cwsa 2010 recommends mechanization for small towns and less than 10 l min i e yield below which a borehole is deemed unsuccessful by cwsa 2010 these yields were then plotted on the generated map as a means of validating the groundwater storage volume map fig 4 the validation showed that 78 of the yields greater than 85 l min were found in high groundwater volume zones 171 m3 grid cell whereas 82 of the yields less than 10 l min were located within low groundwater storage zones thus demonstrating the level of accuracy of the estimated groundwater volume and the unsustainability of abstracting groundwater from the low storage volume areas in the basin 3 2 basin water demands fig 5 shows estimates of the current water demands in the basin for domestic and livestock purposes and their projections for the next 30 years currently in 2018 the total water demand for domestic and livestock use in the basin is estimated to be 10 5 mcm and it represents about 1 of the sustainable groundwater storage volume in the basin comparatively the volume of groundwater abstracted currently in the basin is estimated from the borehole yields to be 1 1 mcm representing just 0 1 of the groundwater storage volume available for abstraction and about 10 of the current basin water demands for domestic and livestock use in the next 30 years the total domestic and livestock water demands are projected to be equal to 39 4 mcm and the total cumulative water demands for domestic and livestock up to the 30 years would be 150 mcm this projected cumulative water demand for the next 30 years is equivalent to 14 of the estimated groundwater volume available for abstraction indicating that the groundwater alone in the basin is enough to support the basic water demands of the populace table 2 shows the monthly net irrigation water requirement for the dry season crops in the basin land preparation for irrigation starts in late november while planting starts in december in the dry season for those with access to water the total net irrigation water requirement estimated by summing all the monthly irrigation water requirements niwr for the dry season i e december to may was 712 07 mm applying an efficiency of 50 fao 1997 altchenko and villholth 2015 resulted in a gross irrigation water requirement giwr of 1424 14 mm throughout the growing period for the dry season which is equivalent to 14 241 4 m3 ha season 1 mm 10 m3 ha field visits to the basin revealed that there are about 7000 farmers cultivating at least 2 ha of land which is equivalent to a cultivated land area of 14 000 ha in the rainy season however less than 10 of the farmers engage in irrigation in the dry season due to the unavailability of water also a total of 24 ha of land 16 ha for libga irrigation scheme under the ghana irrigation development agency gida and 8 ha for private and community irrigation practice from perennial streams in gushie nabogo and bunglung is irrigated in the dry season this land area is only 0 2 of the cultivated land during the rainy season and it is extremely low considering that agriculture is the major economic activity in the basin employing about 89 of the populace the estimated volume of water that would be needed to cultivate the same 14 000 ha of land in the dry season as is done in the rainy season was estimated to be 199 mcm 14 000 ha x 14 241 4 m3 ha thus the volume of water needed for irrigation to ensure the cultivation of crops in the dry season is equivalent to 18 7 of the groundwater volume available for abstraction less the current domestic and livestock water demands 3 3 groundwater sustainability in order to ensure the sustainable use of the groundwater in the basin groundwater abstractions to meet the water demands of the populace must be counterbalanced by the recharge to the aquifer formations to avoid depletion of the resource the annual recharge to groundwater was estimated to be 191 mcm whereas that of the drought year scenario was 143 mcm this recharge is 6 of the annual rainfall and within the range of recharge i e 1 13 of the annual rainfall provided by krautstrunk 2012 and carrier et al 2011 furthermore the estimated baseflow was 57 28 mcm and 42 94 mcm for the normal and drought scenario respectively which implies the net groundwater recharge to the basin is 134 mcm and 100 mcm for the normal and drought scenarios respectively table 3 provides a summary of various groundwater abstraction scenarios and the stage of groundwater development in the basin taking into consideration net recharge to the basin aquifer the current stage of groundwater abstraction in the basin is only 0 8 and 1 1 for the drought scenario of the net recharge table 3 and it is unlikely to cause any adverse effect on the sustainability of groundwater however the current groundwater abstraction in the basin is far less than the current basin water demands since it is mainly used to supplement domestic and livestock water needs in parts of the basin in the second abstraction scenario if it is assumed that the groundwater would be utilised all over the basin to meet the current water demands i e for domestic and livestock use excluding irrigation of the populace then the abstraction required would be equivalent to 7 9 and 10 5 in case of a drought season of the net recharge therefore the populace could have access to potable water throughout the year without any change in the groundwater storage volume table 3 also under this scenario if dry season irrigation of 14 000 ha of land i e the same land area farmed in the rainy season is included in the current water demands of the basin for domestic and livestock use the total groundwater abstraction would cause a 7 and 10 for the drought scenario reduction in the groundwater storage volume this decrease would not adversely affect the aquifer hence the available groundwater in the basin can meet the current water supply demands for domestic livestock use and dry season irrigation even in drought periods in the 30 year future scenario it was found that the projected abstracted groundwater needed to meet the water demands i e for domestic and livestock use excluding irrigation in the basin would be 29 5 39 3 for drought scenario of the net recharge table 3 and can therefore be sustained by the net recharge to the aquifer without any effect on the groundwater storage volume however when dry season irrigation is included in the water demands the required groundwater abstractions would reduce the storage volume by 10 and 13 for the normal and drought years respectively additionally if the irrigable land area under this future scenario is assumed to double table 3 in keeping up with the population increase and the possibility of increased farm size as a result of the availability of water then approximately 400 mcm i e 28 000 ha x 14 241 4 m3 ha of groundwater would be required for dry season irrigation this abstraction exceeds the net recharge by 306 mcm and 339 mcm for the drought scenario resulting in 29 and 32 reductions in the storage volume for the normal and drought years respectively table 3 although the reduction in groundwater storage volume from this scenario is very significant there would still be about 70 of groundwater in storage thus the groundwater would still be deemed sustainable but effective groundwater management practices would be required to maintain such an irrigation scheme finally the excess net recharge i e surplus of the net recharge after satisfying the basic water demands domestic and livestock use was converted to potential irrigable land area gwp and it was found that the excess net recharge alone for the normal years could potentially irrigate about 8600 ha and 6600 ha of farmlands in the current and 30 year future dry seasons respectively in the drought scenario however the excess net recharge could potentially irrigate about 6200 ha and 4200 ha of farmlands respectively for the current and future dry seasons although these irrigable areas are less than the total farmlands utilised in the rainy season they are over 100 folds more than the current dry season irrigable area i e 24 ha and greater than the largest irrigation scheme in the country which covers 3840 ha of farmland in a location with similar climatic condition as the study basin agodzo et al 2014 this shows that recharge in the basin alone is adequate to support commercial farming in the dry season without compromising the storage volume or baseflow and demonstrates the sustainability of the groundwater to support economic activities in the basin the various abstraction projections show that the use of groundwater for irrigation could transform agricultural practices in the basin by aiding in dual seasonal cropping and commercial livestock production consequently there would be food security and the livelihoods of the inhabitants would be improved to aid achieve the sustainable development goals sdg s 1 on reducing extreme poverty 2 on zero hunger and 6 on clean water and sanitation bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 although in general the groundwater in the basin seems enough effective exploratory techniques are required prior to selecting locations for the groundwater abstraction via drilling of boreholes and dug wells this is because groundwater in the basin is controlled by secondary porosity and hence localized and not continuous across the lithological units due to the complex geology of the voltaian basin also the effect of future climate change on basin water demands and recharge rate was not considered in the assessments although it could influence the groundwater sustainability in the future 4 conclusions this study has estimated the groundwater storage volume of the nabogo basin using the specific yield and aquifer thickness of the geological formations of the basin in a gis environment and compared it with estimated water demands of the basin to assess the sustainability of the groundwater for domestic livestock and dry season irrigation use the study results show that the total groundwater storage volume in the basin available for abstraction is 1073 mcm while the net annual groundwater recharge is estimated to be 134 mcm also the current domestic and livestock water demands of the basin are estimated to be 10 5 mcm whereas the volume of water needed to irrigate all the estimated 14 000 ha farmlands of the basin in the dry season is 199 mcm the water demands of the basin for domestic and livestock use are projected to rise to 39 4 mcm by the end of the next 30 years and it is equivalent to about 30 of the net annual groundwater recharge likewise the entire future 30 year cumulative water demands for domestic livestock and dry season irrigation of the farmlands in the basin is estimated to be 238 4 mcm this though higher than the net recharge will lead to a lowly 10 reduction in the available groundwater storage volume additionally sustainability scenario analyses of groundwater abstractions in the basin showed that taking into account the net recharge the available groundwater storage volume in the basin would reduce by about 32 if the groundwater is utilised to meet water demands for domestic livestock and dry season irrigation of 28 000 ha of farmlands for the next 30 years however if only the equivalent of the net recharge is abstracted the groundwater could support the water demands for domestic livestock and dry season irrigation of 8600 ha to 6600 ha farmlands in the basin from now up to the next 30 years and beyond thus the study has demonstrated that the groundwater in the nabogo basin generally has the potential to sustainably meet the domestic livestock and dry season irrigation water demands of the inhabitants currently and at least up to the next 30 years it has further indicated that irrigation in the dry season could be expanded to all the current farmlands in the basin and up to doubling of the farmlands with the benefits of ensuring all year round farming increase in crop yields and improvements in the livelihoods of the inhabitants acknowledgements this work was supported by the regional water and environmental sanitation centre kumasi rwesck at the kwame nkrumah university of science and

12251,the inhabitants of nabogo basin in the northern region of ghana rely on surface water sources for their daily water needs these sources are however unreliable throughout the year due to semi arid conditions of the area leading to water scarcity in the dry season redundancy of farmers and thereby affecting their livelihoods although there is groundwater use in the basin it is mostly at isolated areas and mainly for domestic purposes hence this study seeks to assess the sustainability of utilizing groundwater in the basin for irrigation in the dry season in addition to the basic water demands for domestic and livestock use in doing so borehole logging data were obtained and used to estimate the thickness of the aquifer formation which together with the specific yields of the different formations were exported to a gis environment to estimate the groundwater storage volume of the basin the water demands on the other hand were estimated using a combination of the population and livestock data of the basin alongside their respective per capita water demands as well as the crop water requirements for dry season irrigation the study estimates the available groundwater storage volume of the basin to be 1073 mcm million cubic meters whereas the current and 30 year future basic water demands were estimated to be 10 5 mcm and 39 4 mcm respectively the results further show that the remaining groundwater storage volume in the basin after meeting the basic water demands and taking net recharge into consideration could potentially irrigate up to 28 000 ha of farms in the dry season without compromising the baseflow to streams thus the groundwater in the basin could be utilised to curb the water scarcity problems and ensure farming all year round to increase productivity and improve the livelihoods of the inhabitants graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater storage water supply dry season irrigation livestock nabogo basin 1 introduction groundwater

2009 in bangladesh and vietnam groundwater has revolutionized the agricultural sector by transforming their import dependent economies into world leading exporters in pepper coffee and rice zhu et al 2007 likewise in india which is the third largest producer of grain about 40 of its agricultural output comes from groundwater irrigated areas contributing about 9 to its gross domestic product gdp sampat 2000 despite the advantages and benefits most countries derive from groundwater irrigation sub saharan africa is responding slowly to this green revolution and utilizing groundwater in only 5 8 of its total irrigable lands despite the availability of the resource siebert et al 2010 world water assessment programme wwap 2009 in ghana the use of groundwater has grown significantly but 95 of the groundwater abstraction in the country is mostly for domestic purposes this is due to efforts of the government to increase rural water supply through boreholes to achieve the millennium development goals gyau boakye et al 2008 on the other hand groundwater irrigation in ghana is mainly practised on the subsistence level on farmlands less than 2 ha kortatsi 1994 ghana statistical service gss 2014 obuobie and barry 2012 and it s limited to the southern mainly in the accra plains and keta basin and upper regions of ghana kortatsi 1994 for instance irrigation with groundwater in the keta basin is from shallow hand dug wells with depths up to 5 m and 1 5 m in diameter fitted with low powered irrigation pumps similarly in the upper regions dugouts are excavated along ephemeral stream channels for irrigation of vegetable farms less than 2 ha in the dry season kortatsi 1994 obuobie and barry 2012 in developing groundwater for human use it is essential to maintain a balance between the exploitation and recharge to ensure its sustainability hence to effectively develop groundwater to supplement water use in any community estimation of groundwater quantity recharge and abstraction are prerequisites the conventional method of getting insight into aquifer capacity involves ground surveys and exploratory drilling followed by hours of pumping test over the aquifer area these processes are time consuming expensive and uneconomical loaiciga 2008 hence different approaches have been proposed to offset the need for extensive drilling and ground survey to acquire aquifer parameters one such approach is the transient water balance loaiciga 2008 which is a modification of the graphical mass curve method used in sizing surface water reservoirs to estimate groundwater storage volumes loaiciga 2008 loaiciga 2008 used the transient water balance approach to estimate the groundwater storage volume of the edwards aquifer system in texas akudago et al 2009 also used the same approach to estimate the storage volume of the aquifer system in northern ghana however the transient water balance requires long term time series of recharge pumping discharge and evaporation data which are mostly not available for some basins on the other hand geographic information system gis tools have also been used in hydrogeological studies to assess groundwater vulnerability babiker et al 2005 hamza et al 2007 aydi 2018 hasan et al 2019 groundwater potential nagarajan and singh 2009 kumar et al 2016 murmu et al 2019 and groundwater storage wahyuni et al 2008 pandey et al 2013 dixon 2003 in the gis estimation of groundwater storage volume relatively few data of aquifer parameters are exported to a gis environment and interpolated across a given basin to make up for any extensive drilling the prerequisite data for interpolation in a gis environment for groundwater storage volume estimation are the specific yield and aquifer thickness of a study area wahyuni et al 2008 utilised gis to estimate groundwater storage and its spatial distribution in aquifers in uzbekistan taking the thickness as the distance from the top of the water table to the top of the underlying bedrock pandey et al 2013 also estimated groundwater volume using gis in a quest to delineate groundwater potential areas of the kathmandu valley in nepal macdonald et al 2012 also estimated the spatial distribution of groundwater in africa with the aid of gis using secondary data furthermore dixon 2003 used gis tools to estimate groundwater storage volumes in the entiat river valley in washington by manually digitizing the aquifer basin before exporting to the gis environment likewise hinaman 2005 assessed the accuracy of specific yield and porosity in estimating groundwater storage volume in the powder river basin in wyoming using gis tools this study therefore seeks to estimate groundwater storage volume in the nabogo basin from the specific yield aquifer thickness and areal extent of the aquifer in a gis environment and determine its sustainability for agriculture alongside the domestic water demands of the basin groundwater is solely utilised for domestic purposes in parts of the basin whereas the majority of the populace in the basin rely on rainfall and surface water dugouts ponds and small dams for domestic and agriculture use however due to the semiarid conditions of the basin surface water sources run dry at the onset of the dry season resulting in water scarcity especially for agriculture which employs about 89 of the economically active population in the basin ghana statistical service gss 2014 and thereby affects their livelihoods thus estimating the quantity of available groundwater and the annual recharge in the basin is necessary for assessing its potential as a reliable alternative water source for domestic and irrigation needs in the dry season and ensure its sustainable use 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the nabogo basin is a sub catchment of the white volta basin which is a tributary of the volta basin and encompasses the savelugu nanton karaga and parts of the gushegu districts in the northern region of ghana the nabogo river upon which the basin is named is a confluence of smaller tributaries just before the nabogo township the basin drains an approximate area of 2909 km2 within latitudes 9 32 n to 10 01 n and longitudes 0 59 w to 0 15 w the topography of the basin ranges from 67 to 282 m above sea level msl the basin experiences a unimodal rainfall system starting from april and ending in october with august september being the peak months annual average precipitation computed from a 30 year historical data acquired from ghana meteorological agency is 1094 mm with mean minimum and maximum temperatures of 22 9 c and 34 5 c respectively commonly within a year 87 of the rain falls within the months may to october however most of the rains within these months end up as runoff with minimal recharge about 13 of the annual rainfall to the groundwater krautstrunk 2012 carrier et al 2011 the relative humidity in the rainy season ranges from 70 to 81 but falls to 28 in the dry season annual evapotranspiration of 1898 mm year computed using the fao recommended penman monteith method is witnessed within the basin the intense temperatures in the basin result in drying up of surface waters causing water scarcity and hardening of soils which may limit infiltration and thereby reduce recharge into the underlying aquifer formation the nabogo basin is underlained by palaeozoic sedimentary rocks known locally as the voltaian formation comprising of interbedded mudstones siltstones shale conglomerate and sandstones fig 1 dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 this formation has undergone reconsolidation over the years resulting in loss of its primary porosity therefore groundwater occurrence in the basin is controlled by secondary porosity arising from weathering and rock deformation resulting in a localized and fractured type aquifer system under unconfined and confined conditions carrier et al 2008 due to the complexity of geology in the basin aquifer parameters vary across the basin for instance as shown in fig 1 borehole yield in the basin could be as low as 2 l min and as high as 700 l min whereas the depth to water level across the basin ranges from 2 to 30 m with an average of 9 m below ground level nsiah et al 2018 the existing groundwater level data in the basin spans four years from 2006 to 2009 and shows an average annual rise of 17 mm across the observation wells krautstrunk 2012 2 2 groundwater volume estimation generally the volume of groundwater storage in aquifers is controlled by aquifer thickness b storativity s which is largely equivalent to the specific yield sy in unconfined aquifers and areal extent a of aquifers thus the groundwater storage volume gwv of aquifers could be estimated using equation 1 given as 1 g w v a x s y x b in the study basin the aquifer is classified as unconfined with some areas described as semi confined due to the presence of clay layers known as plinthosols krautstrunk 2012 hence the use of specific yield sy as in equation 1 since there are no laboratory and pumping test measurements of sy in the basin proxies from research work in the white volta basin krautstrunk 2012 obuobie et al 2012 pelig ba 2009 and the karoo basin sibanda et al 2009 of zimbabwe were selected as high and low end values respectively the sy values from the karoo basin were used for the study due to its similar lithologic and climatic conditions as that of the voltaian basin for instance like the voltaian basin the karoo basin was formed through deposition of sediments and it is composed of intercalations of shale mudstone siltstone and sandstone and it is also described as semi arid experiencing low precipitation and high evapotranspiration of around 2000 mm year smith 1984 sy values of 0 002 and 0 008 sibanda et al 2009 taken from the karoo basin in zimbabwe were assigned to areas characterized by plinthosols semi confining clay layers where the likelihood of the aquifer to release water is very low whereas the sy values of 0 05 and 0 08 used by obuobie et al 2012 and pelig ba 2009 in the white volta basin were assigned to the other areas in the basin where the aquifer is likely to release more water to an abstracting well generally the productive areas for groundwater development in the basin are the weathered and fractured zones since the groundwater flow is controlled by secondary porosity thus in order to determine the aquifer zones of the basin borehole data with information on depth to water strike transmissivity static water level borehole depth and borehole yields were obtained from world vision and water resources commission outfits in ghana the data was used to estimate the aquifer thickness in the basin by subtracting the depth to groundwater level from the depth to unweathered bedrock under the assumption that the groundwater controlling factors fractures and regolith are laterally extensive in terms of groundwater occurrence furthermore the aquifer thickness b and specific yield sy were exported to arcgis 10 3 for the estimation of groundwater volume fig 2 illustrates the processes followed in the groundwater volume estimation in the arcgis 10 3 software in the arcgis the boundary of the basin was delineated from a 30 by 30 m digital elevation model dem downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs website the delineation involved the use of the fill flow direction flow accumulation and stream delineation tools to extract stream networks from the dem from the extracted streams an outlet was identified and the delineate watershed tool was used to extract the basin boundary next the specific yield sy and aquifer thickness b fig 3 were exported to the gis environment and spatially interpolated to create spatial layers using the inverse distance weighting idw technique in the geostatistical analyst tool the generated layers were then intersected with a 20 by 20 m grid cell the resulting layer was then used to estimate the groundwater volume by multiplying each grid area by its corresponding thickness and specific yield i e g w v g r i d a r e a x s y x b using the field calculator tool 2 2 1 recharge estimation in the nabogo basin rainfall is the main source of recharge hence the rainfall infiltration factor rif method gec 1997 chatterjee et al 2009 shekhar et al 2015 was used to estimate the recharge in the basin according to gec 1997 the estimated recharge from rainfall infiltration factor should be compared to estimates from water level fluctuation method in selecting the appropriate value for recharge if long term groundwater level data is available however long term water level data was not available for the basin hence only the rif method was used to estimate the recharge in the basin as in equation 2 2 r f x a x r f where f is the infiltration factor a is the area of computation of recharge and r f is the normal rainfall infiltration factor of 0 06 was selected for the study area based on gec 1997 recommended value for consolidated sandstone since it best represents the geology of the basin the average normal rainfall in the basin computed from historical data spanning 1987 2016 is 1094 mm over the basin area of 2909 km2 a field visit to the basin showed the existence of some perennial streams which presupposes a possible baseflow contribution to streams therefore baseflow was considered in this study however due to the paucity of information on groundwater contribution to surface water in ghana baseflow data in the basin is highly uncertain gec 1997 recommends 10 of annual recharge as baseflow when rif method is used in recharge computation whereas pavelic et al 2013 used 30 50 of annual recharge as baseflow based on a sensitivity analysis of groundwater balance of discharge to recharge in estimating areas that can be irrigated with groundwater in sub saharan africa ssa in the study by pavelic et al 2013 ghana was among the countries with a lower discharge flux making 30 of annual recharge as baseflow an appropriate natural discharge value therefore 30 of annual recharge to the aquifer was used as a suitable baseflow d in estimating the net annual recharge nr with the aid of equation 3 3 n r r d thus the available groundwater in the basin for abstraction would be the sum of the net recharge and the groundwater storage volume to account for extreme conditions due to climate variability a drought scenario was computed drought is a complex phenomenon whose occurrence is imperceptible it has many definitions but for the purpose of this paper drought is defined as a period of dry weather of enough duration where the seasonal rainfall is below a threshold the indian meteorological department set this threshold at 75 of the long term average rainfall kant et al 2014 hence 75 of the 30 year average rainfall i e 1094 mm which is 820 mm was used to estimate recharge for the drought scenario 2 3 water demands estimation in the nabogo basin water for domestic and livestock watering is a priority in the dry season therefore groundwater would be used to satisfy that demand before considering irrigation assuming that the population would have access to groundwater current groundwater abstraction in the basin is solely for domestic and livestock watering thus the yields of all functional boreholes totalling 86 were multiplied by an average pumping duration of 8 h martin and van de giesen 2005 to determine the current groundwater abstraction in the basin boreholes in the basin commonly have troughs 10 m away with spillways where water spilled from the boreholes are collected to feed the livestock hence the current groundwater abstraction for domestic and livestock use in the basin was considered as a lump sum in order to better understand how groundwater could be used to support the basin the domestic and livestock water demands in the basin were estimated up to 2048 i e 30 years from 2018 by multiplying the population data of the inhabitants and livestock ghana statistical service gss 2014 by the daily clean water requirement gleick 1996 taking into consideration the growth rate and assuming a constant daily water need table 1 up to 2048 for this future estimation the system of animal rearing in the basin would be intensive hence the livestock water demand was estimated separately from the domestic water demand as compared to the lump sum for the current abstraction the major crops cultivated in the dry season within the basin are rice pepper eggplant and tomato thus to quantify the volume of water required for dry season irrigation climate data for the tamale weather station was used to estimate the crop water requirement of the major dry season crops in the basin the climate data was acquired from the meteorological service department of ghana and the selection of the tamale weather station was because of its proximity to the nabogo basin and availability of uninterrupted data from 1987 to 2016 the data included 30 year monthly averages of minimum and maximum temperatures relative humidity minimum and maximum wind speed sunshine hours and rainfall as well as the geographic coordinates latitude longitude and elevation of the station which were prerequisite parameters for the penman monteith method equation 4 employed in determining reference evapotranspiration et of the basin with the aid of the cropwat software fao 1998 4 e t 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where e s saturation vapour pressure kpa g soil

spatial distribution of groundwater volume in the basin in all the total groundwater volume in the basin is estimated to be 1221 million cubic meters mcm the areas with low and moderate groundwater storage contain 148 mcm equivalent to 0 17 m water depth and 314 mcm equivalent to 0 3 m water depth respectively while the high volume area contains 759 mcm equivalent to 0 75 m water depth the groundwater storage volume depths were determined based on a classification by martin and van de giesen 2005 in the volta basin in that classification storage depths less than 0 17 m are deemed susceptible to drought and unsustainable for water supply hence boreholes drilled in these zones may not last more than 6 months therefore in considering sustainable groundwater volume available for abstraction for the basin the low groundwater storage zones shown in fig 4 were ignored since boreholes sited in such areas are unlikely to withstand the prolonged drought conditions in the basin this means taking into consideration only volumes greater than 171 m3 grid area i e water depth greater than 0 17 m the total sustainable groundwater volume available for abstraction in the nabogo basin is estimated to be 1073 mcm also since borehole yields have direct relation with storage in the aquifers the yield of boreholes in the study area were categorized into yields greater than 85 l min i e yield above which cwsa 2010 recommends mechanization for small towns and less than 10 l min i e yield below which a borehole is deemed unsuccessful by cwsa 2010 these yields were then plotted on the generated map as a means of validating the groundwater storage volume map fig 4 the validation showed that 78 of the yields greater than 85 l min were found in high groundwater volume zones 171 m3 grid cell whereas 82 of the yields less than 10 l min were located within low groundwater storage zones thus demonstrating the level of accuracy of the estimated groundwater volume and the unsustainability of abstracting groundwater from the low storage volume areas in the basin 3 2 basin water demands fig 5 shows estimates of the current water demands in the basin for domestic and livestock purposes and their projections for the next 30 years currently in 2018 the total water demand for domestic and livestock use in the basin is estimated to be 10 5 mcm and it represents about 1 of the sustainable groundwater storage volume in the basin comparatively the volume of groundwater abstracted currently in the basin is estimated from the borehole yields to be 1 1 mcm representing just 0 1 of the groundwater storage volume available for abstraction and about 10 of the current basin water demands for domestic and livestock use in the next 30 years the total domestic and livestock water demands are projected to be equal to 39 4 mcm and the total cumulative water demands for domestic and livestock up to the 30 years would be 150 mcm this projected cumulative water demand for the next 30 years is equivalent to 14 of the estimated groundwater volume available for abstraction indicating that the groundwater alone in the basin is enough to support the basic water demands of the populace table 2 shows the monthly net irrigation water requirement for the dry season crops in the basin land preparation for irrigation starts in late november while planting starts in december in the dry season for those with access to water the total net irrigation water requirement estimated by summing all the monthly irrigation water requirements niwr for the dry season i e december to may was 712 07 mm applying an efficiency of 50 fao 1997 altchenko and villholth 2015 resulted in a gross irrigation water requirement giwr of 1424 14 mm throughout the growing period for the dry season which is equivalent to 14 241 4 m3 ha season 1 mm 10 m3 ha field visits to the basin revealed that there are about 7000 farmers cultivating at least 2 ha of land which is equivalent to a cultivated land area of 14 000 ha in the rainy season however less than 10 of the farmers engage in irrigation in the dry season due to the unavailability of water also a total of 24 ha of land 16 ha for libga irrigation scheme under the ghana irrigation development agency gida and 8 ha for private and community irrigation practice from perennial streams in gushie nabogo and bunglung is irrigated in the dry season this land area is only 0 2 of the cultivated land during the rainy season and it is extremely low considering that agriculture is the major economic activity in the basin employing about 89 of the populace the estimated volume of water that would be needed to cultivate the same 14 000 ha of land in the dry season as is done in the rainy season was estimated to be 199 mcm 14 000 ha x 14 241 4 m3 ha thus the volume of water needed for irrigation to ensure the cultivation of crops in the dry season is equivalent to 18 7 of the groundwater volume available for abstraction less the current domestic and livestock water demands 3 3 groundwater sustainability in order to ensure the sustainable use of the groundwater in the basin groundwater abstractions to meet the water demands of the populace must be counterbalanced by the recharge to the aquifer formations to avoid depletion of the resource the annual recharge to groundwater was estimated to be 191 mcm whereas that of the drought year scenario was 143 mcm this recharge is 6 of the annual rainfall and within the range of recharge i e 1 13 of the annual rainfall provided by krautstrunk 2012 and carrier et al 2011 furthermore the estimated baseflow was 57 28 mcm and 42 94 mcm for the normal and drought scenario respectively which implies the net groundwater recharge to the basin is 134 mcm and 100 mcm for the normal and drought scenarios respectively table 3 provides a summary of various groundwater abstraction scenarios and the stage of groundwater development in the basin taking into consideration net recharge to the basin aquifer the current stage of groundwater abstraction in the basin is only 0 8 and 1 1 for the drought scenario of the net recharge table 3 and it is unlikely to cause any adverse effect on the sustainability of groundwater however the current groundwater abstraction in the basin is far less than the current basin water demands since it is mainly used to supplement domestic and livestock water needs in parts of the basin in the second abstraction scenario if it is assumed that the groundwater would be utilised all over the basin to meet the current water demands i e for domestic and livestock use excluding irrigation of the populace then the abstraction required would be equivalent to 7 9 and 10 5 in case of a drought season of the net recharge therefore the populace could have access to potable water throughout the year without any change in the groundwater storage volume table 3 also under this scenario if dry season irrigation of 14 000 ha of land i e the same land area farmed in the rainy season is included in the current water demands of the basin for domestic and livestock use the total groundwater abstraction would cause a 7 and 10 for the drought scenario reduction in the groundwater storage volume this decrease would not adversely affect the aquifer hence the available groundwater in the basin can meet the current water supply demands for domestic livestock use and dry season irrigation even in drought periods in the 30 year future scenario it was found that the projected abstracted groundwater needed to meet the water demands i e for domestic and livestock use excluding irrigation in the basin would be 29 5 39 3 for drought scenario of the net recharge table 3 and can therefore be sustained by the net recharge to the aquifer without any effect on the groundwater storage volume however when dry season irrigation is included in the water demands the required groundwater abstractions would reduce the storage volume by 10 and 13 for the normal and drought years respectively additionally if the irrigable land area under this future scenario is assumed to double table 3 in keeping up with the population increase and the possibility of increased farm size as a result of the availability of water then approximately 400 mcm i e 28 000 ha x 14 241 4 m3 ha of groundwater would be required for dry season irrigation this abstraction exceeds the net recharge by 306 mcm and 339 mcm for the drought scenario resulting in 29 and 32 reductions in the storage volume for the normal and drought years respectively table 3 although the reduction in groundwater storage volume from this scenario is very significant there would still be about 70 of groundwater in storage thus the groundwater would still be deemed sustainable but effective groundwater management practices would be required to maintain such an irrigation scheme finally the excess net recharge i e surplus of the net recharge after satisfying the basic water demands domestic and livestock use was converted to potential irrigable land area gwp and it was found that the excess net recharge alone for the normal years could potentially irrigate about 8600 ha and 6600 ha of farmlands in the current and 30 year future dry seasons respectively in the drought scenario however the excess net recharge could potentially irrigate about 6200 ha and 4200 ha of farmlands respectively for the current and future dry seasons although these irrigable areas are less than the total farmlands utilised in the rainy season they are over 100 folds more than the current dry season irrigable area i e 24 ha and greater than the largest irrigation scheme in the country which covers 3840 ha of farmland in a location with similar climatic condition as the study basin agodzo et al 2014 this shows that recharge in the basin alone is adequate to support commercial farming in the dry season without compromising the storage volume or baseflow and demonstrates the sustainability of the groundwater to support economic activities in the basin the various abstraction projections show that the use of groundwater for irrigation could transform agricultural practices in the basin by aiding in dual seasonal cropping and commercial livestock production consequently there would be food security and the livelihoods of the inhabitants would be improved to aid achieve the sustainable development goals sdg s 1 on reducing extreme poverty 2 on zero hunger and 6 on clean water and sanitation bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 although in general the groundwater in the basin seems enough effective exploratory techniques are required prior to selecting locations for the groundwater abstraction via drilling of boreholes and dug wells this is because groundwater in the basin is controlled by secondary porosity and hence localized and not continuous across the lithological units due to the complex geology of the voltaian basin also the effect of future climate change on basin water demands and recharge rate was not considered in the assessments although it could influence the groundwater sustainability in the future 4 conclusions this study has estimated the groundwater storage volume of the nabogo basin using the specific yield and aquifer thickness of the geological formations of the basin in a gis environment and compared it with estimated water demands of the basin to assess the sustainability of the groundwater for domestic livestock and dry season irrigation use the study results show that the total groundwater storage volume in the basin available for abstraction is 1073 mcm while the net annual groundwater recharge is estimated to be 134 mcm also the current domestic and livestock water demands of the basin are estimated to be 10 5 mcm whereas the volume of water needed to irrigate all the estimated 14 000 ha farmlands of the basin in the dry season is 199 mcm the water demands of the basin for domestic and livestock use are projected to rise to 39 4 mcm by the end of the next 30 years and it is equivalent to about 30 of the net annual groundwater recharge likewise the entire future 30 year cumulative water demands for domestic livestock and dry season irrigation of the farmlands in the basin is estimated to be 238 4 mcm this though higher than the net recharge will lead to a lowly 10 reduction in the available groundwater storage volume additionally sustainability scenario analyses of groundwater abstractions in the basin showed that taking into account the net recharge the available groundwater storage volume in the basin would reduce by about 32 if the groundwater is utilised to meet water demands for domestic livestock and dry season irrigation of 28 000 ha of farmlands for the next 30 years however if only the equivalent of the net recharge is abstracted the groundwater could support the water demands for domestic livestock and dry season irrigation of 8600 ha to 6600 ha farmlands in the basin from now up to the next 30 years and beyond thus the study has demonstrated that the groundwater in the nabogo basin generally has the potential to sustainably meet the domestic livestock and dry season irrigation water demands of the inhabitants currently and at least up to the next 30 years it has further indicated that irrigation in the dry season could be expanded to all the current farmlands in the basin and up to doubling of the farmlands with the benefits of ensuring all year round farming increase in crop yields and improvements in the livelihoods of the inhabitants acknowledgements this work was supported by the regional water and environmental sanitation centre kumasi rwesck at the kwame nkrumah university of science and

12252,prediction of response to fissure water pumping from a shaft on the surrounding areas is conducted with a numerical model which was refined using environmental stable isotope esi tritium and hydrochemical datasets the numerical model domain covers the local carbonate rock units mainly because it is known to be the main source of groundwater based on the hydrochemical dataset of the fissure water pumped at the shaft strong signature of na cl type water originating from the seepage of a waste rock dump as well as polluted water from mine offices loading unloading and parking lot areas is evident the environmental isotope data demonstrated that fissure water intercepted at the shaft has strong footprint of surface water and polluted groundwater from nearby areas the 30 year numerical model prediction indicates that pumping at a rate of 2500 m3 day or more would cause the radius of influence to expand to areas where the central tailings storage facility is located and could possibly draw highly acidic water interception of acid rock drainage could cause sever corrosion of pump infrastructure enhance dolomite dissolution and local ground subsidence as well as possibly compromise the structural integrity of the central tailings dam it is recommended that the current groundwater monitoring network be revised for taking proactive action the study highlights

moisture surface air temperature amount and seasonality of precipitation and recharge altitude the relationship between climate and mean annual stable isotope contents of precipitation craig 1961 clark and fritz 1997 dotsika et al 2010 provides significant insights into paleoclimatic conditions and the underlying pre existing evaporation and condensation processes environmental stable isotopes

et al 2001 huang and chen 2012 schofielda and jankowski 2004 various processes in the hydrologic cycle including evaporation condensation recharge mixing and water rock interaction cause fractionation of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes thereby modifying the equilibrium of isotopic ratios from baseline condition aravena 1995 mazor 1997 thus by systematically sampling measuring and mapping the isotopic ratio of various water sources it is possible to understand the process that the water was subjected dotsika et al 2010 successful quantification of evaporation process can also be done using the extent to which stable isotope ratios deuterium and oxygen 18 deviate from the defined local or global meteoric water line values on a catchment level provided that long term spatially representative and detail stable isotope and meteorological data are available gibson et al 1993 in a scenario where considerable mixing of surface water from mining and metallurgical processes and fissure water from shaft dewatering activities is expected qualitative extent of mixing of surface water groundwater can be estimated from measured environmental stable isotope esi data mengistu et al 2015 hydrochemical data of major ions and cations can be interpreted using mixing models and water rock interaction processes to classify water types on the basis of these various classes of water chemistry possible flow paths through which the water may have circulated could be identified woldeyohannes et al 2015a 2015b the hydrochemical data is proven to be indicative of percent mixing thereby showing groundwater migration in a defined direction as well as vertical migration of water if any improving predictive model result using various data sets has shown increasing acceptance and has been advocated to be one way of limiting uncertainties xu et al 2012 mengistu et al 2015 in this study the use of hydrochemical environmental stable isotope esi and radioactive isotope data are used to refine the understanding of conceptual groundwater flow information on groundwater flow paths groundwater recharge conditions groundwater residence times and evaporative processes can be retrieved and integrated with the initial conceptual groundwater model for refinement making it a novel approach numerical modelling is a powerful tool in providing improved understanding of groundwater flow and information on relevant groundwater management parameters provided that scientifically sound and robust conceptual model is available even in the most stressed site conditions such as in mining areas konikow and bredehoeft 1974 robson 1974 owen et al 1996 gvirtzman et al 1997 mills et al 2002 leake et al 2005 mengistu et al 2015 the most important aspect of using numerical models as a tool for various management purposes lies on addressing the issue of how well the real site condition is captured as closely as possible voss 2011a 2011b merz 2012 woldeyohannes et al 2015a 2015b one school of thought advocates developing and implementing generalized groundwater guidelines as an overarching document and modify it to fit the specific site conditions johnson 2010 barnett et al 2012 others argue that the approach of using groundwater numerical modelling guidelines doesn t bring much traction because of the fact that the real world is too complex to be fairly represented with guidelines reilly and habough 2004 in some instances analytical and empirical models calibrated to fit the specific site are used in conjunction with water balance data woldeyohannes and webb 2015 the most common approach to the majority of the scientific community is that uncertainties associated with anisotropy and heterogeneity of aquifer parameters in real field conditions had to be minimized as much as possible through various model result validations swanson and bahir 2004 ji chun and xian xi 2013 sarkar et al 2015 however the use of various data sets to refine a conceptual model to reduce model result uncertainties has not been employed therefore in this study refining of conceptual model a pre requisite for improving numerical modelling through minimizing uncertainties is implemented by integrating hydrochemical and environmental isotope information 2 study area the study area is situated about 200 km southwest of johannesburg city near the boundary of northwest and the northern part of free state provinces south africa the study area covers approximately 96 km2 surrounding an active mining shaft located 3 km south of the vaal river with a waste rock dump very close to the shaft fig 1 the mine started stoping from the shaft in 2003 reaching full production in 2010 reaching in depth to over 4 km below groundwater level dwa 2006 the main tailings storage facilities with its half a dozen seepage dams commissioned in 2003 and expanded in 2011 are situated approximately 2 5 km in the southwest direction dwa 2006 there are two other mining shafts farther west and northwest of the study area gold purification metallurgical and uranium processing plants with associated infrastructure just outside the study area the study area is characterized by generally flat topography with elevation ranging between 1287 m amsl in the northern most area and approximately 1337 m amsl in the southern most portion of the area the northern boundary of the study area is defined by the westerly flowing vaal river with a non perennial stream flowing north in the middle of the small catchment the drainage of the study area is not well developed due to the relatively small average annual precipitation of 650 mm and the flat topography surface water flows generally in a north to north westerly direction which appears to follow the strike of the major fractures and the surface topography the major economic activities of the study area are agriculture crop cultivation and dairy and mining shrubs and grass constitute the major land use although 10 of the area is covered by seasonal crop mainly maize the soil in the area is poorly developed sandy silty clay loam texture having from barely few centimetres to absent i e dolomite exposures especially in the north part the soil thickness gradually increases towards south reaching up to 10 m near the southern boundary 3 geological and hydrogeological setting the geology of the area is mainly characterized by the archaean malmani dolomite group of the transvaal supergroup 3 2 ga composed of carbonates and arenacious rocks exposed mainly in the northern half of the project area covering roughly 30 of the overall surface geology and referred as transvaal dolomite the surface geology map fig 2 there is a subordinate cover of the karoo fluvio lacustrine sequences paleozoic era which becomes more important in the south quarter of the study area sacs 1980 the malmani dolomite referred also as transvaal dolomite is compositionally heterogeneous in that in some sections it is chert rich locally known as the oak tree formation varying laterally to the chert poor monte christo formation with shale and quartzite acting as a confining layer clay 1981 kafri and foster 1989 smith and ritzi 1993 yager and kappel 1998 mccarthy 2006 the volcano sedimentary pretoria group of the transvaal supergroup comprised of conglomerate and sandstone locally crops out in the far northeastern part of the study area erikson et al 2006 the ventersdorp supergroup is outcropped mainly west of the study area and dips east wards beneath the malmani dolomite and pretoria group of the transvaal supergroup clay 1981 the ventersdorp supergroup archaean age comprises bimodal volcanic and siliciclastic sedimentary rocks erikson et al 2006 van niekerk and van der walt 2006 prinsloo 2007 abyie et al 2011 tessema et al 2012 mengistu et al 2015 the bottom unit within the study area is the witwatersrand supergroup which is comprised of shallow marine and fluvial sedimentary rocks quartzites and shale and described as the most important gold bearing formation naickera et al 2003 none of the formations underneath the malmani dolomite are not outcropped within the model domain fig 2 minor but noticeable quaternary alluvium is evident along the vaal river flood plain fig 2 the malmani dolomite unit in the study areas is characterized to be highly fractured and weathered in the top 30 40 m which reaches up to 60 m in the close proximity of major geological structures clay 1981 generally ranges from almost non existent in the west to a depth of up to 1700 m in the eastern boundary fig 3 the intercalation of chert layers within the dolomite geology in the region plays a major role in groundwater storage and flow with chert rich dolomite portion exhibiting higher transmissivity than the chert poor portion of the unit veltman and wilke 2008 winde and van der walt 2004 in the western margin of the study area the ventersdorp volano sedimentary super formation juxtaposes the dolomite and evidently dips gently towards the east below the malmani dolomite the whole sequence of geological formations are dissected by pre and post transvaal fractures and faults down throwing the eastern branch of the most economically important gold bearing ore body the vaal reef several hundred meters and making it one of the deepest mines in the world at roughly 4500 m below ground level duane et al 1997 groundwater storage and flow in the area is dictated by proximity to major structural features and composition of the dolomite unit there are overwhelming evidences in the area that karstification and 3d spatial distribution of cavities are positively correlated with major regional and local structural features tessema et al 2012 the major aquifers are the upper weathered and highly fractured dolomite unit mostly within the top 25 m the slightly weathered and fractured bottom dolomite and the top karoo sediment with the top soil or alluvium formations constituting perched shallow ground water mostly less than 1 5 m below ground surface the regional groundwater flow direction is generally towards the north although local shallow short path flows occur towards topographic lows specifically towards the local stream from west and east directions several evidences suggest that groundwater flow in the malmani dolomite is dominantly preferential along weak zones open fractures and faults and associated dissolution channels within the carbonate formation especially the top 25 m below surface where the majority of cavities and karst features are evident tessema et al 2012 groundwater flow pattern is either enhanced or hampered by few dykes especially those which are categorized as post transvaal in age veltman and wilke 2008 4 methodology

modpath mt3dms rt3d seam3d femwater pest utexas modaem and seep2d aquaveo 2014 pumping tests were conducted at five different sites within the study area each using a pipe of 80 mm inner tube diameter and 80 m long 20 kwa skid mount generator pump with aquamaster electronic flow meter and solinist model 3001 water level logger the tests were conducted for 48 h of pumping and 12 h of recovery and water level data were transferred electronically to a memory key aquifer hydraulic parameters including transmissivity and storage coefficient were calculated based on the pumping tests data using aqtesolv pro software groundwater and surface water samples were taken during the dry season june august of 2012 using 250 ml hdpvc bottles in triplicate for a site cation and trace metal samples were filtered and acidified with 10 hno3 anion samples were filtered but not acidified and environmental isotope samples were unfiltered and unacidified the environmental isotope sampling was intentionally conducted 11 a m 2 pm to reduce d excess which is considered as a reliable tracer of variations in atmospheric moisture harris et al 2010 samples were taken from boreholes near and far away from the main shaft seepage dams vaal river as well as from 900 m bgl depth in moab khutsong shaft the collected samples were properly labelled and stored in portable cooler boxes at 4 c until submission to the laboratory one field duplicate and blank sample were also taken for every 10 sites cation analyses were performed by midvaal water company water services accredited lab using a perkinelmer elan drc ii icp ms system that was calibrated according to the manufacturer s specification whereas anions were analysed using a dionex ion chromatograph ic analytical system with us epa method 300 1 the hydrochemical data generated was plotted on piper trilinear diagram using aquachem software to analyse interpret and compare water quality while data contouring and visualization was implemented with surfer 9 0 spatial data management map generation and overlaying of different layers of information was executed using arcmap 10 1 platform esri 2012 environmental isotope samples were collected in 1 l hdpvc bottles and were put in portable cool boxes and stored at 4 c water 2h 1h and 18o 16o ratios were analysed in the laboratory of the environmental isotope group eig of ithemba laboratory in johannesburg south africa the equipment consists of a pdz europa geo 20 20 gas mass spectrometer connected to peripheral sample piper diagram graphic representation of water analytical data was constructed using aquachem to analyse interpret and compare water quality whereas data contouring and visualization was implemented with surfer 9 0 golden software 2009 a pdz water equilibration system wes was employed for hydrogen and oxygen isotope analysis according to schimmelmann and deniro 1993 and equilibration for oxygen done according to the procedure of socki et al 1992 isotope measurement results are presented in the common delta notation with precision estimated at 0 1 for oxygen and 0 5 for hydrogen delta values are expressed as per mil relative to a known standard in this case standard mean ocean water smow for δ18o and δ2h gibson et al 1993 laboratory standards calibrated against international reference materials were analysed with each batch of samples analytical precision was estimated at 0 1 for o and 0 5 for h the measured values of in permill units are plotted with δ18o on the x axis versus δd on the y axis along with the global meteoric water line gmwl and the local meteoric water line to assess deviations for the two lines and extract the underline processes such as evaporation and mixing clark and fritz 1997 field water samples for tritium were chosen to represent the shallow and deep aquifers stream river and dam waters down and up gradient of the moab khutsong shaft tritium analysis was done by ithemba laboratory using a low level liquid scintillation spectrometer with 500 ml of the water sample according to the protocol developed by international atomic energy agency iaea and usepa method 906 distilled water containing sodium hydroxide was introduced into the cell with a direct current between 10 and 20 a was then subsequently cooled samples of standard known tritium spikes were run in one cell of each batch to check enrichment to be at least 20 times and sample volumes reduced to 20 ml for liquid scintillation counting samples were prepared by directly distilling the enriched water sample from the highly concentrated electrolyte with a detection limit of 0 2 tu 5 results and discussions 5 1 environmental stable isotope twelve samples were taken from the vaal river seepage water from a return water dam shallow aquifer deep aquifer and very deep shaft water intercepted around 900 m bgl during summer season june july 2012 fig 4 four boreholes are upstream of the shaft although the majority of boreholes cluster around the shaft whereas three boreholes are situated around the main tailings storage facility fig 4 the environmental stable isotope data of deuterium ranges from most depleted 49 in a borehole that taps a deeper aquifer to 4 in surface water from tailings dam whereas δ18o values ranges from 8 to 0 1 table 1 the laboratory procedural uncertainty is δ18o 0 1 and δd 0 5 and altitude effect adapted from cape town area is 0 22 for δ18o and 1 4 for δd therefore total margin of error is 0 32 for δ18o and 1 9 for δd plot of the data in relation to the global meteoric water line gmwl shows four type of waters surface water from vaal river and seepage water obviously showing highly enriched isotopic signal caused by fractionation driven by evaporation fig 5 the shallow aquifer waters show relatively more enrichment than deeper aquifer water highly likely indicating significant mixture of recently recharged infiltrating water the third type of water is represented by relatively depleted isotope samples in the deeper aquifers north of the shaft area and the far south farm borehole however one anomalous borehole mk02 located north of the shaft show extremely depleted stable isotope data which points towards a suggestion that perhaps aquifer with a different flow system is evident the shaft water intercepted at the 12 level 900 m bgl falls in the third group of water with a mix of water between recently infiltrated water in the shallow aquifer and deep aquifer 5 2 tritium data tritium data collected from boreholes surface water and the vaal river show values ranging from 0 8 to 3 8 tu table 2 generally the tritium data in the study area evidently show that all water recharge occurred recently post 1960s or confirming active mixing zone between surface and shallow groundwater the argument of active mixing aquifer is not unexpected considering the mine activity in the area which puts considerable amount of recharge into the local aquifer however the sample which shows highly depleted stable isotope signature mk02 is characterized by a rather relatively elevated tritium level pointing towards a recent recharge but geographically outside the mine influence area the farthest south farm borehole mk22 and a borehole south of the tailings dam mk16 deep show the lowest tritium level confirming an earlier argument with stable isotope data of the existence of older water that don t undergo active mixing with recent recharge the most interesting piece of information is the tritium level detected from the shaft water which was sampled roughly 900 m bgl level considering the depth at which the water was taken from the shaft the shaft fissure water is expected to exhibit depleted stable isotope and tritium values typical of deep groundwater therefore argument of short cycle circulation zone or active mixing of surface water must have been going on something which is evident from the stable isotope data 5 3 hydrochemistry data hydrochemical data of eight selected groundwater samples two shaft fissure water and a surface water samples were plotted on piper trilinear diagram to better understand the underlying process responsible for the environmental isotopic variations discussed the hydrochemical data table 3 and fig 6 show three distinct water types ca mg hco3 type water ca mg na so4 cl type water and ca mg na hco3 cl type water chemistry groundwater samples represented by ca mg hco3 type water chemistry are situated upstream of the shaft as well as se and e of the waste rock dump ca mg hco3 type waters appears to show no or very little impact from the mining activities as the water chemistry is typically drawn from water rock carbonate composition interaction samples in the parking pad and in the vicinity of the seepage dam are ca mg cl hco3 cl type water chemistry where the surface water sample taken from the main tailings dam seepage is categorized as ca mg na so4 cl type water the shaft fissure water is grouped in the ca mg na hco3 cl type chemistry fig 6 from the local geology and site information the shaft water intercepted around 900 m below ground surface exhibit considerable mixing of the shallow ca mg hco3 type water with considerable signature of nacl type water mixture the major cation and anion data sheds light that the water intercepted in the shaft as fissure water show strong signature of nacl type water originated from household waste water from the mine office area mixed with the unpolluted ca mg hco3 type water originated from the surrounding carbonate aquifer fig 6 it is evident that currently deep circulation is not expected to be occurring from the eastern side of the model domain the high concentration of na and very low concentrations of ca and mg in the shaft water appear to indicate ion exchange reaction synonymous to sodic rich clay soils and groundwater however there is no clear evidence of sodic rich clay soil nor seepage from the central tailings dam facility and the five seepage dams contributing to the shaft fissure water results of the hydrochemical data interpretation converges well with interpretation results of the environmental isotope data including tritium these two converging evidences are used to refine the conceptual groundwater flow model that was built using site hydrological conditions and local groundwater gradient defined based on measured borehole hydraulic heads 5 4 conceptualization of groundwater flow within the study area understanding and developing a robust conceptual flow model is a very critical component of implementing a functional and acceptable numerical flow model dewandel et al 2006 zhau and li 2011 the three dimensional hydrogeological model was built on the basis of information from the roughly 40 boreholes situated in the vicinity of the shafts and farther away from the major mining operations which are also used as observation points two water levels represented by upper weathered rock soil and karoo formation up to a depth pf 15 m bgl and the lower aquifer intercepted at depths below 35 m bgl site conditions and previously completed mine reports shows that three layered model assumption top soil and karoo sediments top highly fractured and weathered dolomite middle and slightly fractured and weathered dolomite units fairly represent the field condition for groundwater flow simulation fig 7 deep preferential flows are enhanced by a major fault that trends towards the nw of the shaft reaching the surface northwest of the shaft the fault is intercepted around 600 m below ground level within the main mining shaft and seems to cross the entire thickness of the malmani dolomite unit fig 3 it is evident that the fault and the surrounding fracture zone is an active area of groundwater storage groundwater flow and the subsequent mixing of water of different sources detail study of the geology of the area shows two post transvaal faults which branches in the deep zone of the dolomite in which one of the branch is confirmed to be projected to the surface in a southeast northwest trend another younger fault also truncates the post transvaal fault and project to the surface in a northwest direction from the location map the operational tailings dam which is situated in the southwest of the shaft does not appear to contribute to the shaft fissure water however the data substantiates the argument that infiltration of water is being channelled from the impounded seepage dam from the waste rock dump right next to the shaft through preferential pathways created in the vicinity of the deeper fault from the southeast direction towards a zone much below the 12 level 900 m bgl shaft depth once it reaches the intersection with the fault that is projected toward the northwest the water will decant and flow upwards along the fault to the level where it is intercepted by the shaft at a dyke intersection it is also likely that the northwest trending fault acts as another source of water from deeper circulation ground waters which are tapped in boreholes such as mk02 and mk04 just northwest of the shaft therefore very low tritium groundwater is being intercepted by dykes and flow towards the shaft area along the preferential pathways created by the youngest fault and mixes with highly enriched recently charged water that has highly enriched stable isotope signature presumably infiltrating from the seepage dam from the environmental isotope tritium and hydrochemical data it evident that the fissure water intercepted in the main mining shaft has the signature of the local unpolluted groundwater from the south and southwest mixing with the shallow aquifer that get recharged by local precipitation moreover the data suggest contribution of seepage from the mine office household sewage and the surface water evaporation dam to the top aquifer the evidence of active mixing and local flow provides satisfactory explanation to limit the groundwater model domain within the dolomite aquifer that ranges in thickness from west to east and less profoundly from north to south 5 5 numerical modelling 5 5 1 model domain model discretization and model boundaries the model area is represented by the extent of a non perennial stream catchment which flows to the vaal river towards north covering roughly 100 km2 surrounding the target mining shaft fig 8 the model domain is discretised into 200 rows by 200 columns with a mesh size of 50 m by 50 m the mesh size is considered to be optimal value to capture relevant hydrological features but not too detail to ensure reasonable computational time as individual runs are iterative and could take long time for every simulation except the northern boundary all the surrounding model domain edges are marked by subdued surface water divide boundaries with the assumption that no significant crossflow occurs because of the apparent absence of prominent subsurface structures for improved understanding and reliable result interpretation with acceptable level of certainty the malmani dolomite aquifer and the units right above it are incorporated in the simulation excluding the lower units of ventersdorp and the witwatersrand supergroups harbaugh et al 2000 the model domain is delineated by the water divide of the non perennial stream it is also assumed that pumping from the two nearby shafts located outside the catchment does not affect the dynamics of flow within the model domain into which no flow is taken from or added to the study area one of the most important aspect of ascertaining accuracy of flow simulation is assigning the correct model boundaries which direct movement of flow mills et al 2002 swanson and bahir 2004 no flow boundaries are assigned throughout the model domain edges except small stretch along the vaal rive on the basis of surface morphology and no evidence of large scale buried structure that may cause cross boundary flow in a way that contradicts the assumption head dependant flow boundary cauchy type is assigned along the short stretch of the vaal river in the northern strip of the model area the river bottom elevation demonstrates that river aquifer interaction is evident with the upper hydrologic unit average river conductance is assigned to be 1 m2 day on the basis of average aquifer thickness of 3 m average and field vertical infiltration data conducted on various points along the river course fox et al 2011 the malmani dolomite group is weathered and karstified dolomite unit between depths of 3 5 35 mbgl and slightly weathered and fractured to fresh massive dolomite below 35 m to maximum depth of 1500 mbgl towards the eastern boundary of the model on the basis of boreholes and deep mine plans borehole logs indicate that the malmani dolomite group dips from west to east reaching maximum thickness very close to the eastern margin of the model domain boundary water levels and water quality data shows that the dolomite layer support two hydraulically distinct layers whose upper portion 3 5 35 m bgl shows substantial weathering and fracturing and dissolution channels with the bottom layer depth 35 1500 m bgl having a hydraulic conductivity that is an order of magnitude less than the upper portion soil thickness significantly varies from few centimetres to few meters which was considered negligible and therefore modelled with the karoo supergroup in the conceptual flow model initial input values used in the model are obtained from various aquifer test data infiltration test as well as chloride and tritium measurements table 3 thorough effort was made to average aquifer constant values by assigning laterally localized as well vertical hydraulic conductivities consistent with similar modelling work in the judea carbonate in israel as well as nearby catchment north of the study area gvirtzman et al 1997 mengistu et al 2015 specific storage values for the three layers were simulated using average thickness and storativity values which were adapted from earlier aquifer tests for the entire top dolomite aquifer as well as from a report compiled on a similar formation just north and south of the vaal river su et al 2004 mengistu et al 2015 table 4 5 5 2 initial conditions pre mining head distribution was estimated with steady state simulation requiring pre mining recharge which was estimated to be 4 of the of the mean annual precipitation 22 mm per year predicted in the area before mining started 558 mm annum using 24 year rain fall data personal commu mr trevor else of margaret water company along the vaal river and the local stream area 8 44 mm annum was assumed based on previous research along river channels by hodgson et al 2001 slightly different post mining recharge values were determined using the last 12 years annual precipitation data whereas field infiltration data were used to estimate induced recharge value from tailings dams and return water dams table 4 relevant additional aquifer parameters including transmissivity storage coefficient effective porosity were acquired from previous aquifer tests initial head for the transient simulation is adapted from pre mining steady state modelling head distribution calibrated with measured hydraulic heads far away from the current dewatering and mining operations in the pre mining setup the additional input parameters related to mining are not incorporated and only few boreholes sufficiently far away from and upstream of the current cone of depression caused by the dewatering activity are found and used as control points for the transient simulation the major dewatering shaft moab khutsong shaft which has a recorded pumping rate between 1500 and 2500 m3 day was incorporated the dewatering shaft pumping record shows that pumping rate changed from time to time for various reasons and as a result transient simulation was undertaken the simulation was subdivided into five stress periods ranging from 75 days up to 30 years average pumping rate was calculated at 1800 m3 day and was used for stress periods three to four with slightly lower rate of 1500 m3 day used for stress periods 1 and 2 whereas a slightly higher pumping rate of 2500 m3 day for stress period 5 in anticipation of potential cone of depression capturing the seepage from the tailings storage facilities decreasing trend of pumping rate is the reason for using the 10 year average for simulating long term pumping scenario there is not any evidence of subsidence and compaction observation data and therefore no such aquifer property is incorporated 5 5 3 sensitivity test and model calibration model calibration and sensitivity tests which measures the robustness of model are considered to be the most important steps in ensuring the validity of a numerical modelling exercise it s been a common practice to find out the extent to which individual change of a parameter among many causes a change to the model simulation result commonly referred as sensitivity test conventionally sensitivity tests are conducted iteratively to assess how the model simulation result changes when the magnitude of input parameters change using forward simulation gedeon and mallants 2012 recharge hydraulic conductivity and river conductance are the three input parameters which were tested separately for sensitivity to the model outcome recharge parameter shows significant modification of model outcome and simulation residual error and therefore categorized as type iv sensitivity in that slight change causes drastic change in model outcome as well as simulation residual error recharge is a parameter that causes non convergence when the transient simulation causes dry cells within the domain due to shaft dewatering on the other hand the effect of hydraulic conductivity parameter differs from layer to layer in that any change in both horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities in the lower layer layer 3 is less pronounced than the change in the upper layers layers 1 and 2 hydraulic conductivity changes in layer 2 cause the most noticeable altered model outcome compared to the layer above layer 1 or the layer below layer 3 horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the top aquifer also exhibits high sensitivity in significantly changing the model outcome and the simulation residual error sensitivity test conducted using river conductance streambed leakance as input parameter with values from 0 01 to 20 m2 day shows that model simulation result is insensitive to value of river conductance 4 m2 day however when values are changed the model simulation result changes considerably making it to be categorized as type iv sensitivity as well it is very critical that during the modelling exercise a balance had to be achieved between simplicity and complexity though having several parameters in an attempt to represent real field conditions by reducing the number of parameters or by regularisation leake et al 2005 he et al 2013 ji chun and xian xi 2013 automated parameter estimation pest was used to perform inverse modelling and allow optimized values of vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the two aquifers be calculated pest module iteratively calculated values until the least sum of square error is achieved appendix 1 measured hydraulic heads of roughly 40 boreholes in the current state of the flow regime were used to seek the most optimal hydraulic conductivities with the least mean square errors fig 9 similar inverse modelling was done for finding optimum recharge value using the calculated hydraulic conductivity values and measured groundwater hydraulic heads cause non convergence due to several dry cells in layer 1 and layer 2 due to the shaft dewatering application of induced recharge in areas covered by the central tailings facilities and evaporation dams did not offset the dewatering and therefore recharge parameter estimation was disregarded model validation is affirmed with reasonable water balance calculation which shows the inflow mass is very close to what is flowing out of the system table 5 the water mass balance data exclusively incorporates measured values like well and shaft abstraction rate as well as induced recharge from the various mine infrastructure the mass water balance calculated by the numerical simulation is consistent with similar water balance studies compiled elsewhere in the region ogola et al 2011 mengistu et al 2015 5 5 4 numerical model results the most challenging aspect of using a numerical modelling as a tool to thoroughly understand the groundwater flow and storage is to have a picture of what the local area flow system was before mining commenced finding distant boreholes away from the dewatering mine shaft was difficult because either the boreholes tap only the top aquifer or non existent at all however by making use of surface elevation as an initial head reasonable stead state pre mining head distribution was achieved and is used as initial head distribution for the transient simulation under mining condition the pre mining modelling without additional induced recharge and dewatering from the mine shaft shows that groundwater recharge mainly comes from the precipitation the model result shows that groundwater locally flows toward the non perennial stream from east and west direction but generally flowing northerly towards the vaal river following the surface water drainage fig 10 groundwater flow gradient is roughly 0 0004 in the southern portion of the model domain but slightly increases near the stream and in the northern portion of the domain area the inflow water into the system is partly balanced by outflows along the stream and the vaal river fig 10 transient simulation was done on the basis of five stress periods of 100 days 365 days 1095 days 3650 days and 10950 days several scenarios were considered to understand the aquifer response including dewatering due to shaft pumping and induced recharge from mine infrastructure mainly from tailings storage facilities mine waste rock dumps and evaporation dams the simulation shows that roughly 50 of the upper layer layer 1 is dewatered within the first 100 days of pumping where the layer thickness is small as low as 0 8 m in few areas and very limited supply of water replenishment is evident while areas farther upstream of the dewatering shaft south and east do not show any drying of the top layer fig 11 a interestingly the eventual interception of considerable seepage water from the central tailings dam after 30 year of pumping is predicted to generate much higher gradient and higher groundwater level of layer1 fig 11b continuous pumping for almost 30 years doesn t change the flow pattern indicating that the layer may reach near steady or quasi steady state condition it is also evident that layer 2 experiences relatively slight widening of the cone of depression in the first three stress periods and does not change significantly during the later stress periods stress 4 and 5 the extent of dewatering in layer 2 is limited to few isolated areas because of its relatively higher storage coefficient as well as transmissivity of the aquifer during the course of 30 years of pumping the simulation shows that there seem to be a steady supply of input perhaps from induced recharge from the mine infrastructure keeping the radius of influence from further expanding in a significant way fig 12 a and b the dewatering in the bottom layer layer 3 clearly demonstrate gradual but continuous widening and deepening of the cone of depression especially in the northern portion of the model domain fig 13 a b and 13c the 30 year period stress five creates roughly 2 5 km wide cone of depression which has a real possibility of drawing water from the tailings facility as well as the surrounding evaporation dams fig 13c possible capture of seepage water from the main mine tailings storage facility and other infrastructure would have repercussion as the quality of the water is expected to be very poor and possibly highly acidic the longer the dewatering continuous the higher likelihood of shallow boreholes owned by the local farmers around the shaft getting dry within approximately 10 years fig 13b water mass balance or water budget simulation result shows very close inflow and outflow values showing low uncertainty of the flow numerical modelling result table 5 the close estimate of inflow and outflow of water to and out of system is an indicative of pumping from the mine shaft effectively captures the majority of water inflow from the tailings storage facility and local evaporation dams however it is not recommended to assume that the model prediction would stay unchanged provided that climate change could cause either higher or lower recharge than anticipated as well as any unforeseen subsurface geological structure that has not been properly incorporated in the model future change in mining operations which refers to either cessation or expansion would undoubtedly alteration in the flow regime of the model area and obviously the model prediction water budget calculation in pre mining steady state condition is balanced between inflow and outflow where recharge is the only input and the stream and the river as the ways of outflow from the system table 5 it is possible that the non perennial stream the flows northwards was once might be perennial or used to hold more water that is being fed by groundwater 5 6 model result implications and model limitations the model prediction in the short term stress periods 1 and 2 i e after roughly one year of pumping at a rate of 2500 m3 day demonstrates that groundwater in the uppermost layer quickly dewatered areas in the immediate vicinity and where the layer is thin the pattern of dry cells in roughly 50 of layer 1 and isolated areas of layer 2 doesn t considerably change even after extended period of pumping presumably creating quasi steady state condition the implication to this prediction is that any seepage from new mine infrastructure would quickly be captured and intercepted by the pumping at the shaft the effect of pumping in the bottom layer layer 3 is more pronounced after stress period 3 three years the model simulation shows that shaft pumping causes higher groundwater flow gradient than the surrounding areas that quickly could dewater the top aquifer which in turn may cause local ground subsidence extended shaft pumping whose zone of influence enlarges could reach the central tailings storage facility area whose structural stability could be compromised and possibly cause catastrophic dam failure therefore stringent groundwater monitoring network is highly recommended around the central tailings storage facility to observe the groundwater level however pumping does not pose any potential ground instability in the short term the 30 year simulation shows that the zone of influence expands as far southwest as the tailings storage facility and areas north of the model boundary the vaal river the induced seepage of highly polluted water from the central tailings storage facility as well as evaporation dams not only continues to deteriorate the groundwater quality but also it may enhance formation of new or widening of existing dissolution channels within the malmani dolomite upper aquifer which in turn can potentially cause sinkholes and local subsidence groundwater quality monitoring should be able to determine whether or not any groundwater quality change is happening on a timely manner it is inconceivable that the underground mining would create man made tunnelling including hauling of ore bearing rock material to the surface that would facilitate tube like flow in the actual mining area the numerical modelling which is meant for conventional modelling in natural conditions lack to accurately include flow change in the simulation it may cause localized uncertainty but the overall flow regime may not be considerably modified inactive cells located in some portions of the domain is due to very thin thickness of the layer and could incur slight uncertainty in the model result a gravity low anomaly found in a previous un published consultant report is not incorporated in the model as the inferred structure was not confirmed by drilling or any other techniques if indeed the magnetic anomaly is a sink hole which acts as groundwater conduit it may create result uncertainty locally but it may also be insignificant if the entire flow system is considered for the whole model domain 6 conclusions the conceptual groundwater flow model built on the basis of existing borehole logs and detail deep mine map has been verified using hydrochemical and environmental isotope data and tritium data δ18o δ2h 3h all these datasets demonstrate that at the current time shaft fissure water has a strong signature of na cl type water presumably originating from surface mine infrastructure such as the local mine office and loading unloading as well as parking areas the shaft fissure water also shows that sulfate type water is intercepted from the local mine waste rock dump area tritium data set indicates recent recharge water is intercepted in the shaft water likely from rapid rainwater infiltration into the deep levels of the mine through shaft uncapped boreholes and other excavations numerical groundwater flow model built on the basis of the recalibrated conceptual hydrogeological model shows that shaft water pumping at the current rate dewaters roughly 50 of the top layer in the first 100 days however near quasi steady state condition seems to be established after the three years of pumping the numerical modelling prediction further shows the extended 30 years shaft fissure water pumping enlarged the zone of influence to areas of the central tailings storage facility area that may have compromised the structural integrity of the dam it also implies that the 10 and 30 year possible interception of highly polluted and acid mine water from the tailings dam waste rock dump and evaporation dams likely deteriorate the dewatering pumps shaft and other underground mine infrastructure substantial mixing of rock mine drainage also has the potential of accelerated sink hole and other surface subsidence due to enhanced dissolution of the local carbonate malmani dolomite aquifer stringent water quality and water level monitoring network is a highly recommended course of action to proactively take preventive measures from potential catastrophic dam failures in future it is very critical to consider the groundwater flow pattern before implementing future expansion of the central tailings storage facility south of the current dam site future tailings dams expansion should be done south of the existing dam this study underscore the critical importance of using various datasets to develop and calibrate the conventional conceptual groundwater flow models as to properly capture actual field conditions the robustness reliability and predicting capacity of numerical models depend mainly on these improved conceptual groundwater

12252,prediction of response to fissure water pumping from a shaft on the surrounding areas is conducted with a numerical model which was refined using environmental stable isotope esi tritium and hydrochemical datasets the numerical model domain covers the local carbonate rock units mainly because it is known to be the main source of groundwater based on the hydrochemical dataset of the fissure water pumped at the shaft strong signature of na cl type water originating from the seepage of a waste rock dump as well as polluted water from mine offices loading unloading and parking lot areas is evident the environmental isotope data demonstrated that fissure water intercepted at the shaft has strong footprint of surface water and polluted groundwater from nearby areas the 30 year numerical model prediction indicates that pumping at a rate of 2500 m3 day or more would cause the radius of influence to expand to areas where the central tailings storage facility is located and could possibly draw highly acidic water interception of acid rock drainage could cause sever corrosion of pump infrastructure enhance dolomite dissolution and local ground subsidence as well as possibly compromise the structural integrity of the central tailings dam it is recommended that the current groundwater monitoring network be revised for taking proactive action the study highlights

of mining economics lines 1985 rubio and loca 1993 wolkersdorfer 2008 woldeyohannes et al 2015 a and b failure to have a thorough understanding of groundwater flow dynamics could make or break the profitability of the overall mining operation due to exceedingly high human operational and material costs rubio and loca 1993 balasubramaniam and panda 2004 wasteful and expensive dewatering schemes can be avoided with proper economically sound as well as environmentally sustainable design of mine water management on the basis of clear and sound understanding of groundwater storage and flow direction as well as flow rate in many occasions the conventional groundwater flow modelling approaches may not be strictly applicable to design effective groundwater management in mining conditions owing to the complexity of groundwater flow system woldeyohannes and webb 2015 groundwater management in underground mines has another layer of difficulty because of the substantial infrastructure development within and in the vicinity of the mine and the considerable change of the groundwater flow regime relative to natural conditions hodgson et al 2001 conventional hydrological tools designed to characterize groundwater flow even in undisturbed conditions mostly fall short of representing real conditions in a satisfactory manner reilly and habough 2004 ji chun and xian xi 2013 mining activities including construction of tunnels and haulages massive hauling of rock debris from underground construction of tailings storage facilities waste rock dumps evaporation dams and installation of associated metallurgical plants on surface causes significant change in groundwater recharge flow and storage conditions mining operations further complicate conceptualization of groundwater and surface water flow regimes with conventional hydrologic tools rubio and loca 1993 it is almost unconceivable that any viable numerical modelling can be developed without a fact based and reliable conceptual model zhau and li 2011 singhal and goyal 2011 it has been proven that the uncertainty caused by mining operations exceed all the known uncertainty reduction methods including parameter estimation calibration sensitivity analyses as well as invoking additional conceptual model recalibration tools stauffer 2005 fu and gomez hernandez 2009 keating et al 2010 vrugt et al 2014 mengistu et al 2015 the application of environmental stable isotope finger printing method has been widely used in combination with other methods such as geochemical foot printing and tracer testing to evaluate various hydrological processes which include identification of recharge area qualitative groundwater pathway and mixing as well as water rock interaction abyie et al 2011 jaunat et al 2012 chesson et al 2014 mengistu et al 2015 data from environmental stable isotope composition of precipitation waters show close relationship with a number of environmental parameters including source of moisture surface air temperature amount and seasonality of precipitation and recharge altitude the relationship between climate and mean annual stable isotope contents of precipitation craig 1961 clark and fritz 1997 dotsika et al 2010 provides significant insights into paleoclimatic conditions and the underlying pre existing evaporation and condensation processes environmental stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h are commonly used to develop conceptual groundwater flow path identify recharge discharge areas mixing process salinization process of groundwater pulido bosch et al 1997 larsen et al 2001 huang and chen 2012 schofielda and jankowski 2004 various processes in the hydrologic cycle including evaporation condensation recharge mixing and water rock interaction cause fractionation of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes thereby modifying the equilibrium of isotopic ratios from baseline condition aravena 1995 mazor 1997 thus by systematically sampling measuring and mapping the isotopic ratio of various water sources it is possible to understand the process that the water was subjected dotsika et al 2010 successful quantification of evaporation process can also be done using the extent to which stable isotope ratios deuterium and oxygen 18 deviate from the defined local or global meteoric water line values on a catchment level provided that long term spatially representative and detail stable isotope and meteorological data are available gibson et al 1993 in a scenario where considerable mixing of surface water from mining and metallurgical processes and fissure water from shaft dewatering activities is expected qualitative extent of mixing of surface water groundwater can be estimated from measured environmental stable isotope esi data mengistu et al 2015 hydrochemical data of major ions and cations can be interpreted using mixing models and water rock interaction processes to classify water types on the basis of these various classes of water chemistry possible flow paths through which the water may have circulated could be identified woldeyohannes et al 2015a 2015b the hydrochemical data is proven to be indicative of percent mixing thereby showing groundwater migration in a defined direction as well as vertical migration of water if any improving predictive model result using various data sets has shown increasing acceptance and has been advocated to be one way of limiting uncertainties xu et al 2012 mengistu et al 2015 in this study the use of hydrochemical environmental stable isotope esi and radioactive isotope data are used to refine the understanding of conceptual groundwater flow information on groundwater flow paths groundwater recharge conditions groundwater residence times and evaporative processes can be retrieved and integrated with the initial conceptual groundwater model for refinement making it a novel approach numerical modelling is a powerful tool in providing improved understanding of groundwater flow and information on relevant groundwater management parameters provided that scientifically sound and robust conceptual model is available even in the most stressed site conditions such as in mining areas konikow and bredehoeft 1974 robson 1974 owen et al 1996 gvirtzman et al 1997 mills et al 2002 leake et al 2005 mengistu et al 2015 the most important aspect of using numerical models as a tool for various management purposes lies on addressing the issue of how well the real site condition is captured as closely as possible voss 2011a 2011b merz 2012 woldeyohannes et al 2015a 2015b one school of thought advocates developing and implementing generalized groundwater guidelines as an overarching document and modify it to fit the specific site conditions johnson 2010 barnett et al 2012 others argue that the approach of using groundwater numerical modelling guidelines doesn t bring much traction because of the fact that the real world is too complex to be fairly represented with guidelines reilly and habough 2004 in some instances analytical and empirical models calibrated to fit the specific site are used in conjunction with water balance data woldeyohannes and webb 2015 the most common approach to the majority of the scientific community is that uncertainties associated with anisotropy and heterogeneity of aquifer parameters in real field conditions had to be minimized as much as possible through various model result validations swanson and bahir 2004 ji chun and xian xi 2013 sarkar et al 2015 however the use of various data sets to refine a conceptual model to reduce model result uncertainties has not been employed therefore in this study refining of conceptual model a pre requisite for improving numerical modelling through minimizing uncertainties is implemented by integrating hydrochemical and environmental isotope information 2 study area the study area is situated about 200 km southwest of johannesburg city near the boundary of northwest and the northern part of free state provinces south africa the study area covers approximately 96 km2 surrounding an active mining shaft located 3 km south of the vaal river with a waste rock dump very close to the shaft fig 1 the mine started stoping from the shaft in 2003 reaching full production in 2010 reaching in depth to over 4 km below groundwater level dwa 2006 the main tailings storage facilities with its half a dozen seepage dams commissioned in 2003 and expanded in 2011 are situated approximately 2 5 km in the southwest direction dwa 2006 there are two other mining shafts farther west and northwest of the study area gold purification metallurgical and uranium processing plants with associated infrastructure just outside the study area the study area is characterized by generally flat topography with elevation ranging between 1287 m amsl in the northern most area and approximately 1337 m amsl in the southern most portion of the area the northern boundary of the study area is defined by the westerly flowing vaal river with a non perennial stream flowing north in the middle of the small catchment the drainage of the study area is not well developed due to the relatively small average annual precipitation of 650 mm and the flat topography surface water flows generally in a north to north westerly direction which appears to follow the strike of the major fractures and the surface topography the major economic activities of the study area are agriculture crop cultivation and dairy and mining shrubs and grass constitute the major land use although 10 of the area is covered by seasonal crop mainly maize the soil in the area is poorly developed sandy silty clay loam texture having from barely few centimetres to absent i e dolomite exposures especially in the north part the soil thickness gradually increases towards south reaching up to 10 m near the southern boundary 3 geological and hydrogeological setting the geology of the area is mainly characterized by the archaean malmani dolomite group of the transvaal supergroup 3 2 ga composed of carbonates and arenacious rocks exposed mainly in the northern half of the project area covering roughly 30 of the overall surface geology and referred as transvaal dolomite the surface geology map fig 2 there is a subordinate cover of the karoo fluvio lacustrine sequences paleozoic era which becomes more important in the south quarter of the study area sacs 1980 the malmani dolomite referred also as transvaal dolomite is compositionally heterogeneous in that in some sections it is chert rich locally known as the oak tree formation varying laterally to the chert poor monte christo formation with shale and quartzite acting as a confining layer clay 1981 kafri and foster 1989 smith and ritzi 1993 yager and kappel 1998 mccarthy 2006 the volcano sedimentary pretoria group of the transvaal supergroup comprised of conglomerate and sandstone locally crops out in the far northeastern part of the study area erikson et al 2006 the ventersdorp supergroup is outcropped mainly west of the study area and dips east wards beneath the malmani dolomite and pretoria group of the transvaal supergroup clay 1981 the ventersdorp supergroup archaean age comprises bimodal volcanic and siliciclastic sedimentary rocks erikson et al 2006 van niekerk and van der walt 2006 prinsloo 2007 abyie et al 2011 tessema et al 2012 mengistu et al 2015 the bottom unit within the study area is the witwatersrand supergroup which is comprised of shallow marine and fluvial sedimentary rocks quartzites and shale and described as the most important gold bearing formation naickera et al 2003 none of the formations underneath the malmani dolomite are not outcropped within the model domain fig 2 minor but noticeable quaternary alluvium is evident along the vaal river flood plain fig 2 the malmani dolomite unit in the study areas is characterized to be highly fractured and weathered in the top 30 40 m which reaches up to 60 m in the close proximity of major geological structures clay 1981 generally ranges from almost non existent in the west to a depth of up to 1700 m in the eastern boundary fig 3 the intercalation of chert layers within the dolomite geology in the region plays a major role in groundwater storage and flow with chert rich dolomite portion exhibiting higher transmissivity than the chert poor portion of the unit veltman and wilke 2008 winde and van der walt 2004 in the western margin of the study area the ventersdorp volano sedimentary super formation juxtaposes the dolomite and evidently dips gently towards the east below the malmani dolomite the whole sequence of geological formations are dissected by pre and post transvaal fractures and faults down throwing the eastern branch of the most economically important gold bearing ore body the vaal reef several hundred meters and making it one of the deepest mines in the world at roughly 4500 m below ground level duane et al 1997 groundwater storage and flow in the area is dictated by proximity to major structural features and composition of the dolomite unit there are overwhelming evidences in the area that karstification and 3d spatial distribution of cavities are positively correlated with major regional and local structural features tessema et al 2012 the major aquifers are the upper weathered and highly fractured dolomite unit mostly within the top 25 m the slightly weathered and fractured bottom dolomite and the top karoo sediment with the top soil or alluvium formations constituting perched shallow ground water mostly less than 1 5 m below ground surface the regional groundwater flow direction is generally towards the north although local shallow short path flows occur towards topographic lows specifically towards the local stream from west and east directions several evidences suggest that groundwater flow in the malmani dolomite is dominantly preferential along weak zones open fractures and faults and associated dissolution channels within the carbonate formation especially the top 25 m below surface where the majority of cavities and karst features are evident tessema et al 2012 groundwater flow pattern is either enhanced or hampered by few dykes especially those which are categorized as post transvaal in age veltman and wilke 2008 4 methodology

modpath mt3dms rt3d seam3d femwater pest utexas modaem and seep2d aquaveo 2014 pumping tests were conducted at five different sites within the study area each using a pipe of 80 mm inner tube diameter and 80 m long 20 kwa skid mount generator pump with aquamaster electronic flow meter and solinist model 3001 water level logger the tests were conducted for 48 h of pumping and 12 h of recovery and water level data were transferred electronically to a memory key aquifer hydraulic parameters including transmissivity and storage coefficient were calculated based on the pumping tests data using aqtesolv pro software groundwater and surface water samples were taken during the dry season june august of 2012 using 250 ml hdpvc bottles in triplicate for a site cation and trace metal samples were filtered and acidified with 10 hno3 anion samples were filtered but not acidified and environmental isotope samples were unfiltered and unacidified the environmental isotope sampling was intentionally conducted 11 a m 2 pm to reduce d excess which is considered as a reliable tracer of variations in atmospheric moisture harris et al 2010 samples were taken from boreholes near and far away from the main shaft seepage dams vaal river as well as from 900 m bgl depth in moab khutsong shaft the collected samples were properly labelled and stored in portable cooler boxes at 4 c until submission to the laboratory one field duplicate and blank sample were also taken for every 10 sites cation analyses were performed by midvaal water company water services accredited lab using a perkinelmer elan drc ii icp ms system that was calibrated according to the manufacturer s specification whereas anions were analysed using a dionex ion chromatograph ic analytical system with us epa method 300 1 the hydrochemical data generated was plotted on piper trilinear diagram using aquachem software to analyse interpret and compare water quality while data contouring and visualization was implemented with surfer 9 0 spatial data management map generation and overlaying of different layers of information was executed using arcmap 10 1 platform esri 2012 environmental isotope samples were collected in 1

johannesburg south africa the equipment consists of a pdz europa geo 20 20 gas mass spectrometer connected to peripheral sample piper diagram graphic representation of water analytical data was constructed using aquachem to analyse interpret and compare water quality whereas data contouring and visualization was implemented with surfer 9 0 golden software 2009 a pdz water equilibration system wes was employed for hydrogen and oxygen isotope analysis according to schimmelmann and deniro 1993 and equilibration for oxygen done according to the procedure of socki et al 1992 isotope measurement results are presented in the common delta notation with precision estimated at 0 1 for oxygen and 0 5 for hydrogen delta values are expressed as per mil relative to a known standard in this case standard mean ocean water smow for δ18o and δ2h gibson et al 1993 laboratory standards calibrated against international reference materials were analysed with each batch of samples analytical precision was estimated at 0 1 for o and 0 5 for h the measured values of in permill units are plotted with δ18o on the x axis versus δd on the y axis along with the global meteoric water line gmwl and the local meteoric water line to assess deviations for the two lines and extract the underline processes such as evaporation and mixing clark and fritz 1997 field water samples for tritium were chosen to represent the shallow and deep aquifers stream river and dam waters down and up gradient of the moab khutsong shaft tritium analysis was done by ithemba laboratory using a low level liquid scintillation spectrometer with 500 ml of the water sample according to the protocol developed by international atomic energy agency iaea and usepa method 906 distilled water containing sodium hydroxide was introduced into the cell with a direct current between 10 and 20 a was then subsequently cooled samples of standard known tritium spikes were run in one cell of each batch to check enrichment to be at least 20 times and sample volumes reduced to 20 ml for liquid scintillation counting samples were prepared by directly distilling the enriched water sample from the highly concentrated electrolyte with a detection limit of 0 2 tu 5 results and discussions 5 1 environmental stable isotope twelve samples were taken from the vaal river seepage water from a return water dam shallow aquifer deep aquifer and very deep shaft water intercepted around 900 m bgl during summer season june july 2012 fig 4 four boreholes are upstream of the shaft although the majority of boreholes cluster around the shaft whereas three boreholes are situated around the main tailings storage facility fig 4 the environmental stable isotope data of deuterium ranges from most depleted 49 in a borehole that taps a deeper aquifer to 4 in surface water from tailings dam whereas δ18o values ranges from 8 to 0 1 table 1 the laboratory procedural uncertainty is δ18o 0 1 and δd 0 5 and altitude effect adapted from cape town area is 0 22 for δ18o and 1 4 for δd therefore total margin of error is 0 32 for δ18o and 1 9 for δd plot of the data in relation to the global meteoric water line gmwl shows four type of waters surface water from vaal river and seepage water obviously showing highly enriched isotopic signal caused by fractionation driven by evaporation fig 5 the shallow aquifer waters show relatively more enrichment than deeper aquifer water highly likely indicating significant mixture of recently recharged infiltrating water the third type of water is represented by relatively depleted isotope samples in the deeper aquifers north of the shaft area and the far south farm borehole however one anomalous borehole mk02 located north of the shaft show extremely depleted stable isotope data which points towards a suggestion that perhaps aquifer with a different flow system is evident the shaft water intercepted at the 12 level 900 m bgl falls in the third group of water with a mix of water between recently infiltrated water in the shallow aquifer and deep aquifer 5 2 tritium data tritium data collected from boreholes surface water and the vaal river show values ranging from 0 8 to 3 8 tu table 2 generally the tritium data in the study area evidently show that all water recharge occurred recently post 1960s or confirming active mixing zone between surface and shallow groundwater the argument of active mixing aquifer is not unexpected considering the mine activity in the area which puts considerable amount of recharge into the local aquifer however the sample which shows highly depleted stable isotope signature mk02 is characterized by a rather relatively elevated tritium level pointing towards a recent recharge but geographically outside the mine influence area the farthest south farm borehole mk22 and a borehole south of the tailings dam mk16 deep show the lowest tritium level confirming an earlier argument with stable isotope data of the existence of older water that don t undergo active mixing with recent recharge the most interesting piece of information is the tritium level detected from the shaft water which was sampled roughly 900 m bgl level considering the depth at which the water was taken from the shaft the shaft fissure water is expected to exhibit depleted stable isotope and tritium values typical of deep groundwater therefore argument of short cycle circulation zone or active mixing of surface water must have been going on something which is evident from the stable isotope data 5 3 hydrochemistry data hydrochemical data of eight selected groundwater samples two shaft fissure water and a surface water samples were plotted on piper trilinear diagram to better understand the underlying process responsible for the environmental isotopic variations discussed the hydrochemical data table 3 and fig 6 show three distinct water types ca mg hco3 type water ca mg na so4 cl type water and ca mg na hco3 cl type water chemistry groundwater samples represented by ca mg hco3 type water chemistry are situated upstream of the shaft as well as se and e of the waste rock dump ca mg hco3 type waters appears to show no or very little impact from the mining activities as the water chemistry is typically drawn from water rock carbonate composition interaction samples in the parking pad and in the vicinity of the seepage dam are ca mg cl hco3 cl type water chemistry where the surface water sample taken from the main tailings dam seepage is categorized as ca mg na so4 cl type water the shaft fissure water is grouped in the ca mg na hco3 cl type chemistry fig 6 from the local geology and site information the shaft water intercepted around 900 m below ground surface exhibit considerable mixing of the shallow ca mg hco3 type water with considerable signature of nacl type water mixture the major cation and anion data sheds light that the water intercepted in the shaft as fissure water show strong signature of nacl type water originated from household waste water from the mine office area mixed with the unpolluted ca mg hco3 type water originated from the surrounding carbonate aquifer fig 6 it is evident that currently deep circulation is not expected to be occurring from the eastern side of the model domain the high concentration of na and very low concentrations of ca and mg in the shaft water appear to indicate ion exchange reaction synonymous to sodic rich clay soils and groundwater however there is no clear evidence of sodic rich clay soil nor seepage from the central tailings dam facility and the five seepage dams contributing to the shaft fissure water results of the hydrochemical data interpretation converges well with interpretation results of the environmental isotope data including tritium these two converging evidences are used to refine the conceptual groundwater flow model that was built using site hydrological conditions and local groundwater gradient defined based on measured borehole hydraulic heads 5 4 conceptualization of groundwater flow within the study area understanding and developing a robust conceptual flow model is a very critical component of implementing a functional and acceptable numerical flow model dewandel et al 2006 zhau and li 2011 the three dimensional hydrogeological model was built on the basis of information from the roughly 40 boreholes situated in the vicinity of the shafts and farther away from the major mining operations which are also used as observation points two water levels represented by upper weathered rock soil and karoo formation up to a depth pf 15 m bgl and the lower aquifer intercepted at depths below 35 m bgl site conditions and previously completed mine reports shows that three layered model assumption top soil and karoo sediments top highly fractured and weathered dolomite middle and slightly fractured and weathered dolomite units fairly represent the field condition for groundwater flow simulation fig 7 deep preferential flows are enhanced by a major fault that trends towards the nw of the shaft reaching the surface northwest of the shaft the fault is intercepted around 600 m below ground level within the main mining shaft and seems to cross the entire thickness of the malmani dolomite unit fig 3 it is evident that the fault and the surrounding fracture zone is an active area of groundwater storage groundwater flow and the subsequent mixing of water of different sources detail study of the geology of the area shows two post transvaal faults which branches in the deep zone of the dolomite in which one of the branch is confirmed to be projected to the surface in a southeast northwest trend another younger fault also truncates the post transvaal fault and project to the surface in a northwest direction from the location map the operational tailings dam which is situated in the southwest of the shaft does not appear to contribute to the shaft fissure water however the data substantiates the argument that infiltration of water is being channelled from the impounded seepage dam from the waste rock dump right next to the shaft through preferential pathways created in the vicinity of the deeper fault from the southeast direction towards a zone much below the 12 level 900 m bgl shaft depth once it reaches the intersection with the fault that is projected toward the northwest the water will decant and flow upwards along the fault to the level where it is intercepted by the shaft at a dyke intersection it is also likely that the northwest trending fault acts as another source of water from deeper circulation ground waters which are tapped in boreholes such as mk02 and mk04 just northwest of the shaft therefore very low tritium groundwater is being intercepted by dykes and flow towards the shaft area along the preferential pathways created by the youngest fault and mixes with highly enriched recently charged water that has highly enriched stable isotope signature presumably infiltrating from the seepage dam from the environmental isotope tritium and hydrochemical data it evident that the fissure water intercepted in the main mining shaft has the signature of the local unpolluted groundwater from the south and southwest mixing with the shallow aquifer that get recharged by local precipitation moreover the data suggest contribution of seepage from the mine office household sewage and the surface water evaporation dam to the top aquifer the evidence of active mixing and local flow provides satisfactory explanation to limit the groundwater model domain within the dolomite aquifer that ranges in thickness from west to east and less profoundly from north to south 5 5 numerical modelling 5 5 1 model domain model discretization and model boundaries the model area is represented by the extent of a non perennial stream catchment which flows to the vaal river towards north covering roughly 100 km2 surrounding the target mining shaft fig 8 the model domain is discretised into 200 rows by 200 columns with a mesh size of 50 m by 50 m the mesh size is considered to be optimal value to capture relevant hydrological features but not too detail to ensure reasonable computational time as individual runs are iterative and could take long time for every simulation except the northern boundary all the surrounding model domain edges are marked by subdued surface water divide boundaries with the assumption that no significant crossflow occurs because of the apparent absence of prominent subsurface structures for improved understanding and reliable result interpretation with acceptable level of certainty the malmani dolomite aquifer and the units right above it are incorporated in the simulation excluding the lower units of ventersdorp and the witwatersrand supergroups harbaugh et al 2000 the model domain is delineated by the water divide of the non perennial stream it is also assumed that pumping from the two nearby shafts located outside the catchment does not affect the dynamics of flow within the model domain into which no flow is taken from or added to the study area one of the most important aspect of ascertaining accuracy of flow simulation is assigning the correct model boundaries which direct movement of flow mills et al 2002 swanson and bahir 2004 no flow boundaries are assigned throughout the model domain edges except small stretch along the vaal rive on the basis of surface morphology and no evidence of large scale buried structure that may cause cross boundary flow in a way that contradicts the assumption head dependant flow boundary cauchy type is assigned along the short stretch of the vaal river in the northern strip of the model area the river bottom elevation demonstrates that river aquifer interaction is evident with the upper hydrologic unit average river conductance is assigned to be 1 m2 day on the basis of average aquifer thickness of 3 m average and field vertical infiltration data conducted on various points along the river course fox et al 2011 the malmani dolomite group is weathered and karstified dolomite unit between depths of 3 5 35 mbgl and slightly weathered and fractured to fresh massive dolomite below 35 m to maximum depth of 1500 mbgl towards the eastern boundary of the model on the basis of boreholes and deep mine plans borehole logs indicate that the malmani dolomite group dips from west to east reaching maximum thickness very close to the eastern margin of the model domain boundary water levels and water quality data shows that the dolomite layer support two hydraulically distinct layers whose upper portion 3 5 35 m bgl shows substantial weathering and fracturing and dissolution channels with the bottom layer depth 35 1500 m bgl having a hydraulic conductivity that is an order of magnitude less than the upper portion soil thickness significantly varies from few centimetres to few meters which was considered negligible and therefore modelled with the karoo supergroup in the conceptual flow model initial input values used in the model are obtained from various aquifer test data infiltration test as well as chloride and tritium measurements table 3 thorough effort was made to average aquifer constant values by assigning laterally localized as well vertical hydraulic conductivities consistent with similar modelling work in the judea carbonate in israel as well as nearby catchment north of the study area gvirtzman et al 1997 mengistu et al 2015 specific storage values for the three layers were simulated using average thickness and storativity values which were adapted from earlier aquifer tests for the entire top dolomite aquifer as well as from a report compiled on a similar formation just north and south of the vaal river su et al 2004 mengistu et al 2015 table 4 5 5 2 initial conditions pre mining head distribution was estimated with steady state simulation requiring pre mining recharge which was estimated to be 4 of the of the mean annual precipitation 22 mm per year predicted in the area before mining started 558 mm annum using 24 year rain fall data personal commu mr trevor else of margaret water company along the vaal river and the local stream area 8 44 mm annum was assumed based on previous research along river channels by hodgson et al 2001 slightly different post mining recharge values were determined using the last 12 years annual precipitation data whereas field infiltration data were used to estimate induced recharge value from tailings dams and return water dams table 4 relevant additional aquifer parameters including transmissivity storage coefficient effective porosity were acquired from previous aquifer tests initial head for the transient simulation is adapted from pre mining steady state modelling head distribution calibrated with measured hydraulic heads far away from the current dewatering and mining operations in the pre mining setup the additional input parameters related to mining are not incorporated and only few boreholes sufficiently far away from and upstream of the current cone of depression caused by the dewatering activity are found and used as control points for the transient simulation the major dewatering shaft moab khutsong shaft which has a recorded pumping rate between 1500 and 2500 m3 day was incorporated the dewatering shaft pumping record shows that pumping rate changed from time to time for various reasons and as a result transient simulation was undertaken the simulation was subdivided into five stress periods ranging from 75 days up to 30 years average pumping rate was calculated at 1800 m3 day and was used for stress periods three to four with slightly lower rate of 1500 m3 day used for stress periods 1 and 2 whereas a slightly higher pumping rate of 2500 m3 day for stress period 5 in anticipation of potential cone of depression capturing the seepage from the tailings storage facilities decreasing trend of pumping rate is the reason for using the 10 year average for simulating long term pumping scenario there is not any evidence of subsidence and compaction observation data and therefore no such aquifer property is incorporated 5 5 3 sensitivity test and model calibration model calibration and sensitivity tests which measures the robustness of model are considered to be the most important steps in ensuring the validity of a numerical modelling exercise it s been a common practice to find out the extent to which individual change of a parameter among many causes a change to the model simulation result commonly referred as sensitivity test conventionally sensitivity tests are conducted iteratively to assess how the model simulation result changes when the magnitude of input parameters change using forward simulation gedeon and mallants 2012 recharge hydraulic conductivity and river conductance are the three input parameters which were tested separately for sensitivity to the model outcome recharge parameter shows significant modification of model outcome and simulation residual error and therefore categorized as type iv sensitivity in that slight change causes drastic change in model outcome as well as simulation residual error recharge is a parameter that causes non convergence when the transient simulation causes dry cells within the domain due to shaft dewatering on the other hand the effect of hydraulic conductivity parameter differs from layer to layer in that any change in both horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities in the lower layer layer 3 is less pronounced than the change in the upper layers layers 1 and 2 hydraulic conductivity changes in layer 2 cause the most noticeable altered model outcome compared to the layer above layer 1 or the layer below layer 3 horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the top aquifer also exhibits high sensitivity in significantly changing the model outcome and the simulation residual error sensitivity test conducted using river conductance streambed leakance as input parameter with values from 0 01 to 20 m2 day shows that model simulation result is insensitive to value of river conductance 4 m2 day however when values are changed the model simulation result changes considerably making it to be categorized as type iv sensitivity as well it is very critical that during the modelling exercise a balance had to be achieved between simplicity and complexity though having several parameters in an attempt to represent real field conditions by reducing the number of parameters or by regularisation leake et al 2005 he et al 2013 ji chun and xian xi 2013 automated parameter estimation pest was used to perform inverse modelling and allow optimized values of vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the two aquifers be calculated pest module iteratively calculated values until the least sum of square error is achieved appendix 1 measured hydraulic heads of roughly 40 boreholes in the current state of the flow regime were used to seek the most optimal hydraulic conductivities with the least mean square errors fig 9 similar inverse modelling was done for finding optimum recharge value using the calculated hydraulic conductivity values and measured groundwater hydraulic heads cause non convergence due to several dry cells in layer 1 and layer 2 due to the shaft dewatering application of induced recharge in areas covered by the central tailings facilities and evaporation dams did not offset the dewatering and therefore recharge parameter estimation was disregarded model validation is affirmed with reasonable water balance calculation which shows the inflow mass is very close to what is flowing out of the system table 5 the water mass balance data exclusively incorporates measured values like well and shaft abstraction rate as well as induced recharge from the various mine infrastructure the mass water balance calculated by the numerical simulation is consistent with similar water balance studies compiled elsewhere in the region ogola et al 2011 mengistu et al 2015 5 5 4 numerical model results the most challenging aspect of using a numerical modelling as a tool to thoroughly understand the groundwater flow and storage is to have a picture of what the local area flow system was before mining commenced finding distant boreholes away from the dewatering mine shaft was difficult because either the boreholes tap only the top aquifer or non existent at all however by making use of surface elevation as an initial head reasonable stead state pre mining head distribution was achieved and is used as initial head distribution for the transient simulation under mining condition the pre mining modelling without additional induced recharge and dewatering from the mine shaft shows that groundwater recharge mainly comes from the precipitation the model result shows that groundwater locally flows toward the non perennial stream from east and west direction but generally flowing northerly towards the vaal river following the surface water drainage fig 10 groundwater flow gradient is roughly 0 0004 in the southern portion of the model domain but slightly increases near the stream and in the northern portion of the domain area the inflow water into the system is partly balanced by outflows along the stream and the vaal river fig 10 transient simulation was done on the basis of five stress periods of 100 days 365 days 1095 days 3650 days and 10950 days several scenarios were considered to understand the aquifer response including dewatering due to shaft pumping and induced recharge from mine infrastructure mainly from tailings storage facilities mine waste rock dumps and evaporation dams the simulation shows that roughly 50 of the upper layer layer 1 is dewatered within the first 100 days of pumping where the layer thickness is small as low as 0 8 m in few areas and very limited supply of water replenishment is evident while areas farther upstream of the dewatering shaft south and east do not show any drying of the top layer fig 11 a interestingly the eventual interception of considerable seepage water from the central tailings dam after 30 year of pumping is predicted to generate much higher gradient and higher groundwater level of layer1 fig 11b continuous pumping for almost 30 years doesn t change the flow pattern indicating that the layer may reach near steady or quasi steady state condition it is also evident that layer 2 experiences relatively slight widening of the cone of depression in the first three stress periods and does not change significantly during the later stress periods stress 4 and 5 the extent of dewatering in layer 2 is limited to few isolated areas because of its relatively higher storage coefficient as well as transmissivity of the aquifer during the course of 30 years of pumping the simulation shows that there seem to be a steady supply of input perhaps from induced recharge from the mine infrastructure keeping the radius of influence from further expanding in a significant way fig 12 a and b the dewatering in the bottom layer layer 3 clearly demonstrate gradual but continuous widening and deepening of the cone of depression especially in the northern portion of the model domain fig 13 a b and 13c the 30 year period stress five creates roughly 2 5 km wide cone of depression which has a real possibility of drawing water from the tailings facility as well as the surrounding evaporation dams fig 13c possible capture of seepage water from the main mine tailings storage facility and other infrastructure would have repercussion as the quality of the water is expected to be very poor and possibly highly acidic the longer the dewatering continuous the higher likelihood of shallow boreholes owned by the local farmers around the shaft getting dry within approximately 10 years fig 13b water mass balance or water budget simulation result shows very close inflow and outflow values showing low uncertainty of the flow numerical modelling result table 5 the close estimate of inflow and outflow of water to and out of system is an indicative of pumping from the mine shaft effectively captures the majority of water inflow from the tailings storage facility and local evaporation dams however it is not recommended to assume that the model prediction would stay unchanged provided that climate change could cause either higher or lower recharge than anticipated as well as any unforeseen subsurface geological structure that has not been properly incorporated in the model future change in mining operations which refers to either cessation or expansion would undoubtedly alteration in the flow regime of the model area and obviously the model prediction water budget calculation in pre mining steady state condition is balanced between inflow and outflow where recharge is the only input and the stream and the river as the ways of outflow from the system table 5 it is possible that the non perennial stream the flows northwards was once might be perennial or used to hold more water that is being fed by groundwater 5 6 model result implications and model limitations the model prediction in the short term stress periods 1 and 2 i e after roughly one year of pumping at a rate of 2500 m3 day demonstrates that groundwater in the uppermost layer quickly dewatered areas in the immediate vicinity and where the layer is thin the pattern of dry cells in roughly 50 of layer 1 and isolated areas of layer 2 doesn t considerably change even after extended period of pumping presumably creating quasi steady state condition the implication to this prediction is that any seepage from new mine infrastructure would quickly be captured and intercepted by the pumping at the shaft the effect of pumping in the bottom layer layer 3 is more pronounced after stress period 3 three years the model simulation shows that shaft pumping causes higher groundwater flow gradient than the surrounding areas that quickly could dewater the top aquifer which in turn may cause local ground subsidence extended shaft pumping whose zone of influence enlarges could reach the central tailings storage facility area whose structural stability could be compromised and possibly cause catastrophic dam failure therefore stringent groundwater monitoring network is highly recommended around the central tailings storage facility to observe the groundwater level however pumping does not pose any potential ground instability in the short term the 30 year simulation shows that the zone of influence expands as far southwest as the tailings storage facility and areas north of the model boundary the vaal river the induced seepage of highly polluted water from the central tailings storage facility as well as evaporation dams not only continues to deteriorate the groundwater quality but also it may enhance formation of new or widening of existing dissolution channels within the malmani dolomite upper aquifer which in turn can potentially cause sinkholes and local subsidence groundwater quality monitoring should be able to determine whether or not any groundwater quality change is happening on a timely manner it is inconceivable that the underground mining would create man made tunnelling including hauling of ore bearing rock material to the surface that would facilitate tube like flow in the actual mining area the numerical modelling which is meant for conventional modelling in natural conditions lack to accurately include flow change in the simulation it may cause localized uncertainty but the overall flow regime may not be considerably modified inactive cells located in some portions of the domain is due to very thin thickness of the layer and could incur slight uncertainty in the model result a gravity low anomaly found in a previous un published consultant report is not incorporated in the model as the inferred structure was not confirmed by drilling or any other techniques if indeed the magnetic anomaly is a sink hole which acts as groundwater conduit it may create result uncertainty locally but it may also be insignificant if the entire flow system is considered for the whole model domain 6 conclusions the conceptual groundwater flow model built on the basis of existing borehole logs and detail deep mine map has been verified using hydrochemical and environmental isotope data and tritium data δ18o δ2h 3h all these datasets demonstrate that at the current time shaft fissure water has a strong signature of na cl type water presumably originating from surface mine infrastructure such as the local mine office and loading unloading as well as parking areas the shaft fissure water also shows that sulfate type water is intercepted from the local mine waste rock dump area tritium data set indicates recent recharge water is intercepted in the shaft water likely from rapid rainwater infiltration into the deep levels of the mine through shaft uncapped boreholes and other excavations numerical groundwater flow model built on the basis of the recalibrated conceptual hydrogeological model shows that shaft water pumping at the current rate dewaters roughly 50 of the top layer in the first 100 days however near quasi steady state condition seems to be established after the three years of pumping the numerical modelling prediction further shows the extended 30 years shaft fissure water pumping enlarged the zone of influence to areas of the central tailings storage facility area that may have compromised the structural integrity of the dam it also implies that the 10 and 30 year possible interception of highly polluted and acid mine water from the tailings dam waste rock dump and evaporation dams likely deteriorate the dewatering pumps shaft and other underground mine infrastructure substantial mixing of rock mine drainage also has the potential of accelerated sink hole and other surface subsidence due to enhanced dissolution of the local carbonate malmani dolomite aquifer stringent water quality and water level monitoring network is a highly recommended course of action to proactively take preventive measures from potential catastrophic dam failures in future it is very critical to consider the groundwater flow pattern before implementing future expansion of the central tailings storage facility south of the current dam site future tailings dams expansion should be done south of the existing dam this study underscore the critical importance of using various datasets to develop and calibrate the conventional conceptual groundwater flow models as to properly capture actual field conditions the robustness reliability and predicting capacity of numerical models depend mainly on these improved conceptual groundwater

still is a sustainable solution to provide potable water researchers used work on passive and active solar still to improve distillate output but the very less research work done on tubular solar still hence the main aim of this review paper is to review various research works on tubular solar still done by multiple researchers 2 working principle of tubular solar still tubular solar still is consists of a transparent tubular cover and a black semicircular trough inside the tubular cover the sun energy after transmitting through a transparent tubular cover is principally absorbed by water in the channel consequently the water is heated up and evaporates the water vapour density of the humid air raises connected with the evaporation from the water surface and then the water vapour is condensed on the inner surface of the tubular cover releasing its latent heat of vaporization in the end the condensed water naturally trickles down toward the bottom of the tubular cover due to gravity and then is collected into a collector through a pipe equipped at the lower end of the tubular cover fig 1 shows the tubular solar still 3 various techniques to enhance the distillate output of tubular solar still salman hammadi et al ahsan et al 2011 designed fabricated and tested conventional tubular solar still tss and tested in climate conditions of iraq their main aim behind the experimental work was to investigate the effect of brine water depth on the performance of tubular solar still tss they found that the distillate output of tss increases with the decrease of water depth in tss they have also investigated the distillate output and received the highest production during july fig 2 shows the distillate output received by tss from february to july 2015 ishan khudur and rai khudhur and rai 2014 conducted experimental work on tubular solar still with the use of phase change material and tested in climate conditions of allahabad india they want to see the effect of the use of phase change material on distillate output of tubular solar still they received 20 enhancement of distillate output by use of phase change material in tubular solar still based on the experimental results they also derived correlation for water temperature and distillate output as shown in fig 3 later bhaskar and rai 2018 used a 4 w dc fan in the tubular solar still to examine the outcome on the thermal performance of the system they conducted experiments with and without the use of a fan and obtained 133 higher distillate output with the use of a fan in tubular solar still fig 4 shows the distillate output obtained by fan and absence of fan in tubular solar still distillate output of tubular solar still is lower hence it is a prime duty of a researcher to study the design of tubular solar still before the actual fabrication thus rahbar et al 2018 carried out the 2 d cfd simulation of tubular solar still to calculate the heat and mass transfer of tubular solar still they also carried out the experiments on tubular solar still and compared with the simulation results and obtained good agreement between the simulation and experimental results they also found that most of the condensation of vapour takes place at the outer glass cover of tubular solar still at last they proposed a new model to estimate the distillate output and heat and mass transfer relations fig 5 shows the comparison between the experimental and cfd simulation results of tubular solar still chen et al 2013 carried out an experimental analysis of three effect solar still and tested in the laboratory their main aim of the experimentation was to assess the performance of three effect solar still by varying the heating of water on distillate output for heating of water in the three effects tubular solar still three different heating phases of 100 200 300 and 400 w used for the research work they found that when the heating phase was increased from 100 w to 400 w then distillate output of tubular solar still increases fig 6 shows the relationship between the heating phase and the total distillate output of three effects tubular solar still ahsan and fukuhara 2010 conducted an experimental analysis of two tubular solar still models with vinyl chloride and polyethene film as cover material they experimented both models with the use of the solar simulator and observed that

output at last they carried out filed test analysis at different countries and obtained good agreement between the calculated results and field data results fig 7 shows the schematic diagram of experiments on two models of tubular solar still arunkumar et al 2013 conducted the experiments on single basin solar still coupled with compound parabolic concentrator concentric tubular solar still cpc ctsst as shown in fig 8 the cpc ctsst used to supply the hot water to solar still to increase the distillate output they determined that the distillate output of single basin solar still increased by application of cpc ctsst due to the enhancement of evaporative heat transfer coefficient they also used phase change material in single basin solar still and received an improvement in distillate output during night also fig shows the experiment setup of cpc ctsst mohamed elashmawy 2017 compared performance analysis of tubular solar still with the use of rectangular trough with clothing and half cylindrical trough without clothing they obtained maximum 1 66 l day for tubular solar still with half cylindrical trough without clothing at last they concluded that the present tubular solar still is best suitable for small communities as well as houses with roof area arun kumar and kabeel arunkumar and kabeel 2017 used compound parabolic concentrator cpc concentric circular tubular solar

between the experimental and cfd simulation results also performed and found good agreement between them fig 10 shows the triangular and tubular solar still guo xie et al 2018 tested a laboratory model of an innovative solar desalination system contains multiple tubular solar still they carried out a series of tests to establish a relationship between the distillate output and chamber pressure of the system it is as shown in fig 11 they also carried out the performance analysis of the system by varying the vacuum pressure at last they calculated the economic analysis of the system and found that the system is best suitable for the remote and desert locations later guo xie et al 2016 carried out a theoretical and experimental analysis of tubular solar still with chamber vacuum conditions due to its theoretical analysis they suggested that the application of vacuum enhances the distillate output of tubular solar still they also compared with experimental results with theoretical results and received the excellent agreement from the theoretical analysis they proposed a new model and also tested experimentally and received 80 higher tested energy utilization efficiency as compared with the previous testing model fig 12 shows the schematic diagram of the tubular solar desalination system with application of vacuum elshamy and ei said elshamy and el said 2018 performed an experimental analysis of tubular solar still with the corrugated and flat absorber therefore they fabricated two tubular solar stills with corrugated and flat absorber and tested in climate conditions of egypt after a series of tests they found that the tubular solar still with corrugated absorber received 4 3 l distillate output and 26 43 enhancement as compared with the flat shaped

different designs used with tubular solar still arun kumar et al arunkumar et al 2016b fabricated a new compound parabolic concentric tubular solar still cpc ctss and tested in climate conditions of coimbatore india the main aim of the research work to see the effect of cooling air over the condensation surface on performance analysis of concentrated tubular solar still ctss as shown in fig 15 they carried out a series of experiments with a fixed mass flow rate of air 4 5 m s over the condensation surface of ctss they obtained 2020 ml distillate output and 18 9 thermal efficiency of solar still with constant flow rate of cold air at last they concluded that the constant flow rate of cold air increases the distillate output due to enhancement of evaporation and condensation of vapour in tubular solar still kabeel et al 2019 had analyzed the tubular solar still with help of glass cover cooling and water depth and tested at tanta university egypt glass cover cooling and water depth both are very important parameters of the solar still performed and also analyzed by many researchers mevada et al panchal et al 1007 shyora et al 1080 they concluded that the lower water depth and glass cover cooling increases the distillate output as well as thermal efficiency of tubular solar still fig 16 shows the experimental set up of tubular solar still mohamed elashmawy 2019 had performed the experiments on high performance tubular solar still with variations of glass cover cooling and tube thickness he carried out several experiments on the tubular solar still with variations of tube thickness to prepare efficient design he concluded that the proper tube dimensions of the tubular still are major parameter of efficient design he also concluded that the distillate output of tubular solar still reduced by 37 5 by reduction of tube thickness from 5 mm to 3 mm fig 17 shows the experimental set up of high performance tubular solar still tiantongyan yanguo et al 1016 had performed experiment on double effect tubular solar still with use of vacuum they also compared the single effect and double effect tubular solar still with vacuum they found that the distillate output of water increased in both the tubular solar still with use of vacuum they also concluded that the vacuum operation is good in case of double effect tubular solar still as compared with single effect tubular solar still fig 18 shows the experimental set up of tubular solar still with use of vacuum 4 scope of further research and recommendations tubular solar still is a new research area in the field of solar desalination there is a good scope of further research work the research work on sensible and latent heat storage materials still unattended by the researchers for tubular solar still use of cooling the glass cover has been investigated but the optimum amount of water is also unattended by researchers use of proper dimensioning is also a problem in case of tubular solar still nobody has studied the area optimization in case of tubular solar still 5 conclusions from the present review paper following points are concluded distillate output of tubular solar still is inversely proportional to the water depth phase change material in the tubular solar still increase the distillate output even at night time also use of fan inside the tubular solar still improved the performance and obtained 120 higher distillate output cfd analysis is one of the best solutions to assess the performance of tubular solar still polythene film is a good cover material for tubular solar still as compared with vinyle chloride tubular solar still with use of corrugated plate found higher performance as compared with flat configuration tubular solar still obtained higher distillate output as compared with triangular solar still thermal efficiency of tubular and triangular solar still found 41 and 35 respectively application of vacuum inside the tubular solar still increases the distillate output cold air flow over the tubular solar still can improve the distillate output and increases 18 9 thermal efficiency cooling of the tubular solar still improves the condensation and increase the distillate output

and shah 2014c panchal and shah 2015 sharshir et al 2016 omara et al 2013 coupled with solar still and received higher distillate output from the above works of literature it is evident that solar still is a sustainable solution to provide potable water researchers used work on passive and active solar still to improve distillate output but the very less research work done on tubular solar still hence the main aim of this review paper is to review various research works on tubular solar still done by multiple researchers 2 working principle of tubular solar still tubular solar still is consists of a transparent tubular cover and a black semicircular trough inside the tubular cover the sun energy after transmitting through a transparent tubular cover is principally absorbed by water in the channel consequently the water is heated up and evaporates the water vapour density of the humid air raises connected with the evaporation from the water surface and then the water vapour is condensed on the inner surface of the tubular cover releasing its latent heat of vaporization in the end the condensed water naturally trickles down toward the bottom of the tubular cover due to gravity and then is collected into a collector through a pipe equipped at the lower end of the tubular cover fig 1 shows the tubular solar still 3 various techniques to enhance the distillate output of tubular solar still salman hammadi et al ahsan et al 2011 designed fabricated and tested conventional tubular solar still tss and tested in climate conditions of iraq their main aim behind the experimental work was to investigate the effect of brine water depth on the performance of tubular solar still tss they found that the distillate output of tss increases with the decrease of water depth in tss they have also investigated the distillate output and received the highest production during july fig 2 shows the distillate output received by tss from february to july 2015 ishan khudur and rai khudhur and rai 2014 conducted experimental work on tubular solar still with the use of phase change material and tested in climate conditions of allahabad india they want to see the effect of the use of phase change material on distillate output of tubular solar still they received 20 enhancement of distillate output by use of phase change material in tubular solar still based on the experimental results they also derived correlation for water temperature and distillate output as shown in fig 3 later bhaskar and rai 2018 used a 4 w dc fan in the tubular solar still to examine the outcome on the thermal performance of the system they conducted experiments with and without the use of a fan and obtained 133 higher distillate output with the use of a fan in tubular solar still fig 4 shows the distillate output obtained by fan and absence of fan in tubular solar still distillate output of tubular solar still is lower hence it is a prime duty of a researcher to study the design of tubular solar still before the actual fabrication thus rahbar et al 2018 carried out the 2 d cfd simulation of tubular solar still to calculate the heat and mass transfer of tubular solar still they also carried out the experiments on tubular solar still and compared with the simulation results and obtained good agreement between the simulation and experimental results they also found that most of the condensation of vapour takes place at the outer glass cover of tubular solar still at last they proposed a new model to estimate the distillate output and heat and mass transfer relations fig 5 shows the comparison between the experimental and cfd simulation results of tubular solar still chen et al 2013 carried out an experimental analysis of three effect solar still and tested in the laboratory their main aim of the experimentation was to assess the performance of three effect solar still by varying the heating of water on distillate output for heating of water in the three effects tubular solar still three different heating phases of 100 200 300 and 400 w used for the research work they found that when the heating phase was increased from 100 w to 400 w then distillate output of tubular solar still increases fig 6 shows the relationship between the heating phase and the total distillate output of three effects tubular solar still ahsan and fukuhara 2010 conducted an experimental analysis of two tubular solar still models with vinyl chloride and polyethene film as cover material they experimented both models with the use of the solar simulator and observed that the polythene film as cover material as best covers material compared with vinyl chloride they also evaluated the performance of tubular solar still based on evaporation condensation and distillate output at last they carried out filed test analysis at different countries and obtained good agreement between the calculated results and field data results fig 7 shows the schematic diagram of

cpc ctsst as shown in fig 8 the cpc ctsst used to supply the hot water to solar still to increase the distillate output they determined that the distillate output of single basin solar still increased by application of cpc ctsst due to the enhancement of evaporative heat transfer coefficient they also used phase change material in single basin solar still and received an improvement in distillate output during night also fig shows the experiment setup of cpc ctsst mohamed elashmawy 2017 compared performance analysis of tubular solar still with the use of rectangular trough with clothing and half cylindrical trough without clothing they obtained maximum 1 66 l day for tubular solar still with half cylindrical trough without clothing at last they concluded that the present tubular solar still is best suitable for small communities as well as houses with roof area arun kumar and kabeel arunkumar and kabeel 2017 used compound parabolic concentrator cpc concentric circular tubular solar still cctss with phase change material pcm and tested in climate conditions of chennai india the pcm paraffin wax is packed in the uniquely designed portion in the tubular solar still they carried out experiments with and without the use of paraffin wax and received 5779 and 5330 ml water as distillate output fig 9 shows the distillate output of cpc cctss with and without the use of pcm rahbar et

enhances 20 more distillate output as compared with triangular solar still the experimental thermal efficiency of 41 and 35 obtained for tubular and triangular solar still at last the comparison between the experimental and cfd simulation results also performed and found good agreement between them fig 10 shows the triangular and tubular solar still guo xie et al 2018 tested a laboratory model of an innovative solar desalination system contains multiple tubular solar still they carried out a series of tests to establish a relationship between the distillate output and chamber pressure of the system it is as shown in fig 11 they also carried out the performance analysis of the system by varying the vacuum pressure at last they calculated the economic analysis of the system and found that the system is best suitable for the remote and desert locations later guo xie et al 2016 carried out a theoretical and experimental analysis of tubular solar still with chamber vacuum conditions due to its theoretical analysis they suggested that the application of vacuum enhances the distillate output of tubular solar still they also compared with experimental results with theoretical results and received the excellent agreement from the theoretical analysis they proposed a new model and also tested experimentally and received 80 higher tested energy utilization efficiency as compared with the previous testing model fig 12 shows the schematic diagram of the tubular solar desalination system with application of vacuum elshamy and ei said elshamy and el said 2018 performed an experimental analysis of tubular solar still with the corrugated and flat absorber therefore they fabricated two tubular solar stills with corrugated and flat absorber and tested in climate

still and pyramid type solar still and received 6460 and 7770 ml distillate output from the single basin and pyramid type solar still fig 14 shows the comparison of distillate output received by different designs used with tubular solar still arun kumar et al arunkumar et al 2016b fabricated a new compound parabolic concentric tubular solar still cpc ctss and tested in climate conditions of coimbatore india the main aim of the research work to see the effect of cooling air over the condensation surface on performance analysis of concentrated tubular solar still ctss as shown in fig 15 they carried out a series of experiments with a fixed mass flow rate of air 4 5 m s over the condensation surface of ctss they obtained 2020 ml distillate output and 18 9 thermal efficiency of solar still with constant flow rate of cold air at last they concluded that the constant flow rate of cold air increases the distillate output due to enhancement of evaporation and condensation of vapour in tubular solar still kabeel et al 2019 had analyzed the tubular solar still with help of glass cover cooling and water depth and tested at tanta university egypt glass cover cooling and water depth both are very important parameters of the solar still performed and also analyzed by many researchers mevada et al panchal et al 1007 shyora et al 1080 they concluded that the lower water depth and glass cover cooling increases the distillate output as well as thermal efficiency of tubular solar still fig 16 shows the experimental set up of tubular solar still mohamed elashmawy 2019 had performed the experiments on high performance tubular solar still with variations of glass cover cooling and tube thickness he carried out several experiments on the tubular solar still with variations of tube thickness to prepare efficient design he concluded that the proper tube dimensions of the tubular still are major parameter of efficient design he also concluded that the distillate output of tubular solar still reduced by 37 5 by reduction of tube thickness from 5 mm to 3 mm fig 17 shows the experimental set up of high performance tubular solar still tiantongyan yanguo et al 1016 had performed experiment on double effect tubular solar still with use of vacuum they also compared the single effect and double effect tubular solar still with vacuum they found that the distillate output of water increased in both the tubular solar still with use of vacuum they also concluded that the vacuum operation is good in case of double effect tubular solar still as compared with single effect tubular solar still fig 18 shows the experimental set up of tubular solar still with use of vacuum 4 scope of further research and recommendations tubular solar still is a new research area in the field of solar desalination there is a good scope of further research work the research work on sensible and latent heat storage materials still unattended by the researchers for tubular solar still use of cooling the glass cover has been investigated but the optimum amount of water is also unattended by researchers use of proper dimensioning is also a problem in case of tubular solar still nobody has studied the area optimization in case of tubular solar still 5 conclusions from the present review paper following points are concluded distillate output of tubular solar still is inversely proportional to the water depth phase change material in the tubular solar still increase the distillate output even at night time also use of fan inside the tubular solar

12254,the effect of climate change on future groundwater conditions in the toyserkan basin in western iran has been studied in recent years overexploitation for agricultural activities has led to water table decline groundwater recharge rate predictions in the study area were obtained from the rcp4 5 scenario of the 5th assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change and hadgem2 general circulation model outputs were downscaled with the regcm4 regional climate model coupled to the community land model version 4 5 clm 4 5 regcm4 model validation and prediction were attempted for 7 years 1999 2005 and 11 years 2015 2025 respectively validation results showed that regcm4 reasonably simulated daily precipitation and monthly temperature and runoff firstly geological geophysical and hydrogeological data were used and evaluated to develop the conceptual model secondly a 3d numerical model of groundwater flow was developed in order to describe the groundwater regime and predict the effects of water management strategies two scenarios were defined for the prediction period the first scenario assumes that current exploitation rates will be continued while the second one assumes a 20 percent decrease in pumping due to increased irrigation efficiency the results showed a water table rise from 2015 to 2025 which is heightened by increase in irrigation efficiency graphical abstract image 1 keywords regcm4 regional climate model groundwater recharge modflow gms 1 introduction general circulation models gcms are used in order to predict the climate during future periods and estimate the hydro climate balance at large spatial scales and seasonal to annual time scales because of their spatial resolution the topography and land cover are represented at coarse scale therefore the simulation of fine scale atmospheric circulation is restricted van roosmalen et al 2010 for agriculture and water resources management outputs of gcms must be downscaled statistical and dynamical approaches have been commonly used for downscaling gcm data von storch 1995 zorita and von storch 1999 with the availability of increased computational power the dynamic downscaling approach which improves the horizontal resolution to 1 km is preferable this approach involves solving dynamical atmospheric equations with different spatial and temporal schemes while including physics based land surface radiation cloud microphysics boundary layer and cumulus schemes although these models are the best tools for estimating regional climate changes systematic local errors are still evident zorita and von storch 1999 the regional climate model regcm is one of the most well known dynamic models which is applied in climate change studies fuentes franco et al

version 5 mm5 grell et al 1994 the regional climate model version 4 regcm4 is a hydrostatic compressible sigma p vertical coordinate model run on an arakawa b grid in which wind and thermodynamical variables are horizontally staggered this model involves new land surface planetary boundary layer and air sea flux schemes and a full upgrade of the model code towards improved flexibility and portability giorgi et al 2012 demonstrated a set of test experiments over 4 regions defined under the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex framework africa south america east

value is 2665 mm rivers such as the serkan karzan artiman and sarabi emanate from the southern slopes of alvand mountain and join to form the perennial toyserkan river which is the main stream of the area there is a hydrometry station on the toyserkan river at the outlet of the basin the specification of these stations are shown in table 1 based on 51 years of discharge data the average annual discharge rate is 1 37 m3 s anonymous 2009 2 1 1 geology the area is located within the sanandaj sirjan tectonic zone in the vicinity of the folded zagros zone on the southern slope of the alvand batholith intrusive rocks granite to granodiorite are mostly exposed in the northeast and northwest metamorphic hornfels adjoining the intrusive body is mostly exposed in the northeast the other metamorphic rocks including slate and schist mostly occur in the western highlands pre jurassic and cretaceous limestones are exposed in the southeastern part of the basin the limestones generally strike nw se and dip 30 50 limestones are mostly located subjacent to the schists and are permeable where jointed and fractured these limestones are likely discharging to quaternary alluvial sediments in the valleys of several streams towards the outlet of the basin the sediments consist mainly of granitic gravel sand and silt with a small percentage of clay granite hornfels schist and slate form the relatively impermeable bedrock underlying the alluvium 2 1 2 geoelectrical measurements vertical electrical soundings vess were conducted with the schlumberger configuration bhattacharya and patra 1968 keller and frischknecht 1966 zohdy et al 1974 in order to reveal the subsurface features especially in the central part of the area the maximum current electrode spacing was kept between 400 and 500 m the apparent resistivity data for different values of ab 2 were processed for 44 ves locations and 12 profiles were obtained resulting maps showed that the aquifer s thickness increases from 40 m in the northern part to 80 m in the central part of the basin fig 2 resistivity values for sandy horizons range between 25 and 200 ω m whereas for clayey layers it ranges from 15 to 25 ω m resistivity for rock formations varies from 150 to 400 ω m relatively low values are associated with friable and weathered rocks 2 1 3 hydrogeology the aquifer is primarily unconfined and groundwater recharge takes place from direct infiltration of rainfall and return irrigation water the direction of groundwater flow in the study area is affected by geologic structure but primarily follows the topography from northeast to southwest in the basin there are 430 deep and 1349 semi deep with a maximum depth of 30 m boreholes discharging 64 mcm million cubic metres of groundwater annually in order to cover the irrigation demands kamali 2013 pumping tests were used to calculate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer applying theis and jacob methods transmissivity t values range from 400

during recent years a significant drawdown has occurred in the aquifer associated with the groundwater extraction for irrigation use and the precipitation decrease based on groundwater measurements the static water level fell about 11 m during the period 2001 2013 which equates to an average decline of 0 92 m yr and an annual volumetric loss is estimated to be 2 v d l s y a 0 92 m 0 06 150 k m 2

sres the new scenarios are named representative concentration pathways rcps and include rcp8 5 rcp6 rcp4 5 and rcp2 6 in the present study the rcp4 5 climate change scenario for climatic projections was applied related data were downloaded for the 2014 2025 period 2 3 regcm in this study outputs of the hadley centre global environmental model version 2 hadgem2 were used with regcm4 boundary condition files with a time step of 3 h were created from the gcm history files and a lambert conformal map projection which is suitable for mid latitudes was chosen the model was run over an area with a central point located at 48 16 51 e and 34 29 43 n the model grid includes 10 points with a 10 km horizontal resolution the computational time step of regcm4 for the 10 km simulations is 30 s a small time step is required to ensure numerical stability of the model the atmospheric model communicates with the land surface model every 600 modeled seconds the exponential relaxation process presented by giorgi et al 1993 was utilized to offer the model with lateral boundary conditions mit emanuel 1991 and clm4 5 oleson et al 2013 schemes were used as convective and land surface schemes respectively monthly sea surface temperature sst data of the hadgem2 model and a usgs global digital elevation model dem with a horizontal grid spacing of 30 arc seconds gtopo30 were also used the community land model clm is a land model within the community earth system model cesm officially called the community climate system model ccsm oleson et al 2010 it was constructed for combining with

less than 0 indicating a negative association 2 4 aquifer model the available hydrogeological data including geoelectrical measurements lithological data water level measurements and pumping test data were used to understand the geometry and the boundaries of the aquifer to estimate the recharge of the aquifer and losses from the aquifer to calculate the variability of transmissivity t and storativity s in the study area and provide information about interconnection between surface water and groundwater a gis approach is used in order to handle all data required for the construction of the model to obtain information for the model to observe model results and to perform post processing for model outputs groundwater modeling system gms version 10 0 5 was used general head boundaries ghbs were used to simulate the hydrogeological regime in the northern northwestern northeastern and southeastern limits as inflow boundaries and the southwestern limit as an outflow boundary no flow boundaries were set as limits of the rest of the studied region the effect of the river was not considered because river flow was negligible and groundwater level depth was more than 30 m along the river the model grid was divided into 500 500 m cells in total the model includes 64 columns and 46 rows the model grid contains only active and inactive cells because there is no lake or other constant head boundaries to assign initial hydraulic heads for the steady state conditions a map showing water levels in october 2008 was used the calibration was implemented both under steady state and transient state conditions steady state calibration was performed in order to determine hydraulic conductivity values by comparing observed and calculated heads through both a trial error method and automatic calibration using pest parameter estimation tool the steady state model was calibrated for the year 2008 whereas the transient state was calibrated for the period 2008 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 regcm4 clm4 5 model validation and prediction the results of the applied model are shown in table 2 the model shows its best performance for simulated temperature at all time scales because of positive correlations and low errors the model performance is also appropriate for simulating daily precipitation for all stations and monthly precipitation for the first three ones the errors can be due to uncertainties in gcm outputs notwithstanding these uncertainties the model simulations at the monthly time scale are acceptable monthly runoff simulations also show positive efficiency high correlation and relatively small errors the regcm clm model was run under the rcp4 5 scenario for the 2016 2025 period highest values of precipitation occur in the months of april and may because of available moisture increase evapotranspiration and runoff also have their highest values mostly in these two months temperature does not show any perceptible change apart from a small increasing trend monthly average values of water budget components for the 10 year prediction period are shown in fig 3 in april may october and november the average precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration runoff and groundwater recharge are positive in may and june maximum values of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff occur in may and maximum recharge occurs in june when evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation runoff is zero and negative values of recharge rate capillary rise from aquifer to unsaturated zone occur fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of annual average precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff over the basin highest values of precipitation occur in the eastern and central parts while lowest values occur in the southwestern part of the area the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration is similar to precipitation the highest values of runoff occur in the eastern part and the highest values of recharge occur in the northeast which mostly consists of fractured hard granites the lowest values of recharge negative recharge occur in the central part where flat alluvium allows more capillary rise and evaporation 3 2 aquifer model calibration and sensitivity analysis steady state calibration was carried out for water levels in the toyserkan aquifer measured in october 2008 when the water table was expected to be at the lowest point based on data from meteorological and hydrometry stations no precipitation occurred and river discharge was zero during this month during the steady state calibration horizontal hydraulic conductivity values were adjusted to achieve a good fit to the observed piezometry the rmse value of 0 02 m shows the good accordance between calculated and observed water levels fig 5 the hydraulic conductivity tends to increase in the southern part of the area and decrease in the northern part where hard rock formations occur the calibrated steady state model was used as a basis for the development of the transient model first the final hydraulic heads for the steady state model were selected as the initial heads for the transient model stress period october 2008 the model was run for 12 monthly stress periods the transient model calibration was also optimized using pest and then by trial and error adjustment of the specific yield sy until the modeled values reproduced water level fluctuations observed in wells fig 5 illustrates comparison for a selected borehole b 13 in the transient state simulation values of specific yield sy range from 0 02 to 0 25 in the study area the values of hydraulic conductivity did not change from those calibrated from steady state conditions natural recharge rates were varied in the transient model to reflect seasonal variability high in wet period and low in dry period in general the model reasonably reproduces annual water level fluctuations in most of the boreholes in the area for sensitivity analysis the calibrated values of hydraulic conductivity specific yield and recharge were increased and decreased by 10 20 and 30 percent separately the model was run for 18 cases and then simulated and observed water levels were compared the results are presented in table 3 the model is most sensitive to specific yield and then hydraulic conductivity recharge is the least important factor the model also shows more sensitivity to decrease of specific yield and hydraulic conductivity compared to their increase while it has similar responses to increase and decrease of recharge the model verification was conducted for 6 monthly stress periods from october 2009 to march 2010 relations between modeled and observed values of the water table for each stress period are shown in fig 6 high correlation between computed and observed values provides confidence in the model s ability to predict the future conditions of the aquifer system 3 3 aquifer model prediction the modflow model was used for the prediction of the aquifer response under recharge conditions obtained from the regcm clm model for this study two major scenarios were considered the first one assumes that current groundwater exploitation rates will be continued while the second one assumes a 20 percent decrease in exploitation rates of agricultural wells due to increased irrigation efficiency in the study area 12 percent 3311 47 ha of irrigated lands are equipped with pressurized irrigation systems and almost all of them use groundwater kamali and taheri tizro 2013 evaluated irrigation efficiency in the toyserkan basin using data on cropping patterns irrigation systems and groundwater exploitation they concluded that if surface irrigation systems are replaced with pressurized sprinkler and drip irrigation systems in the toyserkan basin the exploitation rates of agricultural wells will decrease by 20 percent at the end of the prediction period there is a mean water level rise of 0 63 m for the first scenario and 1 25 m for the second scenario fig 7 fig 8 shows 10 year water level variation maps october 2015 to october 2025 for the first scenario the water level has declined in the eastern central and southwestern parts negative values while for the second scenario the water level has risen in most parts of the aquifer except for small areas in the eastern and central parts 4 conclusions the regcm clm model was run under the rcp4 5 scenario of ipcc ar5 for a reference period 1999 2005 for model validation and a prediction period 2016 2025 model validation results showed that the model best simulates precipitation at a daily time scale and temperature and runoff at a monthly time scale it also has an acceptable performance in simulating monthly precipitation in this study the short period of model validation could have been a source of error in model simulation verification showed that the model is reliable to predict the aquifer behavior for different pumping scenarios results indicated that the water table generally will rise in the next 10 years and irrigation efficiency increase will cause a greater rise because of a lack of direct measurements of recharge rate it is impossible to validate the modeled recharge but the clm model considers real hydrologic processes and can realistically simulate recharge this method thus can produce acceptable predictions for future planning and water management

12254,the effect of climate change on future groundwater conditions in the toyserkan basin in western iran has been studied in recent years overexploitation for agricultural activities has led to water table decline groundwater recharge rate predictions in the study area were obtained from the rcp4 5 scenario of the 5th assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change and hadgem2 general circulation model outputs were downscaled with the regcm4 regional climate model coupled to the community land model version 4 5 clm 4 5 regcm4 model validation and prediction were attempted for 7 years 1999 2005 and 11 years 2015 2025 respectively validation results showed that regcm4 reasonably simulated daily precipitation and monthly temperature and runoff firstly geological geophysical and hydrogeological data were used and evaluated to develop the conceptual model secondly a 3d numerical model of groundwater flow was developed in order to describe the groundwater regime and predict the effects of water management strategies two scenarios were defined for the prediction period the first scenario assumes that current exploitation rates will be continued while the second one assumes a 20 percent decrease in pumping due to increased irrigation efficiency the results showed a water table rise from 2015 to 2025 which is heightened by increase in irrigation efficiency graphical abstract image 1 keywords regcm4 regional climate model groundwater recharge modflow gms 1 introduction general circulation models gcms are used in order to predict the climate during future periods and estimate the hydro climate balance at large spatial scales and seasonal to annual time scales because of their spatial resolution the topography and land cover are represented at coarse scale therefore the simulation of fine scale atmospheric circulation is restricted van roosmalen et al 2010 for agriculture and water resources management outputs of gcms must be downscaled statistical and dynamical approaches have been commonly used for downscaling gcm data von storch 1995 zorita and von storch 1999 with the availability of increased computational power the dynamic downscaling approach which improves the horizontal resolution to 1 km is preferable this approach involves solving dynamical atmospheric equations with different spatial and temporal schemes while including physics based land surface radiation cloud microphysics boundary layer and cumulus schemes although these models are the best tools for estimating regional climate changes systematic local errors are still evident zorita and von storch 1999 the regional climate model regcm is one of the most well known dynamic models which is applied in climate change studies fuentes franco et al 2014 giorgi et al 2004 2012 oh et al 2014 wang et al 2015 xue jie et al 2013 yu et al 2014 venetsanou et al 2016 2018 the regcm dynamic core is close to the hydrostatic version of mesoscale model version 5 mm5 grell et al 1994 the regional climate model version 4 regcm4 is a hydrostatic compressible sigma p vertical coordinate model run on an arakawa b grid in which wind and thermodynamical variables are horizontally staggered this model involves new land surface planetary boundary layer and air sea flux schemes and a full upgrade of the model code towards improved flexibility and portability giorgi et al 2012 demonstrated a set of test experiments over 4 regions defined under the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex framework africa south america east asia and europe to show illustrative examples of the model behavior and sensitivities under different climatic conditions overall regcm4 showed improved performance in several respects compared to previous versions oh et al 2014 used regcm4 to investigate spatial and temporal changes in precipitation over the cordex east asia domain for present 1986 2005 and future 2031 2050 periods meteorological boundary conditions for regcm4 were generated by the hadley centre global environmental model version 2 with the atmosphere ocean coupling hadgem2 ao following representative

research unit cru data its ability to simulate temporal fluctuation varied based on geographical areas and seasons groundwater flow models are used to predict the behavior of the aquifer including hydraulic heads and fluxes to natural or artificial stresses kresic 2006 one of the most widely used software packages for groundwater modeling is modflow harbaugh et al 2000 a modular finite difference code distributed by the us geological survey in modflow an aquifer system is simulated by a discretised domain consisting of an array of nodes and associated finite difference blocks cells the model solves the following equation derived from darcy s law and the law of conservation of mass for each cell 1 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z w s s h t where k xx k yy and k zz are the values of hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z coordinate axes h is hydraulic head w is the volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources w 0 and or sinks w 0 of water s s is specific storage and t is time taheri tizro et al 2011 used modflow to predict the aquifer system response to artificial recharge in the bahar aquifer in western iran they found that at the end of the recharge period in normal conditions 2 7 mcm of water recharged there was an average water level rise of 1 17 m in the study area the main purpose of this study is to predict the future conditions of the aquifer system for scenarios of climate change and improved irrigation efficiency the results of the study can be useful for cropping pattern and groundwater exploitation planning in the area considering climatic conditions and their effect on water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the toyserkan basin is located in the southwestern part of the hamadan region western iran at 48 5 48 35 e longitude and 34 22 34 42 n latitude fig 1 covering an area of 805 km2 it is bounded by the alvand mountains to the north by alousiah and kamarzard mountains to the south by khangarmaz and goodin mountains to the west and by great shahneshin dareghar and cheshmedareh mountains to the east the highest elevation is alvand mountain at 3580 m above mean sea level a m s l fig 1 the elevation of the lowest point in the southwest is 1512 m the mean annual absolute temperature in the area ranges between 25 c january and 41 c july the study area has a semiarid climate the mean annual rainfall is 430 mm data recorded for the period 1994 2011 and most of the precipitation falls between november and april annual pan evaporation ranges from 2280 mm to 3500 mm the mean value is 2665 mm rivers such as the serkan karzan artiman and sarabi emanate from the southern slopes of alvand mountain and join to form the perennial toyserkan river which is the main stream of the area there is a hydrometry station on the toyserkan river at the outlet of the basin the specification of these stations are shown in table 1 based on 51 years of discharge data the average annual discharge rate is 1 37 m3 s anonymous 2009 2 1 1 geology the area is located within the sanandaj sirjan tectonic zone in the vicinity of the folded zagros zone on the southern slope of the alvand batholith intrusive rocks granite to granodiorite are mostly exposed in the northeast and northwest metamorphic hornfels adjoining the intrusive body is mostly exposed in the northeast the other metamorphic rocks including slate and schist mostly occur in the western highlands pre jurassic and cretaceous limestones are exposed in the southeastern part of the basin the limestones generally strike nw se and dip 30 50 limestones are mostly located subjacent to the schists and are permeable where jointed and fractured these limestones are likely discharging to quaternary alluvial sediments in the valleys of several streams towards the outlet of the basin the sediments consist mainly of granitic gravel sand and silt with a small percentage of clay granite hornfels schist and slate form the relatively impermeable bedrock underlying the alluvium 2 1 2 geoelectrical measurements vertical electrical soundings vess were conducted with the schlumberger configuration bhattacharya and patra 1968 keller and frischknecht 1966 zohdy et al 1974 in order to reveal the subsurface features especially in the central part of the area the maximum current electrode spacing was kept between 400 and 500 m the apparent resistivity data for different values of ab 2 were processed for 44 ves locations and 12 profiles were obtained resulting maps showed that the aquifer s thickness increases from 40 m in the northern part to 80 m in the central part of the basin fig 2 resistivity values for sandy horizons range between 25 and 200 ω m whereas for clayey layers it ranges from 15 to 25 ω m resistivity for rock formations varies from 150 to 400 ω m relatively low values are associated with friable and weathered rocks 2 1 3 hydrogeology the aquifer is primarily unconfined and groundwater recharge takes place from direct infiltration of rainfall and return irrigation water the direction of groundwater flow in the study area is affected by geologic structure but primarily follows the topography from northeast to southwest in the basin there are 430 deep and 1349 semi deep with a maximum depth of 30 m boreholes discharging 64 mcm million cubic metres of groundwater annually in order to cover the irrigation demands kamali 2013 pumping tests were used to calculate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer applying theis and jacob methods transmissivity t values range from 400 to 1000 m2 day in the periphery and up to 2000 m2 day in the central part of the aquifer values of hydraulic conductivity k range between 6 and 60 m day and the mean value of storativity s is 0 06 6 during recent years a significant drawdown has occurred in the aquifer associated with the groundwater extraction for irrigation use and the precipitation decrease based on groundwater measurements the static water level fell about 11 m during the period 2001 2013 which equates to an average decline of 0 92 m yr and an annual volumetric loss is estimated to be 2 v d l s y a 0 92 m 0 06 150 k m 2

sres the new scenarios are named representative concentration pathways rcps and include rcp8 5 rcp6 rcp4 5 and rcp2 6 in the present study the rcp4 5 climate change scenario for climatic projections was applied related data were downloaded for the 2014 2025 period 2 3 regcm in this study outputs of the hadley centre global environmental model version 2 hadgem2 were used with regcm4 boundary condition files with a time step of 3 h were created from the gcm history files and a lambert conformal map projection which is suitable for mid latitudes was chosen the model was run over an area with a central point located at 48 16 51 e and 34 29 43 n the model grid includes 10 points with a 10 km horizontal resolution the computational time step of regcm4 for the 10 km simulations is 30 s a small time step is required to ensure numerical stability of the model the atmospheric model communicates with the land surface model every 600 modeled seconds the exponential relaxation process presented by giorgi et al 1993 was utilized to offer the model with lateral boundary conditions mit emanuel 1991 and clm4 5 oleson et al 2013 schemes were used as convective and land surface schemes respectively monthly sea surface temperature sst data of the hadgem2 model and a usgs global digital elevation model dem with a horizontal grid spacing of 30 arc seconds gtopo30 were also used the community land model clm is a land model within the community earth system model cesm officially called the community climate system model ccsm oleson et al 2010 it was constructed for combining with atmospheric models such as the community atmosphere model cam in order to assess the surface albedo upward longwave radiation sensible heat flux latent heat flux water vapor flux and surface co2 exchanges required by atmospheric models oleson et al 2010 clm4 5 was released along with cesm version 1 2 cesm1 2 oleson et al 2013 spatial land surface heterogeneity in clm is depicted as a nested sub grid hierarchy in which grid cells are consisted of multiple land units snow soil columns and plant functional types pfts each grid cell can have a different number of land units each land unit can have a different number of columns and each column can have multiple pfts the purpose of land unit is to capture the broadest spatial patterns of sub grid heterogeneity the land units are glacier

simulation the correlation coefficient varies between 1 and 1 with a value of 0 indicating no association between the two variables a value greater than 0 indicating a positive association and a value less than 0 indicating a negative association 2 4 aquifer model the available hydrogeological data including geoelectrical measurements lithological data water level measurements and pumping test data were used to understand the geometry and the boundaries of the aquifer to estimate the recharge of the aquifer and losses from the aquifer to calculate the variability of transmissivity t and storativity s in the study area and provide information about interconnection between surface water and groundwater a gis approach is used in order to handle all data required for the construction of the model to obtain information for the model to observe model results and to perform post processing for model outputs groundwater modeling system gms version 10 0 5 was used general head boundaries ghbs were used to simulate the hydrogeological regime in the northern northwestern northeastern and southeastern limits as inflow boundaries and the southwestern limit as an outflow boundary no flow boundaries were set as limits of the rest of the studied region the effect of the river was not considered because river flow was negligible and groundwater level depth was more than 30 m along the river the model grid was divided into 500 500 m cells in total the model includes 64 columns and 46 rows the model grid contains only active and inactive cells because there is no lake or other constant head boundaries to assign initial hydraulic heads for the steady state conditions a map showing water levels in october 2008 was used the calibration was implemented both under steady state and transient state conditions steady state calibration was performed in order to determine hydraulic conductivity values by comparing observed and calculated heads through both a trial error method and automatic calibration using pest parameter estimation tool the steady state model was calibrated for the year 2008 whereas the transient state was calibrated for the period 2008 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 regcm4 clm4 5 model validation and prediction the results of the applied model are shown in table 2 the model shows its best performance for simulated temperature at all time scales because of positive correlations and low errors the model performance is also appropriate for simulating daily precipitation for all stations and monthly precipitation for the first three ones the errors can be due to uncertainties in gcm outputs notwithstanding these uncertainties the model simulations at the monthly time scale are acceptable monthly runoff simulations also show positive efficiency high correlation and relatively small errors the regcm clm model was run under the rcp4 5 scenario for the 2016 2025 period highest values of precipitation occur in the months of april and may because of available moisture increase evapotranspiration and runoff also have their highest values mostly in these two months temperature does not show any perceptible change apart from a small increasing trend monthly average values of water budget components for the 10 year prediction period are shown in fig 3 in april may october and november the average precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration runoff and groundwater recharge are positive in may and june maximum values of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff occur in may and maximum recharge occurs in june when evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation runoff is zero and negative values of recharge rate capillary rise from aquifer to unsaturated zone occur fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of annual average precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff over the basin highest values of precipitation occur in the eastern and central parts while lowest values occur in the southwestern part of the area the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration is similar to precipitation the highest values of runoff occur in the eastern part and the highest values of recharge occur in the northeast which mostly consists of fractured hard granites the lowest values of recharge negative recharge occur in the central part where flat alluvium allows more capillary rise and evaporation 3 2 aquifer model calibration and sensitivity analysis steady state calibration was carried out for water levels in the toyserkan aquifer measured in october 2008 when the water table was expected to be at the lowest point based on data from meteorological and hydrometry stations no precipitation occurred and river discharge was zero during this month during the steady state calibration horizontal hydraulic conductivity values were adjusted to achieve a good fit to the observed piezometry the rmse value of 0 02 m shows the good accordance between calculated and observed water levels fig 5 the hydraulic conductivity tends to increase in the southern part of the area and decrease in the northern part where hard rock formations occur the calibrated steady state model was used as a basis for the development of the transient model first the final hydraulic heads for the steady state model were selected as the initial heads for the transient model stress period october 2008 the model was run for 12 monthly stress periods the transient model calibration was also optimized using pest and then by trial and error adjustment of the specific yield sy until the modeled values reproduced water level fluctuations observed in wells fig 5 illustrates comparison for a selected borehole b 13 in the transient state simulation values of specific yield sy range from 0 02 to 0 25 in the study area the values of hydraulic conductivity did not change from those calibrated from steady state conditions natural recharge rates were varied in the transient model to reflect seasonal variability high in wet period and low in dry period in general the model reasonably reproduces annual water level fluctuations in most of the boreholes in the area for sensitivity analysis the calibrated values of hydraulic conductivity specific yield and recharge were increased and decreased by 10 20 and 30 percent separately the model was run for 18 cases and then simulated and observed water levels were compared the results are presented in table 3 the model is most sensitive to specific yield and then hydraulic conductivity recharge is the least important factor the model also shows more sensitivity to decrease of specific yield and hydraulic conductivity compared to their increase while it has similar responses to increase and decrease of recharge the model verification was conducted for 6 monthly stress periods from october 2009 to march 2010 relations between modeled and observed values of the water table for each stress period are shown in fig 6 high correlation between computed and observed values provides confidence in the model s ability to predict the future conditions of the aquifer system 3 3 aquifer model prediction the modflow model was used for the prediction of the aquifer response under recharge conditions obtained from the regcm clm model for this study two major scenarios were considered the first one assumes that current groundwater exploitation rates will be continued while the second one assumes a 20 percent decrease in exploitation rates of agricultural wells due to increased irrigation efficiency in the study area 12 percent 3311 47 ha of irrigated lands are equipped with pressurized irrigation systems and almost all of them use groundwater kamali and taheri tizro 2013 evaluated irrigation efficiency in the toyserkan basin using data on cropping patterns irrigation systems and groundwater exploitation they concluded that if surface irrigation systems are replaced with pressurized sprinkler and drip irrigation systems in the toyserkan basin the exploitation rates of agricultural wells will decrease by 20 percent at the end of the prediction period there is a mean water level rise of 0 63 m for the first scenario and 1 25 m for the second scenario fig 7 fig 8 shows 10 year water level variation maps october 2015 to october 2025 for the first scenario the water level has declined in the eastern central and southwestern parts negative values while for the second scenario the water level has risen in most parts of the aquifer except for small areas in the eastern and central parts 4 conclusions the regcm clm model was run under the rcp4 5 scenario of ipcc ar5 for a reference period 1999 2005 for model validation and a prediction period 2016 2025 model validation results showed that the model best simulates precipitation at a
