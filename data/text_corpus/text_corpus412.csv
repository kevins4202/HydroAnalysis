2060,global climate change and local human activities have profoundly affected the regional hydrological cycle and water resources it is imperative to explore the potential changes in future water resources and water related hazards at the regional scale under global warming and local socioeconomic development while a scientific assessment of future hydrological risks requires reasonable projection of future climate land use and vegetation changes in order to improve the traditional statistical downscaling method this study combines the machine learning and quantile mapping methods to project future climate under four shared socio economic pathway representative concentration pathways ssp rcp of the cmip6 future land use is projected jointly with the future climate by the ca markov model and the vegetation dynamics are simulated by the biome bgc model then we employ a physically based distributed hydrological model to simulate the future hydrological changes in the upper chao phraya basin under the interaction among climate and land use changes and the vegetation dynamics the results show that under the joint impact of climate and land use changes the study area may face increasing water scarcity and more frequent floods and droughts in the future water scarcity will reach the worst in the mid 21st century water resources per capita decrease 34 2 compared to the 2010 s by the end 21st century the 100 year historical flood and drought in the study basin will increase by 1 63 times and 0 59 times respectively under the ssp126 scenario the most sustainable pathway and by 4 55 times and 1 56 times under the ssp370 scenario the most pessimistic rocky road pathway results demonstrate that climate change is the major cause for more frequent floods and droughts in the future while afforestation or more sustainable land use management will mitigate the adverse effects of climate change to some extent this finding is helpful to the local government in managing future water resources floods and droughts in the study basin keywords climate change land use change vegetation dynamics flood and drought cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change has a wide impact on the hydrological cycle across many regions worldwide basheer et al 2016 schewe et al 2014 yang 2021 which may cause more water shortage greve 2018 and higher risk of the water related disasters tanoue et al 2021 yuan 2019 however due to the large regional differences in climate change ipcc 2021 awareness of changes in regional water resources and water related disasters under future climate change scenarios is still limited especially in underdeveloped countries and regions hase et al 2021 schmidt et al 2013 therefore studies on the climate change impact on regional water resources floods and droughts are of great significance for mitigating the climate change impact and achieving the sustainable development goals anghileri et al 2011 kang et al 2019 wang 2013 past efforts to explore the change in future water related hazards mainly including water resource scarcity floods and droughts were mainly by the hydrological modeling forced by the future climate projected from the general circulation models gcms at a variety of spatial scales ranging from the globe alfieri 2017 arnell and gosling 2014 dankers 2014 do et al 2018 hirabayashi 2013 liu 2021 winsemius 2015 to regions bates 2021 ma 2021 rottler et al 2021 roudier 2015 wang et al 2022 however due to systematic bias and coarse spatial resolution there is a gap between the gcms output and the inputs of regional hydrological models where numerous statistical downscaling methods including bias correction and spatial downscaling have been developed chen et al 2013 guo et al 2020 mamalakis et al 2017 among these methods the widely used quantile mapping qm methods can effectively reduce the biases in marginal distribution cannon et al 2015 guti√©rrez 2019 and perform better than other methods chen et al 2013 guo et al 2020 however qm based statistical downscaling methods usually is carried out at the temporal scale of a month which ignores the correlation between raw gcm outputs and observations at the daily time scale zhao 2017 this may lead to the failure of bias correction and watershed hydrological simulations preserving the correlation information between predictors and targets during the training period recurrent neural networks rnns perform well in the long term prediction of nonlinear time series yang et al 2019a and are widely used in hydrological studies adi et al 2017 chung et al 2016 feng et al 2020 yang et al 2019a zhang 2018 combining qm and rnns can potentially be an effective method for accurate bias correction in statistical downscaling by considering land use and climate change impacts on watershed hydrology some studies illustrated the impact of specially designed land use scenarios such as rapid urbanization deforestation and afforestation on streamflow regimes in the context of global warming aich 2016 chacuttrikul et al 2018 pervez and henebry 2015 wang et al 2008 yang et al 2019b nevertheless the previous studies rarely considered the interaction of climate land use and vegetation in the hydrological simulations under future scenarios in these studies regional climate change and land use change were often described individually rather than jointly in a unified future scenario which ignores the interaction between the climate and land use under the shared socio economic development and greenhouse gas emission pathway therefore the future land use change should be projected jointly with the future climate change under the most recent ssp rcp scenarios of the cmip6 further land use is an important factor affecting vegetation but few studies consider the vegetation dynamics such as the change of lai under the future land use scenarios in the watershed hydrological simulation with the recent release of the luh2 dataset hurtt 2020b which is a part of cmip6 and serves as the input of the gcms it is possible to project the future climate and land use scenarios jointly at the regional scale for improving the future hydrological projection under different climate and land use scenarios here we propose a new framework to simulate the mutual interaction of climate land use vegetation and hydrology the chao phraya river basin is the largest river basin in thailand which is undergoing land use change and suffering the climate change impact the basin locates in a typical tropical monsoon region and is highly sensitive to hydrological extremes previous studies report that extreme floods will be amplified more than twice in frequency in the next 3 5 decades under future climate change and socio economic development alfieri 2017 alfieri et al 2015 jongman 2014 vitousek 2017 ipcc 2021 reports that the change in future drought may be less than the change in floods in thailand therefore the chao phraya river basin is chosen as the study area in this study we mainly try to solve the problem of insufficient consideration of the coupling of climate land use and vegetation changes in hydrological prediction under future scenarios therefore we develop a statistical downscaling method that combines quantile mapping qm and a recurrent neural network rnn for bias correction and spatial downscaling of the gcm outputs mainly for precipitation and project the land use maps with high spatial resolution under the future ssp rcp scenarios using the ca markov model based on the luh2 dataset we also simulate the vegetation dynamics mainly change in the leaf area index using the biome bgc model under the future climate and land use scenarios then we employ a physically based distributed hydrological model namely gbhm to simulate the future changes in the hydrological cycle in the study basin this study aims to 1 project the future changes in climate and land use jointly under the combined scenarios of socio economic developments and greenhouse gas emissions 2 analyze the risk of future flood drought and water resources scarcity 3 quantify the respective impact of climate change and land use change on regional hydrology 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the upper chao phraya river basin ucprb located in northern thailand has a drainage area of 110 569 km2 and consists of four sub basins ping wang yom and nan rivers covering 15 provinces the extent and geomorphic features are shown in fig 1 with northern mountains mainly covered by forests and the central plain mainly covered by crops the ucprb has significant spatial heterogeneities of topography land use types and meteorology and belongs to a tropical monsoon pattern with a mean annual precipitation of approximately 1 200 mm with 85 of the total annual rainfall occurring between may and november i e the wet season the temporal and spatial distributions of rainfall are highly heterogeneous ponpang nga and techamahasaranont 2016 which brings great difficulties to statistical downscaling in this study the outlet gauge of the ucprb referred to as c2 and four mountain exit gauges of the main tributaries i e p12 station at ping river w4 station at wang river y14 station at yom river and n9 station at nan river were selected to evaluate the changes in future water related hazards 2 2 data 1 historical observation data the observation data used in this study mainly consist of meteorological data land use data daily streamflow observations at the four stations and other basic geographic information required by the gbhm the gauged meteorological observations were provided by the royal irrigation department of thailand and included daily mean maximum and minimum temperature precipitation relative humidity wind speed and sunshine duration at 96 rainfall gauges and 14 meteorological gauges these gauged data were spatially interpolated into gridded data with a spatial resolution of 2 5 km 2 5 km by an angular distance weighting method with elevation corrections yang 2004 three historical land use maps for 2006 2011 and 2014 at a 100 m 100 m spatial resolution were provided by the department of land development of thailand and land use was classified into eight types i e water bodies urban areas bare soil forests

150 000 soil profiles and remote sensing based soil covariates srtm dem derivatives modis land products global land use map in 2011 climatic images and global landform and lithology maps the soil properties including soil organic matter bulk density and the proportion of clay silt sand and gravel were used in this study for hydrological simulation and future soil organic matter projection 2 climate outputs of gcms and land use projections from luh2 considering the data accessibility for downloading we selected five newly released gcm outputs under four ssp rcp scenarios ssp1 rcp2 6 is referred to as ssp126 ssp2 rcp4 5 is referred to as ssp245 ssp3 rcp7 0 is referred to as ssp370 and ssp5 rcp8 5 is referred to as ssp585 from the latest cmip6 these five gcms i e access esm1 5 gfdl esm4 miroc6 mpi esm1 2 lr and mri esm2 0 have been applied in southeastern asia for future climate change assessments in previous studies hunukumbura and tachikawa 2012 okwala et al 2020 panjwani et al 2019 plangoen and udmale 2017 preethi et al 2017 singhrattna and singh babel 2011 and detailed information is shown in table 1 the climate model outputs including the daily near surface mean maximum and minimum air temperature daily precipitation daily near surface relative humidity and daily near surface wind speed were downloaded for both the historical period 1985 2014 and future period 2015 2100 the newly developed ssp rcp scenarios are rooted in socioeconomic trajectories i e ssps which can be harmoniously combined with previously developed rcps in cmip5 through shared policy assumptions and present more reasonable future scenarios ncc 2019 ssps represent the potential futures of green fueled growth for ssp1 a middle of the road scenario for ssp2 high inequality between countries for ssp3 and fossil fueled growth for ssp5 gidden 2019 serving as the basic scenarios for climate model projections the four ssp rcp scenarios selected in this study belong to the tier 1 scenarios of cmip6 and span a full range of forcing targets following that of the rcps in cmip5 gidden 2019 o neill 2016 the scenario based future land use data were obtained from the luh2 dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 25‚Å∞ 0 25‚Å∞ and mainly include the annual land use states and transitions between land use states for the future period 2015 2100 under the four ssp rcp scenarios consistent with the climate outputs of gcms the land use states in luh2 contain twelve types and are reclassified into cropland grassland forest and urban area detailed information on luh2 can be found in the study by hurtt 2020a 3 methods this section introduces a statistical downscaling framework combining quantile mapping and machine learning a ca markov based algorithm for simulating the future land use maps with high spatial resolution under the ssp rcp scenarios simplified as ssp scenarios and the biome bgc model for simulating vegetation dynamics using the downscaled climate forcing land use and vegetation leaf area index lai gbhm is used to simulate the hydrological processes based on the hydrological simulation results the frequency of flood and drought is analyzed using a copula based method fig 2 shows the overall framework of the methodology in this study the future changes in water resources flood and drought are compared with the historical 30 year data from 1985 to 2014 used in the previous study alfieri et al 2015 three future time slices span from 2026 to 2055 with the median year of 2040 the period of 2046 2075 with the median year of 2060 and the period of 2071 2100 with the median year of 2085 3 1 statistical downscaling for climate outputs of gcms this study proposed a statistical downscaling framework combining quantile mapping qm a genetic algorithm based nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous input ga narx and triple gamma distribution mapping tgdm and mainly applied this complicated method to precipitation downscaling since precipitation serves as the primary factor affecting the basin hydrological process and its variability plays a critical role in complicated hydrological regime forming houston 2006 moulin et al 2009 saifullah et al 2016 yang et al 2019b considering the high computational cost of the newly proposed framework and less complexity than precipitation the climate variables except precipitation were bias corrected and spatially downscaled by qm in the historical period and by detrended quantile mapping dqm in the future period the statistical downscaling process mainly consists of three steps 1 the first step is the initial bias correction and spatial downscaling by qm piani et al 2009 for the historical period and dqm cannon et al 2015 for the future period and this step is applied to all climate variables the cumulative distribution functions cdfs in qm and dqm are constructed based on all days in a certain month m 2 the second step is to use ga narx lin et al 1996 yang et al 2019a for further daily correction of the results of the first step and this step is only applied to precipitation considering the high computational cost and greater complexity of precipitation compared with other climate variables in ga narx this study selects the qm dqm corrected daily rainfall mean maximum minimum temperature relative humidity and wind speed as the predictors and the observed rainfall as the target with historical data split into training 70 validation 15 and testing 15 yang et al 2019a this process can be expressed as 1 p t m l f p t q m t max t q m t min t q m t m e a n t q m r h t q m w s t q m where pt ml is the machine learning corrected rainfall and f represents the mapping relationship based on the ga narx to avoid the effect of non stationarity all projected climate variables in the future period are detrended and then serve as inputs of the developed ga narx model for each gcm to predict future rainfall finally the trends are multiplicatively added to the predicted rainfall series 3 the third step is to improve the correction accuracy of extremely high rainfall by tgdm which divides the rainfall into normal high and extremely high rainfall by 95th and 99th percentiles based on historical rainfall and then corrects the bias by the gamma distribution mapping for each type of rainfall gao et al 2019 the detailed descriptions of qm dqm ga narx and tgdm are provided in the supplement text s1 s3 3 2 future land use projections by ca markov combining ca and the markov chain the ca markov model can project both quantitative and spatial changes in land use yang et al 2019b the markov chain model can quantify the transition probabilities of multiple land use categories at discrete time steps and cellular automata ca can effectively predict spatial changes over a certain period with transition probabilities du et al 2012 the ca markov model is run using idirisi software and more details can be found in the idirisi manual eastman 2012 and the supplement text s4 in this study we first validated the model accuracy and then predicted future land use maps at a 100 m 100 m resolution for every decade from 2020 to 2090 with the land use transitions from luh2 as the constraint of ca markov the whole process can be split into the following steps 1 the land use map of 2014 is predicted with the land use map of 2006 and 2010 as inputs and then the accuracy of the model is evaluated by comparing it with the observed land use map of 2014 2 with the observed land use of 2010 and 2014 as inputs transition area matrixes and 100 m 100 m conditional probability maps relative to the observed land use of 2014 are produced from 2020 to 2090 by the markov chain and are referred to as the markov based transition area matrix and markov based conditional probability maps 3 the future transition area matrixes relative to the land use state of 2014 in luh2 are derived from luh2 for each decade and are used to replace the markov based transition area matrix and correct the markov based conditional probability maps 4 future 100 m 100 m land use maps from 2020 to 2090 are generated by ca markov using the same method we also generated historical land use maps for every decade from 1980 to 2000 during which time the observed land use maps were missing the kappa indices including kappa for no information kno kappa for grid cell level location klocation kappa for stratum level location k locationstrata and kappa standard kstandard are selected in this study to evaluate the prediction accuracy and the performance can be regarded as good with kappa values higher than 0 8 gashaw et al 2017 yang et al 2019b a detailed description and formula of the kappa indices can be found in the study by pontius 2000 3 3 lai projection by biome bgc the future daily lai is simulated by the biome bgc model based on future land use and climate scenarios the biome bgc model thornton 2002 is a one dimensional process based biogeochemical model that can simulate the stocks and fluxes of carbon nitrogen energy and water at daily time steps with soil and meteorological conditions detailed descriptions of the biome bgc model can be found in the supplement text s5 and the studies by white et al 2000 and thornton 2002 in this study the 4 2 version of biome bgc is used and we improve the model to realize parallel computation on the surface the eco physiological parameters for each land use type except urban areas water bodies and bare soil are calibrated with the lai data from gimms from 1985 to 1989 and are validated from 1990 to 1994 with the calibrated biome bgc model the future daily lai under different scenarios is projected based on future meteorological data and land use maps 3 4 hydrological simulation by gbhm the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm proposed by yang et al 1998 is a fully distributed hydrological model mainly consisting of hillslope unit based hydrological simulations and river routing along river networks the hydrological simulations mainly contain the canopy interception evapotranspiration surface flow infiltration unsaturated flow and groundwater flow and the river routing is solved by the kinematic wave method without a reservoir operation module gbhm can effectively simulate the natural hydrological processes in a large basin and a detailed description of the model can be found in yang et al 1998 and yang et al 2002 this study adopts gbhm to simulate the natural hydrological processes in ucprb with a spatial resolution of 2 5 km 2 5 km to be convinced for reflecting the hydrological processes the model is calibrated and validated in the historical period and then applied to simulate future hydrological changes the hydrological initial conditions of the model were stabilized by a 6 year warm up run the daily observed runoff data at p12 station is complete from 1 january 1985 to 31 december 2014 and not affected by the reservoirs therefore the data at p12 from 1 january 1985 to 31 december 1989 is used to calibrate the model parameters including the groundwater hydraulic conductivity slope shape factor and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the topsoil miao et al 2016 yang 2020 the data at four mountain sub catchment gauges p12 w4 y14 and n9 from 1 january 1990 to 31 december 1995 were used to validate the model 3 5 copula based flood and drought frequency analysis before frequency analysis flood and drought events need to be identified for floods the peak over threshold pot method lang et al 1999 is adopted in this study pot selects flood events by setting the threshold that leads to an average of a specific number of events per year compared with the annual maximum flood series amf pot has three significant advantages identifying more large flood events in a wet year ignoring unimportant small flood events in a dry year and supplying more information such as the magnitude duration volume and lag time between two adjacent events mediero et al 2014 yang et al 2019a and a large number of samples for frequency analysis in this study a threshold allowing three events per year is adopted and the details of pot can be found in the previous studies by lang et al 1999 and mediero et al 2014 the streamflow drought index sdi is used to identify hydrological drought events the sdi is calculated based on the monthly streamflow as suggested by the previous study shamshirband 2020 a hydrological drought occurs when the sdi value is less than zero nalbantis and tsakiris 2008 tabari et al 2012 drought events are extracted from the monthly sdi series with a threshold of zero the detailed method of sdi calculation is introduced by shamshirband 2020 shukla and wood 2008 the copula function provides more flexibility in selecting marginal and joint probability functions compared with the classical bivariate frequency and is the dominant method in bivariate frequency analysis fan 2016 sraj et al 2015 copula functions connect univariable marginal distribution functions with the multivariable probability distribution sklar 1959 and a detailed description of copula functions can be found in the studies by nelsen 2000 and salvadori et al 2007 in this study flood and drought events are first identified from the hydrological simulation results and the flood peak and volume series as well as the drought duration and severity series are derived second the marginal distribution functions of the univariates are fitted and the parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood method the distribution with the minimum bayesian information criterion bic is selected as the marginal distribution third the dependences between the flood peak and volume as well as the drought duration and severity are assessed by correlation coefficients including the pearson kendall and spearman coefficients fourth the joint probability distribution is processed and the parameters of candidate copula functions are estimated by a hybrid evolution markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach within a bayesian framework all copula based flood and drought frequency analyses are conducted using the multivariate copula analysis toolbox mvcat sadegh 2018 sadegh et al 2017 and a mathematical description of the bic marginal distribution functions copula functions and joint return period can also be found in the study by sadegh et al 2017 3 6 quantification of the climate change and land use change impacts the comparison between the historical simulation and the future projection in the study basin under the ssp scenario shows the possible changes in future water resources floods and droughts under the combined impact of future climate and land use changes to identify the respective impact of climate change and the land use change we artificially design other four scenarios which combine the projected climate forcing under four ssp rcps and the historical land use in 2011 referred to as scenarios n126 n245 n370 and n585 for example the difference in hydrological simulation between the scenarios ssp126 and n126 can be identified as the impact of land use change comparison between the hydrological simulation under the historical climate and land use and the hydrological simulation under scenario n126 we can quantify the impact of future climate change under ssp 126 4 results 4 1 statistical downscaling results of climate variables as shown in table 2 the results indicate that the proposed statistical downscaling method achieves good accuracy with the correlation coefficient r increasing from 0 47 to 0 82 in the test period since the qm method the first step is mainly used for spatial downscaling and initial bias correction on a monthly scale the r value has a slight decrease the ml the second step can significantly improve the daily correlation relationship between observations and simulations while there is still an underestimation of high precipitation that needs to be improved the tgdm method the third step can effectively improve the performance of simulation of the high precipitation fig 3 shows the annual precipitation and annual mean air temperature downscaled for the four ssp scenarios regarding the future precipitation changes fig 3a the annual areal mean precipitation under all scenarios shows an increasing trend with a rate of 0 88 mm yr under ssp126 1 30 mm yr under ssp245 1 06 mm yr under ssp370 and 1 73 mm yr under ssp585 the mean annual precipitation in the future period of 2071 2100 will increase by 17 6 under ssp126 14 6 under ssp245 8 6 under ssp370 and 24 8 under ssp585 compared with the mean annual precipitation in the historical period comparison between the long term mean of monthly precipitation between the historical period and future climate scenario fig 3b the results show that the historical precipitation is mainly concentrated in the period from may to october with two peaks while future precipitation appears to be more concentrated between july and september which may lead to an increase of the future floods regarding the future air temperature change fig 3c the annual mean temperature also shows an increasing trend with a rate of 0 16 10 yr under ssp126 0 24 10 yr under ssp245 0 40 10 yr under ssp370 and 0 54 10 yr under ssp585 the annual mean air temperature in 2071 2100 will rise by 1 84 under ssp126 2 44 under ssp245 3 07 under ssp370 and 4 08 under ssp585 compared with the historical period the downscaling results of other climate variables are given in text s7 in the supplementary materials 4 2 projected future land use changes under the ssp rcps using the land use map in 2006 and 2011 as the inputs to the ca markov model the land use map in 2014 is simulated and the comparison between the simulated and observed land use map in 2014 shows a good performance with kappa indices greater than 80 kno of 93 3 klocation of 92 2 klocationstrata of 92 2 and kstandard of 92 0 based on the land use transition matrixes calculated from the luh2 dataset as well as the observed land use maps in 2011 and 2014 the high resolution land use maps in each decade from 2020 to 2090 under the four ssp rcp scenarios are projected and the historical maps in 1980 1990 and 2000 are also simulated the land use maps in 2090 under the ssp126 ssp245 ssp370 and ssp585 scenarios are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 while other projected maps are provided in the supplementary material see fig s2 s5 to better investigate the future land use changes under various scenarios we summarize the temporal variation of three main land use types forestland crop fields and urban areas from 1980 to 2090 under the four scenarios and the results are shown in fig 4 it shows that the forestland decreased consistently and the cropland and urban areas increased gradually during the historical period while the future land use changes under the four scenarios have different trends the forestland under ssp126 is the largest with an increasing trend and the cropland is the lowest with a decreasing trend which is consistent with the design of a green development path the forestland under ssp370 is the smallest with a decreasing trend and the cropland is the largest with an increasing trend future urbanization also increases in ssp370 while it first increases and then decreases under other scenarios the rocky road design of ssp370 means that land use is hardly regulated and deforestation consistently occurs for more cropland with medium regulation of land use the proportions of forest and cropland under ssp245 and ssp585 range between those of ssp126 and ssp370 4 3 future changes in water resources with the calibrated gbhm and biome bgc the future daily lai is projected and then the hydrological process during the period from 1 january 2015 to 31 december 2099 is simulated using the future climate forcing data and land use series under the four scenarios based on the simulation results the changes in the water resources floods and droughts are analyzed the calibration and validation results of biome bgc and gbhm are provided in supplement text s5 and s6 and the results show that the two models can satisfactorily simulate the vegetation growth and river discharge in the study basin the comparison between the areal mean half monthly observed lai and simulated lai by biome bgc is shown in fig 5 a and the projection results of areal mean annual maximum lai under four future scenarios are shown in fig 5b the results show that the changes in lai are basically consistent with the vegetation changes in the projected land use fig 6 a shows the change in annual runoff at the c 2 station the outlet of the study basin to illustrate the change in the water resource available under the four future ssp rcps the future annual runoff shows an increasing trend and the annual runoff in the 2090 s will increase by 10 0 under ssp126 23 4 under ssp245 3 3 under ssp370 and 20 0 under ssp585 compared with that in the 2010 s for quantifying the relative contribution of climate change and land use change the simulated runoff under the four artificially designed scenarios is also shown in fig 6 a the land use changes under ssp126 and ssp370 are larger than other ssp rcp scenarios and thus we mainly analyze the respective impacts of climate change and land use change under ssp126 and ssp370 from 2071 to 2100 the annual runoff under n126 has an increase of 31 9 compared to that in the historical period of 1985 2014 which is the contribution of climate change and the annual runoff under ssp126 has an increase of 25 2 compared to that in the historical period of 1985 2014 which is caused by both climate and land use changes therefore runoff change caused only by the land use change can be estimated to be 6 7 i e 25 2 31 9 which means that the decrease of cropland and afforestation will slightly reduce the annual runoff under the ssp370 scenario the annual runoff has an increase of 7 5 due to climate change and the land use change causes a slight increase in annual runoff about 3 5 due to deforestation and cropland expansion in order to assess the water scarcity the annual water resource per capita is calculated as the annual mean runoff volume divided by the population in the study area schewe et al 2014 according to the projected future population in the ssp datasets see fig 6b the population in the study area reaches the peak from the 2030 s to 2040 s and then decline under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 while the population under ssp370 will stabilize at the peak the annual water resources per capita fig 6b are projected to reach the bottom approximately 2500 m3 per capita per year between 2030 and 2040 and then gradually increase water scarcity is projected to be the worst under ssp370 a water shortage may occur in the middle of the 21st century in addition to better evaluate the effects of land use and lai on water resources the decadal mean evapotranspiration and runoff coefficient from the 1980 s to 2090 s are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the runoff coefficient increases gradually under the ssp126 scenario with the decrease in cropland while the runoff coefficient presents a slightly decreasing trend under the ssp370 scenario with cropland expansion this result is consistent with the findings by sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 both canopy interception and evapotranspiration show an increasing trend under all future scenarios due to the lai increase caused by the increased precipitation and air temperature in the future 4 4 future changes in flood frequency in this study we model the bivariate joint distribution of flood peak volume combinations based on the copula method and table 3 shows the projected joint return periods of given flood peak volume combinations with 30 year 50 year and 100 year return periods calculated based on the historical period of 1985 2014 a smaller return period indicates that a given flood is more likely to occur with a larger exceedance frequency and vice versa the result shows that the bivariate joint return periods of different flood peak volume combinations decrease gradually under the four future ssp rcp scenarios indicating that the occurrence possibility of floods will increase in the future the comparison of the changes in the return period under different scenarios shows that the floods under ssp370 have the greatest reduction in the return periods and the greatest increase in the flood exceedance frequency while the floods under ssp126 have the smallest reduction in the return periods to identify the relative contribution of climate change and land use change to the flood change the flood return periods under four artificially designed scenarios are also shown in table 3 similar to the analysis of water resources we also choose ssp126 and ssp370 to illustrate the respective impact the results show that in the future period of 2071 2100 the frequency of the historical 100 year flood under n126 increases by 2 12 times compared to that in the historical period while it is amplified by 1 63 times under ssp126 this result indicates that climate change dominates the increase of future flood frequency 2 12 times and continued afforestation under ssp126 will offset the flood frequency increase caused by climate change the flood frequency under n370 increases by 3 17 times and that under ssp370 increases by 4 55 times which also illustrates that climate change plays a dominant role in the increase of flood frequency and that the continued deforestation and cropland expansion will exacerbate future flood risk we select the flood peak volume combination with a 100 year return period based on the historical period as the target and calculate the joint return periods fig 8 from upstream to downstream at 12 stations in the period of 2071 2100 for further detecting the spatial characteristics of the flood frequency changes over the study basin the results also demonstrate that the frequency of future floods will increase significantly under the ssp370 scenario in addition the results also show that the frequency increases along the four tributaries from upstream to downstream which means that the downstream region will face a greater flood risk than the upstream region in the future at the outlet of the study basin c2 station the probability of a historical 100 year flood is projected to increase by approximately 4 5 times at the end of the 21st century under the ssp370 scenario and increase by 1 63 times under the ssp126 scenario 4 5 future changes in drought frequency this study analyzes the bivariate joint distribution of hydrological drought duration severity combinations by the copula method and the results are shown in table 4 and fig 9 similar to the results of the flood frequency analysis table 4 shows the projected return periods of the historical droughts with different magnitudes and fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of the future changes in drought frequency from table 4 it can be derived that the projected return periods decrease gradually under the four future ssp rcp scenarios representing more frequent droughts in the future among the four scenarios ssp370 and ssp245 show greater increases in the occurrence probabilities of future droughts while the situations under ssp126 have relatively less change regarding the relative contribution of climate change and land use change to the drought the result shows that climate change is the major cause of the increase in hydrological drought frequency the spatial distribution of the changes in the drought return periods fig 9 does not show a similar pattern as the changes in future floods overall although the occurrence probability of extreme droughts occurring may be less than that of extreme floods in the future frequent and severe hydrological droughts will be a risk to agriculture and thus food security in the future 5 discussion 5 1 contribution of a more sustainable land use managements in flood mitigation in section 4 4 and section 4 5 we have quantified the effects of future climate and land use changes on floods and droughts on the basis of frequency by comparing the ssp rcp scenarios which combine the future climate forcing data and future land use maps with synthetic analysis which combine the future climate forcing data and historical land use maps the dominated effect of climate change is demonstrated and positive effect of afforestation or more sustainable land use change is illustrated moreover to explore the degree of mitigation of future flood disasters by land use management under high greenhouse gas emissions this study simply designs a scenario combining the projected climate data 2071 2100 under ssp370 and the projected land use under ssp126 that has the highest amount of afforestation the annual mean runoff under the designed scenario has a decrease of 4 8 compared with that under the most rocky road future ssp370 which indicates that afforestation will slightly reduce the streamflow the exceedance frequency of a historical 100 year flood under the newly designed scenario will be decreased by 33 3 compared to that under ssp370 this indicates that the increased risk of floods caused by climate change could be offset to some extent by afforestation or more sustainable land use management although the frequencies of floods still increase considerably compared to those in the historical period 5 2 comparison with previous studies previous studies on the impact of climate change on hydrological processes have illustrated that global warming will lead to more frequent floods and droughts in most parts of the world dai 2012 hirabayashi 2013 while land use change will exacerbate or mitigate water related risks bradshaw et al 2007 takata and hanasaki 2020 thailand suffers a lot from floods and droughts in the past and previous studies consistently reported that there would be an increase in high flows and a decrease in low flows under global warming kiguchi 2021 kotsuki et al 2014 watanabe 2014 in the chao phraya river basin most studies have projected a future increase in peak flows and thus increasing flood risks kiguchi 2021 in this study based on greenhouse gas emission and socioeconomic development combined scenarios developed in cmip6 we found that future precipitation would become more concentrated in the wet season with an increasing precipitation amount and the air temperature would continue rising we found that these changes in climate would dominate the future changes in runoff floods and droughts by altering the hydrological cycle in the study region under future scenarios and population growth also let to future water scarcity which is consistent with previous studies miralles wilhelm 2021 meanwhile land use change can also impact regional hydrological prosses although the impact of land use change is smaller than that of climate change forest degradation will reduce evapotranspiration canopy storage and interception increase infiltration and then lead to the rise of soil water content and groundwater recharge ultimately increasing runoff yang et al 2019b zhang and wei 2012 and exacerbating flood risks bradshaw et al 2007 knighton et al 2019 villarreal rosas et al 2021 large differences in the proportion of forest cover may explain the higher flood risk in the downstream agricultural plains than that in the upper forest cover mountains this study is distinguished from the previous studies in that we reasonably estimated the future land use changes under the coupled greenhouse gas emission and socioeconomic development scenarios in cmip6 and considered future vegetation dynamics in the hydrological projection together with the joint impact of climate and land use changes the projected future trend of water resources flood and drought provided a scientific basis for regional water resources management in the changing environment 5 3 adaptation and mitigation suggestions global climate change mitigation requires international collaboration which is difficult to achieve through efforts from a single local government however greener land use management can be realized by a regional government therefore we propose several corresponding mitigations and adaptation suggestions to face the potential risks of future water scarcity and flood and drought risks first and foremost since climate change dominates future changes in water related disasters mitigation strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and slowing global warming should be urgent priorities this cannot be achieved by efforts from a single country and international cooperation in tackling global climate change is more urgent and important than ever second at the regional scale sustainable water management can mediate or constrain climate goals for both mitigation and adaptation and is also required to adapt to future climate change miralles wilhelm 2021 here we suggest integrated basin management including 1 improving efficiencies in water use and synergy among water using sectors 2 improving the existing reservoir operation to adapt to future hydrological regimes 3 wise land management for mitigating flood and drought risks 4 re evaluate the risk of the future floods to the existing hydrological structures 5 4 uncertainties in this study the physical models mainly include the gbhm and biome bgc models the error from the gbhm model is mainly caused by the uncertainties linked to the meteorological inputs model structure and model parameters li et al 2012 similarly the uncertainties contained in the lai projections by the biome bgc model mainly come from the meteorological inputs model structure and parameter estimation turner et al 2016 limited by the number of meteorological stations the spatial interpolation of climate variables may not fully reflect the real spatial distribution situation which will be solved as a future collection of more observation data the model structures still have uncertainties in describing the real physical processes and this will be gradually improved with future deeper research 6 conclusion this study proposes a framework of future watershed hydrological projection coupling the climate and land use changes and vegetation dynamics in a physically based distributed hydrological simulation and applies it to the upper chao phraya river basin through analysis of the changes in water resources floods and hydrological droughts we derive the following conclusions 1 in the future land use changes have different tendencies under different development pathways by the end of the 21st century under the greenest road ssp126 the forest will increase by 3 2 and the cropland will decrease by 1 0 while the forestland will consistently decrease 5 0 in the 2090 s under the rocky road ssp370 with the cropland continually increasing 3 7 in 2090 s in the study basin 2 the precipitation and air temperature will continue rising in the future under all scenarios with average rising rates from 0 88 mm yr to 2 24 mm yr and from 0 16 10 yr to 0 54 10 yr respectively compared with the annual precipitation and mean air temperature in the historical period the precipitation will increase by 8 6 24 8 and the air temperature will rise by 1 84 4 08 in 2071 2100 3 under the joint impact of climate and land use change the upper chao phraya river basin may face increasing water scarcity more frequent floods and hydrological droughts in the future water scarcity will reach the worst situation in the mid 21st century and then gradually alleviate at the outlet of the study basin the future probability of the historical 100 year flood is projected to increase by 4 55 times by the end 21st century under ssp370 and by 1 63 times under ssp126 the future frequency of the historical 100 year drought will increase by 0 59 times under ssp126 and by 1 5 times under ssp370 by the end 21st century 4 climate change is the major cause of more frequent floods and droughts in the future and the impact of regional land use changes cannot be ignored future continued deforestation and cropland expansion lead to a slight increase in annual mean runoff and exacerbate future flood risks this research is helpful to the local government in managing the future water resources floods and drought in the study basin the projected future trends of water

2060,global climate change and local human activities have profoundly affected the regional hydrological cycle and water resources it is imperative to explore the potential changes in future water resources and water related hazards at the regional scale under global warming and local socioeconomic development while a scientific assessment of future hydrological risks requires reasonable projection of future climate land use and vegetation changes in order to improve the traditional statistical downscaling method this study combines the machine learning and quantile mapping methods to project future climate under four shared socio economic pathway representative concentration pathways ssp rcp of the cmip6 future land use is projected jointly with the future climate by the ca markov model and the vegetation dynamics are simulated by the biome bgc model then we employ a physically based distributed hydrological model to simulate the future hydrological changes in the upper chao phraya basin under the interaction among climate and land use changes and the vegetation dynamics the results show that under the joint impact of climate and land use changes the study area may face increasing water scarcity and more frequent floods and droughts in the future water scarcity will reach the worst in the mid 21st century water resources per capita decrease 34 2 compared to the 2010 s by the end 21st century the 100 year historical flood and drought in the study basin will increase by 1 63 times and 0 59 times respectively under the ssp126 scenario the most sustainable pathway and by 4 55 times and 1 56 times under the ssp370 scenario the most pessimistic rocky road pathway results demonstrate that climate change is the major cause for more frequent floods and droughts in the future while afforestation or more sustainable land use management will mitigate the adverse effects of climate change to some extent this finding is helpful to the local government in managing future water resources floods and droughts in the study basin keywords climate change land use change vegetation dynamics flood and drought cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change has a wide impact on the hydrological cycle across many regions worldwide basheer et al 2016 schewe et al 2014 yang 2021 which may cause more water shortage greve 2018 and higher risk of the water related disasters tanoue et al 2021 yuan 2019 however due to the large regional differences in climate change ipcc 2021 awareness of changes in regional water resources and water related disasters under future climate change scenarios is still limited especially in underdeveloped countries and regions hase et al 2021 schmidt et al 2013 therefore studies on the climate change impact on regional water resources floods and droughts are of great significance for mitigating the climate change impact and achieving the sustainable development goals anghileri et al 2011 kang et al 2019 wang 2013 past efforts to explore the change in future water related hazards mainly including water resource scarcity floods and droughts were mainly by the hydrological modeling forced by the future climate projected from the general circulation models gcms at a variety of spatial scales ranging from the globe alfieri 2017 arnell and gosling 2014 dankers 2014 do et al 2018 hirabayashi 2013 liu 2021 winsemius 2015 to regions bates 2021 ma 2021 rottler et al 2021 roudier 2015 wang et al 2022 however due to systematic bias and coarse spatial resolution there is a gap between the gcms output and the inputs of regional hydrological models where numerous statistical downscaling methods including bias correction and spatial downscaling have been developed chen et al 2013 guo et al 2020 mamalakis et al 2017 among these methods the widely used quantile mapping qm methods can effectively reduce the biases in marginal distribution cannon et al 2015 guti√©rrez 2019 and perform better than other methods chen et al 2013 guo et al 2020 however qm based statistical downscaling methods usually is carried out at the temporal scale of a month which ignores the correlation between raw gcm outputs and observations at the daily time scale zhao 2017 this may lead to the failure of bias correction and watershed hydrological simulations preserving the correlation information between predictors and targets during the training period recurrent neural networks rnns perform well in the long term prediction of nonlinear time series yang et al 2019a and are widely used in hydrological studies adi et al 2017 chung et al 2016 feng et al 2020 yang et al 2019a zhang 2018 combining qm and rnns can potentially be an effective method for accurate bias correction in statistical downscaling by considering land use and climate change impacts on watershed hydrology some studies illustrated the impact of specially designed land use scenarios such as rapid urbanization deforestation and afforestation on streamflow regimes in the context of global warming aich 2016 chacuttrikul et al 2018 pervez and henebry 2015 wang et al 2008 yang et al 2019b nevertheless the previous studies rarely considered the interaction of climate land use and vegetation in the hydrological simulations under future scenarios in these studies regional climate change and land use change were often described individually rather than jointly in a unified future scenario which ignores the interaction between the climate and land use under the shared socio economic development and greenhouse gas emission pathway therefore the future land use change should be projected jointly with the future climate change under the most recent ssp rcp scenarios of the cmip6 further land use is an important factor affecting vegetation but few studies consider the vegetation dynamics such as the change of lai under the future land use scenarios in the watershed hydrological simulation with the recent release of the luh2 dataset hurtt 2020b which is a part of cmip6 and serves as the input of the gcms it is possible to project the future climate and land use scenarios jointly at the regional scale for improving the future hydrological projection under different climate and land use scenarios here we propose a new framework to simulate the mutual interaction of climate land use vegetation and hydrology the chao phraya river basin is the largest river basin in thailand which is undergoing land use change and suffering the climate change impact the basin locates in a typical tropical monsoon region and is highly sensitive to hydrological extremes previous studies report that extreme floods will be amplified more than twice in frequency in the next 3 5 decades under future climate change and socio economic development alfieri 2017 alfieri et al 2015 jongman 2014 vitousek 2017 ipcc 2021 reports that the change in future drought may be less than the change in floods in thailand therefore the chao phraya river basin is chosen as the study area in this study we mainly try to solve the problem of insufficient consideration of the coupling of climate land use and vegetation changes in hydrological prediction under future scenarios therefore we develop a statistical downscaling method that combines quantile mapping qm and a recurrent neural network rnn for bias correction and spatial downscaling of the gcm outputs mainly for precipitation and project the land use maps with high spatial resolution under the future ssp rcp scenarios using the ca markov model based on the luh2 dataset we also simulate the vegetation dynamics mainly change in the leaf area index using the biome bgc model under the future climate and land use scenarios then we employ a physically based distributed hydrological model namely gbhm to simulate the future changes in the hydrological cycle in the study basin this study aims to 1 project the future changes in climate and land use jointly under the combined scenarios of socio economic developments and greenhouse gas emissions 2 analyze the risk of future flood drought and water resources scarcity 3 quantify the respective impact of climate change and land use change on regional hydrology 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the upper chao phraya river basin ucprb located in northern thailand has a drainage area of 110 569 km2 and consists of four sub basins ping wang yom and nan rivers covering 15 provinces the extent and geomorphic features are shown in fig 1 with northern mountains mainly covered by forests and the central plain mainly covered by crops the ucprb has significant spatial heterogeneities of topography land use types and meteorology and belongs to a tropical monsoon pattern with a mean annual precipitation of approximately 1 200 mm with 85 of the total annual rainfall occurring between may and november i e the wet season the temporal and spatial distributions of rainfall are highly heterogeneous ponpang nga and techamahasaranont 2016 which brings great difficulties to statistical downscaling in this study the outlet gauge of the ucprb referred to as c2 and four mountain exit gauges of the main tributaries i e p12 station at ping river w4 station at wang river y14 station at yom river and n9 station at nan river were selected to evaluate the changes in future water related hazards 2 2 data 1 historical observation data the observation data used in this study mainly consist of meteorological data land use data daily streamflow observations at the four stations and other basic geographic information required by the gbhm the gauged meteorological observations were provided by the royal irrigation department of thailand and included daily mean maximum and minimum temperature precipitation relative humidity wind speed and sunshine duration at 96 rainfall gauges and 14 meteorological gauges these gauged data were spatially interpolated into gridded data with a spatial resolution of 2 5 km 2 5 km by an angular distance weighting method with elevation corrections yang 2004 three historical land use maps for 2006 2011 and 2014 at a 100 m 100 m spatial resolution were provided by the department of land development of thailand and land use was classified into eight types i e water bodies urban areas bare soil forests shrubs upland fields grasslands and paddy fields as required by the gbhm and biome bgc daily streamflow observations at the four stations were provided by the royal irrigation department of thailand the geomorphological information including the slope slope length and elevation was calculated from the hydrological data and maps based on the shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales

modeling and mapping studies gimms zhu 2013 the soil data were obtained from the soilgrids dataset hengl 2017 released by the international soil reference and information center isric this dataset provides the global distribution of soil types and numerous physical and biochemical soil properties with a 250 m spatial resolution and 6 layers by an ensemble of machine learning methods based on 150 000 soil profiles and remote sensing based soil covariates srtm dem derivatives modis land products global land use map in 2011 climatic images and global landform and lithology maps the soil properties including soil organic matter bulk density and the proportion of clay silt sand and gravel were used in this study for hydrological simulation and future soil organic matter projection 2 climate outputs of gcms and land use projections from luh2 considering the data accessibility for downloading we selected five newly released gcm outputs under four ssp rcp scenarios ssp1 rcp2 6 is referred to as ssp126 ssp2 rcp4 5 is referred to as ssp245 ssp3 rcp7 0 is referred to as ssp370 and ssp5 rcp8 5 is referred to as ssp585 from the latest cmip6 these five gcms i e access esm1 5 gfdl esm4 miroc6 mpi esm1 2 lr and mri esm2 0 have been applied in southeastern asia for future climate change assessments in previous studies hunukumbura and tachikawa 2012 okwala et al 2020 panjwani et al 2019 plangoen and udmale 2017 preethi et al 2017 singhrattna and singh babel 2011 and detailed information is shown in table 1 the climate model outputs including the daily near surface mean maximum and minimum air temperature daily precipitation daily near surface relative humidity and daily near surface wind speed were downloaded for both the historical period 1985 2014 and future period 2015 2100 the newly developed ssp rcp scenarios are rooted in socioeconomic trajectories i e ssps which can be harmoniously combined with previously developed rcps in cmip5 through shared policy assumptions and present more reasonable future scenarios ncc 2019 ssps represent the potential futures of green fueled growth for ssp1 a middle of the road scenario for ssp2 high inequality between countries for ssp3 and fossil fueled growth for ssp5 gidden 2019 serving as the basic scenarios for climate model projections the four ssp rcp scenarios selected in this study belong to the tier 1 scenarios of cmip6 and span a full range of forcing targets following that of the rcps in cmip5 gidden 2019 o neill 2016 the scenario based future land use data were obtained from the luh2 dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 25‚Å∞ 0 25‚Å∞ and mainly include the annual land use states and transitions between land use states for the future period 2015 2100 under the four ssp rcp scenarios consistent with the climate outputs of gcms the land use states in luh2 contain twelve types and are reclassified into cropland grassland forest and urban area detailed information on luh2 can be found in the study by hurtt 2020a 3 methods this section introduces a statistical downscaling framework combining quantile mapping and machine learning a ca markov based algorithm for simulating the future land use maps with high spatial resolution under the ssp rcp scenarios simplified as ssp scenarios and the biome bgc model for simulating vegetation dynamics using the downscaled climate forcing land use and vegetation leaf area index lai gbhm is used to simulate the hydrological processes based on the hydrological simulation results the frequency of flood and drought is analyzed using a copula based method fig 2 shows the overall framework of the methodology in this study the future changes in water resources flood and drought are compared with the historical 30 year data from 1985 to 2014 used in the previous study alfieri et al 2015 three future time slices span from 2026 to 2055 with the median year of 2040 the period of 2046 2075 with the median year of 2060 and the period of 2071 2100 with the median year of 2085 3 1 statistical downscaling for climate outputs of gcms this study proposed a statistical downscaling framework combining quantile mapping qm a genetic algorithm based nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous input ga narx and triple gamma distribution mapping tgdm and mainly applied this complicated method to precipitation downscaling since precipitation serves as the primary factor affecting the basin hydrological process and its variability plays a critical role in complicated hydrological regime forming houston 2006 moulin et al 2009 saifullah et al 2016 yang et al 2019b considering the high computational cost of the newly proposed framework and less complexity than precipitation the climate variables except precipitation were bias corrected and spatially downscaled by qm in the historical period and by detrended quantile mapping dqm in the future period the statistical downscaling process mainly consists of three steps 1 the first step is the initial bias correction and spatial downscaling by qm piani et al 2009 for the historical period and dqm cannon et al 2015 for the future period and this step is applied to all climate variables the cumulative distribution functions cdfs in qm and dqm are constructed based on all days in a certain month m 2 the second step is to use ga narx lin et al 1996 yang et al 2019a for further daily correction of the results of the first step and this step is only applied to precipitation considering the high computational cost and greater complexity of precipitation compared with other climate variables in ga narx this study selects the qm dqm corrected daily rainfall mean maximum minimum temperature relative humidity and wind speed as the predictors and the observed rainfall as the target with historical data split into training 70 validation 15 and testing 15 yang et al 2019a this process can be expressed as 1 p t m l f p t q m t max t q m t min t q m t m e a n t q m r h t q m w s t q m where pt ml is the machine learning corrected rainfall and f represents the mapping relationship based on the ga narx to avoid the effect of non stationarity all projected climate variables in the future period are detrended and then serve as inputs of the developed ga narx model for each gcm to predict future rainfall finally the trends are multiplicatively added to the predicted rainfall series 3 the third step is to improve the correction accuracy of extremely high rainfall by tgdm which divides the rainfall into normal high and extremely high rainfall by 95th and 99th percentiles based on historical rainfall and then corrects the bias by the gamma distribution mapping for each type of rainfall gao et al 2019 the detailed descriptions of qm dqm ga narx and tgdm are provided in the supplement text s1 s3 3 2 future land use projections by ca markov combining ca and the markov chain the ca markov model can project both quantitative and spatial changes in land use yang et al 2019b the markov chain model can quantify the transition probabilities of multiple land use categories at discrete time steps and cellular automata ca can effectively predict spatial changes over a certain period with transition probabilities du et al 2012 the ca markov model is run using idirisi software and more details can be found in the idirisi manual eastman 2012 and the supplement text s4 in this study we first validated the model accuracy and then predicted future land use maps at a 100 m 100 m resolution for every decade from 2020 to 2090 with the land use transitions from luh2 as the constraint of ca markov the whole process can be split into the following steps 1 the land use map of 2014 is predicted with the land use map of 2006 and 2010 as inputs and then the accuracy of the model is evaluated by comparing it with the observed land use map of 2014 2 with the observed land use of 2010 and 2014 as inputs transition area matrixes and 100 m 100 m conditional probability maps relative to the observed land use of 2014 are produced from 2020 to 2090 by the markov chain and are referred to as the markov based transition area matrix and markov based conditional probability maps 3 the future transition area matrixes relative to the land use state of 2014 in luh2 are derived from luh2 for each decade and are used to replace the markov based transition area matrix and correct the markov based conditional probability maps 4 future 100 m 100 m land use maps from 2020 to 2090 are generated by ca markov using the same method we also generated historical land use maps for every decade from 1980 to 2000 during which time the observed land use maps were missing the kappa indices including kappa for no information kno kappa for grid cell level location klocation kappa for stratum level location k locationstrata and kappa standard kstandard are selected in this study to evaluate the prediction accuracy and the performance can be regarded as good with kappa values higher than 0 8 gashaw et al 2017 yang et al 2019b a detailed description and formula of the kappa indices can be found in the study by pontius 2000 3 3 lai projection by biome bgc the future daily lai is simulated by the biome bgc model based on future land use and climate scenarios the biome bgc model thornton 2002 is a one dimensional process based biogeochemical model that can simulate the stocks and fluxes of carbon nitrogen energy and water at daily time steps with soil and meteorological conditions detailed descriptions of the biome bgc model can be found in the supplement text s5 and the studies by white et al 2000 and thornton 2002 in this study the 4 2 version of biome bgc is used and we improve the model to realize parallel computation on the surface the eco physiological parameters for each land use type except urban areas water bodies and bare soil are calibrated with the lai data from gimms from 1985 to 1989 and are validated from 1990 to 1994 with the calibrated biome bgc model the future daily lai under different scenarios is projected based on future meteorological data and land use maps 3 4 hydrological simulation by gbhm the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm proposed by yang et al 1998 is a fully distributed hydrological model mainly consisting of hillslope unit based hydrological simulations and river routing along river networks the hydrological simulations mainly contain the canopy interception evapotranspiration surface flow infiltration unsaturated flow and groundwater flow and the river routing is solved by the kinematic wave method without a reservoir operation module gbhm can effectively simulate the natural hydrological processes in a large basin and a detailed description of the model can be found in yang et al 1998 and yang et al 2002 this study adopts gbhm to simulate the natural hydrological processes in ucprb with a spatial resolution of 2 5 km 2 5 km to be convinced for reflecting the hydrological processes the model is calibrated and validated in the historical period and then applied to simulate future hydrological changes the hydrological initial conditions of the model were stabilized by a 6 year warm up run the daily observed runoff data at p12 station is complete from 1 january 1985 to 31 december 2014 and not affected by the reservoirs therefore the data at p12 from 1 january 1985 to 31 december 1989 is used to calibrate the model parameters including the groundwater hydraulic conductivity slope shape factor and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the topsoil miao et al 2016 yang 2020 the data at four mountain sub catchment gauges p12 w4 y14 and n9 from 1 january 1990 to 31 december 1995 were used to validate the model 3 5 copula based flood and drought frequency analysis before frequency analysis flood and drought events need to be identified for floods the peak over threshold pot method lang et al 1999 is adopted in this study pot selects flood events by setting the threshold that leads to an average of a specific number of events per year compared with the annual maximum flood series amf pot has three significant advantages identifying more large flood events in a wet year ignoring unimportant small flood events in a dry year and supplying more information such as the magnitude duration volume and lag time between two adjacent events mediero et al 2014 yang et al 2019a and a large number of samples for frequency analysis in this study a threshold allowing three events per year is adopted and the details of pot can be found in the previous studies by lang et al 1999 and mediero et al 2014 the streamflow drought index sdi is used to identify hydrological drought events the sdi is calculated based on the monthly streamflow as suggested by the previous study shamshirband 2020 a hydrological drought occurs when the sdi value is less than zero nalbantis and tsakiris 2008 tabari et al 2012 drought events are extracted from the monthly sdi series with a threshold of zero the detailed method of sdi calculation is introduced by shamshirband 2020 shukla and wood 2008 the copula function provides more flexibility in selecting marginal and joint probability functions compared with the classical bivariate frequency and is the dominant method in bivariate frequency analysis fan 2016 sraj et al 2015 copula functions connect univariable marginal distribution functions with the multivariable probability distribution sklar 1959 and a detailed description of copula functions can be found in the studies by nelsen 2000 and salvadori et al 2007 in this study flood and drought events are first identified from the hydrological simulation results and the flood peak and volume series as well as the drought duration and severity series are derived second the marginal distribution functions of the univariates are fitted and the parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood method the distribution with the minimum bayesian information criterion bic is selected as the marginal distribution third the dependences between the flood peak and volume as well as the drought duration and severity are assessed by correlation coefficients including the pearson kendall and spearman coefficients fourth the joint probability distribution is processed and the parameters of candidate copula functions are estimated by a hybrid evolution markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach within a bayesian framework all copula based flood and drought frequency analyses are conducted using the multivariate copula analysis toolbox mvcat sadegh 2018 sadegh et al 2017 and a mathematical description of the bic marginal distribution functions copula functions and joint return period can also be found in the study by sadegh et al 2017 3 6 quantification of the climate change and land use change impacts the comparison between the historical simulation and the future projection in the study basin under the ssp scenario shows the possible changes in future water resources floods and droughts under the combined impact of future climate and land use changes to identify the respective impact of climate change and the land use change we artificially design other four scenarios which combine the projected climate forcing under four ssp rcps and the historical land use in 2011 referred to as scenarios n126 n245 n370 and n585 for example the difference in hydrological simulation between the scenarios ssp126 and n126 can be identified as the impact of land use change comparison between the hydrological simulation under the historical climate and land use and the hydrological simulation under scenario n126 we can quantify the impact of future climate change under ssp 126 4 results 4 1 statistical downscaling results of climate variables as shown in table 2 the results indicate that the proposed statistical downscaling method achieves good accuracy with the correlation coefficient r increasing from 0 47 to 0 82 in the test period since the qm method the first step is mainly used for spatial downscaling and initial bias correction on a monthly scale the r value has a slight decrease the ml the second step can significantly improve the daily correlation relationship between observations and simulations while there is still an underestimation of high precipitation that needs to be improved the tgdm method the third step can effectively improve the performance of simulation of the high precipitation fig 3 shows the annual precipitation and annual mean air temperature downscaled for the four ssp scenarios regarding the future precipitation changes fig 3a the annual areal mean precipitation under all scenarios shows an increasing trend with a rate of 0 88 mm yr under ssp126 1 30 mm yr under ssp245 1 06 mm yr under ssp370 and 1 73 mm yr under ssp585 the mean annual precipitation in the future period of 2071 2100 will increase by 17 6 under ssp126 14 6 under ssp245 8 6 under ssp370 and 24 8 under ssp585 compared with the mean annual precipitation in the historical period comparison between the long term mean of monthly precipitation between the historical period and future climate scenario fig 3b the results show that the historical precipitation is mainly concentrated in the period from may to october with two peaks while future precipitation appears to be more concentrated between july and september which may lead to an increase of the future floods regarding the future air temperature change fig 3c the annual mean temperature also shows an increasing trend with a rate of 0 16 10 yr under ssp126 0 24 10 yr under ssp245 0 40 10 yr under ssp370 and 0 54 10 yr under ssp585 the annual mean air temperature in 2071 2100 will rise by 1 84 under ssp126 2 44 under ssp245 3 07 under ssp370 and 4 08 under ssp585 compared with the historical period the downscaling results of other climate variables are given in text s7 in the supplementary materials 4 2 projected future land use changes under the ssp rcps using the land use map in 2006 and 2011 as the inputs to the ca markov model the land use map in 2014 is simulated and the comparison between the simulated and observed land use map in 2014 shows a good performance with kappa indices greater than 80 kno of 93 3 klocation of 92 2 klocationstrata of 92 2 and kstandard of 92 0 based on the land use transition matrixes calculated from the luh2 dataset as well as the observed land use maps in 2011 and 2014 the high resolution land use maps in each decade from 2020 to 2090 under the four ssp rcp scenarios are projected and the historical maps in 1980 1990 and 2000 are also simulated the land use maps in 2090 under the ssp126 ssp245 ssp370 and ssp585 scenarios are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 while other projected maps are provided in the supplementary material see fig s2 s5 to better investigate the future land use changes under various scenarios we summarize the temporal variation of three main land use types forestland crop fields and urban areas from 1980 to 2090 under the four scenarios and the results are shown in fig 4 it shows that the forestland decreased consistently and the cropland and urban areas increased gradually during the historical period while the future land use changes under the four scenarios have different trends the forestland under ssp126 is the largest with an increasing trend and the cropland is the lowest with a decreasing trend which is consistent with the design of a green development path the forestland under ssp370 is the smallest with a decreasing trend and the cropland is the largest with an increasing trend future urbanization also increases in ssp370 while it first increases and then decreases under other scenarios the rocky road design of ssp370 means that land use is hardly regulated and deforestation consistently occurs for more cropland with medium regulation of land use the proportions of forest and cropland under ssp245 and ssp585 range between those of ssp126 and ssp370 4 3 future changes in water resources with the calibrated gbhm and biome bgc the future daily lai is projected and then the hydrological process during the period from 1 january 2015 to 31 december 2099 is simulated using the future climate forcing data and land use series under the four scenarios based on the simulation results the changes in the water resources floods and droughts are analyzed the calibration and validation results of biome bgc and gbhm are provided in supplement text s5 and s6 and the results show that the two models can satisfactorily simulate the vegetation growth and river discharge in the study basin the comparison between the areal mean half monthly observed lai and simulated lai by biome bgc is shown in fig 5 a and the projection results of areal mean annual maximum lai under four future scenarios are shown in fig 5b the results show that the changes in lai are basically consistent with the vegetation changes in the projected land use fig 6 a shows the change in annual runoff at the c 2 station the outlet of the study basin to illustrate the change in the water resource available under the four future ssp rcps the future annual runoff shows an increasing trend and the annual runoff in the 2090 s will increase by 10 0 under ssp126 23 4 under ssp245 3 3 under ssp370 and 20 0 under ssp585 compared with that in the 2010 s for quantifying the relative contribution of climate change and land use change the simulated runoff under the four artificially designed scenarios is also shown in fig 6 a the land use changes under ssp126 and ssp370 are larger than other ssp rcp scenarios and thus we mainly analyze the respective impacts of climate change and land use change under ssp126 and ssp370 from 2071 to 2100 the annual runoff under n126 has an increase of 31 9 compared to that in the historical period of 1985 2014 which is the contribution of climate change and the annual runoff under ssp126 has an increase of 25 2 compared to that in the historical period of 1985 2014 which is caused by both climate and land use changes therefore runoff change caused only by the land use change can be estimated to be 6 7 i e 25 2 31 9 which means that the decrease of cropland and afforestation will slightly reduce the annual runoff under the ssp370 scenario the annual runoff has an increase of 7 5 due to climate change and the land use change causes a slight increase in annual runoff about 3 5 due to deforestation and cropland expansion in order to assess the water scarcity the annual water resource per capita is calculated as the annual mean runoff volume divided by the population in the study area schewe et al 2014 according to the projected future population in the ssp datasets see fig 6b the population in the study area reaches the peak from the 2030 s to 2040 s and then decline under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 while the population under ssp370 will stabilize at the peak the annual water resources per capita fig 6b are projected to reach the bottom approximately 2500 m3 per capita per year between 2030 and 2040 and then gradually increase water scarcity is projected to be the worst under ssp370 a water shortage may occur in the middle of the 21st century in addition to better evaluate the effects of land use and lai on water resources the decadal mean evapotranspiration and runoff coefficient from the 1980 s to 2090 s are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the runoff coefficient increases gradually under the ssp126 scenario with the decrease in cropland while the runoff coefficient presents a slightly decreasing trend under the ssp370 scenario with cropland expansion this result is consistent with the findings by sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 both canopy interception and evapotranspiration show an increasing trend under all future scenarios due to the lai increase caused by the increased precipitation and air temperature in the future 4 4 future changes in flood frequency in this study we model the bivariate joint distribution of flood peak volume combinations based on the copula method and table 3 shows the projected joint return periods of given flood peak volume combinations with 30 year 50 year and 100 year return periods calculated based on the historical period of 1985 2014 a smaller return period indicates that a given flood is more likely to occur with a larger exceedance frequency and vice versa the result shows that the bivariate joint return periods of different flood peak volume combinations decrease gradually under the four future ssp rcp scenarios indicating that the occurrence possibility of floods will increase in the future the comparison of the changes in the return period under different scenarios shows that the floods under ssp370 have the greatest reduction in the return periods and the greatest increase in the flood exceedance frequency while the floods under ssp126 have the smallest reduction in the return periods to identify the relative contribution of climate change and land use change to the flood change the flood return periods under four artificially designed scenarios are also shown in table 3 similar to the analysis of water resources we also choose ssp126 and ssp370 to illustrate the respective impact the results show that in the future period of 2071 2100 the frequency of the historical 100 year flood under n126 increases by 2 12 times compared to that in the historical period while it is amplified by 1 63 times under ssp126 this result indicates that climate change dominates the increase of future flood frequency 2 12 times and continued afforestation under ssp126 will offset the flood frequency increase caused by climate change the flood frequency under n370 increases by 3 17 times and that under ssp370 increases by 4 55 times which also illustrates that climate change plays a dominant role in the increase of flood frequency and that the continued deforestation and cropland expansion will exacerbate future flood risk we select the flood peak volume combination with a 100 year return period based on the historical period as the target and calculate the joint return periods fig 8 from upstream to downstream at 12 stations in the period of 2071 2100 for further detecting the spatial characteristics of the flood frequency changes over the study basin the results also demonstrate that the frequency of future floods will increase significantly under the ssp370 scenario in addition the results also show that the frequency increases along the four tributaries from upstream to downstream which means that the downstream region will face a greater flood risk than the upstream region in the future at the outlet of the study basin c2 station the probability of a historical 100 year flood is projected to increase by approximately 4 5 times at the end of the 21st century under the ssp370 scenario and increase by 1 63 times under the ssp126 scenario 4 5 future changes in drought frequency this study analyzes the bivariate joint distribution of hydrological drought duration severity combinations by the copula method and the results are shown in table 4 and fig 9 similar to the results of the flood frequency analysis table 4 shows the projected return periods of the historical droughts with different magnitudes and fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of the future changes in drought frequency from table 4 it can be derived that the projected return periods decrease gradually under the four future ssp rcp scenarios representing more frequent droughts in the future among the four scenarios ssp370 and ssp245 show greater increases in the occurrence probabilities of future droughts while the situations under ssp126 have relatively less change regarding the relative contribution of climate change and land use change to the drought the result shows that climate change is the major cause of the increase in hydrological drought frequency the spatial distribution of the changes in the drought return periods fig 9 does not show a similar pattern as the changes in future floods overall although the occurrence probability of extreme droughts occurring may be less than that of extreme floods in the future frequent and severe hydrological droughts will be a risk to agriculture and thus food security in the future 5 discussion 5 1 contribution of a more sustainable land use managements in flood mitigation in section 4 4 and section 4 5 we have quantified the effects of future climate and land use changes on floods and droughts on the basis of frequency by comparing the ssp rcp scenarios which combine the future climate forcing data and future land use maps with synthetic analysis which combine the future climate forcing data and historical land use maps the dominated effect of climate change is demonstrated and positive effect of afforestation or more sustainable land use change is illustrated moreover to explore the degree of mitigation of future flood disasters by land use management under high greenhouse gas emissions this study simply designs a scenario combining the projected climate data 2071 2100 under ssp370 and the projected land use under ssp126 that has the highest amount of afforestation the annual mean runoff under the designed scenario has a decrease of 4 8 compared with that under the most rocky road future ssp370 which indicates that afforestation will slightly reduce the streamflow the exceedance frequency of a historical 100 year flood under the newly designed scenario will be decreased by 33 3 compared to that under ssp370 this indicates that the increased risk of floods caused by climate change could be offset to some extent by afforestation or more sustainable land use management although the frequencies of floods still increase considerably compared to those in the historical period 5 2 comparison with previous studies previous studies on the impact of climate change on hydrological processes have illustrated that global warming will lead to more frequent floods and droughts in most parts of the world dai 2012 hirabayashi 2013 while land use change will exacerbate or mitigate water related risks bradshaw et al 2007 takata and hanasaki 2020 thailand suffers a lot from floods and droughts in the past and previous studies consistently reported that there would be an increase in high flows and a decrease in low flows under global warming kiguchi 2021 kotsuki et al 2014 watanabe 2014 in the chao phraya river basin most studies have projected a future increase in peak flows and thus increasing flood risks kiguchi 2021 in this study based on greenhouse gas emission and socioeconomic development combined scenarios developed in cmip6 we found that future precipitation would become more concentrated in the wet season with an increasing precipitation amount and the air temperature would continue rising we found that these changes in climate would dominate the future changes in runoff floods and droughts by altering the hydrological cycle in the study region under future scenarios and population growth also let to future water scarcity which is consistent with previous studies miralles wilhelm 2021 meanwhile land use change can also impact regional hydrological prosses although the impact of land use change is smaller than that of climate change forest degradation will reduce evapotranspiration canopy storage and interception increase infiltration and then lead to the rise of soil water content and groundwater recharge ultimately increasing runoff yang et al 2019b zhang and wei 2012 and exacerbating flood risks bradshaw et al 2007 knighton et al 2019 villarreal rosas et al 2021 large differences in the proportion of forest cover may explain the higher flood risk in the downstream agricultural plains than that in the upper forest cover mountains this study is distinguished from the previous studies in that we reasonably estimated the future land use changes under the coupled greenhouse gas emission and socioeconomic development scenarios in cmip6 and considered future vegetation dynamics in the hydrological projection together with the joint impact of climate and land use changes the projected future trend of water resources flood and drought provided a scientific basis for regional water resources management in the changing environment 5 3 adaptation and mitigation suggestions global climate change mitigation requires international collaboration which is difficult to achieve through efforts from a single local government however greener land use management can be realized by a regional government therefore we propose several corresponding mitigations and adaptation suggestions to face the potential risks of future water scarcity and flood and drought risks first and foremost since climate change dominates future changes in water related disasters mitigation strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and slowing global warming should be urgent priorities this cannot be achieved by efforts from a single country and international cooperation in tackling global climate change is more urgent and important than ever second at the regional scale sustainable water management can mediate or constrain climate goals for both mitigation and adaptation and is also required to adapt to future climate change miralles wilhelm 2021 here we suggest integrated basin management including 1 improving efficiencies in water use and synergy among water using sectors 2 improving the existing reservoir operation to adapt to future hydrological regimes 3 wise land management for mitigating flood and drought risks 4 re evaluate the risk of the future floods to the existing hydrological structures 5 4 uncertainties in this study the physical models mainly include the gbhm and biome bgc models the error from the gbhm model is mainly caused by the uncertainties linked to the meteorological inputs model structure and model parameters li et al 2012 similarly the uncertainties contained in the lai projections by the biome bgc model mainly come from the meteorological inputs model structure and parameter estimation turner et al 2016 limited by the number of meteorological stations the spatial interpolation of climate variables may not fully reflect the real spatial distribution situation which will be solved as a future collection of more observation data the model structures still have uncertainties in describing the real physical processes and this will be gradually improved with future deeper research 6 conclusion this study proposes a framework of future watershed hydrological projection coupling the climate and land use changes and vegetation dynamics in a physically based distributed hydrological simulation and applies it to the upper chao phraya river basin through analysis of the changes in water resources floods and hydrological droughts we derive the following conclusions 1 in the future land use changes have different tendencies under different development pathways by the end of the 21st century under the greenest road ssp126 the forest will increase by 3 2 and the cropland will decrease by 1 0 while the forestland will consistently decrease 5 0 in the 2090 s under the rocky road ssp370 with the cropland continually increasing 3 7 in 2090 s in the study basin 2 the precipitation and air temperature will continue rising in the future under all scenarios with average rising rates from 0 88 mm yr to 2 24 mm yr and from 0 16 10 yr to 0 54 10 yr respectively compared with the annual precipitation and mean air temperature in the historical period the precipitation will increase by 8 6 24 8 and the air temperature will rise by 1 84 4 08 in 2071 2100 3 under the joint impact of climate and land use change the upper chao phraya river basin may face increasing water scarcity more frequent floods and hydrological droughts in the future water scarcity will reach the worst situation in the mid 21st century and then gradually alleviate at the outlet of the study basin the future probability of the historical 100 year flood is projected to increase by 4 55 times by the end 21st century under ssp370 and by 1 63 times under ssp126 the future frequency of the historical 100 year drought will increase by 0 59 times under ssp126 and by 1 5 times under ssp370 by the end 21st century 4 climate change is the major cause of more frequent floods and droughts in the future and the impact of regional land use changes cannot be ignored future continued deforestation and cropland expansion lead to a slight increase in annual mean runoff and exacerbate future flood risks this research is helpful to the local government in managing the future water resources floods and drought in the study basin the projected future trends of water

2061,spur dikes mainly for regulating water flow and protecting river banks in the past were found recently to have the ability to increase the fish physical habitat and improve aquatic system however the effect of spur dikes on aquatic system was generally ignored previously and the studies on the influence of spur dikes on improving specific native fish physical habitat are still rare this study reports a numerical investigation for the effects of spur dikes on the physical habitat and the minimum ecological flow in the jinjiang river three spur dikes are placed along the inner bend in the study reach and two fish species of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco and carps are selected as the target species two dimensional water depth and velocity field are simulated in different discharges and the results are used to predict the corresponding weight use area wua the differences of wua before and after the building of spur dikes for the two selected fish species show that spur dikes have a significant effect on the physical habitats and the minimum ecological flows from the instream flow increment approach are different for the two objective fish species and are also considerably impacted by spur dikes keywords urban rivers spur dike minimum ecological flow weighted usable area numerical simulation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction urban rivers generally have the important function in the supplication for human communities except for sustaining their own ecosystems nevertheless in order to satisfy water using requirement for human being these vulnerable rivers across the core area of cities especially with middle and small discharge have been severely impacted by various human unreasonable activities liao et al 2018 linares et al 2020 feyrer et al 2021 tang et al 2022 aquatic ecosystems in these rivers are destroying and serving abilities for human being are losing since the physical habitat for aquatic life is an important index of ecosystem function for a healthy river the recreating and restoring engineering of the river physical habitat for both the riparian assets and the endangered native fish species through a series of rehabilitating measurement have recently received considerable attentions to the eco hydrological researchers choi choi 2018 seygita et al 2021 roseman et al 2021 wildan et al 2022 thus evaluating the influence of these measurements on fish physical habitats is very essential to advance the knowledge of the internal relations between the physical habitat and the hydraulic characteristics for rehabilitating those impaired urban crossing river ecosystems spur dikes are always used to regulate water flow and protect river bank in river channels the previous studies on spur dikes are more focused on the ability to alter flow pattern and the stability caused by sediment scouring constantinescu et al 2009 uijttewaal et al 2001 chen ikeda 1997 safarzadeh et al 2016 pandey et al 2022 many field test and flume experiments are conducted to reveal scouring mechanics and to investigate the scoring holes around spur dikes pandey et al 2019 gill 1972 otherwise spur dikes fixed on the channel bank can increase water depth and alter velocity filed these varying water depths and diverse flow patterns induced by spur dikes can be benefit to providing various physical habitats for fish species deng et al 2019 peters et al 1998 generally spur dikes will cause sediment to deposit along the banks where they are installed while deepen the main channel near their toes due to local scour quillon dartus 1997 most of these deepening around the toes may affect the ability of spur dikes pandey et al 2022 dehghani et al 2013 gill 1972 however these scouring can be used to create a series of scour holes for improving aquatic habitats by providing low velocity pools where fish can rest and feed shields et al 1995 actually the riffles due to sediment deposited behind spur dikes and the pools due to local scouring around spur dikes have been successfully used to enhance aquatic habitat in those unstable streams shields et al 1995 fukudome 2002 copeland hall 1998 shields et al 1998 found reaches stabilized with stone spurs supported significantly higher densities of large fish and higher levels of fish biomass per unit channel length than reaches with other bank treatments such as longitudinal stone toe and dormant willow posts long term field survey results showed that spur dikes might have adverse effects on the instream biota chang et al 2013 shih et al 2008 thus the usage of spur dikes as a physical habitat restoration measurement should be adequately evaluated to determine their actual impact on the aquatic species habitat previous field tests have proved that spur dikes can improve the physical habitat shields et al 1998 shields et al 1995 knight cooper 1991 however the study on how to quantify the influence of spur dikes on the habitat is still rare many methods have been developed to the effects of river restoration practices aiming to sustain wild fish populations in the evaluation of spawning restoration rehabilitation channel stability and physical habitat quality are the important components brown pasternack 2009 garcia and gortazar 2007 applied a two dimensional hydraulic model to evaluate the effectiveness of habitat enhancements like riffles and pools in natural streams recently physical habitat models are developing constantly and become a key tool in river management for protecting aquatic ecosystem yao chen 2018 armour taylor 1991 bockelmann et al 2004 yi et al 2017 these models are particularly useful for appraising the influence of the building engineering of hydropower projects and water abstractions on native fish habitat in rivers also the physical habitat models can be used to determine the minimum flow requirement of aquatic populations armas vargas et al 2017 shields et al 1997 maddock 1999 parasiewicz 2001 ubertini et al 1996 the physical habitat simulation phabsim model bovee 1986 jowett 1996 nagaya et al 2008 which uses the instream flow incremental mehtodology ifim is the first fish habitat model for assessing habitats other models developed from phabasim include the norwegian river system simulator alfredsen killingtveit 1996 rhyhabsim jowett 1996 and mesohabitat parasiewicz 2001 these models link physical variables to the habitat suitability by means of uni or multivariate preference functions bovee 1982 pasternack et al 2008 two dimensional models river2d have been developed for detailed hydraulic analysis of spatially explicit habitat units at the micro habitat scale steffler waddle 2002 this model can present those key flow features such as water depth and velocities around complex habitat rehabilitating measurements which are used to predict the habitat area these methods have been used to evaluate the physical habitat in natural rivers or the effect of dam construction few are used to quantitatively evaluate the influence of spur dikes on the physical habitat according to these studies though spur dikes have recently been used as a newly rehabilitation measurement to improve river ecological system however the study on the impact of spur dikes on fish habitat is still rare there is still huge knowledge gap on the quantitative effects of spur dikes on the fish habitat most of city crossing rivers have been channelized due to flood controlling and its ecological system gradually deteriorates for human unreasonable activities in order to maintain river ecological function many newly rehabilitation measurements are applied to improve river ecological system not only spur dike can be mainly used as bank protected structures for regulating water flow but also it can produce habitat environment of pools and riffles for the native fishes these diverse abilities yield spur dike as a significant rehabilitation measurement for restoring aquatic ecosystem in city crossing rivers however studies on the influence of spur dikes on the key native fish habitat are still rare and most of spur dike engineering are focused on water flow regulated function therefore the objective of this study is to develop a model to quantitatively evaluate the influence of spur dikes on the river ecosystem including the physical habitat and the minimum ecological flow to reach this object two key native fish species one of which is a native endangered fish pelteobagrus fulvidraco and the other is the dominant species chinese carps were selected as the target fish species and the preferences for these two native fishes were investigated to establish the habitat suitability index hsi these results were used to predict the weighted usable areas wua before and after the building of spur dikes then the influences of spur dikes on the two native fish habitats in the jinjiang river were evaluated also the minimum ecological flows in the study reach were predicted through the instream habitat method and are compared by using several popular methods including the hydrology regime method and the hydraulic method as a new effort this study aims to quantify the impact of spur dikes on the physical habitat and the minimum ecological flows for the selected targeted fish by using hsi methods 2 methods 2 1 study site the study reach is about 1 4 km in the jinjiang river which is located on the middle reach of the minjiang river and runs across the chengdu city in sichuan province of china fig 1 the headwater of the jinjiang river is controlled by the dujiangyan irrigation egineering which is a famous irrigation works built in 2 000 before in china and was listed in the world cultural heritage in 2000 by the united nations education scientific and cultural organization due to water usage of irrigation and urban in the upstream the discharge of the study reach reduces gradually and the average annual discharge is only about 54 1 m3 s water depth in the dry season is less than 0 2 0 3 in the main channel which cannot reach the standard of tourism navigation for the chinese sixth class channel standard in order to restore navigating and travelling in this inner city river a spur dike group including three groins were deployed on the inner bank of the bend in the study reach for regulating water flow and increasing water depth fig 1 besides according to fish field test of the minjiang river a total of 28 fish species lives in the upper reaches of the minjiang river and it is divided into 8 orders 4 families and 16 genera among them there are 17 kind species of cypriniformes which accounts for 60 17 of the total number of fishes the pelteobagrus fulvidraco lives in the study reach and is an endemic and economic fish in the upper reaches of the yangtze river in sichuan and the grass carp which is prevail in the jinjiang river is one of the four unique fish to the yangtze river system xiao et al 2022 however the building of spur dikes will cause the significant change of the fish physical habitat in the study reach and the influence of spur dikes on the hydro ecology should be evaluated 2 2 numerical model a two dimensional depth averaged finite element model river2d which is based on a conservative petrov galerkin up winding method was applied to investigate the variation of the physical habitat area induced by spur dikes the model uses the two dimensional depth averaged saint venant equation to solve the hydrodynamic components these

weighted usable area here the weighted usable area which is the basement for the fish habitat component of the river2d model is used to evaluate the available fish habitats in the study reach bovee 1982 the wua is the amount of physical habitat available for the specific fish species and refers an aggregate of the product of a composite suitability index csi 0 1 1 0 this habitat suitability index is the preferences of the target fish species with regards to flow velocity water depth and channel property and the preference criteria for flow velocity and water depth reflects the assumption that lotic biota distributions certain distribution phases and certain life cycle phases are controlled by the hydraulic conditions within the water column gore hamilton 1996 the wua can be calculated by equation 5 5 wua i 1 n f v i d i c i a i where a i is the stream area of the i th cell the item f v i d i c i is the composite suitability index for a i which is usually a product of the corresponding suitability weights for flow velocity water depth and channel property milhous et al 1989 2 4 the target fish species and habitat suitability index hsi in this study pelteobagrus fulvidraco an endangered fish and carp the dominant species in jinjiang river are selected as the target fish species to evaluate the effects of spur dikes on these two fish physical habitats the method of the habitat suitability index hsi which indicates the suitability of habitats based on a single parameter such as flow velocity water depth and channel substrate was firstly used to research the common carps living in the missouri river edwards twomey 1982 yi et al 2010 and yi et al 2006 used the combined habitat suitability index to investigate the impact of the dams on the habitat suitability of carps in the yangtze river the preferred habitat environment for pelteobagrus fulvidraco is based on fish field surveys and the hsi for flow velocity water depth and channel substrate are from the previous researches in the same basin zhang et al 2016 jing et al 2005 yi et al 2010 fig 2 shows the hsi curves of flow velocity water depth and substrate for pelteobagrus fulvidraco according to fish field test water depth is not a key factor in the reproduction of carps in the jinjiang river however the range of water level rise is the necessary component for carps spawning furthermore a suitable water level fluctuation corresponds to a higher egg production yi et al 2010 2014 song et al 2018 the habitat suitability index hsi of the selected carps is mainly characterized by the range of water level rise flow velocity and water temperature flow velocities are important because carp eggs and fries need a certain ideal velocity which can prevent them from sinking generally the preferred spawning area has flow velocities of 0 25 0 9 m s carp eggs will begin to sink as flow velocities fall below 0 27 m s and when flow velocity is below 0 25 m s most of carp eggs will sink to the channel bottom if flow velocity is lower than 0 1 m s all eggs will deposit previous studies found that spawning action of carps in the jinjiang river starts to occur when water temperature is above18 c the ideal spawning temperature is between 21 0 and 24 0 c fig 3 presents the hsi curves for carps in the study reach yi et al 2010 2014 zhang et al 2021 tang et al 2022 2 5 flow regime of the study reach according to the monitored flow data from the pengshan hydrometric station downstream in the study reach the average annual influx discharge is about 382 m3 s in the wet season it is only 20 m3 s in the dry season and in the normal season this discharge is about 52 m3 s actually the inflow discharge of the study reach is mainly regulated by the dujiangyan irrigation engineering in the upstream for the water balance of irrigation water usage and urban water usage in order to evaluate the effect of spur dikes on the wua for the two target fish species in different flow conditions the discharges in the study reach are set to vary from 0 m3 s to 500 m3 s 3 results 3 1 hydraulic model validation due to the insufficiency of the observed physical habitat data the predicted results from the instream flow increment method in river2d cannot be validated however the consistence between the predicted hydraulic characteristic and the observed can be used to judge the availability of the selected river model fig 4 illustrates the correlation between the simulated and observed data for water depth in the jinjiang river it shows that the simulated water depth fits well with the observed at the 200 measured points in the natural river the root mean square error of water depth is approximately 0 11 m or 3 7 of the maximum observed water depth the arithmetic mean error is 0 29 m or 9 3 of the maximum observed water depth from the root mean square error rmse we can see that the model can simulate the hydraulic characteristics of the study reach very well fig 5 presented the comparison for the measured water depth and the simulated water depth on the three selected cross sections we can see though water depth varies fluctuating in each cross section the simulated water depth captures the variation accurately the data of velocities was not collected in the study reach but the selected hydrodynamic model has been valid in previous studies leclerc et al 1995 3 2 habitat variation of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco with and without spur dikes fig 6 shows the physical habitat distribution of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco with different discharges the his value of 1 0 red color cells represents the cells are suitable for living of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco and the value of 0 0 represents the targeted fish cannot survive in these areas with a lower discharge of 20 m3 s in the dry season only a small and narrow band in the main channel at the reach tail is suitable for the living of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco for deeper water depths and faster flow velocities however after spur dikes are built this band extends greatly upstream to the first spur dike in the main channel with a middle flux of 52 m3 s both of water depth and flow velocity increase in the most channel areas these water flows are more closed to the preferred flow conditions for the pelteobagrus fulvidraco and the physical habitat area increases substantially in the middle and tail area of the study reach after spur dikes are built flow velocities in the areas between two spur dikes are very slow and they are not the preferred flow condition for the pelteobagrus fulvidraco because they often live in a lotic environment but the physical habitat area substantially increases on the area behind the last spur dike because of a significant increasing of water depth and flow velocity when the inflow flux is 382 m3 s in the wet season though water levels are higher no overflow land appears on the two river banks due to river channelization the sharply increasing of water depth in the main channel makes the suitable physical habitat decrease quickly this decreasing also occurs with the building of spur dikes and only a small area behind the last spur dike is suitable for the living of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco in the wet season 3 3 the minimum ecological flow for the pelteobagrus fulvidraco in order to further analyze the influence of spur dikes on the physical habitat area of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco in the whole study reach a series of discharges from 0 to 200 m3 s are selected to predict the habitat before and after the building of spur dikes the relationship between the physical habitat area and the discharge are shown in fig 7 it is obvious that whether spur dikes are built or not the physical habitat area for the objective fish will increase firstly and then decrease with the growing of the discharge before the spur dikes are built when the flux rate is about 90 m3 s the value of the physical habitat area reaches the maximum of 37874 4 m2 which occupies 27 1 of the total physical area however after the spur dikes are built when the flux rate reaches to 50 0 m3 s the maximum value of the habitat area is 24821 8 m2 which is 17 5 of the total physical area generally the discharge for this maximum value is determined as the minimum ecological flow for the target fish in the study channel therefore the minimum ecological flow after the building of spur dikes is less than the value before the building of spur dikes for the selected target fish of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco it is interesting that when the discharge is less than 60 m3 s the physical habitat area with spur dikes increases sharply and is large than those without spur dikes it means in a low flux rate spur dikes can greatly improve the physical habitat area for the target fish of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco in the study reach 3 4 habitat areas for the carps for the dominant fish carp species in the jinjiang river which mainly refers to the grass carp and silver carp their preference factors are water temperature flow velocity and water stage fluctuation yi et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 tang et al 2022 these two carp species are the typical fishes spawning drifting fish eggs spawning activity needs adequate flowing water so that these eggs are able to float and water flow velocities are ought to be faster enough to keep the eggs of these species to suspend and drift during the incubation period song et al 2018 chen et al 2021 additionally the duration of water level rise and daily rise are also the main hydraulic factors for the reproduction of these two carps wang et al 2019 xiao et al 2022 water temperature is important for the carp reproduction and the suitable spawning temperature is between 21 0 c and 24 0 c according to in situ monitoring data from chengdu meteorological bureau air temperature around the study reach is about 13 30 c from april to july due to lower discharges and shallow water depths in the study river water temperature is almost the same with the air temperature which delays not above 1 c therefore in the incubation reason water temperature is suitable to fish reproduction thus flow velocities and water stage fluctuation are the main two key factors for these carp species fig 8 presents the physical habitat area for the target carp with the single velocity suitability in the dry normal and wet season due to a wide range of suitable velocities for the carps before spur dikes are built when the discharge is 20 m3 s in the dry season the physical habitat area is 75176 8 m2 and occupies 53 8 of the total physical area and when the flux rate increases to 52 m3 s in the normal season the proportion is 75 3 in the wet season the discharge is 382 m3 s the proportion decreases to 70 6 however after spur dikes are built the physical habitat area always increases gradually with the increase of the flux rate and the proportion for the three different discharges is 33 3 50 3 and 63 5 respectively it should be noticed that in the same discharge for the single velocity suitability of the targeted fish the physical habitat area before the building of spur dikes is always large than those after the building of spur dikes this is because the selected target fish is more suitable to flowing water however large areas in recirculation zones between spur dikes are almost still water that decreases the suitable physical habitat slightly 3 5 the minimum ecological flow for the single suitable velocity of the carps fig 9 shows the relationship between the physical habitat area and discharge before and after the building of spur dikes with the variation of the flux rate from 0 to 500 m3 s still the physical habitat area will increase firstly and then it will decrease whatever with or without spur dikes the minimum ecological flow is 150 m3 s before the building of spur dikes and after spur dikes are built the minimum ecological flow increases to 300 m3 s though spur dikes have a certain effect on the minimum ecological flow for the target carp in these two flow conditions the values of the minimum ecological flow with or without the spur dikes are far larger than the multi averaged annual flux which is close to 52 0 m3 s in the normal season also when the discharge is less than 100 m3 s the physical habitats with or without spur dikes increase sharply but they grow very slowly when the flux rates are larger than 100 m3 s therefore the altering velocities due to the building of spur dikes improve little the physical habitat of the target carp for a single suitable velocity 3 6 suitable water stage fluctuation previous researches showed in the spawning season the target carp has a higher requirement for water temperature and daily water stage fluctuation ban et al 2019 tang et al 2022 according to the in situ observation monthly mean water temperature in the study reach is about 13 30 c from april to july variation of water temperature in study reach can reach to the essential requirement for the target carp fish reproduction in the upstream of the study reach the dujiangyan irrigation engineering can be used to control the daily discharge flow for constructing water stage fluctuation here in order to evaluate the influence of daily water stage fluctuation on the target carp habitat before and after the building of spur dikes three specific discharges of 20 m3 s 52 m3 s and 382 m3 s are selected which represent the influx of the dry normal and wet period in the study reach based on these specific discharges a five grade of daily discharges with each flux increment of 10 m3 s and the maximum increment is 50 m3 s d are used to simulate the variation of the physical habitat area in different daily water stage fluctuation the habitat areas for the suitable water stage fluctuation are shown in fig 10 when the basic flux rate is 20 m3 s the habitat areas for the water stage fluctuation will increase firstly and then decrease both with the spur dikes and without spur dikes and when the increment discharge is 30 m3 s the physical habitat areas reach to the maximum value of the habitat is 122751 9 m2 before the building of spur dikes and the maximum value is 113178 3 m2 after the building of spur dikes though spur dikes slightly decrease the maximum physical habitat for water stage fluctuation the physical habitat areas after the building of spur dikes are always a bit larger than those without spur dikes when the daily increment flux is less than 20 m3 s in the normal season with a basic flux rate of 52 m3 s the habitat areas of the daily water stage fluctuation still increase firstly and then decrease slowly both with and without spur dikes for the increment discharges when the increment discharge is 30 m3 s the physical habitat area before the building of spur dikes reaches to the maximum value of 125923 6 m2 which is slightly larger than the maximum value of 120795 7 m2 after the building of spur dikes when the daily increment of flux is 30 m3 s however when the increment flux is less than 30 m3 s the habitat areas for the target carps with spur dikes are larger than those without spur dikes when the basic flux is 382 m3 s in the wet season whatever the spur dikes built or not with the increasing of the daily increment flux the physical habitat areas increase accordingly and the physical area after the building of spur dikes is slightly larger than that before the building of spur dikes 3 7 methods for the minimum ecological flow in the study reach many methods such as the 7q10 method the tennant methods the r2 cross methods and the wetted perimeter method have been used to predict the minimum ecological flow successfully caissie et al 1998 tennant 1976 bartschi 1976 here these methods also including the instream flow increment method are used to evaluate the effect of spur dikes on the minimum ecological flow in the study reach the 7q10 method applies the average water quantity of the 7 days of the minimum guarantee rate of 90 days as the design value of the minimum ecological flow of the river caissie et al 1998 according to the measured data of hydrologic station the minimum ecological flow is determined as 33 35 m3 s the tennant method applies the percentage of the multi average flow to describe the state of the instream flow and this judgment criterion is more suitable to the middle and small rivers tennant 1976 the results from the tennant method show that in order to reach the ecological requirement of the river the minimum ecological flow is 32 9 m3 s in the r2 cross method the main ecological function of the river flux is maintaining the river habitat especial for shoal habitat so this method applies some indexes such as width depth velocity and wet rate to evaluate the protection of river habitat mosely 1982 three cross sections before and after the deployment of spur dikes are selected and used to predict the minimum ecological flow table 1 before spur dikes are built the averaged minimum ecological is 30 2 m3 s however after the building of spur dikes the average value reduces to 21 5 m3 s the wet perimeter method is based on the assumption of protecting the wet perimeter of the critical zone for aquatic habitat bartschi 1976 this method uses the wet perimeter as the quality index of the habitat and determines the minimum ecological flow according to the break point of the curve which maps the relationship between the wet perimeter of the critical habitat area usually the majority of the shoal and the discharge though the wet perimeter method is used widely for estimating the minimum ecological flow there are still no convenient and effective means for selecting the break point of the mapping curve here the method provided by gippel and stewardson was used to determine the break point gippel stewardson 1998 the minimum ecological flows from this method in the three different cross sections are listed in table 2 the simulated results show the minimum ecological flow is 49 0 m3 s before the building of spur dikes and when the spur dikes are built the minimum ecological flow decreases to 25 9 m3 s through the relationship between the physical habitat area and discharge the flux rate which produces the maximum habitat area is the minimum ecological flow from the method of the instream flow increment methodology thus the minimum ecological flow affected by the building of spur dikes can be determined by this method according to our results for the dangerous fish species of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco the predicted minimum ecological flow is 90 m3 s before the building of spur dikes however the value decreases to 50 m3 s after the building of spur dikes for the dominant species of carps the minimum ecological flow with a single velocity suitability is 150 m3 s before the building of spur dikes and it increases to 300 m3 s after the building of spur dikes when the discharge is 50 m3 s the target carp physical habitat area occupies 76 3 of the total physical area before the building of spur dikes and it can reach to 52 1 after the building of spur dikes thus in normal season there are enough suitable velocity environments for the target carp and water stage fluctuation becomes the most important factor for carp reproduction from this point of view the minimum ecological flow in the study reach can be determined to be 50 m3 s after spur dikes are built 4 discussions 4 1 influences of spur dikes on habitat for the two target fishes spur dikes can alter water flow and provide diverse pool riffle hydraulic environment for native fish living shields et al 1995 however whether these environments forming from spur dikes are suitable or not to be the fish habitat are closely related to the target fish preference shih et al 2008 applied the habitat suitability curves hscs method to evaluate the habitat improvement efficiency on constructed spur dikes for the fish habitat area of varicorhinus barbatulus and hemimyzon formosanum and found both of ecology demands for fish and safety requirement of engineering can be looked after when spur dikes were built but the habitat quality and availability might be overestimated if the channel bed changes over time chang et al 2013 also li 2001 observed the diversity of habitats afforded by spur dikes was greater than the continuous revetment but less than the natural banks they found larval fish were presented at spur dike stabilized sites but the larval fish densities were lower at continuous riprap revetment on the other hand they reported that juvenile cutthroat was absent from spur dikes but presented at the continuous riprap revetment these results shows that the improving efficiency of spur dikes on the fish habitat should be evaluated according to the requirement of fish living in the study reach according to our investigation there are two important fish species in the study reach one is a dangerous fish species named pelteobagrus fulvidraco and the other is the dominant fish species of carps including silver and grass carps field survey shows that pelteobagrus fulvidraco likes to live in the flowing water with shallower water depths and faster velocities however carps like to spawn in a higher water stage increment these differences are also presented in their his curves the prefer velocity ranges of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco are larger than those of the carps and water level fluctuation caused by the variation of the daily discharge will impact the prefer of carps for the dangerous fish of pelteobagrus fulvidraco with a middle and low flux the building of spur dikes increase flow velocity and water depth in the main channel thus the physical habitat areas increase significantly because pelteobagrus fulvidraco likes flowing water but for the dominant fish of carps large areas of recirculation zone developed between spur dikes have smaller flow velocities and are not suitable to carp reproduction then the physical habitat areas for the carps after the building of spur dikes decrease accordingly it can be seen that the building of spur dikes can increase water depth and flow velocity in the main channel and is benefit to diverse fish physical habitats with stagger pool and riffle however each objective fish species might have its own preference for instance some fish species like to live in the still water but others love to the flowing water yi et al 2010 wan et al 2021 some may only live in the shallow water but others will be more suitable to the deep water so whether spur dikes can improve fish physical habitat area and thereby achieve to the requirement of ecological restoration or not need to be determined by combining with the specific fish preferences for the important target fish species in the study reach our results only concern the impact of water depth flow velocity and temperature on the habitat however long terms working for spur dikes will cause sediment deposit heavily between spur dikes and this will change the fish habitat tremendously also these influences may be a long term process chang et al 2013 previous studies showed that turbulence structure will also impact fish swimming behavior liao 2007 liao et al 2003 our model is only two dimensional for the simulation of water depth and flow velocity and cannot present the details of turbulence flow structure therefore the detailed influences of turbulence are not discussed here 4 2 determination of the minimum ecological flow the minimum ecological flows predicted by several prevail methods which include the hydrology method the hydraulic method and the physical habitat method before and after the building of spur dikes are presented in table 3 because the 7q10 method and the tennant method are only related to the statistical flow data in the study reach the minimum ecological flow predicted by these two methods have nothing to do with the building of spur dikes and the values of the minimum ecological flows from these two methods are very close for the method of r2 cross there is a discrepancy of 10 0 m3 s for the minimum ecological flow before and after the construction of spur dikes and by using the method of the wetted perimeter the difference of the minimum ecological flow between with and without spur dikes is 23 0 m3 s when the r2 cross method and the wetted perimeter are applied if the selected calculating cross sections do not have spur dikes spur dikes will have no effect on the minimum ecological flow in the whole reach however if the selected predicting cross sections are located on the spur dikes the results may probably ignore the influence of some important river features on the other cross sections for the whole reach the method of the instream flow increment utilizes the distribution of water depth and flow velocity in the whole study reach which may be changed locally by spur dikes thus the minimum ecological flow in the study reach will vary after spur dikes are built here the minimum ecological flow is 90 m3 s before the spur dikes are built and it is 50 m3 s after the building of spur dikes otherwise because the instream flow increment method is based on the preference of the selected objective fish species the minimum ecological flow will be influenced greatly by the preference curve for different targeted fish species after all different fish species have different habitat suitable index 4 3 operation on water stage fluctuation the selected target fish has a preference on daily water stage fluctuation in the study reach and according to our results a daily discharge increment will increase water level and improve the targeted fish habitat wonderfully an increment of 30 m3 s is enough to provide the appropriate variation of water level for fish habitats the increment discharge can be regulated because the influx of the study reach is controlled by the dujiangyan irrigation engineering which is located on the upstream of the jinjiang river and its main ability is to provide irrigation water for the dujiangyan city previous studies have showed that artificial floods released from the reservoir can sustain fish population on a healthy level ban et al 2019 dixon et al 2015 lima et al 2017 actually artificial water level fluctuations have been used to promoting fish spawning in the ecological regulation tang et al 2022 ban et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 yi et al 2010 the dominant fish species of carps in the study reach has a preference of water stage fluctuation in spawning periods tang et al 2022 xiao et al 2022 according to our results in order to boost the carp reproduction a nearly more 30 m3 s daily flux rate should be released from the upstream for fabricating a suitable water stage fluctuation 5 conclusions a two dimensional hydrodynamic model coupled with the his curves river 2d was applied to evaluate the influence of spur dikes on the physical habitat for the selected objected fish species of pelteobagrus fulvidraco and carps in the jinjiang river 1 spur dikes can improve physical habitat through locally increasing water depth and flow velocity and fabricating stagger pool and riffle environment however fish species have different preferences and habitat suitable indexes for hydraulic characteristics thus the ability of spur dikes for ecological restoration should be determined according to the suitable index curve for the most important indicated fish species in the study reach 2 the building of spur dikes changes water flow condition and provides diverse habitat for fish species thus it can reduce the requirement of the minimum ecological flow for protecting the specific objective fish species in the study reach 3 from the simulated results after improvement of physical habitats by the building of spur dikes the minimum ecological flow should no less than 50 m3 s in the study reach however due to water requirement of irrigation in dry season the discharge from upstream in the jinjiang river even cannot reach to 30 m3 s in order to protect the fish species of pelteobagrus fulvidraco in the river the upstream dujiangyan irrigation engineering should release a discharge no less than 50 m3 s in the whole year 4 because water level fluctuation is a key eco factor for the reproduction of the dominant carp fishes in the study reach a more than 30 m3 s daily flux rate should be discharged from the dujiangyan irrigation in the reproduction period for the carps these more fluxes every day can create enough water fluctuation to reach a suitable water level fluctuation for carp spawning funding this work was supported by the national key r d program of

2061,spur dikes mainly for regulating water flow and protecting river banks in the past were found recently to have the ability to increase the fish physical habitat and improve aquatic system however the effect of spur dikes on aquatic system was generally ignored previously and the studies on the influence of spur dikes on improving specific native fish physical habitat are still rare this study reports a numerical investigation for the effects of spur dikes on the physical habitat and the minimum ecological flow in the jinjiang river three spur dikes are placed along the inner bend in the study reach and two fish species of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco and carps are selected as the target species two dimensional water depth and velocity field are simulated in different discharges and the results are used to predict the corresponding weight use area wua the differences of wua before and after the building of spur dikes for the two selected fish species show that spur dikes have a significant effect on the physical habitats and the minimum ecological flows from the instream flow increment approach are different for the two objective fish species and are also considerably impacted by spur dikes keywords urban rivers spur dike minimum ecological flow weighted usable area numerical simulation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction urban rivers generally have the important function in the supplication for human communities except for sustaining their own ecosystems nevertheless in order to satisfy water using requirement for human being these vulnerable rivers across the core area of cities especially with middle and small discharge have been severely impacted by various human unreasonable activities liao et al 2018 linares et al 2020 feyrer et al 2021 tang et al 2022 aquatic ecosystems in these rivers are destroying and serving abilities for human being are losing since the physical habitat for aquatic life is an important index of ecosystem function for a healthy river the recreating and restoring engineering of the river physical habitat for both the riparian assets and the endangered native fish species through a series of rehabilitating measurement have recently received considerable attentions to the eco hydrological researchers choi choi 2018 seygita et al 2021 roseman et al 2021 wildan et al 2022 thus evaluating the influence of these measurements on fish physical habitats is very essential to advance the knowledge of the internal relations between the physical habitat and the hydraulic characteristics for rehabilitating those impaired urban crossing river ecosystems spur dikes are always used to regulate water flow and protect river bank in river channels the previous studies on spur dikes are more focused on the ability to alter flow pattern and the stability caused by sediment scouring constantinescu et al 2009 uijttewaal et al 2001 chen ikeda 1997 safarzadeh et al 2016 pandey et al 2022 many field test and flume experiments are conducted to reveal scouring mechanics and to investigate the scoring holes around spur dikes pandey et al 2019 gill 1972 otherwise spur dikes fixed on the channel bank can increase water depth and alter velocity filed these varying water depths and diverse flow patterns induced by spur dikes can be benefit to providing various physical habitats for fish species deng et al 2019 peters et al 1998 generally spur dikes will cause sediment to deposit along the banks where they are installed while deepen the main channel near their toes due to local scour quillon dartus 1997 most of these deepening around the toes may affect the ability of spur dikes pandey et al 2022 dehghani et al 2013 gill 1972 however these scouring can be used to create a series of scour holes for improving aquatic habitats by providing low velocity pools where fish can rest and feed shields et al 1995 actually the riffles due to sediment deposited behind spur dikes and the pools due to local scouring around spur dikes have been successfully used to enhance aquatic habitat in those unstable streams shields et al 1995 fukudome 2002 copeland hall 1998 shields et al 1998 found reaches stabilized with stone spurs supported significantly higher densities of large fish and higher levels of fish biomass per unit channel length than reaches with other bank treatments such as longitudinal stone toe and dormant willow posts long term field survey results showed that spur dikes might have adverse effects on the instream biota chang et al 2013 shih et al 2008 thus the usage of spur dikes as a physical habitat restoration measurement should be adequately evaluated to determine their actual impact on the aquatic species habitat previous field tests have proved that spur dikes can improve the physical habitat shields et al 1998 shields et al 1995 knight cooper 1991 however the study on how to quantify the influence of spur dikes on the habitat is still rare many methods have been developed to the effects of river restoration practices aiming to sustain wild fish populations in the evaluation of spawning restoration rehabilitation channel stability and physical habitat quality are the important components brown pasternack 2009 garcia and gortazar 2007 applied a two dimensional hydraulic model to evaluate the effectiveness of habitat enhancements like riffles and pools in natural streams recently physical habitat models are developing constantly and become a key tool in river management for protecting aquatic ecosystem yao chen 2018 armour taylor 1991 bockelmann et al 2004 yi et al 2017 these models are particularly useful for appraising the influence of the building engineering of hydropower projects and water abstractions on native fish habitat in rivers also the physical habitat models can be used to determine the minimum flow requirement of aquatic populations armas vargas et al 2017 shields et al 1997 maddock 1999 parasiewicz 2001 ubertini et al 1996 the physical habitat simulation phabsim model bovee 1986 jowett 1996 nagaya et al 2008 which uses the instream flow incremental mehtodology ifim is the first fish habitat model for assessing habitats other models developed from phabasim include the norwegian river system simulator alfredsen killingtveit 1996 rhyhabsim jowett 1996 and mesohabitat parasiewicz 2001 these models link physical variables to the habitat suitability by means of uni or multivariate preference functions bovee 1982 pasternack et al 2008 two dimensional models river2d have been developed for detailed hydraulic analysis of spatially explicit habitat units at the micro habitat scale steffler waddle 2002 this model can present those key flow features such as water depth and velocities around complex habitat rehabilitating measurements which are used to predict the habitat area these methods have been used to evaluate the physical habitat in natural rivers or the effect of dam construction few are used to quantitatively evaluate the influence of spur dikes on the physical habitat according to these studies though spur dikes have recently been used as a newly rehabilitation measurement to improve river ecological system however the study on the impact of spur dikes on fish habitat is still rare there is still huge knowledge gap on the quantitative effects of spur dikes on the fish habitat most of city crossing rivers have been channelized due to flood controlling and its ecological system gradually deteriorates for human unreasonable activities in order to maintain river ecological function many newly rehabilitation measurements are applied to improve river ecological system not only spur dike can be mainly used as bank protected structures for regulating water flow but also it can produce habitat environment of pools and riffles for the native fishes these diverse abilities yield spur dike as a significant rehabilitation measurement for restoring aquatic ecosystem in city crossing rivers however studies on the influence of spur dikes on the key native fish habitat are still rare and most of spur dike engineering are focused on water flow regulated function therefore the objective of this study is to develop a model to quantitatively evaluate the influence of spur dikes on the river ecosystem including the physical habitat and the minimum ecological flow to reach this object two key native fish species one of which is a native endangered fish pelteobagrus fulvidraco and the other is the dominant species chinese carps were selected as the target fish species and the preferences for these two native fishes were investigated to establish the habitat suitability index hsi these results were used to predict the weighted usable areas wua before and after the building of spur dikes then the influences of spur dikes on the two native fish habitats in the jinjiang river were evaluated also the minimum ecological flows in the study reach were predicted through the instream habitat method and are compared by using several popular methods including the hydrology regime method and the hydraulic method as a new effort this study aims to quantify the impact of spur dikes on the physical habitat and the minimum ecological flows for the selected targeted fish by using hsi methods 2 methods 2 1 study site the study reach is about 1 4 km in the jinjiang river which is located on the middle reach of the minjiang river and runs across the chengdu city in sichuan province of china fig 1 the headwater of the jinjiang river is controlled by the dujiangyan irrigation egineering which is a famous irrigation works built in 2 000 before in china and was listed in the world cultural heritage in 2000 by the united nations education scientific and cultural organization due to water usage of irrigation and urban in the upstream the discharge of the study reach reduces gradually and the average annual discharge is only about 54 1 m3 s water depth in the dry season is less than 0 2 0 3 in the main channel which cannot reach the standard of tourism navigation for the chinese sixth class channel standard in order to restore navigating and travelling in this inner city river a spur dike group including three groins were deployed on the inner bank of the bend in the study reach for regulating water flow and increasing water depth fig 1 besides according to fish field test of the minjiang river a total of 28 fish species lives in the upper reaches of the minjiang river and it is divided into 8 orders 4 families and 16 genera among them there are 17 kind species of cypriniformes which accounts for 60 17 of the total number of fishes the pelteobagrus fulvidraco lives in the study reach and is an endemic and economic fish in the upper reaches of the yangtze river in sichuan and the grass carp which is prevail in the jinjiang river is one of the four unique fish to the yangtze river system xiao et al 2022 however the building of spur dikes will cause the significant change of the fish physical habitat in the study reach and the influence of spur dikes on the hydro ecology should be evaluated 2 2 numerical model a two dimensional depth averaged finite element model river2d which is based on a conservative petrov galerkin up winding method was applied to investigate the variation of the physical habitat area induced by spur dikes the model uses the two dimensional depth averaged saint venant equation to solve the hydrodynamic components these

weighted usable area here the weighted usable area which is the basement for the fish habitat component of the river2d model is used to evaluate the available fish habitats in the study reach bovee 1982 the wua is the amount of physical habitat available for the specific fish species and refers an aggregate of the product of a composite suitability index csi 0 1 1 0 this habitat suitability index is the preferences of the target fish species with regards to flow velocity water depth and channel property and the preference criteria for flow velocity and water depth reflects the assumption that lotic biota distributions certain distribution phases and certain life cycle phases are controlled by the hydraulic conditions within the water column gore hamilton 1996 the wua can be calculated by equation 5 5 wua i 1 n f v i d i c i a i where a i is the stream area of the i th cell the item f v i d i c i is the composite suitability index for a i which is usually a product of the corresponding suitability weights for flow velocity water depth and channel property milhous et al 1989 2 4 the target fish species and habitat suitability index hsi in this study pelteobagrus fulvidraco an endangered fish and carp the dominant species in jinjiang river are selected as the target fish species to evaluate the effects of spur dikes on these two fish physical habitats the method of the habitat suitability index hsi which indicates the suitability of habitats based on a single parameter such as flow velocity water depth and channel substrate was firstly used to research the common carps living in the missouri river edwards twomey 1982 yi et al 2010 and yi et al 2006 used the combined habitat suitability index to investigate the impact of the dams on the habitat suitability of carps in the yangtze river the preferred habitat environment for pelteobagrus fulvidraco is based on fish field surveys and the hsi for flow velocity water depth and channel substrate are from the previous researches in the same basin zhang et al 2016 jing et al 2005 yi et al 2010 fig 2 shows the hsi curves of flow velocity water depth and substrate for pelteobagrus fulvidraco according to fish field test water depth is not a key factor in the reproduction of carps in the jinjiang river however the range of water level rise is the necessary component for carps spawning furthermore a suitable water level fluctuation corresponds to a higher egg production yi et al 2010 2014 song et al 2018 the habitat suitability index hsi of the selected carps is mainly characterized by the range of water level rise flow velocity and water temperature flow velocities are important because carp eggs and fries need a certain ideal velocity which can prevent them from sinking generally the preferred spawning area has flow velocities of 0 25 0 9 m s carp eggs will begin to sink as flow velocities fall below 0 27 m s and when flow velocity is below 0 25 m s most of carp eggs will sink to the channel bottom if flow velocity is lower than 0 1 m s all eggs will deposit previous studies found that spawning action of carps in the jinjiang river starts to occur when water temperature is above18 c the ideal spawning temperature is between 21 0 and 24 0 c fig 3 presents the hsi curves for carps in the study reach yi et al 2010 2014 zhang et al 2021 tang et al 2022 2 5 flow regime of the study reach according to the monitored flow data from the pengshan hydrometric station downstream in the study reach the average annual influx discharge is about 382 m3 s in the wet season it is only 20 m3 s in the dry season and in the normal season this discharge is about 52 m3 s actually the inflow discharge of the study reach is mainly regulated by the dujiangyan irrigation engineering in the upstream for the water balance of irrigation water usage and urban water usage in order to evaluate the effect of spur dikes on the wua for the two target fish species in different flow conditions the discharges in the study reach are set to vary from 0 m3 s to 500 m3 s 3 results 3 1 hydraulic model validation due to the insufficiency of the observed physical habitat data the predicted results from the instream flow increment method in river2d cannot be validated however the consistence between the predicted hydraulic characteristic and the observed can be used to judge the availability of the selected river model fig 4 illustrates the correlation between the simulated and observed data for water depth in the jinjiang river it shows that the simulated water depth fits well with the observed at the 200 measured points in the natural river the root mean square error of water depth is approximately 0 11 m or 3 7 of the maximum observed water depth the arithmetic mean error is 0 29 m or 9 3 of the maximum observed water depth from the root mean square error rmse we can see that the model can simulate the hydraulic characteristics of the study reach very well fig 5 presented the comparison for the measured water depth and the simulated water depth on the three selected cross sections we can see though water depth varies fluctuating in each cross section the simulated water depth captures the variation accurately the data of velocities was not collected in the study reach but the selected hydrodynamic model has been valid in previous studies leclerc et al 1995 3 2 habitat variation of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco with and without spur dikes fig 6 shows the physical habitat distribution of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco with different discharges the his value of 1 0 red color cells represents the cells are suitable for living of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco and the value of 0 0 represents the targeted fish cannot survive in these areas with a lower discharge of 20 m3 s in the dry season only a small and narrow band in the main channel at the reach tail is suitable for the living of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco for deeper water depths and faster flow velocities however after spur dikes are built this band extends greatly upstream to the first spur dike in the main channel with a middle flux of 52 m3 s both of water depth and flow velocity increase in the most channel areas these water flows are more closed to the preferred flow conditions for the pelteobagrus fulvidraco and the physical habitat area increases substantially in the middle and tail area of the study reach after spur dikes are built flow velocities in the areas between two spur dikes are very slow and they are not the preferred flow condition for the pelteobagrus fulvidraco because they often live in a lotic environment but the physical habitat area substantially increases on the area behind the last spur dike because of a significant increasing of water depth and flow velocity when the inflow flux is 382 m3 s in the wet season though water levels are higher no overflow land appears on the two river banks due to river channelization the sharply increasing of water depth in the main channel makes the suitable physical habitat decrease quickly this decreasing also occurs with the building of spur dikes and only a small area behind the last spur dike is suitable for the living of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco in the wet season 3 3 the minimum ecological flow for the pelteobagrus fulvidraco in order to further analyze the influence of spur dikes on the physical habitat area of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco in the whole study reach a series of discharges from 0 to 200 m3 s are selected to predict the habitat before and after the building of spur dikes the relationship between the physical habitat area and the discharge are shown in fig 7 it is obvious that whether spur dikes are built or not the physical habitat area for the objective fish will increase firstly and then decrease with the growing of the discharge before the spur dikes are built when the flux rate is about 90 m3 s the value of the physical habitat area reaches the maximum of 37874 4 m2 which occupies 27 1 of the total physical area however after the spur dikes are built when the flux rate reaches to 50 0 m3 s the maximum value of the habitat area is 24821 8 m2 which is 17 5 of the total physical area generally the discharge for this maximum value is determined as the minimum ecological flow for the target fish in the study channel therefore the minimum ecological flow after the building of spur dikes is less than the value before the building of spur dikes for the selected target fish of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco it is interesting that when the discharge is less than 60 m3 s the physical habitat area with spur dikes increases sharply and is large than those without spur dikes it means in a low flux rate spur dikes can greatly improve the physical habitat area for the target fish of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco in the study reach 3 4 habitat areas for the carps for the dominant fish carp species in the jinjiang river which mainly refers to the grass carp and silver carp their preference factors are water temperature flow velocity and water stage fluctuation yi et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 tang et al 2022 these two carp species are the typical fishes spawning drifting fish eggs spawning activity needs adequate flowing water so that these eggs are able to float and water flow velocities are ought to be faster enough to keep the eggs of these species to suspend and drift during the incubation period song et al 2018 chen et al 2021 additionally the duration of water level rise and daily rise are also the main hydraulic factors for the reproduction of these two carps wang et al 2019 xiao et al 2022 water temperature is important for the carp reproduction and the suitable spawning temperature is between 21 0 c and 24 0 c according to in situ monitoring data from chengdu meteorological bureau air temperature around the study reach is about 13 30 c from april to july due to lower discharges and shallow water depths in the study river water temperature is almost the same with the air temperature which delays not above 1 c therefore in the incubation reason water temperature is suitable to fish reproduction thus flow velocities and water stage fluctuation are the main two key factors for these carp species fig 8 presents the physical habitat area for the target carp with the single velocity suitability in the dry normal and wet season due to a wide range of suitable velocities for the carps before spur dikes are built when the discharge is 20 m3 s in the dry season the physical habitat area is 75176 8 m2 and occupies 53 8 of the total physical area and when the flux rate increases to 52 m3 s in the normal season the proportion is 75 3 in the wet season the discharge is 382 m3 s the proportion decreases to 70 6 however after spur dikes are built the physical habitat area always increases gradually with the increase of the flux rate and the proportion for the three different discharges is 33 3 50 3 and 63 5 respectively it should be noticed that in the same discharge for the single velocity suitability of the targeted fish the physical habitat area before the building of spur dikes is always large than those after the building of spur dikes this is because the selected target fish is more suitable to flowing water however large areas in recirculation zones between spur dikes are almost still water that decreases the suitable physical habitat slightly 3 5 the minimum ecological flow for the single suitable velocity of the carps fig 9 shows the relationship between the physical habitat area and discharge before and after the building of spur dikes with the variation of the flux rate from 0 to 500 m3 s still the physical habitat area will increase firstly and then it will decrease whatever with or without spur dikes the minimum ecological flow is 150 m3 s before the building of spur dikes and after spur dikes are built the minimum ecological flow increases to 300 m3 s though spur dikes have a certain effect on the minimum ecological flow for the target carp in these two flow conditions the values of the minimum ecological flow with or without the spur dikes are far larger than the multi averaged annual flux which is close to 52 0 m3 s in the normal season also when the discharge is less than 100 m3 s the physical habitats with or without spur dikes increase sharply but they grow very slowly when the flux rates are larger than 100 m3 s therefore the altering velocities due to the building of spur dikes improve little the physical habitat of the target carp for a single suitable velocity 3 6 suitable water stage fluctuation previous researches showed in the spawning season the target carp has a higher requirement for water temperature and daily water stage fluctuation ban et al 2019 tang et al 2022 according to the in situ observation monthly mean water temperature in the study reach is about 13 30 c from april to july variation of water temperature in study reach can reach to the essential requirement for the target carp fish reproduction in the upstream of the study reach the dujiangyan irrigation engineering can be used to control the daily discharge flow for constructing water stage fluctuation here in order to evaluate the influence of daily water stage fluctuation on the target carp habitat before and after the building of spur dikes three specific discharges of 20 m3 s 52 m3 s and 382 m3 s are selected which represent the influx of the dry normal and wet period in the study reach based on these specific discharges a five grade of daily discharges with each flux increment of 10 m3 s and the maximum increment is 50 m3 s d are used to simulate the variation of the physical habitat area in different daily water stage fluctuation the habitat areas for the suitable water stage fluctuation are shown in fig 10 when the basic flux rate is 20 m3 s the habitat areas for the water stage fluctuation will increase firstly and then decrease both with the spur dikes and without spur dikes and when the increment discharge is 30 m3 s the physical habitat areas reach to the maximum value of the habitat is 122751 9 m2 before the building of spur dikes and the maximum value is 113178 3 m2 after the building of spur dikes though spur dikes slightly decrease the maximum physical habitat for water stage fluctuation the physical habitat areas after the building of spur dikes are always a bit larger than those without spur dikes when the daily increment flux is less than 20 m3 s in the normal season with a basic flux rate of 52 m3 s the habitat areas of the daily water stage fluctuation still increase firstly and then decrease slowly both with and without spur dikes for the increment discharges when the increment discharge is 30 m3 s the physical habitat area before the building of spur dikes reaches to the maximum value of 125923 6 m2 which is slightly larger than the maximum value of 120795 7 m2 after the building of spur dikes when the daily increment of flux is 30 m3 s however when the increment flux is less than 30 m3 s the habitat areas for the target carps with spur dikes are larger than those without spur dikes when the basic flux is 382 m3 s in the wet season whatever the spur dikes built or not with the increasing of the daily increment flux the physical habitat areas increase accordingly and the physical area after the building of spur dikes is slightly larger than that before the building of spur dikes 3 7 methods for the minimum ecological flow in the study reach many methods such as the 7q10 method the tennant methods the r2 cross methods and the wetted perimeter method have been used to predict the minimum ecological flow successfully caissie et al 1998 tennant 1976 bartschi 1976 here these methods also including the instream flow increment method are used to evaluate the effect of spur dikes on the minimum ecological flow in the study reach the 7q10 method applies the average water quantity of the 7 days of the minimum guarantee rate of 90 days as the design value of the minimum ecological flow of the river caissie et al 1998 according to the measured data of hydrologic station the minimum ecological flow is determined as 33 35 m3 s the tennant method applies the percentage of the multi average flow to describe the state of the instream flow and this judgment criterion is more suitable to the middle and small rivers tennant 1976 the results from the tennant method show that in order to reach the ecological requirement of the river the minimum ecological flow is 32 9 m3 s in the r2 cross method the main ecological function of the river flux is maintaining the river habitat especial for shoal habitat so this method applies some indexes such as width depth velocity and wet rate to evaluate the protection of river habitat mosely 1982 three cross sections before and after the deployment of spur dikes are selected and used to predict the minimum ecological flow table 1 before spur dikes are built the averaged minimum ecological is 30 2 m3 s however after the building of spur dikes the average value reduces to 21 5 m3 s the wet perimeter method is based on the assumption of protecting the wet perimeter of the critical zone for aquatic habitat bartschi 1976 this method uses the wet perimeter as the quality index of the habitat and determines the minimum ecological flow according to the break point of the curve which maps the relationship between the wet perimeter of the critical habitat area usually the majority of the shoal and the discharge though the wet perimeter method is used widely for estimating the minimum ecological flow there are still no convenient and effective means for selecting the break point of the mapping curve here the method provided by gippel and stewardson was used to determine the break point gippel stewardson 1998 the minimum ecological flows from this method in the three different cross sections are listed in table 2 the simulated results show the minimum ecological flow is 49 0 m3 s before the building of spur dikes and when the spur dikes are built the minimum ecological flow decreases to 25 9 m3 s through the relationship between the physical habitat area and discharge the flux rate which produces the maximum habitat area is the minimum ecological flow from the method of the instream flow increment methodology thus the minimum ecological flow affected by the building of spur dikes can be determined by this method according to our results for the dangerous fish species of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco the predicted minimum ecological flow is 90 m3 s before the building of spur dikes however the value decreases to 50 m3 s after the building of spur dikes for the dominant species of carps the minimum ecological flow with a single velocity suitability is 150 m3 s before the building of spur dikes and it increases to 300 m3 s after the building of spur dikes when the discharge is 50 m3 s the target carp physical habitat area occupies 76 3 of the total physical area before the building of spur dikes and it can reach to 52 1 after the building of spur dikes thus in normal season there are enough suitable velocity environments for the target carp and water stage fluctuation becomes the most important factor for carp reproduction from this point of view the minimum ecological flow in the study reach can be determined to be 50 m3 s after spur dikes are built 4 discussions 4 1 influences of spur dikes on habitat for the two target fishes spur dikes can alter water flow and provide diverse pool riffle hydraulic environment for native fish living shields et al 1995 however whether these environments forming from spur dikes are suitable or not to be the fish habitat are closely related to the target fish preference shih et al 2008 applied the habitat suitability curves hscs method to evaluate the habitat improvement efficiency on constructed spur dikes for the fish habitat area of varicorhinus barbatulus and hemimyzon formosanum and found both of ecology demands for fish and safety requirement of engineering can be looked after when spur dikes were built but the habitat quality and availability might be overestimated if the channel bed changes over time chang et al 2013 also li 2001 observed the diversity of habitats afforded by spur dikes was greater than the continuous revetment but less than the natural banks they found larval fish were presented at spur dike stabilized sites but the larval fish densities were lower at continuous riprap revetment on the other hand they reported that juvenile cutthroat was absent from spur dikes but presented at the continuous riprap revetment these results shows that the improving efficiency of spur dikes on the fish habitat should be evaluated according to the requirement of fish living in the study reach according to our investigation there are two important fish species in the study reach one is a dangerous fish species named pelteobagrus fulvidraco and the other is the dominant fish species of carps including silver and grass carps field survey shows that pelteobagrus fulvidraco likes to live in the flowing water with shallower water depths and faster velocities however carps like to spawn in a higher water stage increment these differences are also presented in their his curves the prefer velocity ranges of the pelteobagrus fulvidraco are larger than those of the carps and water level fluctuation caused by the variation of the daily discharge will impact the prefer of carps for the dangerous fish of pelteobagrus fulvidraco with a middle and low flux the building of spur dikes increase flow velocity and water depth in the main channel thus the physical habitat areas increase significantly because pelteobagrus fulvidraco likes flowing water but for the dominant fish of carps large areas of recirculation zone developed between spur dikes have smaller flow velocities and are not suitable to carp reproduction then the physical habitat areas for the carps after the building of spur dikes decrease accordingly it can be seen that the building of spur dikes can increase water depth and flow velocity in the main channel and is benefit to diverse fish physical habitats with stagger pool and riffle however each objective fish species might have its own preference for instance some fish species like to live in the still water but others love to the flowing water yi et al 2010 wan et al 2021 some may only live in the shallow water but others will be more suitable to the deep water so whether spur dikes can improve fish physical habitat area and thereby achieve to the requirement of ecological restoration or not need to be determined by combining with the specific fish preferences for the important target fish species in the study reach our results only concern the impact of water depth flow velocity and temperature on the habitat however long terms working for spur dikes will cause sediment deposit heavily between spur dikes and this will change the fish habitat tremendously also these influences may be a long term process chang et al 2013 previous studies showed that turbulence structure will also impact fish swimming behavior liao 2007 liao et al 2003 our model is only two dimensional for the simulation of water depth and flow velocity and cannot present the details of turbulence flow structure therefore the detailed influences of turbulence are not discussed here 4 2 determination of the minimum ecological flow the minimum ecological flows predicted by several prevail methods which include the hydrology method the hydraulic method and the physical habitat method before and after the building of spur dikes are presented in table 3 because the 7q10 method and the tennant method are only related to the statistical flow data in the study reach the minimum ecological flow predicted by these two methods have nothing to do with the building of spur dikes and the values of the minimum ecological flows from these two methods are very close for the method of r2 cross there is a discrepancy of 10 0 m3 s for the minimum ecological flow before and after the construction of spur dikes and by using the method of the wetted perimeter the difference of the minimum ecological flow between with and without spur dikes is 23 0 m3 s when the r2 cross method and the wetted perimeter are applied if the selected calculating cross sections do not have spur dikes spur dikes will have no effect on the minimum ecological flow in the whole reach however if the selected predicting cross sections are located on the spur dikes the results may probably ignore the influence of some important river features on the other cross sections for the whole reach the method of the instream flow increment utilizes the distribution of water depth and flow velocity in the whole study reach which may be changed locally by spur dikes thus the minimum ecological flow in the study reach will vary after spur dikes are built here the minimum ecological flow is 90 m3 s before the spur dikes are built and it is 50 m3 s after the building of spur dikes otherwise because the instream flow increment method is based on the preference of the selected objective fish species the minimum ecological flow will be influenced greatly by the preference curve for different targeted fish species after all different fish species have different habitat suitable index 4 3 operation on water stage fluctuation the selected target fish has a preference on daily water stage fluctuation in the study reach and according to our results a daily discharge increment will increase water level and improve the targeted fish habitat wonderfully an increment of 30 m3 s is enough to provide the appropriate variation of water level for fish habitats the increment discharge can be regulated because the influx of the study reach is controlled by the dujiangyan irrigation engineering which is located on the upstream of the jinjiang river and its main ability is to provide irrigation water for the dujiangyan city previous studies have showed that artificial floods released from the reservoir can sustain fish population on a healthy level ban et al 2019 dixon et al 2015 lima et al 2017 actually artificial water level fluctuations have been used to promoting fish spawning in the ecological regulation tang et al 2022 ban et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 yi et al 2010 the dominant fish species of carps in the study reach has a preference of water stage fluctuation in spawning periods tang et al 2022 xiao et al 2022 according to our results in order to boost the carp reproduction a nearly more 30 m3 s daily flux rate should be released from the upstream for fabricating a suitable water stage fluctuation 5 conclusions a two dimensional hydrodynamic model coupled with the his curves river 2d was applied to evaluate the influence of spur dikes on the physical habitat for the selected objected fish species of pelteobagrus fulvidraco and carps in the jinjiang river 1 spur dikes can improve physical habitat through locally increasing water depth and flow velocity and fabricating stagger pool and riffle environment however fish species have different preferences and habitat suitable indexes for hydraulic characteristics thus the ability of spur dikes for ecological restoration should be determined according to the suitable index curve for the most important indicated fish species in the study reach 2 the building of spur dikes changes water flow condition and provides diverse habitat for fish species thus it can reduce the requirement of the minimum ecological flow for protecting the specific objective fish species in the study reach 3 from the simulated results after improvement of physical habitats by the building of spur dikes the minimum ecological flow should no less than 50 m3 s in the study reach however due to water requirement of irrigation in dry season the discharge from upstream in the jinjiang river even cannot reach to 30 m3 s in order to protect the fish species of pelteobagrus fulvidraco in the river the upstream dujiangyan irrigation engineering should release a discharge no less than 50 m3 s in the whole year 4 because water level fluctuation is a key eco factor for the reproduction of the dominant carp fishes in the study reach a more than 30 m3 s daily flux rate should be discharged from the dujiangyan irrigation in the reproduction period for the carps these more fluxes every day can create enough water fluctuation to reach a suitable water level fluctuation for carp spawning funding this work was supported by the national key r d program of

2062,water conflict is evolving into one of the most vital social and environmental issues as the global water crisis intensifies in recent years previous studies mostly focus on the game between water users but overlook the fact that water resource institutions wris which are increasingly involved in water conflicts are also essential players in this study a tripartite evolutionary game model that considers wris demand side users and supply side users is developed seven potential evolutionary stable strategies and nine evolutionary scenarios are deduced the theoretical findings are validated by simulating the water conflict of two provinces i e hubei and henan in the hanjiang basin china the results indicate that non cooperation among water users and ineffective intervention by wris are the long term outcomes of this water conflict case to foster cooperation the game structure needs to be altered by affecting the external variables that determine the net benefits of excess water intake and water rights transfer owing to the insufficient long term incentives for wris cooperation among water users cannot rely on the intervention strategy nonetheless even if external conditions are immature the intervention strategy can act as auxiliary means to foster cooperation in advance but at the cost of some of the wris interests the outcomes of the present study can provide managers of water resources with contributing information for cooperation promoting among water users keywords water conflict water resources institutions evolutionary stable strategy

sustainable development induced by the increasing requirement for water and the impact of global climate variation huang et al 2021 liu et al 2019 water conflicts have frequently been aggravated over the past decades angelakis et al 2021 involving a growing number of stakeholders with different objectives these conflicts could impede the development of economics and society and damage the ecological environment to varying extents unfried et al 2022 thus paying attention to the contradictions and conflicts that emerge during water utilization examining the interaction and decision making process among multiple stakeholders and realizing the harmonious utilization of water resources by designing scientific and reasonable cooperation mechanisms are necessary actions as a mathematical tool for analyzing decisions and their equilibrium when the actions of decision makers directly interact game theory can provide valuable insights for resolving water conflicts dinar and hogarth 2015 madani 2010 many researchers analyze the causes and solutions of water conflicts in the game theoretic framework using non cooperative or cooperative game theory specifically non

zeng et al 2019 among others these studies which applied classical game theory provide beneficial insights into the reduction of water conflicts and improvement of water conditions however the drawbacks are as follows i the assumption of entirely rational players is relatively idealized in reality players are frequently limited in rationality by their cognitive ability and game complexity yuan et al 2022 which renders prediction results different from actual situations ii the dynamic development process of the game is ignored many game problems including water conflict do not converge quickly to the predicted equilibrium camerer 2011 players may make decisions several times in long standing water conflicts which is a repetitive and evolutionary game process especially when the initial willingness strategies initially selected by players is far from the equilibrium dozens of games may be required to achieve equilibrium one of the most promising methodologies for addressing the abovementioned drawbacks is evolutionary game theory which considers the finite rationality of players and describes the dynamic decision making process it originates from evolutionary biology studies smith 1974 smith and price 1973 taylor and jonker 1978 which was developed in economics sun and zhang 2019 management liu et al 2021 engineering fang et al 2019 among others in recent years several researchers examined water conflicts on the basis of evolutionary game theory yuan et al 2022 applied evolutionary game theory to identify three equilibrium strategies in the water sharing problem in accordance with the priorities and preferences of two different types of riparian countries the authors found that the initial state of conflict and the interests of riparian counties affect the final equilibrium of the game tian et al 2020 developed a bayesian evolutionary game model with incomplete property rights information they used it to demonstrate the feasibility of coordinating water conflicts between upstream and downstream river basin areas through water rights trading lu et al 2021 presented an early warning system for water conflicts among water consumption subjects in the upper middle and lower reaches based on evolutionary game theory the authors derived four evolutionary stable strategies esss and found that the cost of cooperative water intake significantly influences the strategy evolutionary path of water consumption subjects in previous studies scholars prefer to examine conflicts between groups with direct competing interests at the level of water users the players contradictions are centered on water quantity which represents the most conflictive aspect of transboundary water management wolf et al 2003 regardless of how the players are named they can be broadly divided into two types based on the demand relationship of water namely demand side users dsus and supply side users ssus these studies advance our understanding of the dynamic evolution of water conflicts but ignore the influence of other behavioral subjects in the regional system the stakeholders of water conflicts are not limited to people living in the disputed waters because of the obvious externalities petersen perlman et al 2017 increasingly other parties in the system are attempting to intervene and change the pattern of water conflicts the most common and influential of which are water resources institutions wris wris are important counterbalance forces in water conflicts but the inadequacy of existing research makes it difficult for wris to access valuable references in regulating water user behavior therefore there is an urgent need to investigate the dynamic evolution characteristics of water conflicts in the context of considering wris in this paper the concept of wris is relatively broad it is not limited to the following common forms that exist in the world ministry chen et al 2021a authority zhang et al 2020 committee silva et al 2021 commission kittikhoun and staubli 2018 council al muqdadi 2019 association richards and syallow 2018 among others wris may also have other functions importantly however they hold the power to manage water withdrawal by users and represent a wide range of public interests ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2015 schmeier 2012 the reason for considering that wris should be included as players in water conflicts is mainly based on two aspects decision making behavior and interest goals these two aspects are key to determining whether or not a party is a game player if a party exhibits different strategies and payoffs in a game then it can act as a player zanjanian et al 2018 on the one hand intervention by wris is prevalent in water conflicts water resources management encompasses conflict management and conflict prevention thus wris are required to consider the multiple aspects of potential conflicts and intervene with water users niu et al 2014 petersen perlman et al 2017 raquel et al 2007 wolf et al 2003 carried out an analysis enrolling 1831 international water conflict events between 1948 and 2000 the authors indicated wris as the main factor influencing most events and the institutional capacity as significant as the physical aspects of the system de stefano et al 2010 performed an investigation covering 755 water related events between 2000 and 2008 and observed an increasing prevalence of management intervention in conflicts over the years when the outcome of a conflict deviates from the initial objective of wris they may consider using power to achieve more favorable equilibrium according to management effects yu et al 2015 classified power directly exercised by managers into incentive and punitive ones furthermore the authors found that power can transform the uncertain preferences of water users into strict ones but typically at certain costs well functioning and well adapted wris can better address the climate water security nexus thus promoting cooperation among dsus and ssus angelakis et al 2021 meanwhile if the intervention is extremely costly or inefficient then wris may terminate it liu and yan 2022 therefore wris employ different intensities of intervention strategies in water conflicts on the other hand the interest goals of wris lie in close relation to water conflicts the benefits affected can be broadly divided into three components the first component most notably is the public interest which is related to their responsibility in the system wris aim to maximize the public interest them serving as agents which however is significantly reduced in water conflicts resulting from the negative externalities of water conflicts fan and hui 2020 liu et al 2002 the second component is the benefit generated by intervention which is altered by the costs and revenues generated by exercising power bjornlund and mckay 2002 as one that is most easily overlooked the third component is associated with the established management measures by wris antecedent to the occurrence of water conflict water conflicts influence the implementation of established measures which alters this part for instance in various regions of the world wris require fees from users according to water withdrawal although the specific forms of these measures may vary among regions such as water resources tax berbel et al 2019 water resources fee chen et al 2021b gao et al 2022 membership fee de et al 2022 and so on they are usually associated with users water withdrawal behavior and primarily serve to maintain the operation of institutions thus wris have payoffs in water conflicts which vary according to the decision of each party based on the abovementioned consideration this paper builds an evolutionary game model among wris dsus and ssus it analyzes stakeholder groups decision making behavior and interaction mechanisms by simulating a water conflict in the hanjiang basin china primarily this paper tries to answer the following key questions i what are the dynamic evolution characteristics of water conflicts that involve wris dsus and ssus ii how to optimize the behavior of water users in the system according to the dynamic evolution characteristics in answering the questions this study exerts the following major contributions i it contributes to water conflict theory by providing an improved understanding of the evolution of water conflicts involving multiple subjects beyond the traditional focus primarily on conflicts between water users the inclusion of wris significantly enriches the interest linkages between parties some of which were generally overlooked in the past thus making the analysis more systematic and comprehensive ii this study develops a quantitative analysis model involving wris dsus and ssus based on evolutionary game theory which can effectively describe the complex connection between the subjects and predict the interaction outcome the model helps to improve players knowledge of the conflict environment they are in thus reducing behavioral risk and assisting in decision making iii with a real life case in the hanjiang basin china this research provides practical insights into regulating the non cooperative behavior in the region which are potential solutions to this water conflict and may be appropriate for other regions that face similar challenges the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the modeling process and the theoretical analysis of the model section 3 describes the data and material used in the case simulation section 4 demonstrates the impact of various factors and the feasible paths to cooperation through case simulation section 5 provides the key points of discussion finally section 6 summarizes the study and outlines the limitations and future directions 2 construction of the tripartite evolutionary game model for water conflicts 2 1 problem description the essence of water conflicts is considered the competition of interests in general users only enjoy limited rights to withdraw water which are still determined artificially due to geographic historical environmental socio economic and other factors users may not enjoy equitable access to water resources as a result some users have relatively decreased water rights dsus correspondingly others with relatively increased ssus which may lead to water conflicts because of the difference chen and wu 2010 to investigate the evolution of water conflicts we consider the behavior strategies of each party respectively in contrast to traditional water wars the form of water conflicts has changed in recent decades nowadays the conflict strategies adopted by users typically are actions that hinder the economic interests of others but exclude militarily hostile action which may exacerbate inequitable access to water resources barnaby 2009 therefore the players strategies in this paper are derived from their prominent economic linkages and are closely related to their distinct identities and expectations ssus with relatively sufficient access to water can determine whether to transfer the extra water rights to dsus to alleviate the water crisis and increase public interest dsus aim to obtain the needed water rights and may take water in violation of rules if not realized leading to the reduced public interest wris as the agents of public interest can decide whether to intervene in user behavior to promote cooperation and protect the public interest for a comprehensive illustration of the relationships between participants fig 1 depicts the main interactions between the three groups water conflict is a long term and complex problem which renders evolutionary game theory appropriate for this research evolutionary game theory which combines classical game theory and biological evolutionary theory is an effective tool for elucidating complex game relationships and evolutionary paths of strategies brunetti et al 2016 it uses the percentage of individuals in a group that select different pure strategies to substitute for the mixed strategy of classical game theory with the two core elements namely replicator dynamics taylor and jonker 1978 and ess smith and price 1973 the dynamic evolution process and outcome of the strategies of finite rational players in the game are described it provides a new analytical paradigm for examining water conflicts and helps stakeholders in decision making subsequently an evolutionary game model for water conflicts among wris dsus and ssus is constructed 2 2 basic assumptions and parameters according to evolutionary game theory and the considered behavioral characteristics of players in water conflicts the following basic assumptions are made in the model assumption 1 wris dsus and ssus are not overlapped and seek to maximize profits individuals in the same group are homogeneous which means that players within the same group will always obtain equal expected payoffs when making the same decision all players make decisions by comparing payoffs with others within the same group and learn from the players with the maximum payoff assumption 2 wris can decide whether to intervene in the behavior of dsus and ssus and the strategy set is intervention non intervention if selecting intervention wris will adopt incentive and punitive measures for water users in which the proportion of individuals in wris that choose intervention is x and the proportion of selecting non intervention is 1 x dsus and ssus can decide whether or not to cooperate in water intake and both of their strategy sets are cooperation non cooperation in cooperation ssus will transfer the extra water rights to dsus and dsus will only take water within the water rights on the contrary in non cooperation ssus will refuse to transfer the water rights and dsus will take more water regardless of the water rights the proportion of individuals in dsus selecting cooperation is y and the proportion of choosing non cooperation is 1 y which are set as z and 1 z in ssus respectively x y z 0 1 assumption 3 the payoffs of wri consist of three parts namely intervention benefits established measure benefits and public benefits intervention benefits only arise when intervention is selected with the cost of g in which the rewards for selecting cooperation by dsu and ssu are e 1 and e 2 respectively and the penalties for choosing non cooperation are f 1 and f 2 respectively established measure benefits and public benefits are determined by the actual water withdrawal by dsu and ssu assumption 4 the volume of water shortage for dsu is q 1 and the volume of extra water rights for ssu is q 2 if ssu opts for cooperation then the actual volume of water rights transferred is q min q 1 q 2 if the corresponding water rights are obtained then the established measure expenses benefits and costs generated by dsu using water at volume q are s 1 v 1 and c 1 respectively correspondingly the established measure expenses benefits and costs generated by dsu using water at volume q are s 2 v 2 and c 2 respectively if both choose cooperation then dsu will pay transfer expenses m to ssu for the water rights and the public benefit generated is h 1 if ssu unilaterally chooses cooperation then dsu will take additional water at volume Œ¥ q max 0 q 1 q 2 after receiving the water rights since the established measures generally exert the binding on users for excess water use zhong and mol 2010 the payoffs for this part require to be determined separately the established measure expenses benefits and costs generated by dsu using water at volume Œ¥ q are s 3 v 3 and c 3 respectively and the public benefit is h 2 if dsu unilaterally selects cooperation then ssu will refuse to transfer the water rights and the public benefit is h 3 if both choose non cooperation then dsu will take additional water at volume q 1 established measure expenses for q 1 should be s 4 as corresponding water rights are not obtained and the public benefit at this point is h 4 table 1 presents the specific meanings of the parameters 2 3 payoff function of players based on the proposed strategies eight interactive strategy combinations exist among wris dsus and ssus in water conflicts table 2 presents the payoff matrix according to table 2 the expected payoffs of wri choosing intervention and non intervention are calculated and denoted as u 11 and u 12 respectively as follows 1 u 11 y z h 1 s 1 s 2 g e 1 e 2 y 1 z h 3 g e 1 f 2 z 1 y h 2 s 1 s 3 s 2 g f 1 e 2 1 y 1 z h 4 s 4 g f 1 f 2 2 u 12 y z h 1 s 1 s 2 y 1 z h 3 z 1 y h 2 s 1 s 3 s 2 1 y 1 z h 4 s 4 furthermore the average expected payoff of wri is calculated and denoted as u 1 as follows 3 u 1 x u 11 1 x u 12 the expected payoffs of dsu choosing cooperation and non cooperation and the average are then calculated and denoted as u 21 u 22 and u 2 respectively as follows 4 u 21 x z v 1 e 1 m c 1 s 1 x 1 z e 1 z 1 x v 1 m c 1 s 1 5 u 22 x z v 1 v 3 f 1 m c 1 c 3 s 1 s 3 x 1 z v 1 v 3 f 1 c 1 c 3 s 4 z 1 x v 1 v 3 m c 1 c 3 s 1 s 3 1 x 1 z v 1 v 3 c 1 c 3 s 4 6 u 2 y u 21 1 y u 22 finally the expected payoffs of ssu choosing cooperation and non cooperation and the average are calculated and denoted as u 31 u 32 and u 3 respectively as follows 7 u 31 x y v 2 e 2 m c 2 s 2 x 1 y v 2 e 2 m c 2 s 2 y 1 x v 2 m c 2 s 2 1 x 1 y v 2 m c 2 s 2 8 u 32 x y f 2 x 1 y f 2 9 u 3 z u 31 1 z u 32 2 4 tripartite replicator dynamic equations replicator dynamic equations describe the evolution process of the proportion of group members that select a particular pure strategy taking wris as an example we derived the replicator dynamic equation that represents the growth rate of the proportion of individuals choosing intervention first at moment t we set the total number of wris and the number of individuals choosing intervention as p t and p 1 t respectively then there is an identical equation as follows 10 p t x t p 1 t next an important assumption of the replicator dynamic needs to be mentioned is that the game payoff is the incremental benefit that affects the adaptation of the intervention strategy where adaptation is measured by the increase in individuals choosing intervention per unit of time taylor and jonker 1978 weibull 1997 thus there are eqs 11 and 12 11 d p 1 dt p 1 u 11 12 dp dt p u 1 taking the derivative of t for both sides of eq 10 yields the following equation 13 p dx dt d p 1 dt x dp dt p 1 u 11 x p u 1 dividing both sides of eq 13 by p yields the equation as follows 14 dx dt p 1 p u 11 x u 1 x u 11 u 1 eq 14 shows that the growth rate of the proportion of individuals using a particular strategy equals the difference between the payoff obtained using that strategy and the average payoff finally by combining eqs 1 3 and eq 14 the replicator dynamic equation for wris is obtained as follows 15 f x d x d t x u 11 u 1 x 1 x u 11 u 12 x 1 x f 1 f 2 g y e 1 f 1 z e 2 f 2 in the same way the replicator dynamic equations for dsus and ssus can be derived as shown in eqs 16 and 17 respectively 16 f y d y d t y u 21 u 2 y 1 y u 21 u 22 y 1 y v 1 v 3 c 1 c 3 s 4 x e 1 f 1 z v 1 c 1 s 3 s 4 17 f z dz dt z u 3 1 u 3 z 1 z u 3 1 u 3 2 z 1 z v 2 m c 2 s 2 x e 2 f 2 eqs 15 17 constitute a dynamic system for the evolution of the tripartite strategy in water conflicts to facilitate the subsequent analysis of evolutionary dynamics the first order derivatives of f x f y and f z are calculated as follows 18 f x 1 2 x f 1 f 2 g y e 1 f 1 z e 2 f 2 19 f y 1 2 y v 1 v 3 c 1 c 3 s 4 x e 1 f 1 z v 1 c 1 s 3 s 4 20 f z 1 2 z v 2 m c 2 s 2 x e 2 f 2 2 5 tripartite evolutionary dynamics in the evolutionary dynamic system every point represents a tripartite strategy a point is an ess if it remains constant and is robust to arbitrarily small disturbances consequently when a point x x y z is an ess then x must simultaneously satisfy f x 0 and f x 0 to reach asymptotic stability conditions hofbauer and sigmund 1998 jiang et al 2019 and y and z also need to meet similar requirements for wris when y y f 1 f 2 g z e 2 f 2 e 1 f 1 fig 2 a then f x 0 and f x 0 thus x will not change over time and no ess will exist in the system in other words the proportion of individuals in wris selecting intervention will remain constant in water conflicts when y y fig 2 b then f x x 0 f x x 1 0 f x x 0 0 and f x x 1 0 thus x 1 is asymptotically stable that is all wris will eventually select intervention over time when y y fig 2 c then f x x 0 f x x 1 0 f x x 0 0 and f x x 1 0 thus x 0 is asymptotically stable which denotes that all wris will eventually choose non intervention for dsus when x x v 1 v 3 c 1 c 3 s 4 z v 1 c 1 s 3 s 4 e 1 f 1 fig 2 d then f y 0 and f y 0 thus y will remain the same over time and no ess will exist in the system simply put the proportion of individuals in dsus choosing cooperation will remain constant in water conflicts when x x fig 2 e then f y y 0 f y y 1 0 f y y 0 0 and f y y 1 0 thus y 0 is asymptotically stable which indicates that all dsus will eventually choose non cooperation over time when x x fig 2 f then f y y 0 f y y 1 0 f y y 0 0 and f y y 1 0 thus y 1 is asymptotically stable and indicates that all dsus will eventually choose cooperation for ssus when x x v 2 m c 2 s 2 e 2 f 2 fig 2 g then f z 0 and f z 0 thus z will remain the same over time and no ess will exist in the system in other words the proportion of individuals in ssus choosing cooperation will remain constant in water conflicts when x x fig 2 h then f z z 0 f z z 1 0 f z z 0 0 and f z z 1 0 thus z 0 is asymptotically stable that is all ssus will eventually select non cooperation over time when x x fig 2 i then f z z 0 f z z 1 0 f z z 0 0 and f z z 1 0 thus z 1 is asymptotically stable simply put all ssus will eventually choose cooperation over time the evolutionary dynamics of wris dsus and ssus jointly lead to the evolution of the tripartite strategy in water conflicts therefore if the relative position of the tripartite strategy point in the space is known then we can determine the evolutionary trends of wris dsus and ssus fig 2 j depicts the evolutionary trends of eight representative interior points in a given scenario where two esss are 0 1 0 and 1 0 1 without loss of generality various evolutionary scenarios are discussed subsequently 2 6 evolutionary stable strategies to distinguish esss in the system we obtain the equilibrium point x x y z in the evolutionary dynamic system by setting eqs 15 17 equal to 0 simultaneously as follows 21 f x 0 f y 0 f z 0 solving 21 yields 13 local solutions including eight pure strategy equilibrium points namely x 1 0 0 0 x 2 1 0 0 x 3 0 1 0 x 4 0 0 1 x 5 1 1 0 x 6 1 0 1 x 7 0 1 1 and x 8 1 1 1 and five mixed strategy equilibrium points appendix a provides the specific analytical solutions notably not all equilibrium points can be esss because a few may not be robust to arbitrarily small disturbances according to selten 1988 ritzberger and weibull 1995 and cheng and yu 2018 esss in a multi subject game must be a strict nash equilibrium and pure strategy combination thus only eight pure strategy equilibrium points need to be analyzed to determine the conditions for the emergence of esss the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium points can be analyzed using liapunov s indirect method friedman 1998 lyapunov 1992 a local linear approximation is made to the system at the equilibrium point as follows 22 f x f y f z j x x f x x f x y f x z f y x f y y f y z f z x f z y f z z x x x x y y z z where j is the jacobian matrix if and only if all eigenvalues of j exhibit negative real parts then the asymptotic stability condition will be satisfied fang et al 2019 and the equilibrium point will be an ess table 3 presents the eigenvalues of j corresponding to different equilibrium points and the mutually exclusive relationship where equilibrium points with the mutually exclusive relationship cannot simultaneously comprise esss and where Œª i k represents the kth eigenvalue of equilibrium points x i i 1 2 8 and k 1 2 3 table 3 indicates that the evolution of the tripartite strategy in the system is influenced by many external variables among the eight pure strategy equilibrium points only x 8 1 1 1 cannot be an ess because Œª 8 1 always displays a positive real part from a realistic point of view a potential interpretation is that wri always benefits less from the intervention than non intervention when both dsu and ssu choose cooperation hence under the principle of economic rationality x 8 is not asymptotically stable this study aims to promote cooperation between water users thus the only ideal potential ess is x 7 0 1 1 which indicates that dsu and ssu will cooperate spontaneously even without intervention it is not difficult to deduce that when c 3 s 3 v 3 and m c 2 s 2 v 2 then all eigenvalues of x 7 will have negative real parts and x 7 will be an ess in the abovementioned first inequality the benefits of excess water intake for dsu are less than the sum of its use costs and established measure expenses that is the net benefits of excess water intake are negative in the second inequality the benefits of ssu from using water at volume q are less than the sum of its transfer expenses use costs and established measure expenses which implies that the net benefits of water rights transfer are positive if the abovementioned two inequalities are satisfied simultaneously then water users will cooperate spontaneously in water conflicts moreover according to the mutually exclusive relationship x 7 will be unique when it becomes an ess which helps exclude interference from other equilibrium points based on the conditions for the esss to hold table 4 presents the nine possible evolutionary scenarios in the system where y indicates that the corresponding equilibrium point is an ess and n denotes that it is not an ess among the potential esss only x 3 and x 6 are not mutually exclusive therefore there may be two esss scenario 9 one ess scenarios 2 8 or even no ess scenario 1 in the system 3 data and material a water conflict case in the hanjiang basin in china is simulated to justify the previous analysis which could provide deeper insights hubei and henan provinces are the two predominant provincial administrative regions in the middle and lower reaches of the hanjiang river fig 3 in 2016 the ministry of water resources of china set control targets for multi year average surface water intake in the hanjiang river by 2030 for the two provinces 11 733 billion m3 for hubei province and 2 528 billion m3 for henan province ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2016 however according to lv 2013 and chang et al 2016 the multi year average water demands of the two provinces by 2030 are expected to be 12 426 and 2 281 billion m3 respectively as a result water conflict may arise due to the difference between the allocated water and the actual water demand in this water conflict the ministry of water resources of china or its dispatched watershed management agency hubei province and henan province can be considered as the wri dsu and ssu respectively according to the previously mentioned water allocation plan and the actual water demand hubei province suffers from an annual water shortage of 6 93 108 m3 while henan province enjoys extra water rights of 2 47 108 m3 per year which are denoted as q 1 and q 2 respectively therefore when both sides cooperate henan province will transfer the additional water rights of 2 47 108 m3 which is q meanwhile hubei province will not violate the rules for water withdrawal because of the unmet water rights of 4 46 108 m3 marked as Œ¥ q the marginal revenue of water is estimated as the product of the gdp per cubic meter of water and the output elasticity coefficient of water peng and hu 2007 according to the statistical bulletin data from relevant departments henan water conservancy department 2022 hubei water conservancy department 2022 the average gdp per cubic meter of water in hubei and henan provinces from 2016 to 2020 is 136 00 yuan and 206 78 yuan respectively referring to peng and hu 2007 and lin 2017 we assume that the output elasticity coefficients of water in the two provinces do not differ and remain constant both taken as 0 11 therefore the marginal revenue of water in hubei and henan provinces is 14 96 yuan m3 and 22 75 yuan m3 respectively the values of the parameters related to water use benefits can then be obtained by calculating the product of the water volume and marginal revenue that is v 1 36 95 108 yuan v 2 56 19 108 yuan and v 3 66 72 108 yuan the total cost of water use is composed of the expenses for water intake water production water supply drainage and wastewater treatment according to the study by song et al 2018 the average unit cost of water use in central chinese cities is about 6 15 yuan m3 we use this value to calculate the parameters associated with the cost of water use thus resulting in c 1 c 2 15 19 108 yuan and c 3 27 43 108 yuan using the average price of 1 24 yuan m3 for regional water rights trading in china in 2020 china water exchange 2022 we compute the transfer expense of water rights to be 3 06 108 yuan which is m as for the established measure expenses the water conflict mainly affects the collection of the water resources fee in the two provinces currently the standard price of water resources fee for surface water in hubei and henan provinces is 0 1 yuan m3 and 0 4 yuan m3 respectively and the excess water withdrawal is usually charged twice the standard price department of finance of hubei province et al 2009 henan development and reform commission et al 2015 thus the values of the parameters related to established measure expenses are obtained based on this standard namely s 1 0 25 108 yuan s 2 0 99 108 yuan s 3 0 89 108 yuan and s 4 1 39 108 yuan referring to relevant laws and regulations standing committee of the national people s congress 2016 we set both the reward and penalty at five times the basic water resources fee corresponding to the respective surplus deficit water rights thus working out e 1 f 1 0 89 108 yuan and e 2 f 2 4 94 108 yuan regarding intervention costs we suppose g 0 20 108 yuan referencing similar measures hubei water conservancy department 2021 sichuan provincial finance department 2021 in particular h 1 h 2 h 3 and h 4 are estimated subjectively we assume that the relationship among them is h 1 h 3 h 2 h 4 the public benefits from saving water are not less than the benefits from using it and the losses from excess water withdrawal are not less than the benefits created by using it therefore setting h 1 v 2 v 1 19 24 108 yuan h 2 v 2 v 1 v 3 47 48 108 yuan h 3 0 and h 4 v 1 v 3 103 67 108 yuan may be appropriate the initial values of parameters are organized in table 5 4 simulation results 4 1 dynamic evolutionary trajectories of players fig 4 presents the vector field of the three dimensional dynamic system based on the given initial values and replicator dynamic equations in the space the eight pure strategy points are in a constant state however all equilibrium points except x 2 will evolve into others due to a slight shift in at least one of the x y and z directions in other words certain strategies dominate them any minor disturbance cannot make x 2 evolve into other points such that it is the only ess in the space no player is willing to change its current strategy unilaterally at x 2 the result is consistent with scenario 3 in table 4 and only eigenvalues corresponding to x 2 all display negative real parts in the vector field any point that falls into the interior point set Œ∏ in x y z 0 x 1 0 y 1 0 z 1 will eventually evolve into x 2 to better understand the long term evolutionary process we assign values to x y and z from 0 1 to 0 9 at 0 1 intervals and form 729 initial points for simulation verification fig 5 presents the evolutionary trajectories of the three groups where all initial points eventually evolve into x 2 thus the previous theoretical analysis is effectively verified when we change part of the variable values the eight other evolution scenarios in table 4 are also obtained see supplementary appendix b the influence of external variables on the evolutionary scenario transformation is discussed later 4 2 convergence time of players in this subsection the convergence time at different initial points is further examined under the given conditions first a few representative initial points are observed we assume that the points have an equal distance from the equilibrium in the x y and z directions where the distances are 0 1 close 0 5 moderate and 0 9 far respectively specifically the initial points are 0 9 0 1 0 1 0 5 0 5 0 5 and 0 1 0 9 0 9 as expected the three points eventually evolve into x 2 fig 6 a nevertheless the different initial points influence the time to reach equilibrium as shown in fig 6 b d wris reach equilibrium at t 0 9533 1 2448 and 1 5997 respectively dsus reach equilibrium at t 0 0934 0 1324 and 0 1804 respectively and ssus reach equilibrium at t 0 1748 0 2281 and 0 2600 respectively for the same group the greater the difference from the equilibrium value the longer the time to converge to equilibrium for the same initial point the relationship between the three parties in terms of convergence time is wris ssus dsus in other words dsus converge the fastest followed by ssus and wris when different groups exhibit an equal willingness to adopt the ess then the influence of changes in the initial willingness of a single group is examined we change the initial willingness of a group from 0 1 to 0 9 which indicates a shift from unwillingness to intervene cooperate to a strong desire for it meanwhile we retain the initial willingness of the other groups at 0 5 which indicates that they are neutral for wris as x increases from 0 1 fig 7 a to 0 9 fig 7 b the convergence times of wris dsus and ssus decrease from 1 5205 to 0 9855 increase from 0 1246 to 0 1397 and increase from 0 1972 to 0 2538 respectively which implies that a significant increase in the initial willingness of wris for intervention slows down the convergence of dsus and ssus toward non cooperation for dsus as y increases from 0 1 fig 7 c to 0 9 fig 7 d the convergence times of dsus wris and ssus increase from 0 0948 to 0 1739 increase from 1 2476 to 1 2868 and decrease from 0 2340 to 0 2255 respectively this result implies that a significant increase in the initial willingness of dsus for cooperation slows down the convergence of wris toward intervention but accelerates the convergence of ssus toward non cooperation for ssus as z increases from 0 1 fig 7 e to 0 9 fig 7 f the convergence times of ssus wris and dsus increase from 0 1553 to 0 2983 from 1 2240 to 1 3172 and from 0 1264 to 0 1524 respectively this finding implies that a significant increase in the initial willingness of ssus for cooperation slows down the convergence of wris toward intervention and dsus toward non cooperation 4 3 transformation of evolutionary scenarios the transformation of evolutionary scenarios due to changes in external variable values is tested in this subsection which may help decision makers achieve the desired target given that the initial points do not influence the ess and that the majority of scenarios have only one ess we set the initial values of x y and z as 0 5 first the effect of univariate changes on the ess is tested under the given conditions we change the ess from x 2 1 0 0 scenario 3 to x 1 0 0 0 scenario 2 by increasing g where x 0 becomes x 1 and the condition is g f 1 f 2 however reducing f 1 or f 2 cannot achieve the goal because both f 1 and f 2 are greater than g we set a f 1 f 2 and simulate the changes in the stable state at g 0 6a 0 8a a 1 2a and 1 4a respectively fig 8 illustrates that increasing intervention costs gradually makes wris choose non intervention when g a then x 1 is stable when g a then x 0 is stable when g a then no ess exists in the system and x is stable at a value between 0 and 1 the conversion of the ess from x 2 1 0 0 to x 5 1 1 0 scenario 6 is achieved by increasing c 1 c 3 s 4 f 1 or decreasing v 3 where y 0 becomes y 1 and the condition is c 1 c 3 s 4 e 1 f 1 v 1 v 3 limited by the given values in table 5 changing e 1 or v 1 cannot achieve the goal taking s 4 and v 3 as examples we set b v 1 v 3 c 1 c 3 e 1 f 1 and c c 1 c 3 s 4 e 1 f 1 v 1 and simulate the evolutionary paths at s 4 0 6b 0 8b b 1 2b and 1 4b respectively and v 3 0 6c 0 8c c 1 2c and 1 4c respectively fig 9 suggests that increasing established measure expenses for excess water or decreasing the benefits generated by excess water gradually makes dsus choose cooperation when s 4 b or v 3 c then y 0 is stable when s 4 b or v 3 c then y 1 is stable when s 4 b or v 3 c then no ess exists in the system and y is stable at a value between 0 and 1 the conversion of the ess from x 2 1 0 0 to x 4 0 0 1 scenario 5 is achieved by increasing m c 2 s 2 or decreasing v 2 where x 1 becomes x 0 and z 0 becomes z 1 and the condition is m c 2 s 2 v 2 taking m as an example d 1 v 2 c 2 s 2 e 2 f 2 and d 2 v 2 c 2 s 2 are two critical values we simulate the evolutionary paths at m 0 8d 1 d 1 0 5d 1 0 5d 2 d 2 and 1 2d 2 respectively fig 10 depicts that increasing transfer expenses gradually makes wris choose non intervention and makes ssus choose cooperation when m d 1 then x 1 and z 0 are stable and x 2 is the ess when m d 1 then x is stable at 1 z is stable at a value between 0 and 1 and the ess disappears from the system scenario 1 when d 1 m d 2 then x and z fluctuate periodically between 0 and 1 and no ess exists in the system when m d 2 then x is stable at 0 and z is stable at 1 but still no ess because x 4 cannot resist small disturbances lastly when m d 2 then x 0 and z 1 are stable and x 4 is the ess univariate changes can only transform the present ess x 2 1 0 0 into x 1 0 0 0 x 5 1 1 0 and x 4 0 0 1 however the ideal ess x 7 0 1 1 scenario 8 cannot be obtained thus how to achieve x 7 is tested next the goal is achieved by changing at least two variable values and the following two conditions need to be satisfied simultaneously i c 3 s 3 v 3 ii m c 2 s 2 v 2 in the previous test condition ii is satisfied when m is increased to 1 2d where the ess is shifted to x 4 when continuing to increase c 3 s 3 or decrease v 3 to satisfy condition i then the ess changes from x 4 to x 7 taking m and s 3 as examples we retain m 1 2d 2 and set e v 3 c 3 to simulate the evolutionary paths at s 3 0 6e 0 8e e 1 2e and 1 4e respectively fig 11 indicates that increasing established measure expenses for excess water can gradually make dsus choose cooperation when ssus are willing to cooperate when s 3 e y 0 is stable and x 4 is the ess when s 3 e y 1 is stable and x 7 is the ess when s 3 e there is no ess in the system and y is stable at a value between 0 and 1 finally the effectiveness of the intervention is tested in many realistic situations wris choose to intervene not only due to economic factors but non economic factors such as social political and environmental factors may also motivate the government to intervene niu et al 2014 in this case to avoid intervention failure testing which level of intervention is effective is necessary in this test we retain x 1 because it is known that wris choose intervention then the problem can be considered a two party game between dsus and ssus where x 2 1 0 0 x 5 1 1 0 x 6 1 0 1 and x 8 1 1 1 are the four potential esss setting f 1 v 1 v 3 c 1 c 3 s 4 f 2 v 3 c 3 s 3 g v 2 m c 2 s 2 f 1 e 1 and f 2 e 2 we simulate the transformation of the ess from x 2 to others fig 12 implies that increasing the reward and penalty can gradually make dsus and ssus choose cooperation when e 1 f 1 f 1 then y 1 is stable and the ess is shifted from x 2 to x 5 when e 2 f 2 g then z 1 is stable and the ess is shifted from x 2 to x 6 when e 1 f 1 f 2 and e 2 f 2 g then y 1 and z 1 are stable and x 8 is the ess notably f 2 is significantly lower than f 1 which indicates that the threshold for dsus to cooperate unilaterally is higher 5 discussion 5 1 role of water resources institutions in water conflicts as the world faces a growing water crisis more and more parties with different interests are drawn into water conflicts the involvement of multiple participants is now a vital characteristic of the system from an evolutionary dynamics perspective this study explores how wris dsus and ssus behave in water conflicts under a broadly applicable problem setting although wris do not act directly on water resources they have their own options of action in water conflicts which as how to intervene in the behavior of water users wris are accountable for maintaining orderly water use in the basin so they are inclined to intervene when users in the system exhibit non cooperative behavior our results suggest that wris cannot sustain the intervention strategy to achieve the ideal state where all users are cooperative due to insufficient incentives implying that cooperation among water users cannot rely on the intervention of wris however the intervention strategy can serve as a supplementary means to overcome the shortcomings of the game structure caused by immature external conditions which can facilitate cooperation at an earlier stage but at the cost of some of the wris interests as the results presented in fig 12 wris can foster cooperation among users under immature external conditions by establishing a dynamic incentive and constraint mechanism when the existing game conditions are far from inducing spontaneous cooperation among users the reward and penalty can be set relatively higher which can be progressively reduced as the conditions improve for cooperation the intervention can be terminated when the conditions fully meet the requirements for spontaneous cooperation furthermore by guiding some external variables that are closely related to them wris can foster a game structure that promotes spontaneous cooperation in the model x 7 0 1 1 lies the only ideal potential ess and is achieved on the condition that c 3 s 3 v 3 and m c 2 s 2 v 2 are both satisfied illustrating that water users will cooperate spontaneously even without intervention the realization of this scenario involves several variables that are affected by wris especially the established measure expenses s 3 and s 2 and water rights transfer expenses m established measure expenses arise from some measures developed by wris before water conflicts such as levying water resource taxes which generally exert a binding effect on excess water use zhong and mol 2010 however the occurrence of water conflicts indicates that these measures are not sufficiently binding as a result wris can facilitate cooperation by strengthening the effectiveness of these measures as for water rights transfer expenses it can be accomplished through administrative or quasi market means in which wris play an essential role speed 2009 accordingly wris can also promote cooperation by supporting water rights transfer notably the thresholds of variables that alter the game structure are crucial information for wris from the preceding simulations the illusion of cooperation may arise when external conditions are not satisfied due to the short sightedness of the players resulting from their bounded rationality for instance fig 10 shows that ssus choice alternates periodically between cooperation and non cooperation when d 1 m d 2 in which the cooperation strategy is not stable in the long term outcome despite the temporary increase in the cooperative intention consequently wris still need to develop conditions for cooperation similarly the illusion of non cooperation may also arise even when spontaneous cooperation conditions are reached for example as depicted in fig 11 b when m 1 2d 2 and s 3 e the cooperation intention of dsus drops at first and then increases and stabilizes at 1 implying that the cooperation strategy is stable in the long term outcome therefore wris do not need to develop further conditions and can patiently wait for full cooperation to emerge understanding the threshold of cooperation can help wris not to be misled by these illusions thus reducing the risk of decision making 5 2 key factors for promoting cooperation one of the important objectives of this study is to investigate how to promote cooperative behavior among water users in a system according to its dynamic evolution characteristics as reflected in our results the cooperation will not be robust only until the conditions for spontaneous cooperation are satisfied otherwise it can be easily disrupted by minor disturbances in addition different from the findings of yuan et al 2022 in a two party game context the initial state of players does not affect the cooperation under this research question setting when spontaneous cooperation conditions are met therefore the factors that can lead to spontaneous cooperation are primarily discussed and analyzed from the perspectives of dsus and ssus respectively for dsus the essential factor that influences their behavior is the net benefits of excess water intake since several variables constitute this factor they need to be examined holistically when the benefits of excess water intake are less than the sum of its use costs and established measure expenses i e c 3 s 3 v 3 dsus will tend to cooperate because the net benefits of excess water intake are negative yu et al 2019 argued that incremental benefits are the foundation for cooperation and implied that water users would cooperate if they could obtain more benefits from cooperation meanwhile the simulation outcomes reveal an impact of the net benefits on the convergence time that the larger the absolute value of the net benefits the stronger the motivation for players to cooperate which accelerates the reaching of equilibrium for players consistently the key factor influencing the behavior of ssus is the net benefits of water rights transfer when the sum of the transfer expenses use costs and established measure expenses of the extra water rights are greater than the benefits i e m c 2 s 2 v 2 then ssus will tend to cooperate because the net benefits of water rights transfer are positive if more benefits can be gained from the water rights transfer then ssus will choose to cooperate more quickly in the case simulation a potential water conflict case in the hanjiang basin china is analyzed the simulation results show x 2 1 0 0 as the only ess under the given parameters which is not ideal as the cooperation between dsus and ssus is not promoted followed by ineffective intervention the existing external conditions are far from achieving spontaneous cooperation as a result wris could implement targeted measures for the above two factors however it is worth noting that dsus may not opt to cooperate if only the relevant conditions of dsus are met as reflected by the results in fig 12 when we attempt to alter the game structure through intervention due to the absence of concession from ssus the threshold for dsus to cooperate unilaterally is higher than that for spontaneous cooperation therefore to render cooperation easier for dsus wris can first make ssus willing to cooperate 6 conclusions to elucidate the dynamic evolution characteristics and resolutions of water conflicts involving wris dsus and ssus we construct a tripartite evolutionary game model among them the tripartite evolutionary dynamics and esss in the system are analyzed through a water conflict case in the hanjiang basin in china we simulate the long term evolutionary outcome and the feasible paths to achieve cooperation among water users the major conclusions are as follows 1 the dynamic evolution characteristics of water conflicts concerning wris dsus and ssus are revealed based on evolutionary game theory under different conditions of external variables seven tripartite pure strategies except for 1 1 1 may become esss in the system and it is possible that no ess exists however only 0 1 0 and 1 0 1 may be esss simultaneously owing to the mutually exclusive relationship between strategies thus there are seven potential esss and nine possible evolutionary scenarios in the system when the conditions for achieving the ideal ess 0 1 1 i e spontaneous cooperation are met the long term outcome is independent of the initial willingness of participants 2 since the long term incentives for wris are insufficient cooperation among water users cannot rely on the intervention strategy however if wris can contribute part of their own interests then the intervention strategy can act as a complementary means to overcome the defects in the game structure when external conditions are immature thus enabling water users to cooperate earlier 3 the only ess in the water conflict in the hanjiang basin in china under the given external conditions is 1 0 0 which means that this water conflict is likely to lead to a scenario of non cooperation among water users and ineffective intervention from wris to foster cooperation the external variables concerning the net benefits of the excess water intake and water rights transfer need to be altered if external conditions can enable ssus to gain positive net benefits from water rights transfer and dsus to incur negative net benefits from excess water intake both dsus and ssus will cooperate and the larger the absolute value of the net benefits the earlier the cooperation is realized the present study mainly examines the evolution of water conflicts based on the primary interest connections of participants and draws some practical conclusions however due to the more complex and variable relationships between players in practice the model s applicability may be limited by relevant assumptions and simplifications nevertheless the insights obtained through evolutionary game theory seem to be widely applicable and helpful future research is expected to further elucidate the deeper relationships between players and explore the game mechanisms of non homogeneous groups under dynamic parameters credit authorship contribution statement yang cao conceptualization data

2062,water conflict is evolving into one of the most vital social and environmental issues as the global water crisis intensifies in recent years previous studies mostly focus on the game between water users but overlook the fact that water resource institutions wris which are increasingly involved in water conflicts are also essential players in this study a tripartite evolutionary game model that considers wris demand side users and supply side users is developed seven potential evolutionary stable strategies and nine evolutionary scenarios are deduced the theoretical findings are validated by simulating the water conflict of two provinces i e hubei and henan in the hanjiang basin china the results indicate that non cooperation among water users and ineffective intervention by wris are the long term outcomes of this water conflict case to foster cooperation the game structure needs to be altered by affecting the external variables that determine the net benefits of excess water intake and water rights transfer owing to the insufficient long term incentives for wris cooperation among water users cannot rely on the intervention strategy nonetheless even if external conditions are immature the intervention strategy can act as auxiliary means to foster cooperation in advance but at the cost of some of the wris interests the outcomes of the present study can provide managers of water resources with contributing information for cooperation promoting among water users keywords water conflict water resources institutions evolutionary stable strategy evolutionary game theory hanjiang basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an essential natural and strategic economic resource water plays a vital role in sustainable development induced by the increasing requirement for water and the impact of global climate variation huang et al 2021 liu et al 2019 water conflicts have frequently been aggravated over the past decades angelakis et al 2021 involving a growing number of stakeholders with different objectives these conflicts could impede the development of economics and society and damage the ecological environment to varying extents unfried et al 2022 thus paying attention to the contradictions and conflicts that emerge during water utilization examining the interaction and decision making process among multiple stakeholders and realizing the harmonious utilization of water resources by designing scientific and reasonable cooperation mechanisms are necessary actions as a mathematical tool for analyzing decisions and their equilibrium when the actions of decision makers directly interact game theory can provide valuable insights for resolving water conflicts dinar and hogarth 2015 madani 2010 many researchers analyze the causes and solutions of water conflicts in the game theoretic framework using non cooperative or cooperative game theory specifically non cooperative game theory emphasizes the manner in which game players make decisions yu et al 2019 relevant applications include water conflict analysis along the united states mexico border frisvold and caswell 2000 an inter country case in the aral sea basin in central asia nandalal and hipel 2007 an upstream and downstream transboundary case in the volta basin bhaduri and liebe 2013 a groundwater conflict case in the badr khalidabad region in iran nazari et al 2020 and a transboundary water pollution case in the middle route of china s south north water transfer project sheng and webber 2021 cooperative game theory emphasizes the distribution of the benefits of cooperation among game players regardless of their formation of cooperative coalitions hart and mas colell 1989 madani and hooshyar 2014 previous studies apply it to the establishment of allocation schemes for basin water resources kucukmehmetoglu and guldmann 2004 reallocation of basin total net benefit sadegh and kerachian 2011 development of equitable strategies of cost allocation girard et al 2016 cooperative management in groundwater resources ghadimi and ketabchi 2019 and pollutant discharge allocation zeng et al 2019 among others these studies which applied classical game theory provide beneficial insights into the reduction of water conflicts and improvement of water conditions however the drawbacks are as follows i the assumption of entirely rational players is relatively idealized in reality players are frequently limited in rationality by their cognitive ability and game complexity yuan et al 2022 which renders prediction results different from actual situations ii the dynamic development process of the game is ignored many game problems including water conflict do not converge quickly to the predicted equilibrium camerer 2011 players may make decisions several times in long standing water conflicts which is a repetitive and evolutionary game process especially when the initial willingness strategies initially selected by players is far from the equilibrium dozens of games may be required to achieve equilibrium one of the most promising methodologies for addressing the abovementioned drawbacks is evolutionary game theory which considers the finite rationality of players and describes the dynamic decision making process it originates from evolutionary biology studies smith 1974 smith and price 1973 taylor and jonker 1978 which was developed in economics sun and zhang 2019 management liu et al 2021 engineering fang et al 2019 among others in recent years several researchers examined water conflicts on the basis of evolutionary game theory yuan et al 2022 applied evolutionary game theory to identify three equilibrium strategies in the water sharing problem in accordance with the priorities and preferences of two different types of riparian countries the authors found that the initial state of conflict and the interests of riparian counties affect the final equilibrium of the game tian et al 2020 developed a bayesian evolutionary game model with incomplete property rights information they used it to demonstrate the feasibility of coordinating water conflicts between upstream and downstream river basin areas through water rights trading lu et al 2021 presented an early warning system for water conflicts among water consumption subjects in the upper middle and lower reaches based on evolutionary game theory the authors derived four evolutionary stable strategies esss and found that the cost of cooperative water intake significantly influences the strategy evolutionary path of water consumption subjects in previous studies scholars prefer to examine conflicts between groups with direct competing interests at the level of water users the players contradictions are centered on water quantity which represents the most conflictive aspect of transboundary water management wolf et al 2003 regardless of how the players are named they can be broadly divided into two types based on the demand relationship of water namely demand side users dsus and supply side users ssus these studies advance our understanding of the dynamic evolution of water conflicts but ignore the influence of other behavioral subjects in the regional system the stakeholders of water conflicts are not limited to people living in the disputed waters because of the obvious externalities petersen perlman et al 2017 increasingly other parties in the system are attempting to intervene and change the pattern of water conflicts the most common and influential of which are water resources institutions wris wris are important counterbalance forces in water conflicts but the inadequacy of existing research makes it difficult for wris to access valuable references in regulating water user behavior therefore there is an urgent need to investigate the dynamic evolution characteristics of water conflicts in the context of considering wris in this paper the concept of wris is relatively broad it is not limited to the following common forms that exist in the world ministry chen et al 2021a authority zhang et al 2020 committee silva et al 2021 commission kittikhoun and staubli 2018 council al muqdadi 2019 association richards and syallow 2018 among others wris may also have other functions importantly however they hold the power to manage water withdrawal by users and represent a wide range of public interests ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2015 schmeier 2012 the reason for considering that wris should be included as players in water conflicts is mainly based on two aspects decision making behavior and interest goals these two aspects are key to determining whether or not a party is a game player if a party exhibits different strategies and payoffs in a game then it can act as a player zanjanian et al 2018 on the one hand intervention by wris is prevalent in water conflicts water resources management encompasses conflict management and conflict prevention thus wris are required to consider the multiple aspects of potential conflicts and intervene with water users niu et al 2014 petersen perlman et al 2017 raquel et al 2007 wolf et al 2003 carried out an analysis enrolling 1831 international water conflict events between 1948 and 2000 the authors indicated wris as the main factor influencing most events and the institutional capacity as significant as the physical aspects of the system de stefano et al 2010 performed an investigation covering 755 water related events between 2000 and 2008 and observed an increasing prevalence of management intervention in conflicts over the years when the outcome of a conflict deviates from the initial objective of wris they may consider using power to achieve more favorable equilibrium according to management effects yu et al 2015 classified power directly exercised by managers into incentive and punitive ones furthermore the authors found that power can transform the uncertain preferences of water users into strict ones but typically at certain costs well functioning and well adapted wris can better address the climate water security nexus thus promoting cooperation among dsus and ssus angelakis et al 2021 meanwhile if the intervention is extremely costly or inefficient then wris may terminate it liu and yan 2022 therefore wris employ different intensities of intervention strategies in water conflicts on the other hand the interest goals of wris lie in close relation to water conflicts the benefits affected can be broadly divided into three components the first component most notably is the public interest which is related to their responsibility in the system wris aim to maximize the public interest them serving as agents which however is significantly reduced in water conflicts resulting from the negative externalities of water conflicts fan and hui 2020 liu et al 2002 the second component is the benefit generated by intervention which is altered by the costs and revenues generated by exercising power bjornlund and mckay 2002 as one that is most easily overlooked the third component is associated with the established management measures by wris antecedent to the occurrence of water conflict water conflicts influence the implementation of established measures which alters this part for instance in various regions of the world wris require fees from users according to water withdrawal although the specific forms of these measures may vary among regions such as water resources tax berbel et al 2019 water resources fee chen et al 2021b gao et al 2022 membership fee de et al 2022 and so on they are usually associated with users water withdrawal behavior and primarily serve to maintain the operation of institutions thus wris have payoffs in water conflicts which vary according to the decision of each party based on the abovementioned consideration this paper builds an evolutionary game model among wris dsus and ssus it analyzes stakeholder groups decision making behavior and interaction mechanisms by simulating a water conflict in the hanjiang basin china primarily this paper tries to answer the following key questions i what are the dynamic evolution characteristics of water conflicts that involve wris dsus and ssus ii how to optimize the behavior of water users in the system according to the dynamic evolution characteristics in answering the questions this study exerts the following major contributions i it contributes to water conflict theory by providing an improved understanding of the evolution of water conflicts involving multiple subjects beyond the traditional focus primarily on conflicts between water users the inclusion of wris significantly enriches the interest linkages between parties some of which were generally overlooked in the past thus making the analysis more systematic and comprehensive ii this study develops a quantitative analysis model involving wris dsus and ssus based on evolutionary game theory which can effectively describe the complex connection between the subjects and predict the interaction outcome the model helps to improve players knowledge of the conflict environment they are in thus reducing behavioral risk and assisting in decision making iii with a real life case in the hanjiang basin china this research provides practical insights into regulating the non cooperative behavior in the region which are potential solutions to this water conflict and may be appropriate for other regions that face similar challenges the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the modeling process and the theoretical analysis of the model section 3 describes the data and material used in the case simulation section 4 demonstrates the impact of various factors and the feasible paths to cooperation through case simulation section 5 provides the key points of discussion finally section 6 summarizes the study and outlines the limitations and future directions 2 construction of the tripartite evolutionary game model for water conflicts 2 1 problem description the essence of water conflicts is considered the competition of interests in general users only enjoy limited rights to withdraw water which are still determined artificially due to geographic historical environmental socio economic and other factors users may not enjoy equitable access to water resources as a result some users have relatively decreased water rights dsus correspondingly others with relatively increased ssus which may lead to water conflicts because of the difference chen and wu 2010 to investigate the evolution of water conflicts we consider the behavior strategies of each party respectively in contrast to traditional water wars the form of water conflicts has changed in recent decades nowadays the conflict strategies adopted by users typically are actions that hinder the economic interests of others but exclude militarily hostile action which may exacerbate inequitable access to water resources barnaby 2009 therefore the players strategies in this paper are derived from their prominent economic linkages and are closely related to their distinct identities and expectations ssus with relatively sufficient access to water can determine whether to transfer the extra water rights to dsus to alleviate the water crisis and increase public interest dsus aim to obtain the needed water rights and may take water in violation of rules if not realized leading to the reduced public interest wris as the agents of public interest can decide whether to intervene in user behavior to promote cooperation and protect the public interest for a comprehensive illustration of the relationships between participants fig 1 depicts the main interactions between the three groups water conflict is a long term and complex problem which renders evolutionary game theory appropriate for this research evolutionary game theory which combines classical game theory and biological evolutionary theory is an effective tool for elucidating complex game relationships and evolutionary paths of strategies brunetti et al 2016 it uses the percentage of individuals in a group that select different pure strategies to substitute for the mixed strategy of classical game theory with the two core elements namely replicator dynamics taylor and jonker 1978 and ess smith and price 1973 the dynamic evolution process and outcome of the strategies of finite rational players in the game are described it provides a new analytical paradigm for examining water conflicts and helps stakeholders in decision making subsequently an evolutionary game model for water conflicts among wris dsus and ssus is constructed 2 2 basic assumptions and parameters according to evolutionary game theory and the considered behavioral characteristics of players in water conflicts the following basic assumptions are made in the model assumption 1 wris dsus and ssus are not overlapped and seek to maximize profits individuals in the same group are homogeneous which means that players within the same group will always obtain equal expected payoffs when making the same decision all players make decisions by comparing payoffs with others within the same group and learn from the players with the maximum payoff assumption 2 wris can decide whether to intervene in the behavior of dsus and ssus and the strategy set is intervention non intervention if selecting intervention wris will adopt incentive and punitive measures for water users in which the proportion of individuals in wris that choose intervention is x and the proportion of selecting non intervention is 1 x dsus and ssus can decide whether or not to cooperate in water intake and both of their strategy sets are cooperation non cooperation in cooperation ssus will transfer the extra water rights to dsus and dsus will only take water within the water rights on the contrary in non cooperation ssus will refuse to transfer the water rights and dsus will take more water regardless of the water rights the proportion of individuals in dsus selecting cooperation is y and the proportion of choosing non cooperation is 1 y which are set as z and 1 z in ssus respectively x y z 0 1 assumption 3 the payoffs of wri consist of three parts namely intervention benefits established measure benefits and public benefits intervention benefits only arise when intervention is selected with the cost of g in which the rewards for selecting cooperation by dsu and ssu are e 1 and e 2 respectively and the penalties for choosing non cooperation are f 1 and f 2 respectively established measure benefits and public benefits are determined by the actual water withdrawal by dsu and ssu assumption 4 the volume of water shortage for dsu is q 1 and the volume of extra water rights for ssu is q 2 if ssu opts for cooperation then the actual volume of water rights transferred is q min q 1 q 2 if the corresponding water rights are obtained then the established measure expenses benefits and costs generated by dsu using water at volume q are s 1 v 1 and c 1 respectively correspondingly the established measure expenses benefits and costs generated by dsu using water at volume q are s 2 v 2 and c 2 respectively if both choose cooperation then dsu will pay transfer expenses m to ssu for the water rights and the public benefit generated is h 1 if ssu unilaterally chooses cooperation then dsu will take additional water at volume Œ¥ q max 0 q 1 q 2 after receiving the water rights since the established measures generally exert the binding on users for excess water use zhong and mol 2010 the payoffs for this part require to be determined separately the established measure expenses benefits and costs generated by dsu using water at volume Œ¥ q are s 3 v 3 and c 3 respectively and the public benefit is h 2 if dsu unilaterally selects cooperation then ssu will refuse to transfer the water rights and the public benefit is h 3 if both choose non cooperation then dsu will take additional water at volume q 1 established measure expenses for q 1 should be s 4 as corresponding water rights are not obtained and the public benefit at this point is h 4 table 1 presents the specific meanings of the parameters 2 3 payoff function of players based on the proposed strategies eight interactive strategy combinations exist among wris dsus and ssus in water conflicts table 2 presents the payoff matrix according to table 2 the expected payoffs of wri choosing intervention and non intervention are calculated and denoted as u 11 and u 12 respectively as follows 1 u 11 y z h 1 s 1 s 2 g e 1 e 2 y 1 z h 3 g e 1 f 2 z 1 y h 2 s 1 s 3 s 2 g f 1 e 2 1 y 1 z h 4 s 4 g f 1 f 2 2 u 12 y z h 1 s 1 s 2 y 1 z h 3 z 1 y h 2 s 1 s 3 s 2 1 y 1 z h 4 s 4 furthermore the average expected payoff of wri is calculated and denoted as u 1 as follows 3 u 1 x u 11 1 x u 12 the expected payoffs of dsu choosing cooperation and non cooperation and the average are then calculated and denoted as u 21 u 22 and u 2 respectively as follows 4 u 21 x z v 1 e 1 m c 1 s 1 x 1 z e 1 z 1 x v 1 m c 1 s 1 5 u 22 x z v 1 v 3 f 1 m c 1 c 3 s 1 s 3 x 1 z v 1 v 3 f 1 c 1 c 3 s 4 z 1 x v 1 v 3 m c 1 c 3 s 1 s 3 1 x 1 z v 1 v 3 c 1 c 3 s 4 6 u 2 y u 21 1 y u 22 finally the expected payoffs of ssu choosing cooperation and non cooperation and the average are calculated and denoted as u 31 u 32 and u 3 respectively as follows 7 u 31 x y v 2 e 2 m c 2 s 2 x 1 y v 2 e 2 m c 2 s 2 y 1 x v 2 m c 2 s 2 1 x 1 y v 2 m c 2 s 2 8 u 32 x y f 2 x 1 y f 2 9 u 3 z u 31 1 z u 32 2 4 tripartite replicator dynamic equations replicator dynamic equations describe the evolution process of the proportion of group members that select a particular pure strategy taking wris as an example we derived the replicator dynamic equation that represents the growth rate of the proportion of individuals choosing intervention first at moment t we set the total number of wris and the number of individuals choosing intervention as p t and p 1 t respectively then there is an identical equation as follows 10 p t x t p 1 t next an important assumption of the replicator dynamic needs to be mentioned is that the game payoff is the incremental benefit that affects the adaptation of the intervention strategy where adaptation is measured by the increase in individuals choosing intervention per unit of time taylor and jonker 1978 weibull 1997 thus there are eqs 11 and 12 11 d p 1 dt p 1 u 11 12 dp dt p u 1 taking the derivative of t for both sides of eq 10 yields the following equation 13 p dx dt d p 1 dt x dp dt p 1 u 11 x p u 1 dividing both sides of eq 13 by p yields the equation as follows 14 dx dt p 1 p u 11 x u 1 x u 11 u 1 eq 14 shows that the growth rate of the proportion of individuals using a particular strategy equals the difference between the payoff obtained using that strategy and the average payoff finally by combining eqs 1 3 and eq 14 the replicator dynamic equation for wris is obtained as follows 15 f x d x d t x u 11 u 1 x 1 x u 11 u 12 x 1 x f 1 f 2 g y e 1 f 1 z e 2 f 2 in the same way the replicator dynamic equations for dsus and ssus can be derived as shown in eqs 16 and 17 respectively 16 f y d y d t y u 21 u 2 y 1 y u 21 u 22 y 1 y v 1 v 3 c 1 c 3 s 4 x e 1 f 1 z v 1 c 1 s 3 s 4 17 f z dz dt z u 3 1 u 3 z 1 z u 3 1 u 3 2 z 1 z v 2 m c 2 s 2 x e 2 f 2 eqs 15 17 constitute a dynamic system for the evolution of the tripartite strategy in water conflicts to facilitate the subsequent analysis of evolutionary dynamics the first order derivatives of f x f y and f z are calculated as follows 18 f x 1 2 x f 1 f 2 g y e 1 f 1 z e 2 f 2 19 f y 1 2 y v 1 v 3 c 1 c 3 s 4 x e 1 f 1 z v 1 c 1 s 3 s 4 20 f z 1 2 z v 2 m c 2 s 2 x e 2 f 2 2 5 tripartite evolutionary dynamics in the evolutionary dynamic system every point represents a tripartite strategy a point is an ess if it remains constant and is robust to arbitrarily small disturbances consequently when a point x x y z is an ess then x must simultaneously satisfy f x 0 and f x 0 to reach asymptotic stability conditions hofbauer and sigmund 1998 jiang et al 2019 and y and z also need to meet similar requirements for wris when y y f 1 f 2 g z e 2 f 2 e 1 f 1 fig 2 a then f x 0 and f x 0 thus x will not change over time and no ess will exist in the system in other words the proportion of individuals in wris selecting intervention will remain constant in water conflicts when y y fig 2 b then f x x 0 f x x 1 0 f x x 0 0 and f x x 1 0 thus x 1 is asymptotically stable that is all wris will eventually select intervention over time when y y fig 2 c then f x x 0 f x x 1 0 f x x 0 0 and f x x 1 0 thus x 0 is asymptotically stable which denotes that all wris will eventually choose non intervention for dsus when x x v 1 v 3 c 1 c 3 s 4 z v 1 c 1 s 3 s 4 e 1 f 1 fig 2 d then f y 0 and f y 0 thus y will remain the same over time and no ess will exist in the system simply put the proportion of individuals in dsus choosing cooperation will remain constant in water conflicts when x x fig 2 e then f y y 0 f y y 1 0 f y y 0 0 and f y y 1 0 thus y 0 is asymptotically stable which indicates that all dsus will eventually choose non cooperation over time when x x fig 2 f then f y y 0 f y y 1 0 f y y 0 0 and f y y 1 0 thus y 1 is asymptotically stable and indicates that all dsus will eventually choose cooperation for ssus when x x v 2 m c 2 s 2 e 2 f 2 fig 2 g then f z 0 and f z 0 thus z will remain the same over time and no ess will exist in the system in other words the proportion of individuals in ssus choosing cooperation will remain constant in water conflicts when x x fig 2 h then f z z 0 f z z 1 0 f z z 0 0 and f z z 1 0 thus z 0 is asymptotically stable that is all ssus will eventually select non cooperation over time when x x fig 2 i then f z z 0 f z z 1 0 f z z 0 0 and f z z 1 0 thus z 1 is asymptotically stable simply put all ssus will eventually choose cooperation over time the evolutionary dynamics of wris dsus and ssus jointly lead to the evolution of the tripartite strategy in water conflicts therefore if the relative position of the tripartite strategy point in the space is known then we can determine the evolutionary trends of wris dsus and ssus fig 2 j depicts the evolutionary trends of eight representative interior points in a given scenario where two esss are 0 1 0 and 1 0 1 without loss of generality various evolutionary scenarios are discussed subsequently 2 6 evolutionary stable strategies to distinguish esss in the system we obtain the equilibrium point x x y z in the evolutionary dynamic system by setting eqs 15 17 equal to 0 simultaneously as follows 21 f x 0 f y 0 f z 0 solving 21 yields 13 local solutions including eight pure strategy equilibrium points namely x 1 0 0 0 x 2 1 0 0 x 3 0 1 0 x 4 0 0 1 x 5 1 1 0 x 6 1 0 1 x 7 0 1 1 and x 8 1 1 1 and five mixed strategy equilibrium points appendix a provides the specific analytical solutions notably not all equilibrium points can be esss because a few may not be robust to arbitrarily small disturbances according to selten 1988 ritzberger and weibull 1995 and cheng and yu 2018 esss in a multi subject game must be a strict nash equilibrium and pure strategy combination thus only eight pure strategy equilibrium points need to be analyzed to determine the conditions for the emergence of esss the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium points can be analyzed using liapunov s indirect method friedman 1998 lyapunov 1992 a local linear approximation is made to the system at the equilibrium point as follows 22 f x f y f z j x x f x x f x y f x z f y x f y y f y z f z x f z y f z z x x x x y y z z where j is the jacobian matrix if and only if all eigenvalues of j exhibit negative real parts then the asymptotic stability condition will be satisfied fang et al 2019 and the equilibrium point will be an ess table 3 presents the eigenvalues of j corresponding to different equilibrium points and the mutually exclusive relationship where equilibrium points with the mutually exclusive relationship cannot simultaneously comprise esss and where Œª i k represents the kth eigenvalue of equilibrium points x i i 1 2 8 and k 1 2 3 table 3 indicates that the evolution of the tripartite strategy in the system is influenced by many external variables among the eight pure strategy equilibrium points only x 8 1 1 1 cannot be an ess because Œª 8 1 always displays a positive real part from a realistic point of view a potential interpretation is that wri always benefits less from the intervention than non intervention when both dsu and ssu choose cooperation hence under the principle of economic rationality x 8 is not asymptotically stable this study aims to promote cooperation between water users thus the only ideal potential ess is x 7 0 1 1 which indicates that dsu and ssu will cooperate spontaneously even without intervention it is not difficult to deduce that when c 3 s 3 v 3 and m c 2 s 2 v 2 then all eigenvalues of x 7 will have negative real parts and x 7 will be an ess in the abovementioned first inequality the benefits of excess water intake for dsu are less than the sum of its use costs and established measure expenses that is the net benefits of excess water intake are negative in the second inequality the benefits of ssu from using water at volume q are less than the sum of its transfer expenses use costs and established measure expenses which implies that the net benefits of water rights transfer are positive if the abovementioned two inequalities are satisfied simultaneously then water users will cooperate spontaneously in water conflicts moreover according to the mutually exclusive relationship x 7 will be unique when it becomes an ess which helps exclude interference from other equilibrium points based on the conditions for the esss to hold table 4 presents the nine possible evolutionary scenarios in the system where y indicates that the corresponding equilibrium point is an ess and n denotes that it is not an ess among the potential esss only x 3 and x 6 are not mutually exclusive therefore there may be two esss scenario 9 one ess scenarios 2 8 or even no ess scenario 1 in the system 3 data and material a water conflict case in the hanjiang basin in china is simulated to justify the previous analysis which could provide deeper insights hubei and henan provinces are the two predominant provincial administrative regions in the middle and lower reaches of the hanjiang river fig 3 in 2016 the ministry of water resources of china set control targets for multi year average surface water intake in the hanjiang river by 2030 for the two provinces 11 733 billion m3 for hubei province and 2 528 billion m3 for henan province ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2016 however according to lv 2013 and chang et al 2016 the multi year average water demands of the two provinces by 2030 are expected to be 12 426 and 2 281 billion m3 respectively as a result water conflict may arise due to the difference between the allocated water and the actual water demand in this water conflict the ministry of water resources of china or its dispatched watershed management agency hubei province and henan province can be considered as the wri dsu and ssu respectively according to the previously mentioned water allocation plan and the actual water demand hubei province suffers from an annual water shortage of 6 93 108 m3 while henan province enjoys extra water rights of 2 47 108 m3 per year which are denoted as q 1 and q 2 respectively therefore when both sides cooperate henan province will transfer the additional water rights of 2 47 108 m3 which is q meanwhile hubei province will not violate the rules for water withdrawal because of the unmet water rights of 4 46 108 m3 marked as Œ¥ q the marginal revenue of water is estimated as the product of the gdp per cubic meter of water and the output elasticity coefficient of water peng and hu 2007 according to the statistical bulletin data from relevant departments henan water conservancy department 2022 hubei water conservancy department 2022 the average gdp per cubic meter of water in hubei and henan provinces from 2016 to 2020 is 136 00 yuan and 206 78 yuan respectively referring to peng and hu 2007 and lin 2017 we assume that the output elasticity coefficients of water in the two provinces do not differ and remain constant both taken as 0 11 therefore the marginal revenue of water in hubei and henan provinces is 14 96 yuan m3 and 22 75 yuan m3 respectively the values of the parameters related to water use benefits can then be obtained by calculating the product of the water volume and marginal revenue that is v 1 36 95 108 yuan v 2 56 19 108 yuan and v 3 66 72 108 yuan the total cost of water use is composed of the expenses for water intake water production water supply drainage and wastewater treatment according to the study by song et al 2018 the average unit cost of water use in central chinese cities is about 6 15 yuan m3 we use this value to calculate the parameters associated with the cost of water use thus resulting in c 1 c 2 15 19 108 yuan and c 3 27 43 108 yuan using the average price of 1 24 yuan m3 for regional water rights trading in china in 2020 china water exchange 2022 we compute the transfer expense of water rights to be 3 06 108 yuan which is m as for the established measure expenses the water conflict mainly affects the collection of the water resources fee in the two provinces currently the standard price of water resources fee for surface water in hubei and henan provinces is 0 1 yuan m3 and 0 4 yuan m3 respectively and the excess water withdrawal is usually charged twice the standard price department of finance of hubei province et al 2009 henan development and reform commission et al 2015 thus the values of the parameters related to established measure expenses are obtained based on this standard namely s 1 0 25 108 yuan s 2 0 99 108 yuan s 3 0 89 108 yuan and s 4 1 39 108 yuan referring to relevant laws and regulations standing committee of the national people s congress 2016 we set both the reward and penalty at five times the basic water resources fee corresponding to the respective surplus deficit water rights thus working out e 1 f 1 0 89 108 yuan and e 2 f 2 4 94 108 yuan regarding intervention costs we suppose g 0 20 108 yuan referencing similar measures hubei water conservancy department 2021 sichuan provincial finance department 2021 in particular h 1 h 2 h 3 and h 4 are estimated subjectively we assume that the relationship among them is h 1 h 3 h 2 h 4 the public benefits from saving water are not less than the benefits from using it and the losses from excess water withdrawal are not less than the benefits created by using it therefore setting h 1 v 2 v 1 19 24 108 yuan h 2 v 2 v 1 v 3 47 48 108 yuan h 3 0 and h 4 v 1 v 3 103 67 108 yuan may be appropriate the initial values of parameters are organized in table 5 4 simulation results 4 1 dynamic evolutionary trajectories of players fig 4 presents the vector field of the three dimensional dynamic system based on the given initial values and replicator dynamic equations in the space the eight pure strategy points are in a constant state however all equilibrium points except x 2 will evolve into others due to a slight shift in at least one of the x y and z directions in other words certain strategies dominate them any minor disturbance cannot make x 2 evolve into other points such that it is the only ess in the space no player is willing to change its current strategy unilaterally at x 2 the result is consistent with scenario 3 in table 4 and only eigenvalues corresponding to x 2 all display negative real parts in the vector field any point that falls into the interior point set Œ∏ in x y z 0 x 1 0 y 1 0 z 1 will eventually evolve into x 2 to better understand the long term evolutionary process we assign values to x y and z from 0 1 to 0 9 at 0 1 intervals and form 729 initial points for simulation verification fig 5 presents the evolutionary trajectories of the three groups where all initial points eventually evolve into x 2 thus the previous theoretical analysis is effectively verified when we change part of the variable values the eight other evolution scenarios in table 4 are also obtained see supplementary appendix b the influence of external variables on the evolutionary scenario transformation is discussed later 4 2 convergence time of players in this subsection the convergence time at different initial points is further examined under the given conditions first a few representative initial points are observed we assume that the points have an equal distance from the equilibrium in the x y and z directions where the distances are 0 1 close 0 5 moderate and 0 9 far respectively specifically the initial points are 0 9 0 1 0 1 0 5 0 5 0 5 and 0 1 0 9 0 9 as expected the three points eventually evolve into x 2 fig 6 a nevertheless the different initial points influence the time to reach equilibrium as shown in fig 6 b d wris reach equilibrium at t 0 9533 1 2448 and 1 5997 respectively dsus reach equilibrium at t 0 0934 0 1324 and 0 1804 respectively and ssus reach equilibrium at t 0 1748 0 2281 and 0 2600 respectively for the same group the greater the difference from the equilibrium value the longer the time to converge to equilibrium for the same initial point the relationship between the three parties in terms of convergence time is wris ssus dsus in other words dsus converge the fastest followed by ssus and wris when different groups exhibit an equal willingness to adopt the ess then the influence of changes in the initial willingness of a single group is examined we change the initial willingness of a group from 0 1 to 0 9 which indicates a shift from unwillingness to intervene cooperate to a strong desire for it meanwhile we retain the initial willingness of the other groups at 0 5 which indicates that they are neutral for wris as x increases from 0 1 fig 7 a to 0 9 fig 7 b the convergence times of wris dsus and ssus decrease from 1 5205 to 0 9855 increase from 0 1246 to 0 1397 and increase from 0 1972 to 0 2538 respectively which implies that a significant increase in the initial willingness of wris for intervention slows down the convergence of dsus and ssus toward non cooperation for dsus as y increases from 0 1 fig 7 c to 0 9 fig 7 d the convergence times of dsus wris and ssus increase from 0 0948 to 0 1739 increase from 1 2476 to 1 2868 and decrease from 0 2340 to 0 2255 respectively this result implies that a significant increase in the initial willingness of dsus for cooperation slows down the convergence of wris toward intervention but accelerates the convergence of ssus toward non cooperation for ssus as z increases from 0 1 fig 7 e to 0 9 fig 7 f the convergence times of ssus wris and dsus increase from 0 1553 to 0 2983 from 1 2240 to 1 3172 and from 0 1264 to 0 1524 respectively this finding implies that a significant increase in the initial willingness of ssus for cooperation slows down the convergence of wris toward intervention and dsus toward non cooperation 4 3 transformation of evolutionary scenarios the transformation of evolutionary scenarios due to changes in external variable values is tested in this subsection which may help decision makers achieve the desired target given that the initial points do not influence the ess and that the majority of scenarios have only one ess we set the initial values of x y and z as 0 5 first the effect of univariate changes on the ess is tested under the given conditions we change the ess from x 2 1 0 0 scenario 3 to x 1 0 0 0 scenario 2 by increasing g where x 0 becomes x 1 and the condition is g f 1 f 2 however reducing f 1 or f 2 cannot achieve the goal because both f 1 and f 2 are greater than g we set a f 1 f 2 and simulate the changes in the stable state at g 0 6a 0 8a a 1 2a and 1 4a respectively fig 8 illustrates that increasing intervention costs gradually makes wris choose non intervention when g a then x 1 is stable when g a then x 0 is stable when g a then no ess exists in the system and x is stable at a value between 0 and 1 the conversion of the ess from x 2 1 0 0 to x 5 1 1 0 scenario 6 is achieved by increasing c 1 c 3 s 4 f 1 or decreasing v 3 where y 0 becomes y 1 and the condition is c 1 c 3 s 4 e 1 f 1 v 1 v 3 limited by the given values in table 5 changing e 1 or v 1 cannot achieve the goal taking s 4 and v 3 as examples we set b v 1 v 3 c 1 c 3 e 1 f 1 and c c 1 c 3 s 4 e 1 f 1 v 1 and simulate the evolutionary paths at s 4 0 6b 0 8b b 1 2b and 1 4b respectively and v 3 0 6c 0 8c c 1 2c and 1 4c respectively fig 9 suggests that increasing established measure expenses for excess water or decreasing the benefits generated by excess water gradually makes dsus choose cooperation when s 4 b or v 3 c then y 0 is stable when s 4 b or v 3 c then y 1 is stable when s 4 b or v 3 c then no ess exists in the system and y is stable at a value between 0 and 1 the conversion of the ess from x 2 1 0 0 to x 4 0 0 1 scenario 5 is achieved by increasing m c 2 s 2 or decreasing v 2 where x 1 becomes x 0 and z 0 becomes z 1 and the condition is m c 2 s 2 v 2 taking m as an example d 1 v 2 c 2 s 2 e 2 f 2 and d 2 v 2 c 2 s 2 are two critical values we simulate the evolutionary paths at m 0 8d 1 d 1 0 5d 1 0 5d 2 d 2 and 1 2d 2 respectively fig 10 depicts that increasing transfer expenses gradually makes wris choose non intervention and makes ssus choose cooperation when m d 1 then x 1 and z 0 are stable and x 2 is the ess when m d 1 then x is stable at 1 z is stable at a value between 0 and 1 and the ess disappears from the system scenario 1 when d 1 m d 2 then x and z fluctuate periodically between 0 and 1 and no ess exists in the system when m d 2 then x is stable at 0 and z is stable at 1 but still no ess because x 4 cannot resist small disturbances lastly when m d 2 then x 0 and z 1 are stable and x 4 is the ess univariate changes can only transform the present ess x 2 1 0 0 into x 1 0 0 0 x 5 1 1 0 and x 4 0 0 1 however the ideal ess x 7 0 1 1 scenario 8 cannot be obtained thus how to achieve x 7 is tested next the goal is achieved by changing at least two variable values and the following two conditions need to be satisfied simultaneously i c 3 s 3 v 3 ii m c 2 s 2 v 2 in the previous test condition ii is satisfied when m is increased to 1 2d where the ess is shifted to x 4 when continuing to increase c 3 s 3 or decrease v 3 to satisfy condition i then the ess changes from x 4 to x 7 taking m and s 3 as examples we retain m 1 2d 2 and set e v 3 c 3 to simulate the evolutionary paths at s 3 0 6e 0 8e e 1 2e and 1 4e respectively fig 11 indicates that increasing established measure expenses for excess water can gradually make dsus choose cooperation when ssus are willing to cooperate when s 3 e y 0 is stable and x 4 is the ess when s 3 e y 1 is stable and x 7 is the ess when s 3 e there is no ess in the system and y is stable at a value between 0 and 1 finally the effectiveness of the intervention is tested in many realistic situations wris choose to intervene not only due to economic factors but non economic factors such as social political and environmental factors may also motivate the government to intervene niu et al 2014 in this case to avoid intervention failure testing which level of intervention is effective is necessary in this test we retain x 1 because it is known that wris choose intervention then the problem can be considered a two party game between dsus and ssus where x 2 1 0 0 x 5 1 1 0 x 6 1 0 1 and x 8 1 1 1 are the four potential esss setting f 1 v 1 v 3 c 1 c 3 s 4 f 2 v 3 c 3 s 3 g v 2 m c 2 s 2 f 1 e 1 and f 2 e 2 we simulate the transformation of the ess from x 2 to others fig 12 implies that increasing the reward and penalty can gradually make dsus and ssus choose cooperation when e 1 f 1 f 1 then y 1 is stable and the ess is shifted from x 2 to x 5 when e 2 f 2 g then z 1 is stable and the ess is shifted from x 2 to x 6 when e 1 f 1 f 2 and e 2 f 2 g then y 1 and z 1 are stable and x 8 is the ess notably f 2 is significantly lower than f 1 which indicates that the threshold for dsus to cooperate unilaterally is higher 5 discussion 5 1 role of water resources institutions in water conflicts as the world faces a growing water crisis more and more parties with different interests are drawn into water conflicts the involvement of multiple participants is now a vital characteristic of the system from an evolutionary dynamics perspective this study explores how wris dsus and ssus behave in water conflicts under a broadly applicable problem setting although wris do not act directly on water resources they have their own options of action in water conflicts which as how to intervene in the behavior of water users wris are accountable for maintaining orderly water use in the basin so they are inclined to intervene when users in the system exhibit non cooperative behavior our results suggest that wris cannot sustain the intervention strategy to achieve the ideal state where all users are cooperative due to insufficient incentives implying that cooperation among water users cannot rely on the intervention of wris however the intervention strategy can serve as a supplementary means to overcome the shortcomings of the game structure caused by immature external conditions which can facilitate cooperation at an earlier stage but at the cost of some of the wris interests as the results presented in fig 12 wris can foster cooperation among users under immature external conditions by establishing a dynamic incentive and constraint mechanism when the existing game conditions are far from inducing spontaneous cooperation among users the reward and penalty can be set relatively higher which can be progressively reduced as the conditions improve for cooperation the intervention can be terminated when the conditions fully meet the requirements for spontaneous cooperation furthermore by guiding some external variables that are closely related to them wris can foster a game structure that promotes spontaneous cooperation in the model x 7 0 1 1 lies the only ideal potential ess and is achieved on the condition that c 3 s 3 v 3 and m c 2 s 2 v 2 are both satisfied illustrating that water users will cooperate spontaneously even without intervention the realization of this scenario involves several variables that are affected by wris especially the established measure expenses s 3 and s 2 and water rights transfer expenses m established measure expenses arise from some measures developed by wris before water conflicts such as levying water resource taxes which generally exert a binding effect on excess water use zhong and mol 2010 however the occurrence of water conflicts indicates that these measures are not sufficiently binding as a result wris can facilitate cooperation by strengthening the effectiveness of these measures as for water rights transfer expenses it can be accomplished through administrative or quasi market means in which wris play an essential role speed 2009 accordingly wris can also promote cooperation by supporting water rights transfer notably the thresholds of variables that alter the game structure are crucial information for wris from the preceding simulations the illusion of cooperation may arise when external conditions are not satisfied due to the short sightedness of the players resulting from their bounded rationality for instance fig 10 shows that ssus choice alternates periodically between cooperation and non cooperation when d 1 m d 2 in which the cooperation strategy is not stable in the long term outcome despite the temporary increase in the cooperative intention consequently wris still need to develop conditions for cooperation similarly the illusion of non cooperation may also arise even when spontaneous cooperation conditions are reached for example as depicted in fig 11 b when m 1 2d 2 and s 3 e the cooperation intention of dsus drops at first and then increases and stabilizes at 1 implying that the cooperation strategy is stable in the long term outcome therefore wris do not need to develop further conditions and can patiently wait for full cooperation to emerge understanding the threshold of cooperation can help wris not to be misled by these illusions thus reducing the risk of decision making 5 2 key factors for promoting cooperation one of the important objectives of this study is to investigate how to promote cooperative behavior among water users in a system according to its dynamic evolution characteristics as reflected in our results the cooperation will not be robust only until the conditions for spontaneous cooperation are satisfied otherwise it can be easily disrupted by minor disturbances in addition different from the findings of yuan et al 2022 in a two party game context the initial state of players does not affect the cooperation under this research question setting when spontaneous cooperation conditions are met therefore the factors that can lead to spontaneous cooperation are primarily discussed and analyzed from the perspectives of dsus and ssus respectively for dsus the essential factor that influences their behavior is the net benefits of excess water intake since several variables constitute this factor they need to be examined holistically when the benefits of excess water intake are less than the sum of its use costs and established measure expenses i e c 3 s 3 v 3 dsus will tend to cooperate because the net benefits of excess water intake are negative yu et al 2019 argued that incremental benefits are the foundation for cooperation and implied that water users would cooperate if they could obtain more benefits from cooperation meanwhile the simulation outcomes reveal an impact of the net benefits on the convergence time that the larger the absolute value of the net benefits the stronger the motivation for players to cooperate which accelerates the reaching of equilibrium for players consistently the key factor influencing the behavior of ssus is the net benefits of water rights transfer when the sum of the transfer expenses use costs and established measure expenses of the extra water rights are greater than the benefits i e m c 2 s 2 v 2 then ssus will tend to cooperate because the net benefits of water rights transfer are positive if more benefits can be gained from the water rights transfer then ssus will choose to cooperate more quickly in the case simulation a potential water conflict case in the hanjiang basin china is analyzed the simulation results show x 2 1 0 0 as the only ess under the given parameters which is not ideal as the cooperation between dsus and ssus is not promoted followed by ineffective intervention the existing external conditions are far from achieving spontaneous cooperation as a result wris could implement targeted measures for the above two factors however it is worth noting that dsus may not opt to cooperate if only the relevant conditions of dsus are met as reflected by the results in fig 12 when we attempt to alter the game structure through intervention due to the absence of concession from ssus the threshold for dsus to cooperate unilaterally is higher than that for spontaneous cooperation therefore to render cooperation easier for dsus wris can first make ssus willing to cooperate 6 conclusions to elucidate the dynamic evolution characteristics and resolutions of water conflicts involving wris dsus and ssus we construct a tripartite evolutionary game model among them the tripartite evolutionary dynamics and esss in the system are analyzed through a water conflict case in the hanjiang basin in china we simulate the long term evolutionary outcome and the feasible paths to achieve cooperation among water users the major conclusions are as follows 1 the dynamic evolution characteristics of water conflicts concerning wris dsus and ssus are revealed based on evolutionary game theory under different conditions of external variables seven tripartite pure strategies except for 1 1 1 may become esss in the system and it is possible that no ess exists however only 0 1 0 and 1 0 1 may be esss simultaneously owing to the mutually exclusive relationship between strategies thus there are seven potential esss and nine possible evolutionary scenarios in the system when the conditions for achieving the ideal ess 0 1 1 i e spontaneous cooperation are met the long term outcome is independent of the initial willingness of participants 2 since the long term incentives for wris are insufficient cooperation among water users cannot rely on the intervention strategy however if wris can contribute part of their own interests then the intervention strategy can act as a complementary means to overcome the defects in the game structure when external conditions are immature thus enabling water users to cooperate earlier 3 the only ess in the water conflict in the hanjiang basin in china under the given external conditions is 1 0 0 which means that this water conflict is likely to lead to a scenario of non cooperation among water users and ineffective intervention from wris to foster cooperation the external variables concerning the net benefits of the excess water intake and water rights transfer need to be altered if external conditions can enable ssus to gain positive net benefits from water rights transfer and dsus to incur negative net benefits from excess water intake both dsus and ssus will cooperate and the larger the absolute value of the net benefits the earlier the cooperation is realized the present study mainly examines the evolution of water conflicts based on the primary interest connections of participants and draws some practical conclusions however due to the more complex and variable relationships between players in practice the model s applicability may be limited by relevant assumptions and simplifications nevertheless the insights obtained through evolutionary game theory seem to be widely applicable and helpful future research is expected to further elucidate the deeper relationships between players and explore the game mechanisms of non homogeneous groups under dynamic parameters credit authorship contribution statement yang cao conceptualization data

2063,accurate and timely mapping of inundation extents during flood periods is essential for disaster evaluation and development of rescue strategies with unique advantages over the optical sensors e g little effect of clouds and observations at day and night synthetic aperture radar sar sensors provide an important data source for mapping inundation particularly during flood periods freely available sar images from sentinel 1 have been increasingly used for many applications this study applied an efficient transformer based change detection method bitemporal image transformer bit with bitemporal sentniel 1 images to map inundation extents and evolution in poyang lake area in 2020 the transformer based change detection method firstly adopted resnet for high level semantic features extraction and applied a transformer mechanism to refine these features pixel wise followed by employing a fcn as the prediction head for generating the results of change detection besides we constructed a water change detection dataset with spatial and temporal generalization from bitemporal sentinel 1 images this dataset consists of the seasonal variation water samples of poyang lake for years we compared the results from the bit method with other convolutional neural network cnn based methods stanets and snunet mapped inundation extents were evaluated with the ground truth visually derived from high spatial resolution images the evaluation showed the bit method generated high accurate mapped inundation extents with the f1 score of 95 5 the bit model has proven its superior performance in detecting increased water based on the results of the bit method the variation of inundation extents in poyang lake during may november 2020 was further analyzed it was found that the water surface coverage of poyang lake is the smallest in late may it gradually increased to the maximum on 14th july and then began to stabilize and show a significant downward trend before november the flood distribution map shows that cultivated land has been inundated with the largest area of approximately 600 km2 keywords change detection transformer deep learning sar flood monitoring poyang lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods are extremely destructive and pose a significant threat to the environment human lives and property zeng et al 2020 floods have the characteristics of wide range a frequent occurrence and short duration but catastrophic consequences china experienced a large scale flood disaster in 2020 with more than 148 rivers exceeding the warning water level when the rainy season comes it will often cause a wide range of rainstorms and flood disasters from northeast north china to jianghuai it is crucial to monitor the flood and map the distribution of the inundation area for disaster relief and assessment qiu et al 2021 qiang et al 2021 satellite remote sensing provides an indispensable data source for mapping inundation extents and flooding so far research on using satellite data for flood monitoring can be divided into two categories in terms of used data optical remote sensing and microwave remote sensing tong et al 2018 ban et al 2017 many different satellite based water indexes have been developed based on the distinctive difference in the specular reflection between water and other l objects for example mcfeeters proposed the ndwi normalized difference water index in 1996 using the reflectance from the green and near infrared bands mcfeeters 1996 several improved water indexes were proposed including mndwi modified normalized difference water index xu 2006 mbwi multi band water index wang et al 2018a muwi multi spectral water index wang et al 2018b etc these water indexes enhance the difference between water and non water objects in the multi spectral images by the ratio operation machine learning or deep learning methods are increasingly used to separate open water from other land features for example nandi extracted the water information using landsat 8 images with the support vector machine method nandi et al 2017 sun compared the adaboost and random forest algorithms on the performance of water extraction and their results showed that adaboost was more suitable for water body extraction in gf 1 satellite imagery data sun et al 2020 the deep learning techniques such as the deep convolution neural network dcnn have strong feature expression ability and great advantages in image interpretation dcnn is recently used to extract the water features in satellite images with good performance reported dong et al 2019 wang et al 2020 compared the deep learning technique with the conventional ndwi and they found that the deep learning method densenet was much better in distinguishing water from clouds and mountain shadows although the optical satellite generally provides images at a high spatial resolution it suffers from the influences of thick clouds and rainfall resulting in poor quality images during flood events or periods goffi et al 2020 moreover optical satellites cannot operate at night due to the unavailability of illumination in contrast synthetic aperture radar sar satellite has unique advantages for observing the land surface regardless of the weather condition kitajima et al 2021 besides it can observe the earth at night without relying on solar illumination thanks to the characteristics of active microwave remote sensing refice et al 2020 as a result sar has been used widely for various applications such as landslides monitoring ma et al 2021 flood mapping dong et al 2021 monitoring of wetlands mohammadimanesh et al 2021 and production estimation clauss et al 2018 the main principle for using sar images to identify inundation extent is based on the unique reflection of the target water body at the microwave length the water body will mirror reflect a large amount of radiation energy which leads to low backscatter coefficients in the sar images mahoney et al 2020 therefore the threshold segmentation is the most classical method to distinguish water body from non water areas in the threshold method the pixels with backscatter coefficients lower than the given threshold are assigned to the water class lingyan et al 2015 however determining an optimal threshold is not easy and it is affected by many factors such as atmospheric interference and polarization mode cian et al 2018 the otsu method is widely used for threshold acquisition but many studies have shown that it is unreliable to extract water body sekertekin 2021 li et al 2021 the change detection is used to extract the change information of interest from satellite images in different periods for the same region it has been widely applied for urban expansion fekete 2020 landuse change monitoring karthick et al 2017 and more recently for mapping flooded areas huang and jin 2020 gul√°csi and kov√°cs 2020 for example gong et al 2011 fused the mean ratio difference map and log ratio difference map to greatly improve the quality of difference map from sar images which improved the accuracy of the algorithm for change detection xiang et al 2018 used landsat data to detect the impervious surface change in beijing tianjin tangshan area during 1996 2015 and reflected the different temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of urban expansion gong et al 2015 built a change detection model using deep neural networks which has achieved excellent results in multi temporal change detection in sar images lyu et al 2016 combined the advantages of long short term memory lstm and recurrent neural network rnn and designed a new algorithm and successfully applied it to multispectral or hyperspectral change detection wang et al 2021 proposed an attention mechanism based deep supervision network for the change detection of bi temporal remote sensing images which has better effectiveness and robustness than other change detection methods sefrin et al 2021 proved that the combination of fully convolutional network fcn and lstm outperformed the fcn on detecting the land covers in recent studies on change detection in remote sensing many methods have proven their ability to recognize changes of interest by comparing the bitemporal images change detection methods relied on the cnn based structure were used widely in remote sensing applications due to its capacity to extract high level features from co registered images these methods applied more convolution layers dilated convolution and attention mechanisms to increase the reception field zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2018 however there is still a limitation in obtaining the long range relation in the spatial and temporal scale moreover inefficient and complicated computation make many change detection methods fail to apply well in the massive remote sensing data in this study we aimed to test and evaluate the performance of a transformer based change detection method in mapping inundation extents in poyang lake area using sar images from sentinel 1 we generated a water change detection dataset for poyang lake area using the sar images from sentinel 1 bitemporal images in the poyang lake area for several years were adopted for labeling in order to satisfy the spatial and temporal generalization we applied the transform based model bit along with two cnn based methods stanets and snunet to our water change detection dataset to examine the abilities to recognize the changed water then the variation of inundation extents in poyang lake area during the summer flood in 2020 was further analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the poyang lake n28 24 29 46 e115 49 116 46 is the largest freshwater lake in china which is located in the north of jiangxi province and the middle reach of the yangtze river the area of the poyang lake basin exceeds 162200 km2 which accounts for around 9 of the yangtze river area the poyang lake is a typical seasonal lake that is influenced by the catchment inflow and the interaction with the yangtze river during the rainy season the poyang lake area transcends 3800 km2 regularly while in the dry season the lake area will decline considerably the poyang lake is recharged by five tributaries including ganjiang river fuhe river xinjiang river raohe river xiushui river the complex topography and characteristics of subtropical monsoon climate make the poyang lake easy to occur flood events fig 1 shows that the digital elevation model dem of the poyang lake basin varies from the northern plain at the elevations of 142 m to the southern mountains at the elevations of 3090 m above the mean sea level the poyang lake basin has complex terrains land covers in the basin differ sharply including water bodies cultivated land forest wetland artificial surfaces etc from late june to early july 2020 the poyang lake basin encountered heavy rainfall and the rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river was 1 5 times higher than the annual average many areas in jiangxi province were attacked by flood events many times due to multiple heavy rainstorms 2 2 data sentinel 1 is the earth observation satellite mission launched by the european space agency esa copernicus program there are two satellites sentinel 1a and 1b they were launched in 2014 and 2016 respectively the revisit period of each sentinel 1 is 12 days sentinel 1 a and b satellites can survey the earth every 6 days by the dual constellations twele et al 2016 the c band sar sensor carried by sentinel 1 has four imaging modes including interferometric wide swath iw strip map sw extra wide swath ew and wave wv mode high spatio temporal resolution and powerful penetration ability make sentinel 1 superior in observing the ground surface all day in any weather condition regardless of clouds fogs and rains various levels of products from sentinel 1 are provided freely for research on flood area changes landslides and estimation of crop yield aslan et al 2020 this study used 21 sar images from sentinel 1a and 1b in the ground range detected grd mode acquired in may and july from 2017 to 2020 grd products provide sar data with a high spatial resolution of 10 m and dual polarization modes vertical horizontal polarization vertical vertical polarization grd products are widely applied for analysis of the characteristics of water bodies and monitoring flood events amitrano et al 2018 yunjee et al 2020 in this study all the sentinel 1 grd products were radiometrically calibrated to the sigma naught db then the images were terrain corrected and projected to the world geodetic system 1984 for subsequent processing meimei et al 2020 2 3 methods the methods used in this study mainly consist of three main steps firstly a high resolution water change detection dataset from sentinel 1 data was constructed then we applied three methods the snunet stanets and bit and compared their performance in change detection of water for the sake of a fair comparison we operated all the methods on the same server equipped with an nvidia tesla t4 gpu which was configured with pytorch 1 8 1 independent ground truth were used to evaluate these three methods and finally the best performing method was identified and employed for detecting the changed water in poyang lake area during the summer flood in 2020 furthermore we overlaid the increased water on the land cover map to analyze the inundation distribution 2 3 1 water change detection dataset the applications of deep learning on remote sensing rely on large datasets with good quality therefore we introduced the water change detection dataset annotated by the sentinel 1 data to analyse the flood in the poyang lake area in 2020 and provide a public remote sensing dataset for developing the change detection algorithms 6 3 pairs of sar images from sentinel 1 in the grd mode acquired in the poyang lake area were collected for implementing the tested methods a total number of 15 images during the summer flood may nov 2020 were utilized for studying the evolution of floods detecting the change of water area is very important to analyze the flood event high spatio temporal resolution sar images offer a great opportunity to monitor these changes the backscatter coefficient determines the brightness of ground objects in sar images objects with a larger backscatter coefficient show brighter while that with a lower backscatter coefficient show darker in the sar images waterbody would generally have low backscatter coefficients around 23 db in our study because of specular reflection meimei et al 2020 therefore we annotated the change regions of water body in all the pairs of sar images as white color the final binary classification labels are composed of changed and non changed regions because the change detection for remote sensing data directly tends to be time and memory consuming we divided the original input images into the size of 256 256 pixels to improve the efficiency of data loading finally we had 6296 pairs of water change detection samples these samples were further divided to three sets with 70 of all samples as the training set 20 as the validation set and 10 as the test set fig 2 shows some typical samples in our dataset which consists of the bitemporal sar images and the corresponding ground truth label 2 3 2 the stanets snunet and bit models the stanets method the stanets introduced a self attention mechanism for feature extraction because that can model the long range spatial temporal relationships chen et al 2020 such global relationships are beneficial for detecting the change of interest regardless of the influence of misregistration and illumination diversity besides the self attention module can help networks extract the high level features of the same object in various times and spaces for extracting the multi scale features of objects we applied the pyramid attention architecture in the stanets model for example the input images will be firstly divided into the same scale sub images and the self attention mechanism will be adopted to explore the spatial temporal relationship of each sub image then we can extract features with multiple scales to obtain the change of the interest objects in bitemporal images by integrating the spatial temporal relationships of multiple scale images there are three modules in stanets a basic module without a self attention mechanism referred to as stanet base one basic spatial temporal attention module stanet bam and one pyramid spatial temporal attention module stanet pam the snunet method the snunet is a densely connected siamese network based on the encoder decoder structure it can keep high resolution and fine grained features from remote sensing images by being equipped with a densely skip connection fang et al 2021 the siamese network owns two branches for processing the input bitemporal images separately and the two branches parameters are shared we apply the concatenation for fusing the features extracted from two branches to enrich the spatial temporal information in the bitemporal images then the fine grained localization features are transmitted and maintained through the skip connections from the encoder to four sub decoders outputs of nodes in shallow sub decoders will be connected to the nodes in deep sub decoders of the same size for further utilization therefore the snunet produces four feature maps of the same size as the original images but the semantic levels and spatial localization representations vary between those four outputs the shallow sub decoders obtain the finer grained features and precise localization information while the deep ones obtain the coarse grained features and richer semantic information the ensemble channel attention module ecam which is inspired by cam is designed for suppressing such gaps when fusing those features the four outputs are summed first and the intra group relations are extracted by the cam then four output groups are concatenated and followed by another cam for extracting the inter group relations 1 1 convolution layer is applied for generating the final change map results the bitemporal image transformer bit method the bit can effectively model the long range spatial temporal relationships of interest objects in bitemporal remote sensing images chen et al 2021 as is shown in fig 3 the bit consists of the semantic tokenizer transformer encoder and transformer decoder at the beginning the resnet the classic cnn semantic segmentation network is employed to extract features from the bitemporal images because it is inefficient for modeling the dense relationships pixel by pixel in the semantic tokenizer with the intuition of describing high level concepts of the interest change as some visual words the input bitemporal images the siamese tokenizer learns a series of spatial attention maps and represents them into several semantic tokens then we applied the transformer encoder to model the contextual relationships between the above semantic tokens since the transformer can extract the globally spatial temporal context completely we operated the extraction for rich tokens from each bitemporal feature representations we introduced the multi head self attention msa and multilayer perceptron mlp blocks in the transformer encoder because the msa does well in focusing on the information of different representation sub spaces from different locations and the mlp block is composed of two linear transformation layers with one grlu activation function in the middle after the transformer encoding the semantic tokens own rich high grade information for revealing the interest changes of objects in bitemporal images for obtaining the pixel wise features representation the modified siamese transformer decoder is adopted to refine the features of bitemporal images by projecting the semantic tokens into the features pixel based the transformer decoder explores the relationships between the semantic tokens and each pixel in the feature maps which were extracted by the resnet with the intuition of each pixel can be described by the semantic tokens at last according to the rich semantic features pixel wise we employ an fcn as the prediction head for generating change detection results the differences of stanets snunet and bit models are clearly listed in table1 compared with other cnn based models the bit model has the unique transformer based structure unet is applied for feature extraction by the snunet while the stanets and bit models employs the resnet 18 as the feature extractor meanwhile different attention mechanisms are adopted in those models which have been shown in the table1 and the detailed comparison and their shortages of performance on results are shown in section 3 2 3 3 evaluation metrics we chose the precision recall and f1 score of the change category as the metrics to evaluate the performance of the snunet stanets and bit in detecting the water changes using the ground truth samples these metrics are based on the confusion matrix and are widely used to assess the capability of deep learning algorithms yu et al 2018 chen et al 2021 the precision represents the ratio of the true positive samples to all samples predicted to the changed samples recall represents the ratio of the true positive samples to all the correct samples the f1 score is the harmonic average of the precision and recall the formulas of metrics are described below 1 precision tp tp f p 2 recall tp tp f n 3 f 1 2 p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l precision r e c a l l where tp fp tn and fn stand for the true positive false positive true negative and false negative respectively 3 results 3 1 comparisons of the stanets snunet and bit models fig 4 exhibits the running efficiency of the stanets snunet and bit models in terms of the training losses and the f1 scores loss functions were applied to assess the fitting ability for optimizing the models in the training stage while f1 scores were used to evaluate the performances of models with the validation dataset we used the cross entropy as the loss function since change detection focuses on distinguishing the changed and unchanged regions in remote sensing images as the epochs increase the curve becomes lower and smoother which indicates that the fitness and robustness of the corresponding network are better as shown in fig 4 a we draw the loss curves to intuitively compare the efficiency of the stanet base bam and pam model snunet and bit models at the beginning of the epochs the bit has the lowest loss which was followed by the base bam and pam model the snunet model owns the highest in the initial epochs which was several times higher than other four models then the loss value of snunet dropped quickly within five epochs in the last 90 epochs the snunet s loss curve becomes convergent and lower than the stanets the base and bam models have similar fitting performance on the training stage and their loss curves own the almost trend but small fluctuations the pam model acquires a better fitting performance than the base and bam models the bit model obtains the lowest loss curve among all the methods whose loss value remains lower and smooth during the training stage fig 4 b describes the f1 score curves of models on the validation dataset the higher the f1 score curve the better the performance although the loss curve of the snunet ranks second the snunet s f1 score value is the worst there is still no sharp gap between the f1 score curves of the base and bam models just like their training performances the f1 score values of the pam model have nearly 0 1 point higher than the base and bam models the bit model owns the highest f1 score among such five models corresponding to the bit s lowest loss curve to compare the efficiencies of all the models fairly we evaluated their performance in terms of the selected metrics precision recall and f1 score table 2 and 3 shows the detailed and digital performance of the five models on the validation and test dataset respectively the bit model has the highest precision value of 0 96 on the validation dataset indicating that 96 of the changed samples are recognized correctly within all the samples which are predicted as changed the precision values of the snunet base bam and pam models are 0 83 0 82 0 81 and 0 89 respectively the stanet bam model has the worst performance in terms of the precision value which is 7 5 lower than the bit against the validation dataset however the highest recall value 0 97 is from the stanet bam the remaining recall values are 0 95 bit 0 947 stanet pam 0 93 stanet base and 0 83 snunet respectively since the bit model has the best precision and the second recall values against the validation dataset its f1 score ranks first among all models evaluated the snunet has the lowest f1 score value of 0 83 which is 4 9 lower than the stanets in order to better assess the practical learning ability of models we implemented these models to the test dataset which is widely used to evaluate the generalization ability of the final model the evaluation showed that the bit model has the precision value of 0 91 which is still the highest among all investigated models against the test database the precision value of the base bam and pam models are 0 69 0 66 and 0 73 respectively the snunet has the middle precision of 0 82 between the bit and stanets there is no such big difference in the recall among five models although the bit owns the third recall value the bit model ranks the first with an f1 score of 0 96 which is higher than the snunet 0 85 because the stanets has the lowest precision values the f1 scores values are not as good as the other models considering the performances of different models against the the validation and test datasets the bit has the best efficiency and effectiveness 3 2 visualization results in order to compare the performance of each model in detail we selected several pairs of sub images to explore their abilities for water change detection fig 5 shows five change types of water caused by the flooding images of time 1 time 2 represent the original sentinel 1 images acquired on 27th may and 14th july 2020 in the poyang lake area respectively and the ground truths mean the corresponding labels of increased water the remaining images in figure are the results from different models the bit model has the best performance in detecting the changed water from bitemporal images as is shown clearly in the binary images the recognition results of the bit are closest to the ground truths fig 5a and 5b show that the bit method well captured the changed regions besides the bit preserves clearer and more complete boundaries than other models the snunet model fails to detect detailed change for mountainous areas and loses the high resolution boundary information it is shown in fig 5a that the effects of the snunet on recognizing the increased water in the mountains are not good except for this the result of the bam model is vulnerable to the mountain shadows with a similarly low backscatter coefficient to water the snunets pam and bit models perform better than the base and bam models in the lower left quarter region of fig 5b in fig 5c although the increased water can be identified almost by the five models the results of the base and bam models are a little bigger than the ground truth because they are not sensitive to the tiny change information combined with the recognition results from fig 5d and 5e the stanets have the weak ability to distinguish the tiny unchanged regions from all the changed parts because the stanets own the worst precision value among the five models in fig 5d the stanets identify the existing slender rivers as the increased water inundated by the flood in contrary the snunet and bit perform better than stanets in complex terrains owing to the second f1 score value the snunet has just a few wrong recognition results in the middle of fig 5d therefore it can be concluded that the bit has the best performance in detecting the changing water these models visualization results are consistent with their performances against the test set 3 3 evolution of the flood in june 2020 due to the influence of the subtropical high in the northwest pacific the rainy season in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river was advanced and the rainfall was much stronger than the same period in history as a result the water level of many hydrological stations exceeded the historical high record in 1998 among them the water level of poyang lake in jiangxi soared and the lake area was the largest in the last ten years given such advantageous performance of the bit model it was chosen as the best representative method to monitor the flood of poyang lake in 2020 we selected the sentinel 1 data on 27th may 2020 as the image in the normal water period and the reference image before the flood event subsequently we overlaid the increased water extracted from the 12 day images with the bit model on the reference image and display them in rgb channels to depict the evolution of the flood the white blue and red colors in fig 6 are defined as the background original water and increased water region respectively the water area of poyang lake on 27th may 2020 was the smallest in our selected images then increased gradually from june to early july water in other places of the image on 2ed july also started to extend to form the flood as shown in fig 6 the whole water body on 14th july expanded rapidly and the flood area d the maximum among all images exceeding the original water area there was no significant change in the flood area since late july due to such a small variation in the increased area can be figured out the flood stabilized and started to retract from july to october and the poyang lake returned to its normal area till the 11th november in order to further analyze the losses caused by the summer flood in the poyang lake area in 2020 we combined the water inundation area extracted from the sentinel 1 image by the bit model on 14th july with the land cover type to count the inundation area caused by the flood to different land cover types in the study area fig 7 shows the raster data of the land cover types in the main poyang lake area which was provided by the global geo information public product at a high spatial resolution of 30 m https www globallandcover com this global land cover data product includes 7 classes in our study area cultivated land forest grassland wetland waterbody artificial surface and bare land it can be seen from fig 7 that the main land cover types in the study area are cultivated land forest and grassland the most artificial surfaces gather around the ganjiang river and other streams we overlaid the inundation area relative increased water on 14th july on the land cover distribution map to analyze the inundation status of different land cover types the red region in fig 7 is the inundation area which was mainly distributed in the agricultural lands and the island shoal wetlands in the middle of poyang lake in fig 8 according to the spatial resolution of the global land cover data product we counted the distribution area of flood inundation in different ground feature types to quantitative analyze the disaster loss in the poyang lake region in our study area the total inundation area caused by the summer flood was about 770 km2 the statistical chart shows that the cultivated land is the largest land cover type which was inundated by the flood disaster with an inundation area of almost 600 km2 the second seriously affected land cover type is the wetland which has been inundated nearly 72 km2 the inundation area of grassland reaches 47 km2 which is 6 km2 more than forest the small distribution range of urban areas in our study area is the artificial surfaces and bare land have the least inundation area of less than 10 km2 the cultivated land forest grassland and wetland are mainly distributed around the poyang lake area the artificial surfaces and bare land cover rather fewer areas combined with the inundation distribution map and the total statistical area a large amount of agricultural land has been destroyed worst which led to the decline in agricultural products and economic losses 4 discussion it is worth noting that we can monitor flooding dynamically and precisely with sar imagery data from sentinel 1 at high spatial and temporal resolutions compared with the traditional cnn based structure methods of change detection the transform based model bit showed its excellent performance and high efficiency both the stanets and snunet model failed to detect the small detailed changes and lost the high resolution boundary information in particular for some regions with complex topography both stanets or the snunet model cannot well distinguish the mountain shadow changes due to their similar backscatter coefficients to water the bit model had the best performance in water change detection with high precision thanks to the first rate structure and high quality dataset the bit model can recognize the increased water from brand new images in a few seconds the bit model can differentiate increased water better from similar changes and extract detailed information even the tiny water change however we find that the noises in sar images would affect the result of inundation area identification since the defect of the coherence principle besides the land cover data products have the disadvantage of relatively poor timeliness in order to improve the performance of our models we recommend to add a specialized module of reducing speckle noise in networks scientifically based on radar imaging mechanisms in the future studies in addition we advise future studies to obtain the land types classified by networks from high resolution optical images rather than applying the land cover data products then combine with the flood extraction to quantitatively analyze the losses caused by floods to different land types hu et al 2022 recent works inspired us that adopting few meteorological data and socioeconomic dataset is of great useful for analyzing floods their research found out that flooding risks increasing due to the high socioeconomic exposure and vulnerability of the lower yellow river basin in china ning et al 2021 used observational and reanalysis dataset to investigate the underlying mechanisms and long term trend of extreme precipitation events which may cause disastrous flooding in xinjiang thus taking more factors into account will provide more convincing evidence for analyzing the evolution of flood and its disaster damage our work demonstrates the good applicability of deep learning methods in flood monitoring with satellite data however 12 days revisit period of sentinel 1 in poyang lake basin limits the timely and precise monitoring fast occurring floods the shortcoming of the relative long revisit time of satellites is an obstacle for few monitoring missions by remote sensing technique such as monitoring the floods or forest fires in future combined with higher spatio temporal resolution satellites data the deep learning methods will show more powerful advantage for the purposes of remote sensing applications with the soaring development of satellite technology we expect the increasing needs for applying such advanced algorithms to help us exploring large volume and multi dimension data aside from change detection applications other deep learning methods such as semantic segmentation networks have been reported to have good performance in the classification of multiple ground features with high efficiency tong et al 2018 ding et al 2021 gu et al 2021 thus it is relevant and interesting to test different methods for mapping inundation areas and monitoring floods 5 conclusions in this study a total number of 21 sar images from sentinel 1 acquired in may and july from 2017 to 2020 were used to construct a high resolution water change detection dataset the water change detection dataset consists of the seasonal variation water samples of poyang lake for several years to meet the good temporal and spatial generalization therefore the dataset can be applied in the identification of increased water floods in different regions and seasons meanwhile the bit model which is based on an outstanding transform based architecture has proven its better performance than cnn based structure methods the stanets or the snunet model the bit model can successfully detect the increased water from the sentinel 1 images with high accuracy besides the bit model can capture detailed information without being influenced by mountain shadows and complex terrain we applied the bit model further to analyze the dynamics of inundation extents of the poyang lake area from may to november in 2020 the lake area on 27th may was the smallest and increased rapidly to the maximum by 14th july then the inundation area started to recede significantly and the lake area returned to the normal state until early november we will improve the proposed bit models in the future by adding a reasonable function of removing noises in sar images before extracting features in addition we plan to apply the semantic segmentation algorithms to multi object

2063,accurate and timely mapping of inundation extents during flood periods is essential for disaster evaluation and development of rescue strategies with unique advantages over the optical sensors e g little effect of clouds and observations at day and night synthetic aperture radar sar sensors provide an important data source for mapping inundation particularly during flood periods freely available sar images from sentinel 1 have been increasingly used for many applications this study applied an efficient transformer based change detection method bitemporal image transformer bit with bitemporal sentniel 1 images to map inundation extents and evolution in poyang lake area in 2020 the transformer based change detection method firstly adopted resnet for high level semantic features extraction and applied a transformer mechanism to refine these features pixel wise followed by employing a fcn as the prediction head for generating the results of change detection besides we constructed a water change detection dataset with spatial and temporal generalization from bitemporal sentinel 1 images this dataset consists of the seasonal variation water samples of poyang lake for years we compared the results from the bit method with other convolutional neural network cnn based methods stanets and snunet mapped inundation extents were evaluated with the ground truth visually derived from high spatial resolution images the evaluation showed the bit method generated high accurate mapped inundation extents with the f1 score of 95 5 the bit model has proven its superior performance in detecting increased water based on the results of the bit method the variation of inundation extents in poyang lake during may november 2020 was further analyzed it was found that the water surface coverage of poyang lake is the smallest in late may it gradually increased to the maximum on 14th july and then began to stabilize and show a significant downward trend before november the flood distribution map shows that cultivated land has been inundated with the largest area of approximately 600 km2 keywords change detection transformer deep learning sar flood monitoring poyang lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods are extremely destructive and pose a significant threat to the environment human lives and property zeng et al 2020 floods have the characteristics of wide range a frequent occurrence and short duration but catastrophic consequences china experienced a large scale flood disaster in 2020 with more than 148 rivers exceeding the warning water level when the rainy season comes it will often cause a wide range of rainstorms and flood disasters from northeast north china to jianghuai it is crucial to monitor the flood and map the distribution of the inundation area for disaster relief and assessment qiu et al 2021 qiang et al 2021 satellite remote sensing provides an indispensable data source for mapping inundation extents and flooding so far research on using satellite data for flood monitoring can be divided into two categories in terms of used data optical remote sensing and microwave remote sensing tong et al 2018 ban et al 2017 many different satellite based water indexes have been developed based on the distinctive difference in the specular reflection between water and other l objects for example mcfeeters proposed the ndwi normalized difference water index in 1996 using the reflectance from the green and near infrared bands mcfeeters 1996 several improved water indexes were proposed including mndwi modified normalized difference water index xu 2006 mbwi multi band water index wang et al 2018a muwi multi spectral water index wang et al 2018b etc these water indexes enhance the difference between water and non water objects in the multi spectral images by the ratio operation machine learning or deep learning methods are increasingly used to separate open water from other land features for example nandi extracted the water information using landsat 8 images with the support vector machine method nandi et al 2017 sun compared the adaboost and random forest algorithms on the performance of water extraction and their results showed that adaboost was more suitable for water body extraction in gf 1 satellite imagery data sun et al 2020 the deep learning techniques such as the deep convolution neural network dcnn have strong feature expression ability and great advantages in image interpretation dcnn is recently used to extract the water features in satellite images with good performance reported dong et al 2019 wang et al 2020 compared the deep learning technique with the conventional ndwi and they found that the deep learning method densenet was much better in distinguishing water from clouds and mountain shadows although the optical satellite generally provides images at a high spatial resolution it suffers from the influences of thick clouds and rainfall resulting in poor quality images during flood events or periods goffi et al 2020 moreover optical satellites cannot operate at night due to the unavailability of illumination in contrast synthetic aperture radar sar satellite has unique advantages for observing the land surface regardless of the weather condition kitajima et al 2021 besides it can observe the earth at night without relying on solar illumination thanks to the characteristics of active microwave remote sensing refice et al 2020 as a result sar has been used widely for various applications such as landslides monitoring ma et al 2021 flood mapping dong et al 2021 monitoring of wetlands mohammadimanesh et al 2021 and production estimation clauss et al 2018 the main principle for using sar images to identify inundation extent is based on the unique reflection of the target water body at the microwave length the water body will mirror reflect a large amount of radiation energy which leads to low backscatter coefficients in the sar images mahoney et al 2020 therefore the threshold segmentation is the most classical method to distinguish water body from non water areas in the threshold method the pixels with backscatter coefficients lower than the given threshold are assigned to the water class lingyan et al 2015 however determining an optimal threshold is not easy and it is affected by many factors such as atmospheric interference and polarization mode cian et al 2018 the otsu method is widely used for threshold acquisition but many studies have shown that it is unreliable to extract water body sekertekin 2021 li et al 2021 the change detection is used to extract the change information of interest from satellite images in different periods for the same region it has been widely applied for urban expansion fekete 2020 landuse change monitoring karthick et al 2017 and more recently for mapping flooded areas huang and jin 2020 gul√°csi and kov√°cs 2020 for example gong et al 2011 fused the mean ratio difference map and log ratio difference map to greatly improve the quality of difference map from sar images which improved the accuracy of the algorithm for change detection xiang et al 2018 used landsat data to detect the impervious surface change in beijing tianjin tangshan area during 1996 2015 and reflected the different temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of urban expansion gong et al 2015 built a change detection model using deep neural networks which has achieved excellent results in multi temporal change detection in sar images lyu et al 2016 combined the advantages of long short term memory lstm and recurrent neural network rnn and designed a new algorithm and successfully applied it to multispectral or hyperspectral change detection wang et al 2021 proposed an attention mechanism based deep supervision network for the change detection of bi temporal remote sensing images which has better effectiveness and robustness than other change detection methods sefrin et al 2021 proved that the combination of fully convolutional network fcn and lstm outperformed the fcn on detecting the land covers in recent studies on change detection in remote sensing many methods have proven their ability to recognize changes of interest by comparing the bitemporal images change detection methods relied on the cnn based structure were used widely in remote sensing applications due to its capacity to extract high level features from co registered images these methods applied more convolution layers dilated convolution and attention mechanisms to increase the reception field zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2018 however there is still a limitation in obtaining the long range relation in the spatial and temporal scale moreover inefficient and complicated computation make many change detection methods fail to apply well in the massive remote sensing data in this study we aimed to test and evaluate the performance of a transformer based change detection method in mapping inundation extents in poyang lake area using sar images from sentinel 1 we generated a water change detection dataset for poyang lake area using the sar images from sentinel 1 bitemporal images in the poyang lake area for several years were adopted for labeling in order to satisfy the spatial and temporal generalization we applied the transform based model bit along with two cnn based methods stanets and snunet to our water change detection dataset to examine the abilities to recognize the changed water then the variation of inundation extents in poyang lake area during the summer flood in 2020 was further analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the poyang lake n28 24 29 46 e115 49 116 46 is the largest freshwater lake in china which is located in the north of jiangxi province and the middle reach of the yangtze river the area of the poyang lake basin exceeds 162200 km2 which accounts for around 9 of the yangtze river area the poyang lake is a typical seasonal lake that is influenced by the catchment inflow and the interaction with the yangtze river during the rainy season the poyang lake area transcends 3800 km2 regularly while in the dry season the lake area will decline considerably the poyang lake is recharged by five tributaries including ganjiang river fuhe river xinjiang river raohe river xiushui river the complex topography and characteristics of subtropical monsoon climate make the poyang lake easy to occur flood events fig 1 shows that the digital elevation model dem of the poyang lake basin varies from the northern plain at the elevations of 142 m to the southern mountains at the elevations of 3090 m above the mean sea level the poyang lake basin has complex terrains land covers in the basin differ sharply including water bodies cultivated land forest wetland artificial surfaces etc from late june to early july 2020 the poyang lake basin encountered heavy rainfall and the rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river was 1 5 times higher than the annual average many areas in jiangxi province were attacked by flood events many times due to multiple heavy rainstorms 2 2 data sentinel 1 is the earth observation satellite mission launched by the european space agency esa copernicus program there are two satellites sentinel 1a and 1b they were launched in 2014 and 2016 respectively the revisit period of each sentinel 1 is 12 days sentinel 1 a and b satellites can survey the earth every 6 days by the dual constellations twele et al 2016 the c band sar sensor carried by sentinel 1 has four imaging modes including interferometric wide swath iw strip map sw extra wide swath ew and wave wv mode high spatio temporal resolution and powerful penetration ability make sentinel 1 superior in observing the ground surface all day in any weather condition regardless of clouds fogs and rains various levels of products from sentinel 1 are provided freely for research on flood area changes landslides and estimation of crop yield aslan et al 2020 this study used 21 sar images from sentinel 1a and 1b in the ground range detected grd mode acquired in may and july from 2017 to 2020 grd products provide sar data with a high spatial resolution of 10 m and dual polarization modes vertical horizontal polarization vertical vertical polarization grd products are widely applied for analysis of the characteristics of water bodies and monitoring flood events amitrano et al 2018 yunjee et al 2020 in this study all the sentinel 1 grd products were radiometrically calibrated to the sigma naught db then the images were terrain corrected and projected to the world geodetic system 1984 for subsequent processing meimei et al 2020 2 3 methods the methods used in this study mainly consist of three main steps firstly a high resolution water change detection dataset from sentinel 1 data was constructed then we applied three methods the snunet stanets and bit and compared their performance in change detection of water for the sake of a fair comparison we operated all the methods on the same server equipped with an nvidia tesla t4 gpu which was configured with pytorch 1 8 1 independent ground truth were used to evaluate these three methods and finally the best performing method was identified and employed for detecting the changed water in poyang lake area during the summer flood in 2020 furthermore we overlaid the increased water on the land cover map to analyze the inundation distribution 2 3 1 water change detection dataset the applications of deep learning on remote sensing rely on large datasets with good quality therefore we introduced the water change detection dataset annotated by the sentinel 1 data to analyse the flood in the poyang lake area in 2020 and provide a public remote sensing dataset for developing the change detection algorithms 6 3 pairs of sar images from sentinel 1 in the grd mode acquired in the poyang lake area were collected for implementing the tested methods a total number of 15 images during the summer flood may nov 2020 were utilized for studying the evolution of floods detecting the change of water area is very important to analyze the flood event high spatio temporal resolution sar images offer a great opportunity to monitor these changes the backscatter coefficient determines the brightness of ground objects in sar images objects with a larger backscatter coefficient show brighter while that with a lower backscatter coefficient show darker in the sar images waterbody would generally have low backscatter coefficients around 23 db in our study because of specular reflection meimei et al 2020 therefore we annotated the change regions of water body in all the pairs of sar images as white color the final binary classification labels are composed of changed and non changed regions because the change detection for remote sensing data directly tends to be time and memory consuming we divided the original input images into the size of 256 256 pixels to improve the efficiency of data loading finally we had 6296 pairs of water change detection samples these samples were further divided to three sets with 70 of all samples as the training set 20 as the validation set and 10 as the test set fig 2 shows some typical samples in our dataset which consists of the bitemporal sar images and the corresponding ground truth label 2 3 2 the stanets snunet and bit models the stanets method the stanets introduced a self attention mechanism for feature extraction because that can model the long range spatial temporal relationships chen et al 2020 such global relationships are beneficial for detecting the change of interest regardless of the influence of misregistration and illumination diversity besides the self attention module can help networks extract the high level features of the same object in various times and spaces for extracting the multi scale features of objects we applied the pyramid attention architecture in the stanets model for example the input images will be firstly divided into the same scale sub images and the self attention mechanism will be adopted to explore the spatial temporal relationship of each sub image then we can extract features with multiple scales to obtain the change of the interest objects in bitemporal images by integrating the spatial temporal relationships of multiple scale images there are three modules in stanets a basic module without a self attention mechanism referred to as stanet base one basic spatial temporal attention module stanet bam and one pyramid spatial temporal attention module stanet pam the snunet method the snunet is a densely connected siamese network based on the encoder decoder structure it can keep high resolution and fine grained features from remote sensing images by being equipped with a densely skip connection fang et al 2021 the siamese network owns two branches for processing the input bitemporal images separately and the two branches parameters are shared we apply the concatenation for fusing the features extracted from two branches to enrich the spatial temporal information in the bitemporal images then the fine grained localization features are transmitted and maintained through the skip connections from the encoder to four sub decoders outputs of nodes in shallow sub decoders will be connected to the nodes in deep sub decoders of the same size for further utilization therefore the snunet produces four feature maps of the same size as the original images but the semantic levels and spatial localization representations vary between those four outputs the shallow sub decoders obtain the finer grained features and precise localization information while the deep ones obtain the coarse grained features and richer semantic information the ensemble channel attention module ecam which is inspired by cam is designed for suppressing such gaps when fusing those features the four outputs are summed first and the intra group relations are extracted by the cam then four output groups are concatenated and followed by another cam for extracting the inter group relations 1 1 convolution layer is applied for generating the final change map results the bitemporal image transformer bit method the bit can effectively model the long range spatial temporal relationships of interest objects in bitemporal remote sensing images chen et al 2021 as is shown in fig 3 the bit consists of the semantic tokenizer transformer encoder and transformer decoder at the beginning the resnet the classic cnn semantic segmentation network is employed to extract features from the bitemporal images because it is inefficient for modeling the dense relationships pixel by pixel in the semantic tokenizer with the intuition of describing high level concepts of the interest change as some visual words the input bitemporal images the siamese tokenizer learns a series of spatial attention maps and represents them into several semantic tokens then we applied the transformer encoder to model the contextual relationships between the above semantic tokens since the transformer can extract the globally spatial temporal context completely we operated the extraction for rich tokens from each bitemporal feature representations we introduced the multi head self attention msa and multilayer perceptron mlp blocks in the transformer encoder because the msa does well in focusing on the information of different representation sub spaces from different locations and the mlp block is composed of two linear transformation layers with one grlu activation function in the middle after the transformer encoding the semantic tokens own rich high grade information for revealing the interest changes of objects in bitemporal images for obtaining the pixel wise features representation the modified siamese transformer decoder is adopted to refine the features of bitemporal images by projecting the semantic tokens into the features pixel based the transformer decoder explores the relationships between the semantic tokens and each pixel in the feature maps which were extracted by the resnet with the intuition of each pixel can be described by the semantic tokens at last according to the rich semantic features pixel wise we employ an fcn as the prediction head for generating change detection results the differences of stanets snunet and bit models are clearly listed in table1 compared with other cnn based models the bit model has the unique transformer based structure unet is applied for feature extraction by the snunet while the stanets and bit models employs the resnet 18 as the feature extractor meanwhile different attention mechanisms are adopted in those models which have been shown in the table1 and the detailed comparison and their shortages of performance on results are shown in section 3 2 3 3 evaluation metrics we chose the precision recall and f1 score of the change category as the metrics to evaluate the performance of the snunet stanets and bit in detecting the water changes using the ground truth samples these metrics are based on the confusion matrix and are widely used to assess the capability of deep learning algorithms yu et al 2018 chen et al 2021 the precision represents the ratio of the true positive samples to all samples predicted to the changed samples recall represents the ratio of the true positive samples to all the correct samples the f1 score is the harmonic average of the precision and recall the formulas of metrics are described below 1 precision tp tp f p 2 recall tp tp f n 3 f 1 2 p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l precision r e c a l l where tp fp tn and fn stand for the true positive false positive true negative and false negative respectively 3 results 3 1 comparisons of the stanets snunet and bit models fig 4 exhibits the running efficiency of the stanets snunet and bit models in terms of the training losses and the f1 scores loss functions were applied to assess the fitting ability for optimizing the models in the training stage while f1 scores were used to evaluate the performances of models with the validation dataset we used the cross entropy as the loss function since change detection focuses on distinguishing the changed and unchanged regions in remote sensing images as the epochs increase the curve becomes lower and smoother which indicates that the fitness and robustness of the corresponding network are better as shown in fig 4 a we draw the loss curves to intuitively compare the efficiency of the stanet base bam and pam model snunet and bit models at the beginning of the epochs the bit has the lowest loss which was followed by the base bam and pam model the snunet model owns the highest in the initial epochs which was several times higher than other four models then the loss value of snunet dropped quickly within five epochs in the last 90 epochs the snunet s loss curve becomes convergent and lower than the stanets the base and bam models have similar fitting performance on the training stage and their loss curves own the almost trend but small fluctuations the pam model acquires a better fitting performance than the base and bam models the bit model obtains the lowest loss curve among all the methods whose loss value remains lower and smooth during the training stage fig 4 b describes the f1 score curves of models on the validation dataset the higher the f1 score curve the better the performance although the loss curve of the snunet ranks second the snunet s f1 score value is the worst there is still no sharp gap between the f1 score curves of the base and bam models just like their training performances the f1 score values of the pam model have nearly 0 1 point higher than the base and bam models the bit model owns the highest f1 score among such five models corresponding to the bit s lowest loss curve to compare the efficiencies of all the models fairly we evaluated their performance in terms of the selected metrics precision recall and f1 score table 2 and 3 shows the detailed and digital performance of the five models on the validation and test dataset respectively the bit model has the highest precision value of 0 96 on the validation dataset indicating that 96 of the changed samples are recognized correctly within all the samples which are predicted as changed the precision values of the snunet base bam and pam models are 0 83 0 82 0 81 and 0 89 respectively the stanet bam model has the worst performance in terms of the precision value which is 7 5 lower than the bit against the validation dataset however the highest recall value 0 97 is from the stanet bam the remaining recall values are 0 95 bit 0 947 stanet pam 0 93 stanet base and 0 83 snunet respectively since the bit model has the best precision and the second recall values against the validation dataset its f1 score ranks first among all models evaluated the snunet has the lowest f1 score value of 0 83 which is 4 9 lower than the stanets in order to better assess the practical learning ability of models we implemented these models to the test dataset which is widely used to evaluate the generalization ability of the final model the evaluation showed that the bit model has the precision value of 0 91 which is still the highest among all investigated models against the test database the precision value of the base bam and pam models are 0 69 0 66 and 0 73 respectively the snunet has the middle precision of 0 82 between the bit and stanets there is no such big difference in the recall among five models although the bit owns the third recall value the bit model ranks the first with an f1 score of 0 96 which is higher than the snunet 0 85 because the stanets has the lowest precision values the f1 scores values are not as good as the other models considering the performances of different models against the the validation and test datasets the bit has the best efficiency and effectiveness 3 2 visualization results in order to compare the performance of each model in detail we selected several pairs of sub images to explore their abilities for water change detection fig 5 shows five change types of water caused by the flooding images of time 1 time 2 represent the original sentinel 1 images acquired on 27th may and 14th july 2020 in the poyang lake area respectively and the ground truths mean the corresponding labels of increased water the remaining images in figure are the results from different models the bit model has the best performance in detecting the changed water from bitemporal images as is shown clearly in the binary images the recognition results of the bit are closest to the ground truths fig 5a and 5b show that the bit method well captured the changed regions besides the bit preserves clearer and more complete boundaries than other models the snunet model fails to detect detailed change for mountainous areas and loses the high resolution boundary information it is shown in fig 5a that the effects of the snunet on recognizing the increased water in the mountains are not good except for this the result of the bam model is vulnerable to the mountain shadows with a similarly low backscatter coefficient to water the snunets pam and bit models perform better than the base and bam models in the lower left quarter region of fig 5b in fig 5c although the increased water can be identified almost by the five models the results of the base and bam models are a little bigger than the ground truth because they are not sensitive to the tiny change information combined with the recognition results from fig 5d and 5e the stanets have the weak ability to distinguish the tiny unchanged regions from all the changed parts because the stanets own the worst precision value among the five models in fig 5d the stanets identify the existing slender rivers as the increased water inundated by the flood in contrary the snunet and bit perform better than stanets in complex terrains owing to the second f1 score value the snunet has just a few wrong recognition results in the middle of fig 5d therefore it can be concluded that the bit has the best performance in detecting the changing water these models visualization results are consistent with their performances against the test set 3 3 evolution of the flood in june 2020 due to the influence of the subtropical high in the northwest pacific the rainy season in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river was advanced and the rainfall was much stronger than the same period in history as a result the water level of many hydrological stations exceeded the historical high record in 1998 among them the water level of poyang lake in jiangxi soared and the lake area was the largest in the last ten years given such advantageous performance of the bit model it was chosen as the best representative method to monitor the flood of poyang lake in 2020 we selected the sentinel 1 data on 27th may 2020 as the image in the normal water period and the reference image before the flood event subsequently we overlaid the increased water extracted from the 12 day images with the bit model on the reference image and display them in rgb channels to depict the evolution of the flood the white blue and red colors in fig 6 are defined as the background original water and increased water region respectively the water area of poyang lake on 27th may 2020 was the smallest in our selected images then increased gradually from june to early july water in other places of the image on 2ed july also started to extend to form the flood as shown in fig 6 the whole water body on 14th july expanded rapidly and the flood area d the maximum among all images exceeding the original water area there was no significant change in the flood area since late july due to such a small variation in the increased area can be figured out the flood stabilized and started to retract from july to october and the poyang lake returned to its normal area till the 11th november in order to further analyze the losses caused by the summer flood in the poyang lake area in 2020 we combined the water inundation area extracted from the sentinel 1 image by the bit model on 14th july with the land cover type to count the inundation area caused by the flood to different land cover types in the study area fig 7 shows the raster data of the land cover types in the main poyang lake area which was provided by the global geo information public product at a high spatial resolution of 30 m https www globallandcover com this global land cover data product includes 7 classes in our study area cultivated land forest grassland wetland waterbody artificial surface and bare land it can be seen from fig 7 that the main land cover types in the study area are cultivated land forest and grassland the most artificial surfaces gather around the ganjiang river and other streams we overlaid the inundation area relative increased water on 14th july on the land cover distribution map to analyze the inundation status of different land cover types the red region in fig 7 is the inundation area which was mainly distributed in the agricultural lands and the island shoal wetlands in the middle of poyang lake in fig 8 according to the spatial resolution of the global land cover data product we counted the distribution area of flood inundation in different ground feature types to quantitative analyze the disaster loss in the poyang lake region in our study area the total inundation area caused by the summer flood was about 770 km2 the statistical chart shows that the cultivated land is the largest land cover type which was inundated by the flood disaster with an inundation area of almost 600 km2 the second seriously affected land cover type is the wetland which has been inundated nearly 72 km2 the inundation area of grassland reaches 47 km2 which is 6 km2 more than forest the small distribution range of urban areas in our study area is the artificial surfaces and bare land have the least inundation area of less than 10 km2 the cultivated land forest grassland and wetland are mainly distributed around the poyang lake area the artificial surfaces and bare land cover rather fewer areas combined with the inundation distribution map and the total statistical area a large amount of agricultural land has been destroyed worst which led to the decline in agricultural products and economic losses 4 discussion it is worth noting that we can monitor flooding dynamically and precisely with sar imagery data from sentinel 1 at high spatial and temporal resolutions compared with the traditional cnn based structure methods of change detection the transform based model bit showed its excellent performance and high efficiency both the stanets and snunet model failed to detect the small detailed changes and lost the high resolution boundary information in particular for some regions with complex topography both stanets or the snunet model cannot well distinguish the mountain shadow changes due to their similar backscatter coefficients to water the bit model had the best performance in water change detection with high precision thanks to the first rate structure and high quality dataset the bit model can recognize the increased water from brand new images in a few seconds the bit model can differentiate increased water better from similar changes and extract detailed information even the tiny water change however we find that the noises in sar images would affect the result of inundation area identification since the defect of the coherence principle besides the land cover data products have the disadvantage of relatively poor timeliness in order to improve the performance of our models we recommend to add a specialized module of reducing speckle noise in networks scientifically based on radar imaging mechanisms in the future studies in addition we advise future studies to obtain the land types classified by networks from high resolution optical images rather than applying the land cover data products then combine with the flood extraction to quantitatively analyze the losses caused by floods to different land types hu et al 2022 recent works inspired us that adopting few meteorological data and socioeconomic dataset is of great useful for analyzing floods their research found out that flooding risks increasing due to the high socioeconomic exposure and vulnerability of the lower yellow river basin in china ning et al 2021 used observational and reanalysis dataset to investigate the underlying mechanisms and long term trend of extreme precipitation events which may cause disastrous flooding in xinjiang thus taking more factors into account will provide more convincing evidence for analyzing the evolution of flood and its disaster damage our work demonstrates the good applicability of deep learning methods in flood monitoring with satellite data however 12 days revisit period of sentinel 1 in poyang lake basin limits the timely and precise monitoring fast occurring floods the shortcoming of the relative long revisit time of satellites is an obstacle for few monitoring missions by remote sensing technique such as monitoring the floods or forest fires in future combined with higher spatio temporal resolution satellites data the deep learning methods will show more powerful advantage for the purposes of remote sensing applications with the soaring development of satellite technology we expect the increasing needs for applying such advanced algorithms to help us exploring large volume and multi dimension data aside from change detection applications other deep learning methods such as semantic segmentation networks have been reported to have good performance in the classification of multiple ground features with high efficiency tong et al 2018 ding et al 2021 gu et al 2021 thus it is relevant and interesting to test different methods for mapping inundation areas and monitoring floods 5 conclusions in this study a total number of 21 sar images from sentinel 1 acquired in may and july from 2017 to 2020 were used to construct a high resolution water change detection dataset the water change detection dataset consists of the seasonal variation water samples of poyang lake for several years to meet the good temporal and spatial generalization therefore the dataset can be applied in the identification of increased water floods in different regions and seasons meanwhile the bit model which is based on an outstanding transform based architecture has proven its better performance than cnn based structure methods the stanets or the snunet model the bit model can successfully detect the increased water from the sentinel 1 images with high accuracy besides the bit model can capture detailed information without being influenced by mountain shadows and complex terrain we applied the bit model further to analyze the dynamics of inundation extents of the poyang lake area from may to november in 2020 the lake area on 27th may was the smallest and increased rapidly to the maximum by 14th july then the inundation area started to recede significantly and the lake area returned to the normal state until early november we will improve the proposed bit models

2064,soil and gully erosion is a critical threat to sustainable agricultural land management and productivity soil erosion by rain splash sheet runoff and concentrated flow are complex problems conditioned by the combined interactions of soil physical properties hydrology human activity landscape topography and climate effective management of erosion processes driven by rainfall and surface runoff requires a combined effort of field observation physical experimentation and numerical simulation a physically based hydrodynamic numerical model cche2d with updated raindrop erosion effects is applied to simulate landscape evolution processes as a result of raindrop impact and overland flow the numerical model simulates a thin layer of runoff and concentrated flow over complex terrains and predicts sediment transport due to raindrop splash detachment transport and soil surface erosions soil erosion and landform evolution simulations due to rainfall are presented for an experimental landscape and a tilled large scale agricultural field photogrammetric field data were collected using an unmanned aerial system uas following planting and subsequent rainstorms numerical simulation

creating rills gullies and removal of fertile topsoil lal 1998 weltz et al 2020 erosion contributes to increased sediment yield from agricultural lands and pollutes downstream water bodies lal 2001 gully erosion is particularly harmful because gullies can accelerate erosion yield more sediment than interrill sources and are more difficult to mitigate ballesteros c√°nova et al 2017 ionita et al 2015 poesen et al 2003 soil and gully erosion control in agricultural lands is a difficult task due to limitations in field survey in capturing small scale landscape changes lack of adequate methods for appraisal of conservation measures and practices and limited capabilities of prediction technology de vente et al 2013 poesen 2018 due to the complexity of soil erosion processes there are still more questions than answers following several decades of study the agricultural research service of the u s department of agriculture usda recently articulated a strategic plan to meet the future needs in soil erosion research and modeling weltz et al 2020 these goals include 1 advancing wind and water erosion science 2 improving the climate model for erosion prediction 3 quantifying factors affecting erosion and 4 developing an integrated wind and water erosion prediction system the current study seeks to contribute substantively to several of these goals identified by the udsa many studies have focused on erosion processes using a variety of methods including experimental measurements field observations and mathematical modeling among these mathematical modeling is cost effective and allows for a robust and comprehensive consideration of influencing factors models such as rusle rusle2 renard and foster 1997 usda ars 2013 wepp flanagan et al 2007 and creams foster et al 1980 have been developed to tackle soil loss processes rusle rusle2 models consider comprehensive watershed process factors and predict soil erosion empirically at the field scale rusle model series has been adopted by other well known watershed models including annagnps bingner and theurer 2001 etc to estimate long term soil erosion wepp is a physically based model which needs to simplify the watershed topography and process these models delineate watersheds into morphologic units and use different simplified methods to compute soil erosion in these landform units separately the cche2d hydrodynamic and sediment transport model has been developed and applied to simulate processes in rivers lakes and coastal waters chao et al 2016 ding et al 2020 jia et al 2019a jia et al 2002 jia and wang 1999 and produced good solutions this model has been tested also using experimental and field watershed data jia et al 2018a b 2019b jia and shirmeen 2016 in cche2d model sheet runoff and concentrated flow and their associated sediment transport are simulated dynamically using the same set of equations these physical mechanisms in a watershed are distributed naturally according to local morphology and are handled in the model as a continuously distributed process there is no need to differentiate and delineate morphologic zones such as rill interrill and gully as separated modeling areas willgoose et al 1991a b developed a 2d model for simulating long term landform evolution a watershed stream network and its evolution were simulated by solving a bed change equation the flow and sediment transport are highly simplified overland soil erosion processes are difficult to parameterize in models wei et al 2009 developed equations relating sediment discharge to rainfall intensity and runoff rate using field data xiao et al 2017 studied soil erosion rate in concentrated flows and related this to shear stress stream power water depth and flow discharge zhang et al 2003 studied soil detachment using undisturbed soil and found good correlations between soil detachment rate and flow parameters zhang et al 2009 measured sediment transport capacity over relatively steep soil slopes 8 8 46 6 and found that transport capacity had a close relationship to soil shear stress using experimental data aksoy et al 2017 tested sediment transport formulae and found that the total sediment transport rate was related to combinations of slope rainfall intensity runoff rate and sediment size for rill and interrill areas liu et al 2006 applied sediment transport formulae for open channels to rill erosion processes their sediment detachment function for interrill erosion however was related to runoff velocity rather than rainfall intensity and no topographic change was computed these studies often focus on the erosion rate and the flow parameters for a specific soil area slope steepness rainfall flow rate and typically use one dimensional models the results are difficult to apply to natural watersheds where unsteady processes over multiple morphologic units occur and interact if a numerical model introduces too many simplifications and or idealizations it becomes difficult to capture key physical processes physically based models with fewer simplifications should have a higher potential to effectively model complex hill slope hydrologic processes in this study a physically based finite element hydrodynamic and sediment transport model cche2d is modified and evaluated to simulate rainfall induced watershed runoff process splash erosion channel incision and sediment transport in addition to the original sediment transport capabilities the model is first applied to predict soil erosion processes generated by simulated precipitation in a laboratory experiment conducted at the usda ars national sedimentation laboratory momm et al 2018 the model is then applied to a tilled agricultural field located in shelby county iowa numerical solutions were obtained with high spatial resolutions and the results were evaluated through comparison to sequential topographic surveys using high precision photogrammetry 2 numerical methods and simulation cases 2 1 cche2d hydrodynamic model sheet flow due to rainfall over interrills and concentrated flow in rills and gullies are simulated by solving the depth integrated reynolds stress equations the water surface elevation of the runoff flow Œ∑ is calculated by the continuity equation 1 h t u h r where h Œ∑ Œ∂ is the local water depth Œ∑ and Œ∂ are water surface and bed elevation respectively the variable u u v is a vector of the depth averaged velocity components in x and y directions respectively t is time and r is rainfall intensity which may be a temporal and spatial variable the depth averaged 2d momentum equations for turbulent flows are 2 u t u u x v u y g Œ∑ x œÑ xx x œÑ xy y œÑ Œ∂ x œÅ h 3 v t u v x v v y g Œ∑ y œÑ yx x œÑ yy y œÑ Œ∂ y œÅ h where g is the gravitational acceleration œÅ is water density œÑxx œÑxy œÑyx and œÑyy are depth averaged reynolds stresses and œÑŒ∂x œÑŒ∂y are bed shear stresses for the interrill areas representing shallow laminar flow the convection and reynolds stress terms vanish and eqs 2 and 3 become the kinematic wave equations while in many segments of rills and gullies the reynolds number in terms of the depth or width of the flow may be quite large and the flow would be turbulent the bed shear stresses on the soil surface are evaluated in conjunction with the manning s formula as 4 œÑ Œ∂ x œÅ œÑ Œ∂ y œÅ h g j x j y g n 2 u h 1 3 u v where n is the manning s roughness coefficient and u u 2 v 2 is the total velocity the terms j x j y are components of friction slope j manning s n normally is determined by calibrating the numerical model using experimental data because manning s coefficient is empirical it is highly dependent on soil surface roughness texture tillage and vegetation conditions in this complex situation a constant resistance coefficient would not be suitable detailed experimental studies also indicate this coefficient varies with water depth and rainfall intensity shen et al 2020 shen and li 1973 fraga et al 2013 found that n varies significantly with the depth of overland flow dramatic increases occur when water depth is less than about 5 mm to 1 mm and this change would be greater in the presence of dense vegetation this is consistent with many runoff simulation results noting that manning s n for runoff is much larger than those for rivers downer 2008 kalyanapu et al 2009 singh et al 2014 in this study overland flow is generated by rainfall over irregular topographies the runoff over the soil surface and the tillage ridges are thin sheet flows h 0 001 m 0 00001 m and that along the gully and furrows are concentrated flows depending on the location and rainfall intensity the impact of rain splash on the flow and soil erosion would vary spatially strong on sheet flow and weak on concentrated flows the water depth distribution will also change in time with the evolution of gullies and rills in watershed instead of using a constant manning s coefficient an empirical formula is developed in this study to include the spatial variation effect and allow it to adapt to the evolving topography 5 n 1 max min h h c h s h s h c h s n s n c n c where ns is for sheet flow nc is for concentrated flow hs is the maximum sheet flow depth hc is the minimum concentrated flow depth n n c if h h c and n n s if h h s the distribution of n following eq 5 is shown in fig 1 in which h c 0 01 m and h s 0 001 m in this study n c 0 1 h c 0 01 m and h s 0 001 m were used for both experimental and field case n s 0 03 and n s 0 02 were used for experimental and field case respectively 2 2 soil erosion and sediment transport model when numerical models are used to simulate hillslope soil erosion processes particularly physically based models each process involved should be defined in general watershed sediment transport is driven by two forcings raindrop splash and flow shear detachments both forcings exist in sheet runoff concentrated flow only has shear force raindrop splash detaches and transports soil mass raindrop impact effect is a new erosion mechanism to cche2d some previous researches were reviewed and adopted with modification nearing et al 1989 developed an equation for rainfall induced interrill erosion defined as 6 e i k i i 2 kg s 1 m 2 where ki is the interrill erodibility and i is rainfall intensity sediment transport in rills is dominated by detachment capacity ef and deposition rate dr defined as 7 e f k r œÑ œÑ c 1 g t c kg s 1 m 2 8 d r œâ hu t c g kg s 1 m 2 where œâ is sediment fall velocity erosion occurs when the shear stress at the soil surface œÑ is greater than the critical shear stress of the soil œÑ c deposition is computed when the sediment load g kg s 1 m 1 is greater than the transport capacity tc estimated using yalin s equation finkner et al 1989 at the end of a slope the sedimentation process in rills and interrill areas are handled separately a watershed therefore has to be delineated into rill and interrill zones rain detachment occurs only in the interrill area while the flow shear force is used for rill erosion morgan et al 1998 introduced a comprehensive watershed modeling system eurosem the soil detachment by rainfall impact is calculated by 9 e i a 0 œÅ s k e e z h where ke is the total kinetic energy of the raindrops at the ground surface a0 is the soil detachability and z is a coefficient the rain impact effect vanishes with a greater surface water depth the soil detachment rate by runoff is computed by 10 e f Œ≤ œâ c c c where cc is the transport capacity c is the suspended sediment concentration and Œ≤ is a detachment coefficient that equals unity for non cohesive sediments the net erosion of a slope plane can be computed by combined splash and flow erosion 11 e e i e f gholizadeh et al 2018 assessed 15 algorithms computing raindrop induced soil particle detachment and found the method of hairsine and rose 1991 demonstrated good results under a variety of conditions in this study the equation of hairsine and rose 1991 defining the splash detachment rate due to impact of rainfall is adopted 12 e i a 0 min 1 h 0 h b i p where ei is non zero when water depth h is less than or equal to the break point depth h0 and b and p are dimensionless parameters this equation can be easily applied to general conditions it produces raindrop detachment when the water depth is very small and no raindrop detachment erosion in concentrated flow areas the raindrop splash erosion equation was adopted with the depth effect exponent b set to 1 to 2 and soil detachability was used as a calibration parameter a value of p 2 was adopted h 0 1 m m and h 0 0 5 m m in eq 2 were tested for the experiment and field case respectively sediment yield increases slightly with h 0 no canopy and ground cover effects were considered rain splash erosion is effective in the sheet flow area and it vanishes quickly when water depth becomes larger than h0 when the soil surface has a slope the splash results in a net soil transport downslope dunne et al 2010 developed an empirical function according to experimental data to account for this effect 13 f 1 0 5 e 2 2 t a n j b where f is the fraction of sediment splashed toward downslope j b is the local slope gradient in the 2d model it is computed j b œõ x 2 œõ y 2 when j b 0 50 of the sediment moves toward up and downslope direction the splash transport effect can be dominant where land has steep and variable slope gradient in tilled lands for instance splash induced soil detachment and transport along tillage ridges are strong but become minimal in furrows in this study sediment transport and topographic change are simulated by a two dimensional flow and sediment transport model in the cche2d model erosion and deposition in sheet and concentrated flows are handled with unified formulations sediment load is computed using a mass transport equation 14 1 u b q t q q q c l 15 q q q q x q y where l is a case dependent length scale called the adaptation length for non equilibrium sediment transport ub is the sediment velocity q is the sediment load transport rate and qc is the total sediment transport capacity when rain splash effects exist the transport capacity in the sheet flow zone is enhanced by rain splash and should be modified two rain splash related effects are considered to formulate the corresponding sediment transport capacity in practice ei is the net splashed soil mass rate maintained by raindrop energy and it is a balance of soil particles detached from and re attached to the soil surface the sediment concentration of soil particles in the runoff layer is proportional to e i h and e i u b h is the transport capacity of the sheet flow movement eq 13 is modified to account for net contribution fraction of splash transport toward downslope 1 e 2 2 tan j b the net effect of splash transport vanishes if the slope gradient is uniform in a large area but it should have contributions along the edges of gullies and in tilled land where splash erosion occurs along narrow strips with alternating high and low gradient an estimate of the sediment load considering these two effects splash detached soil moving with sheet flow and direct splash transport is as follows 16 q i c 0 u b max h h s e i Œ± 1 e 2 2 tan j b e i where c0 is a combined coefficient eq 16 does not include canopy interception the transport equation including the rain splash effects then becomes 17 1 u b q t q q q c l q i eq 17 unifies both soil erosion and sediment transport processes for concentrated flow and rain splash in rills and gullies rain splash erosion vanishes and deposition and erosion are determined by the balance of sediment load and sediment transport capacity in thin sheet flow areas the sediment transport capacity is relatively less dominant and rain splash erosion contributes more to sediment load and topographic change the corresponding bed change equation is 18 œÅ s 1 p 0 œõ t q q c l q i where p0 is porosity and œÅ s is sediment mass density the source term is the same as that of eq 17 because sediment load conservation is also the net sediment exchange between the soil surface and the flow all partial differential equations were solved implicitly in this study the sediment transport capacity is a 2d variable distributed over the entire watershed it is computed using the sediment transport formula of wu et al 2000 and wu 2001 the critical shear stress for sediment entrainment is modified to consider the effect of sediment angle of repose the simulations of the runoff and soil erosion processes were coupled 2 3 experimental and field scale soil erosion and landform evolution data the modified cche2d was first used to simulate rainfall runoff soil gully erosion processes in an experimental landscape momm et al 2018 wells et al 2016 in the experiments a soil mantled flume 1 8 m 9 3 m was subjected to simulated rainfall over a period of 18 5 h homogenous soil was used in the experiment and the overall flume slope was set to 5 momm et al 2018 the tested soil is a mixture of sand 3 silt 73 and clay 24 the bulk density of the compacted soil was 1450 kg m3 the simulated rainfall was produced by 14 oscillatory pressure nozzles in the first 360 min of experiment the applied rainfall was 30 mm h which pre wetted the soil the rainfall was then increased to 105 mm h for 735 min and the downstream outlet was lowered 4 cm for soil erosion simulation the landscape evolution process was captured at multiple time 420 465 525 645 705 855 915 975 1035 and 1095 min using the photogrammetry technique the second simulation case was an agricultural field located in shelby county iowa u s a with an area of approximately 54 500 m2 it was surveyed following corn planting on may 11 2017 t1 and one month later on june 12 2017 t2 the landscape relief was less than 20 m the entire area is a tilled cornfield and the tillage is aligned very near north south direction several rainfall events occurred in the period contours in fig 2 a shows the general field topography the three yellow lines indicate the divide of sub watersheds in the survey area approximately one stream was situated at the downslope edge of the watershed the gullies developed in w2 and w3 are referred to north and south gully which merge near the outlet and empty into the stream fig 2a the two side sub watersheds w1 and w4 were only partially surveyed and their main outlets are outside the surveyed study area since they are in the domain w1 and w4 were simulated the simulated flow and sediment in sub watershed w1 and w4 were discharged to auxiliary outlets not shown the tillage induced land surface variation can hardly be seen in the contour map directly the variation can be recognized from the tiny wiggles of the black contour lines the distribution of gradient of local topography j b within the survey area is computed and shown in fig 2b the highly irregular land surface and two gullies are more perceptible and pronounced in the slope map the slope gradient along the two main gullies and near the lower part of the watershed 0 01 0 075 are much less than that over the upper hillslope 0 11 0 15 a novel surveying technique was employed wells et al 2016 2017 where traditional surveying methods were used to establish fixed benchmark points at the edge of the field multiple ground control points spread throughout the field then very high resolution uas survey imagery of the field was captured fig 3 the point density in the horizontal direction was 0 1 cm and the elevation accuracy was 2 cm the uncertainty of the survey method was 1 29 mm for low relief 17 cm and 2 55 mm for higher relief 63 cm topography wells et al 2016 three dimensional point clouds were post processed to assure elevation changes were due to erosional processes rather than survey misalignment fig 3a and 3b show a photo and the 3d imagery near the north east corner of the watershed where the circling marks of planting equipment were clearly seen at point 1 2 and 3 fig 3a and b are of t1 the gully was smoothed by tilling fig 3c and d show the photo and 3d imagery of a small area near the south gully surveyed at t2 the gully has been eroded by sediment transport between the t1 and t2 survey neither flow hydrograph nor sediment yield from this field were measured 3 numerical simulation of soil erosion and landform evolution in an experimental flume 3 1 sediment transport process soil erosion started after the rainfall intensity was increased from 30 mm h to 105 mm h at 360 min and when the downstream boundary was subjected to exogenic forcing through base level lowering momm et al 2018 one representative silt particle size 0 05 mm was set for the soil material the observed erosion rate and thus sediment yield stabilized after 600 min fig 4 the numerical simulation separated the erosion process into two time periods 360 min to 705 min p1 and 650 min to 1150 min p2 in p1 the erosion was dominated by a 4 cm base level lowering at 360 min and an increase in rainfall intensity the sediment load increased quickly and then became constant with time in p2 the base level was lowered an additional 3 cm at 734 min the sediment load exiting the flume however remained steady these two time periods have a short overlap even though the watershed outlet was lowered by 3 cm at 734 min the erosion process was not notably affected so the outlet level change at 734 min was not implemented in the simulation the measured soil topography at elapsed time 360 min and 645 min were used as the initial conditions for p1 and p2 respectively a high density cartesian mesh of 41 85 k nodes was generated for this experimental watershed using 2 cm 2 cm uniform mesh size measured topographic surfaces obtained during the laboratory experiment were projected onto the mesh for numerical simulation one p2 simulation on a laptop pc took about 8 h a mesh with finer resolution the same as that of the photogrammetry data 1 cm 1 cm was also tested the finer mesh was not used because the speed was much slower and the results was about the same the observed sediment load at the flume outlet is shown in fig 4 for the entire experiment the sediment load was very low before the rainfall was increased at 360 min and base level was lowered the sediment load increased quickly and kept almost constant after 600 min good agreement was found when sediment loads from the differences of the simulated topographic elevation data serious was calculated fig 4 diamond lines soil erosion and sediment transport are largely driven by hydrodynamics solved using eqs 1 3 and the flow field is affected by the evolving topographic distribution a flow vector field coarsened for clarity near the main channel at t 540 min p1 is shown in fig 5 the gully and associated rills are reflected by dense contour lines the vectors over the flat areas are relatively uniform representing thin sheet flow they concentrate toward the gully heads driven by localized elevation differences and steeper flow gradients which enhance headcut development and evolution the erosions over flat areas are dominated by the rainfall splash detachment eq 16 soil particles are suspended by the splash impact and move with the sheet flow dynamic erosion of soil occurs largely in the gully and rills where the water depth is greater than the break point depth eq 12 and the dynamic forcing is able to pick up soil particles from soil surface and carry those from upstream sheet flows using eq 5 the manning s coefficient for sheet flow and concentrated flow were set as ns 0 1 and nc 0 03 respectively this feature is important to obtaining reasonable results not only because the distribution is more physically viable but also it adapts to changing topography the distributions of n vary dynamically in time as the gully and rills evolve simulated and measured sediment yields from the experimental soil erosion flume are compared in fig 6 the measured cumulative sediment yield is computed using the observed sediment load exiting the downstream outlet of the soil flume simulated sediment yields for p1 experimental time between 360 and 705 min and p2 experimental time between 645 and 1150 min are also shown the initial sediment yield for p2 line was set to start at 400 kg approximately equal to that of the end value of p1 overall the trends for the measured sediment exiting the flume and the numerical simulations agreed well 3 2 morphologic evolution the morphologic evolution of the experimental watershed is controlled by raindrop splash detachment transport sheet flow over the surface and concentrated flow within the eroding rills and gullies measured and simulated watershed morphologic development in p1 is compared in fig 7 for elapsed times 520 min and 645 min the measured landscape presents a wider channel for both time periods and a faster channel extension toward the watershed upstream for the simulated watershed the main headcut channel is narrower and deeper and there are a larger number of rills developed feeding the main channel the simulated surface shows more morphologic development than the measured surface measured and simulated topographies for p2 are presented in fig 8 for 915 min and 1095 min here the general trends of the simulated and measured watershed surface evolutions are similar the measured landscape surface has more surficial sheet flow erosion but contains less rill and gully incisions similar to p1 there is considerably more rill development and evolution within the simulated results while there is an agreement in terms of the magnitude of soil loss in time from the simulations the evolution of the surfaces is not identical comparison of measured and simulated topographic cross sections at specific time intervals are presented in fig 9 the cross sections are located 1 3 5 and 7 m from the downstream outlet in general the volume of soil loss is similar however there is clearly greater surface incision within the simulations the simulated gully channel is narrower and deeper than the measured the simulated main gully cross sections have uneven profiles primarily due to the development of side tributaries along the gully channel and rills over the soil surface for this reason the simulated cross section profiles close to the flume walls are much less smooth than those in the measured data these features can also be observed in figs 7 and 8 the differences may be attributed to rainfall simulation characterization in the numerical model i e uniform and steady as opposed to that in the experiment produced by 14 oscillatory pressure nozzles pressure and area calibrations were conducted on the laboratory rainfall simulator the raindrops were not perpendicular to the ground the distribution and kinetic energy of the rainfall may not be spatially uniform differences between the observed and simulated surface topographies could also be due to variations in rainfall rates and spatial variations in soil erodibility extracted channel networks from the measured and simulated landforms at 1195 min are presented in fig 10 a where only one half of the experimental watershed the upstream part is shown here the network of the measured topography white lines and that of the simulated topography black lines are highly similar many subnetworks overlap but differences remain to further examine the statistic consistency of the experiment and simulation a watershed network analysis tool zhang and jia 2020 was used to generate the dendritic channel network for the topographies the generated strahler network has 4 orders of channels where the main gully is the 4th order fig 10b shows the mean area distributions of strahler streams of the two channel networks fig 10c shows the distributions of the number of strahler streams near overlapping of these curves r 2 1 0 for strahler area and r 2 0 999 for strahler stream number indicate that the simulated channel network is almost identical to the measured channel network while figs 7 8 and 9 show that there is more rill development within the simulated watershed surface the results of the channel network analysis revealed that these developed rills also exist within the measured landform in less incised states the results presented in figs 6 through 10 show that the numerical simulations reproduced sediment yield processes gully and rill erosion distributions and a dendritic channel network in close agreement to those observed in physical experiment the main differences are that the simulated main gully channel is somewhat deeper and narrower and it has more and deeper side sub gullies and rills 4 simulation results of soil erosion in field conditions 4 1 mesh resolution the aerial photogrammetry of the field data was collected at high resolution the spatial distance of the tillage ridges was approximately 80 cm two cartesian meshes 0 4 m 0 4 m and 0 1 m 0 1 m were generated for preliminary numerical simulations the mesh lines were set in the east west and north south direction it was found that the coarser mesh 0 4 m 0 4 m could not resolve cross tillage topography properly as the undulating landform features were smoothed too much the simulated runoff in the tilled land were not reasonable it largely goes across the tillage lines and run along the direction of the hillslope the finer 0 1 m 0 1 m mesh was tested on average each tillage is resolved with 8 mesh lines the numerical solutions in tilled area are fully confined by tillage and would not vary with further mesh refinement the runoff on the ridge surface flows perpendicularly to the ridge line toward furrows the runoff in the furrows flows along the furrow line toward the main gullies this high resolution mesh captured the ridge furrow topography and produced reasonable runoff distribution in the tilled field this fine mesh contains 5 462 million elements leading to longer computation times no further mesh refinement was tested since the resolved runoff and soil erosion distributions were reasonably consistent to the general and micro morphological characteristics of the field 4 2 simulation results of overland flow in the tilled field two photogrammetric surveys were conducted on may 11 2017 to june 12 2017 several rainfall events occurred in this period a strong rainfall event on may 20 2017 was used for the numerical simulation the manning s coefficient for the numerical simulation was nc 0 1 and ns 0 02 for the sheet flow and concentrated flow areas water depth and velocity distribution of the watershed in the gullies furrows and over ridges were initiated by rainfall and solved by eq 1 2 and 3 the simulated runoff distribution aliened well with the general and micro tillage morphology of the land the rainfall hydrograph and the simulated discharge hydrograph at the common watershed outlet of w2 and w3 fig 2a are shown in fig 11 the simulated discharge hydrograph has a shape consistent to the rainfall hydrograph and has a phase delay about 10 min the simulated total volume of the runoff was very close to that of the measured rainfall 315 m3 the simulated distribution of specific flow discharge h u 2 v 2 near the upstream of the north gully is shown in fig 12 the flows in the gully were contributed from sub watershed w2 the flow rate in the gully was much higher due to the accumulative contributions from furrows along the gullies the runoff in the field is largely confined along the tillage lines minor cross tillage flows exist at an angle about 45 toward the gully which are probably due to the natural rills of the gully the feather like runoff distribution is uniquely determined by the gully and tillage pattern 4 3 simulation of sediment transport and gully erosion process tilled lands exhibit a special ridge furrow land surface morphology the observed aerial photogrammetry data indicated that in the tilled corn field erosion occurred along the tillage ridge tops and deposition occurred along the furrows rainfall is distributed evenly but the runoff over ridges is a thin sheet flow and the flow in furrows is concentrated fig 13 the ridges are narrow and have very high local slope gradient the rain splash detachment and transport effect are strong the ridge surface sheet flow and concentrated flow in furrows may largely reduce splash erosion and carry the detached soil away if the flow exceeds break point depth sediment deposition occurred in most of the furrows because flow is not strong enough to carry all the received splash and sheet flow sediments from ridge areas the model solves all processes without differentiating the local flow and geomorphological conditions these were made possible by this physically based model and the fine mesh resolution one observes that it is impossible to delineate this field landform into interrills rills and gullies and apply different methods for these geomorphic zones without rough simplifications simulated velocity magnitude distribution of runoff near a segment of the north gully is presented in fig 14 the maximum velocity of the color bar is set 0 5 m s to enhance visibility of low velocity in tilled areas the flow velocity magnitudes in different morphologic units have large differences the velocity field is therefore illustrated with unit vectors one can find the concentrated flows in the gully and furrows the runoff over the tilled land is separated by ridges runs into furrows and discharges into the gully the directions of the sheet flow and furrow flow are almost perpendicular and distributed alternately the simulated sediment load distribution near the flow peak time in the north channel is shown in fig 15 a receiving sediment contributions from the side furrows along the way the load in the gully is much higher than those in the furrows and the load in the furrows is higher than that over ridges the vectors in the gully and furrows indicate the flow distribution and the vectors on the ridges are too small to be seen the vectors have been coarsened for better visualization the simulated sediment load distributions of point 1 and point 2 turning around locations of the planting equipment fig 3b are shown in fig 15b and c respectively the color bar is adjusted for better clarity the planting operation does create a disturbed area within the tilled surface topography which has an effect on the runoff and sedimentation process 4 4 comparison of surveyed and simulated topographic change several rainfall events occurred during the 31 days between the two surveys and soil erosion over the tilled land and gully erosions did change the topography of the study area by taking the difference between the two datasets the surveyed soil erosion mapping of the watershed can be obtained comparing the survey and simulated topographic change the simulation results can be evaluated the aerial photogrammetry has a high precision to detect the detailed landform elevation the precision is influenced by many irregular factors such as wind relative drawn elevation survey area etc the topography surveys were in watershed scale the topographic erosion deposition over one month period is in the scale of millimeters to centimeters the elevation errors accumulated over the entire watershed are likely distributed unevenly an innovative technique was developed herein to extract the topographic change information from the field data sets this technique avoids errors accumulated in watershed scale survey and enhances overall accuracy reasonable and detailed topographic change results of the tilled field were thus obtained a comparison of the topographic change t2 t1 computed using observed elevation map fig 16 a and numerical simulation fig 16b near the south channel is presented soil erosion occurs along the tillage ridge lines and gully channels deposition occurs in the tillage furrows and along the gully banks a key difference between the two results are the linear tractor tracks present in the surveyed topography change that are absent in the simulated topography change the farmer applied fertilizer between the initial and final topographic surveys the soil surface along these spray rig tracks were disturbed and showed strong topographic change in the aerial survey results fig 16a the observed topographic changes including the deposition along the gully banks appear to be higher than those of the numerical simulation primarily due to the single event simulation the observed topographic change near the north gully in which the effects of the tractor tracks of the spray rig straight lines and planting equipment turn around circles within the field are shown in fig 16c 3d mosaic of t2 surveyed landform fig 16e showed the incision of the north gully which was smoothed at t1 fig 3b simulated topographic change fig 16d shows the gully incision and effect of planting equipment turnarounds at points 1 2 and 3 the soil erosion deposition pattern due to the circle track of point 1 fig 16e is not clear in fig 16c but the effect of sediment transport affected by circle landform can be seen in fig 15b because the straight spray rig lines were created mechanically between the two surveys they are not reflected in the simulation results measured and simulated elevation data cross the south gully in a 7 7 m short section were presented in fig 17 the section is along the mesh line from west to east direction and the data point spacing was 0 1 m the section is nearly normal to the tillage lines but cuts the gully at an angle about 45 the lowest point is the gully thalweg the irregular tillage ridges and furrows can be recognized by relatively high and low points along the land profile most of the erosion was in the gully the simulated result in the gully channel was good almost all tillage ridges were eroded and furrows have depositions the erosion and deposition depth varied at different locations affected by their up and downstream runoff and sediment transport conditions the measured t2 elevation and simulation results agreed quite well showing consistent deposition and erosion trend with few exceptions 4 5 comparison of measured and simulated gully thalweg profiles the observed and simulated thalweg profiles of the north and south gullies are shown in fig 18 the two gully profiles join at a point where the south gully is approximately 182 m in length from its upstream end very near the watershed outlet black triangle mark in fig 18 and fig 20 the steep slope of both gully profiles decreases at the lower part of the watershed the gully slope steepens after the two gullies join the observed and simulated bed change along the thalwegs of the north fig 19 a and south fig 19b gully are shown the observed and simulated erosion and deposition varied and fluctuated along the thalwegs the high variability in thalweg position is largely a result of farming activity across the gullies which build up dense ridge furrow barriers across the gully channels the flow in the gullies flattened the undulating landform by eroding the ridges and filling the furrows deposition occurs along banks where the undulating thalweg forces the water in the gully channel to overflow the bed changes in the upstream part of both gullies are small the middle reach of both channels from about 50 m to 150 m show stronger incision because more water is accumulated in the lower reach of both channels the channel bed erosion and incision are reduced because the general slope of the watershed and gullies are reduced significantly although the survey and simulation results differ the overall trend is reasonable because the thalweg line was created with straight segments linking miscellaneous points along the visually identified deep channel erosion points the thalweg lines of the survey and simulation do not always coincide resulting in additional comparison differences because the gully erosion depths are in the order of a few centimeters it is hard to visualize the changes of gully elevation profiles therefore the two gullies are plotted in five 40 m segments three profiles are plotted in fig 20 initial observed t2 and simulated t2 bed profile in many locations the simulations match the observations although deviations do occur the main trends of the simulations are quite close to the observed profiles some of the deviations may be attributed to thalweg lines in which the bed elevation of the observation and simulation have minor differences in their projected paths considering the complexity of the problem the simulations agree with the observed gully profiles the studied watershed empties into a stream fig 2a near its outlet the merged gully has a short segment of high gradient fig 18 in which the thalweg erosion was more significant fig 20 this incision may trigger further headcut erosion upstream into the watershed in the future 5 discussion this study improved the cche2d model with raindrop detachment transport and soil erosion capabilities and demonstrated the applicability of this physically based model detailed sheet flow and concentrated flow in flat surfaces rills and gullies and raindrop detachment transport and soil erosion due to these flows are simulated with this developed simulation system experimentally observed channel network development and landform evolution processes were reproduced and rainfall induced soil erosion and sediment transport in a tilled land of field scale were also predicted the model responded sensitively to micro morphology the effects of the tracks of planting equipment and spray rig tractors in the tilled land can be recognized in the numerical solutions considering the initial channel network of the experimental watershed was very simple and the consistency of the final observed and simulated stream networks the model predicted the channel network evolution well variable manning s coefficient is introduced in modeling watershed hydrology processes reasonable distribution and dynamic adaptation to water depth distribution of this parameter is important to produce better results high resolution meshes were used to fully resolve the processes in micro morphological units we do not analyze the watershed topography and manually delineate zones of rills interrills and gullies before simulation and apply different simplified methods according to local and surrounding conditions the two dimensional model solved variables such as velocity water depth sediment load and bed change processes in the watershed indiscriminately we have demonstrated that for situations so complex like the tilled cornfield it is not possible to delineate the watershed domain delineation is not applicable to the experimental case because the channel network changed and extended dramatically in the landform evolution process no previous numerical simulations have attempted hydrologic processes in a large scale experiment flume and agriculture field in such details and obtained results in such high resolutions combining high resolution topographic surveys and numerical simulations is an effective approach to soil and gully erosion research the method of non isotropic manning s n vieira and dabney 2011 had been applied to improve the 0 4 m 0 4 m mesh solution for the field case which would force the runoff along assigned directions a pre set n value and a larger n value force the runoff toward a specified direction if successful the coarse mesh solution could be improved to save computation time numerical tests indicated that the runoff direction was reasonably aligned along the tillage only when the ratio of the two coefficients was approximately 1 100 this method was not adopted since it would force the flow and sediment everywhere over the tilled field including those on ridges toward the tillage direction agriculture lands are complicated in order to simulate soil and gully erosions more accurately additional factors such as crops soil property and cultivation etc should be considered additional researches are needed to improve its applicability to field cases with more complex conditions due to the computer speed limitation the simulation results were obtained using one storm event although the computation algorisms of the model are quite efficient further improvements are needed for studying large areas longer time and more comprehensive conditions 6 conclusions a physically based model cche2d was modified and evaluated in simulating field scale watershed hydrology soil erosion sediment transport and landform evolution processes the rain splash induced erosion and transport mechanisms are developed manning s resistance coefficient considering local flow depth is formulated the spatial distributions of n vary dynamically in time as the gully and rills evolve distributive soil erosion due to raindrop erosion sheet flow on flat areas and concentrated flow in rills and gullies are computed over the entire watersheds continuously the model was evaluated using data of a large scale flume experiment designed to quantify soil erosion and gully development due to a rainfall event and base level adjustment the measured and simulated sediment yield processes gully topographic shape cross sections and stream channel network are compared the simulated evolution of the soil mantled experimental landscape stream network and sediment yield showed good agreement to the observations the model was also applied to simulate soil erosion processes in a field scale agricultural watershed the cornfield in the irregularly shaped watersheds was tilled uniformly the two gullies have been disturbed by tillage ridges and furrows across the gully channels a novel method was used to analyze the topographic maps of the watershed to obtain the topographic change due to soil erosion which were surveyed remotely through the high precision aerial photogrammetry because the spacing of the corn tillage is narrow a high resolution of computational mesh is found necessary to capture the flow and sediment transport characteristics of the cornfield one strong rainfall event was simulated to test the model s applicability the simulated flow hydrograph was consistent with the rainfall hydrograph unsteady rainfall runoff and soil erosion and sediment transport processes were simulated and reasonable results were obtained both survey data and simulation indicated that tillage top and gully channel are erosion zones affected by rain splash and concentrated flows respectively most furrows were areas of deposition because the concentrated flows here were incapable of transporting all sediments delivered from the ridges the simulated erosion deposition distributions closely reflect the tillage ridge furrow pattern as well as planting equipment and spray rig track activities this model made it possible to solves all processes without manually delineating field landforms with such a complexity into interrills rills and gullies and apply simplified methods for these geomorphic zones separately the modeling method represents an advancement in soil erosion prediction technology because it is physically based it includes explicit processes for flow hydrodynamics raindrop splash detachment transport soil erosion and sediment transport the technology suggests that detailed and continuous spatial and temporal information for the watershed runoff soil erosion sediment transport and morphologic change processes can be resolved at very fine temporal and spatial scales with an elevated accuracy this study is to meet the future demand for improved soil erosion science and for modeling capabilities as recently noted by the usda weltz et al 2020 further improvement and refinement of the numerical model s efficiency and capability will greatly enhance our ability to study soil and gully erosion and provide better

2064,soil and gully erosion is a critical threat to sustainable agricultural land management and productivity soil erosion by rain splash sheet runoff and concentrated flow are complex problems conditioned by the combined interactions of soil physical properties hydrology human activity landscape topography and climate effective management of erosion processes driven by rainfall and surface runoff requires a combined effort of field observation physical experimentation and numerical simulation a physically based hydrodynamic numerical model cche2d with updated raindrop erosion effects is applied to simulate landscape evolution processes as a result of raindrop impact and overland flow the numerical model simulates a thin layer of runoff and concentrated flow over complex terrains and predicts sediment transport due to raindrop splash detachment transport and soil surface erosions soil erosion and landform evolution simulations due to rainfall are presented for an experimental

usefulness of the model for studying soil and landscape degradation keywords soil and gully erosion sediment transport rainfall splash physically based numerical model lab and field scale study watershed topographic evolution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil erosion due to rainfall and overland flow is detrimental to agricultural management creating rills gullies and removal of fertile topsoil lal 1998 weltz et al 2020 erosion contributes to increased sediment yield from agricultural lands and pollutes downstream water bodies lal 2001 gully erosion is particularly harmful because gullies can accelerate erosion yield more sediment than interrill sources and are more difficult to mitigate ballesteros c√°nova et al 2017 ionita et al 2015 poesen et al 2003 soil and gully erosion control in agricultural lands is a difficult task due to limitations in field survey in capturing small scale landscape changes lack of adequate methods for appraisal of conservation measures and practices and limited capabilities of prediction technology de vente et al 2013 poesen 2018 due to the complexity of soil erosion processes there are still more questions than answers following several decades of study the agricultural research service of the u s department of agriculture usda recently articulated a strategic plan to meet the future needs in soil erosion research and modeling weltz et al 2020 these goals include 1 advancing wind and water erosion science 2 improving the climate model for erosion prediction 3 quantifying factors affecting erosion and 4 developing an integrated wind and water erosion prediction system the current study seeks to contribute substantively to several of these goals identified by the udsa many studies have focused on erosion processes using a variety of methods including experimental measurements field observations and mathematical modeling among these mathematical modeling is cost effective and allows for a robust and comprehensive consideration of influencing factors models such as rusle rusle2 renard and foster 1997 usda ars 2013 wepp flanagan et al 2007 and creams foster et al 1980 have been developed to tackle soil loss processes rusle rusle2 models consider comprehensive watershed process factors and predict soil erosion empirically at the field scale rusle model series has been adopted by other well known watershed models including annagnps bingner and theurer 2001 etc to estimate long term soil erosion wepp is a physically based model which needs to simplify the watershed topography and process these models delineate watersheds into morphologic units and use different simplified methods to compute soil erosion in these landform units separately the cche2d hydrodynamic and sediment transport model has been developed and applied to simulate processes in rivers lakes and coastal waters chao et al 2016 ding et al 2020 jia et al 2019a jia et al 2002 jia and wang 1999 and produced good solutions this model has been tested also using experimental and field watershed data jia et al 2018a b 2019b jia and shirmeen 2016 in cche2d model sheet runoff and concentrated flow and their associated sediment transport are simulated dynamically using the same set of equations these physical mechanisms in a watershed are distributed naturally according to local morphology and are handled in the model as a continuously distributed process there is no need to differentiate and delineate morphologic zones such as rill interrill and gully as separated modeling areas willgoose et al 1991a b developed a 2d model for simulating long term landform evolution a watershed stream network and its evolution were simulated by solving a bed change equation the flow and sediment transport are highly simplified overland soil erosion processes are difficult to parameterize in models wei et al 2009 developed equations relating sediment discharge to rainfall intensity and runoff rate using field data xiao et al 2017 studied soil erosion rate in concentrated flows and related this to shear stress stream power water depth and flow discharge zhang et al 2003 studied soil detachment using undisturbed soil and found good correlations between soil detachment rate and flow parameters zhang et al 2009 measured sediment transport capacity over relatively steep soil slopes 8 8 46 6 and found that transport capacity had a close relationship to soil shear stress using experimental data aksoy et al 2017 tested sediment transport formulae and found that the total sediment transport rate was related to combinations of slope rainfall intensity runoff rate and sediment size for rill and interrill areas liu et al 2006 applied sediment transport formulae for open channels to rill erosion processes their sediment detachment function for interrill erosion however was related to runoff velocity rather than rainfall intensity and no topographic change was computed these studies often focus on the erosion rate and the flow parameters for a specific soil area slope steepness rainfall flow rate and typically use one dimensional models the results are difficult to apply to natural watersheds where unsteady processes over multiple morphologic units occur and interact if a numerical model introduces too many simplifications and or idealizations it becomes difficult to capture key physical processes physically based models with fewer simplifications should have a higher potential to effectively model complex hill slope hydrologic processes in this study a physically based finite element hydrodynamic and sediment transport model cche2d is modified and evaluated to simulate rainfall induced watershed runoff process splash erosion channel incision and sediment transport in addition to the original sediment transport capabilities the model is first applied to predict soil erosion processes generated by simulated precipitation in a laboratory experiment conducted at the usda ars national sedimentation laboratory momm et al 2018 the model is then applied to a tilled agricultural field located in shelby county iowa numerical solutions were obtained with high spatial resolutions and the results were evaluated through comparison to sequential topographic surveys using high precision photogrammetry 2 numerical methods and simulation cases 2 1 cche2d hydrodynamic model sheet flow due to rainfall over interrills and concentrated flow in rills and gullies are simulated by solving the depth integrated reynolds stress equations the water surface elevation of the runoff flow Œ∑ is calculated by the continuity equation 1 h t u h r where h Œ∑ Œ∂ is the local water depth Œ∑ and Œ∂ are water surface and bed elevation respectively the variable u u v is a vector of the depth averaged velocity components in x and y directions respectively t is time and r is rainfall intensity which may be a temporal and spatial variable the depth averaged 2d momentum equations for turbulent flows are 2 u t u u x v u y g Œ∑ x œÑ xx x œÑ xy y œÑ Œ∂ x œÅ h 3 v t u v x v v y g Œ∑ y œÑ yx x œÑ yy y œÑ Œ∂ y œÅ h where g is the gravitational acceleration œÅ is water density œÑxx œÑxy œÑyx and œÑyy are depth averaged reynolds stresses and œÑŒ∂x œÑŒ∂y are bed shear stresses for the interrill areas representing shallow laminar flow the convection and reynolds stress terms vanish and eqs 2 and 3 become the kinematic wave equations while in many segments of rills and gullies the reynolds number in terms of the depth or width of the flow may be quite large and the flow would be turbulent the bed shear stresses on the soil surface are evaluated in conjunction with the manning s formula as 4 œÑ Œ∂ x œÅ œÑ Œ∂ y œÅ h g j x j y g n 2 u h 1 3 u v where n is the manning s roughness coefficient and u u 2 v 2 is the total velocity the terms j x j y are components of friction slope j manning s n normally is determined by calibrating the numerical model using experimental data because manning s coefficient is empirical it is highly dependent on soil surface roughness texture tillage and vegetation conditions in this complex situation a constant resistance coefficient would not be suitable detailed experimental studies also indicate this coefficient varies with water depth and rainfall intensity shen et al 2020 shen and li 1973 fraga et al 2013 found that n varies significantly with the depth of overland flow dramatic increases occur when water depth is less than about 5 mm to 1 mm and this change would be greater in the presence of dense vegetation this is consistent with many runoff simulation results noting that manning s n for runoff is much larger than those for rivers downer 2008 kalyanapu et al 2009 singh et al 2014 in this study overland flow is generated by rainfall over irregular topographies the runoff over the soil surface and the tillage ridges are thin sheet flows h 0 001 m 0 00001 m and that along the gully and furrows are concentrated flows depending on the location and rainfall intensity the impact of rain splash on the flow and soil erosion would vary spatially strong on sheet flow and weak on concentrated flows the water depth distribution will also change in time with the evolution of gullies and rills in watershed instead of using a constant manning s coefficient an empirical formula is developed in this study to include the spatial variation effect and allow it to adapt to the evolving topography 5 n 1 max min h h c h s h s h c h s n s n c n c where ns is for sheet flow nc is for concentrated flow hs is the maximum sheet flow depth hc is the minimum concentrated flow depth n n c if h h c and n n s if h h s the distribution of n following eq 5 is shown in fig 1 in which h c 0 01 m and h s 0 001 m in this study n c 0 1 h c 0 01 m and h s 0 001 m were used for both experimental and field case n s 0 03 and n s 0 02 were used for experimental and field case respectively 2 2 soil erosion and sediment transport model when numerical models are used to simulate hillslope soil erosion processes particularly physically based models each process involved should be defined in general watershed sediment transport is driven by two forcings raindrop splash and flow shear detachments both forcings exist in sheet runoff concentrated flow only has shear force raindrop splash detaches and transports soil mass raindrop impact effect is a new erosion mechanism to cche2d some previous researches were reviewed and adopted with modification nearing et al 1989 developed an equation for rainfall induced interrill erosion defined as 6 e i k i i 2 kg s 1 m 2 where ki is the interrill erodibility and i is rainfall intensity sediment transport in rills is dominated by detachment capacity ef and deposition rate dr defined as 7 e f k r œÑ œÑ c 1 g t c kg s 1 m 2 8 d r œâ hu t c g kg s 1 m 2 where œâ is sediment fall velocity erosion occurs when the shear stress at the soil surface œÑ is greater than the critical shear stress of the soil œÑ c deposition is computed when the sediment load g kg s 1 m 1 is greater than the transport capacity tc estimated using yalin s equation finkner et al 1989 at the end of a slope the sedimentation process in rills and interrill areas are handled separately a watershed therefore has to be delineated into rill and interrill zones rain detachment occurs only in the interrill area while the flow shear force is used for rill erosion morgan et al 1998 introduced a comprehensive watershed modeling system eurosem the soil detachment by rainfall impact is calculated by 9 e i a 0 œÅ s k e e z h where ke is the total kinetic energy of the raindrops at the ground surface a0 is the soil detachability and z is a coefficient the rain impact effect vanishes with a greater surface water depth the soil detachment rate by runoff is computed by 10 e f Œ≤ œâ c c c where cc is the transport capacity c is the suspended sediment concentration and Œ≤ is a detachment coefficient that equals unity for non cohesive sediments the net erosion of a slope plane can be computed by combined splash and flow erosion 11 e e i e f gholizadeh et al 2018 assessed 15 algorithms computing raindrop induced soil particle detachment and found the method of hairsine and rose 1991 demonstrated good results under a variety of conditions in this study the equation of hairsine and rose 1991 defining the splash detachment rate due to impact of rainfall is adopted 12 e i a 0 min 1 h 0 h b i p where ei is non zero when water depth h is less than or equal to the break point depth h0 and b and p are dimensionless parameters this equation can be easily applied to general conditions it produces raindrop detachment when the water depth is very small and no raindrop detachment erosion in concentrated flow areas the raindrop splash erosion equation was adopted with the depth effect exponent b set to 1 to 2 and soil detachability was used as a calibration parameter a value of p 2 was adopted h 0 1 m m and h 0 0 5 m m in eq 2 were tested for the experiment and field case respectively sediment yield increases slightly with h 0 no canopy and ground cover effects were considered rain splash erosion is effective in the sheet flow area and it vanishes quickly when water depth becomes larger than h0 when the soil surface has a slope the splash results in a net soil transport downslope dunne et al 2010 developed an empirical function according to experimental data to account for this effect 13 f 1 0 5 e 2 2 t a n j b where f is the fraction of sediment splashed toward downslope j b is the local slope gradient in the 2d model it is computed j b œõ x 2 œõ y 2 when j b 0 50 of the sediment moves toward up and downslope direction the splash transport effect can be dominant where land has steep and variable slope gradient in tilled lands for instance splash induced soil detachment and transport along tillage ridges are strong but become minimal in furrows in this study sediment transport and topographic change are simulated by a two dimensional flow and sediment transport model in the cche2d model erosion and deposition in sheet and concentrated flows are handled with unified formulations sediment load is computed using a mass transport equation 14 1 u b q t q q q c l 15 q q q q x q y where l is a case dependent length scale called the adaptation length for non equilibrium sediment transport ub is the sediment velocity q is the sediment load transport rate and qc is the total sediment transport capacity when rain splash effects exist the transport capacity in the sheet flow zone is enhanced by rain splash and should be modified two rain splash related effects are considered to formulate the corresponding sediment transport capacity in practice ei is the net splashed soil mass rate maintained by raindrop energy and it is a balance of soil particles detached from and re attached to the soil surface the sediment concentration of soil particles in the runoff layer is proportional to e i h and e i u b h is the transport capacity of the sheet flow movement eq 13 is modified to account for net contribution fraction of splash transport toward downslope 1 e 2 2 tan j b the net effect of splash transport vanishes if the slope gradient is uniform in a large area but it should have contributions along the edges of gullies and in tilled land where splash erosion occurs along narrow strips with alternating high and low gradient an estimate of the sediment load considering these two effects splash detached soil moving with sheet flow and direct splash transport is as follows 16 q i c 0 u b max h h s e i Œ± 1 e 2 2 tan j b e i where c0 is a combined coefficient eq 16 does not include canopy interception the transport equation including the rain splash effects then becomes 17 1 u b q t q q q c l q i eq 17 unifies both soil erosion and sediment transport processes for concentrated flow and rain splash in rills and gullies rain splash erosion vanishes and deposition and erosion are determined by the balance of sediment load and sediment transport capacity in thin sheet flow areas the sediment transport capacity is relatively less dominant and rain splash erosion contributes more to sediment load and topographic change the corresponding bed change equation is 18 œÅ s 1 p 0 œõ t q q c l q i where p0 is porosity and œÅ s is sediment mass density the source term is the same as that of eq 17 because sediment load conservation is also the net sediment exchange between the soil surface and the flow all partial differential equations were solved implicitly in this study the sediment transport capacity is a 2d variable distributed over the entire watershed it is computed using the sediment transport formula of wu et al 2000 and wu 2001 the critical shear stress for sediment entrainment is modified to consider the effect of sediment angle of repose the simulations of the runoff and soil erosion processes were coupled 2 3 experimental and field scale soil erosion and landform evolution data the modified cche2d was first used to simulate rainfall runoff soil gully erosion processes in an experimental landscape momm et al 2018 wells et al 2016 in the experiments a soil mantled flume 1 8 m 9 3 m was subjected to simulated rainfall over a period of 18 5 h homogenous soil was used in the experiment and the overall flume slope was set to 5 momm et al 2018 the tested soil is a mixture of sand 3 silt 73 and clay 24 the bulk density of the compacted soil was 1450 kg m3 the simulated rainfall was produced by 14 oscillatory pressure nozzles in the first 360 min of experiment the applied rainfall was 30 mm h which pre wetted the soil the rainfall was then increased to 105 mm h for 735 min and the downstream outlet was lowered 4 cm for soil erosion simulation the landscape evolution process was captured at multiple time 420 465 525 645 705 855 915 975 1035 and 1095 min using the photogrammetry technique the second simulation case was an agricultural field located in shelby county iowa u s a with an area of approximately 54 500 m2 it was surveyed following corn planting on may 11 2017 t1 and one month later on june 12 2017 t2 the landscape relief was less than 20 m the entire area is a tilled cornfield and the tillage is aligned very near north south direction several rainfall events occurred in the period contours in fig 2 a shows the general field topography the three yellow lines indicate the divide of sub watersheds in the survey area approximately one stream was situated at the downslope edge of the watershed the gullies developed in w2 and w3 are referred to north and south gully which merge near the outlet and empty into the stream fig 2a the two side sub watersheds w1 and w4 were only partially surveyed and their main outlets are outside the surveyed study area since they are in the domain w1 and w4 were simulated the simulated flow and sediment in sub watershed w1 and w4 were discharged to auxiliary outlets not shown the tillage induced land surface variation can hardly be seen in the contour map directly the variation can be recognized from the tiny wiggles of the black contour lines the distribution of gradient of local topography j b within the survey area is computed and shown in fig 2b the highly irregular land surface and two gullies are more perceptible and pronounced in the slope map the slope gradient along the two main gullies and near the lower part of the watershed 0 01 0 075 are much less than that over the upper hillslope 0 11 0 15 a novel surveying technique was employed wells et al 2016 2017 where traditional surveying methods were used to establish fixed benchmark points at the edge of the field multiple ground control points spread throughout the field then very high resolution uas survey imagery of the field was captured fig 3 the point density in the horizontal direction was 0 1 cm and the elevation accuracy was 2 cm the uncertainty of the survey method was 1 29 mm for low relief 17 cm and 2 55 mm for higher relief 63 cm topography wells et al 2016 three dimensional point clouds were post processed to assure elevation changes were due to erosional processes rather than survey misalignment fig 3a and 3b show a photo and the 3d imagery near the north east corner of the watershed where the circling marks of planting equipment were clearly seen at point 1 2 and 3 fig 3a and b are of t1 the gully was smoothed by tilling fig 3c and d show the photo and 3d imagery of a small area near the south gully surveyed at t2 the gully has been eroded by sediment transport between the t1 and t2 survey neither flow hydrograph nor sediment yield from this field were measured 3 numerical simulation of soil erosion and landform evolution in an experimental flume 3 1 sediment transport process soil erosion started after the rainfall intensity was increased from 30 mm h to 105 mm h at 360 min and when the downstream boundary was subjected to exogenic forcing through base level lowering momm et al 2018 one representative silt particle size 0 05 mm was set for the soil material the observed erosion rate and thus sediment yield stabilized after 600 min fig 4 the numerical simulation separated the erosion process into two time periods 360 min to 705 min p1 and 650 min to 1150 min p2 in p1 the erosion was dominated by a 4 cm base level lowering at 360 min and an increase in rainfall intensity the sediment load increased quickly and then became constant with time in p2 the base level was lowered an additional 3 cm at 734 min the sediment load exiting the flume however remained steady these two time periods have a short overlap even though the watershed outlet was lowered by 3 cm at 734 min the erosion process was not notably affected so the outlet level change at 734 min was not implemented in the simulation the measured soil topography at elapsed time 360 min and 645 min were used as the initial conditions for p1 and p2 respectively a high density cartesian mesh of 41 85 k nodes was generated for this experimental watershed using 2 cm 2 cm uniform mesh size measured topographic surfaces obtained during the laboratory experiment were projected onto the mesh for numerical simulation one p2 simulation on a laptop pc took about 8 h a mesh with finer resolution the same as that of the photogrammetry data 1 cm 1 cm was also tested the finer mesh was not used because the speed was much slower and the results was about the same the observed sediment load at the flume outlet is shown in fig 4 for the entire experiment the sediment load was very low before the rainfall was increased at 360 min and base level was lowered the sediment load increased quickly and kept almost constant after 600 min good agreement was found when sediment loads from the differences of the simulated topographic elevation data serious was calculated fig 4 diamond lines soil erosion and sediment transport are largely driven by hydrodynamics solved using eqs 1 3 and the flow field is affected by the evolving topographic distribution a flow vector field coarsened for clarity near the main channel at t 540 min p1 is shown in fig 5 the gully and associated rills are reflected by dense contour lines the vectors over the flat areas are relatively uniform representing thin sheet flow they concentrate toward the gully heads driven by localized elevation differences and steeper flow gradients which enhance headcut development and evolution the erosions over flat areas are dominated by the rainfall splash detachment eq 16 soil particles are suspended by the splash impact and move with the sheet flow dynamic erosion of soil occurs largely in the gully and rills where the water depth is greater than the break point depth eq 12 and the dynamic forcing is able to pick up soil particles from soil surface and carry those from upstream sheet flows using eq 5 the manning s coefficient for sheet flow and concentrated flow were set as ns 0 1 and nc 0 03 respectively this feature is important to obtaining reasonable results not only because the distribution is more physically viable but also it adapts to changing topography the distributions of n vary dynamically in time as the gully and rills evolve simulated and measured sediment yields from the experimental soil erosion flume are compared in fig 6 the measured cumulative sediment yield is computed using the observed sediment load exiting the downstream outlet of the soil flume simulated sediment yields for p1 experimental time between 360 and 705 min and p2 experimental time between 645 and 1150 min are also shown the initial sediment yield for p2 line was set to start at 400 kg approximately equal to that of the end value of p1 overall the trends for the measured sediment exiting the flume and the numerical simulations agreed well 3 2 morphologic evolution the morphologic evolution of the experimental watershed is controlled by raindrop splash detachment transport sheet flow over the surface and concentrated flow within the eroding rills and gullies measured and simulated watershed morphologic development in p1 is compared in fig 7 for elapsed times 520 min and 645 min the measured landscape presents a wider channel for both time periods and a faster channel extension toward the watershed upstream for the simulated watershed the main headcut channel is narrower and deeper and there are a larger number of rills developed feeding the main channel the simulated surface shows more morphologic development than the measured surface measured and simulated topographies for p2 are presented in fig 8 for 915 min and 1095 min here the general trends of the simulated and measured watershed surface evolutions are similar the measured landscape surface has more surficial sheet flow erosion but contains less rill and gully incisions similar to p1 there is considerably more rill development and evolution within the simulated results while there is an agreement in terms of the magnitude of soil loss in time from the simulations the evolution of the surfaces is not identical comparison of measured and simulated topographic cross sections at specific time intervals are presented in fig 9 the cross sections are located 1 3 5 and 7 m from the downstream outlet in general the volume of soil loss is similar however there is clearly greater surface incision within the simulations the simulated gully channel is narrower and deeper than the measured the simulated main gully cross sections have uneven profiles primarily due to the development of side tributaries along the gully channel and rills over the soil surface for this reason the simulated cross section profiles close to the flume walls are much less smooth than those in the measured data these features can also be observed in figs 7 and 8 the differences may be attributed to rainfall simulation characterization in the numerical model i e uniform and steady as opposed to that in the experiment produced by 14 oscillatory pressure nozzles pressure and area calibrations were conducted on the laboratory rainfall simulator the raindrops were not perpendicular to the ground the distribution and kinetic energy of the rainfall may not be spatially uniform differences between the observed and simulated surface topographies could also be due to variations in rainfall rates and spatial variations in soil erodibility extracted channel networks from the measured and simulated landforms at 1195 min are presented in fig 10 a where only one half of the experimental watershed the upstream part is shown here the network of the measured topography white lines and that of the simulated topography black lines are highly similar many subnetworks overlap but differences remain to further examine the statistic consistency of the experiment and simulation a watershed network analysis tool zhang and jia 2020 was used to generate the dendritic channel network for the topographies the generated strahler network has 4 orders of channels where the main gully is the 4th order fig 10b shows the mean area distributions of strahler streams of the two channel networks fig 10c shows the distributions of the number of strahler streams near overlapping of these curves r 2 1 0 for strahler area and r 2 0 999 for strahler stream number indicate that the simulated channel network is almost identical to the measured channel network while figs 7 8 and 9 show that there is more rill development within the simulated watershed surface the results of the channel network analysis revealed that these developed rills also exist within the measured landform in less incised states the results presented in figs 6 through 10 show that the numerical simulations reproduced sediment yield processes gully and rill erosion distributions and a dendritic channel network in close agreement to those observed in physical experiment the main differences are that the simulated main gully channel is somewhat deeper and narrower and it has more and deeper side sub gullies and rills 4 simulation results of soil erosion in field conditions 4 1 mesh resolution the aerial photogrammetry of the field data was collected at high resolution the spatial distance of the tillage ridges was approximately 80 cm two cartesian meshes 0 4 m 0 4 m and 0 1 m 0 1 m were generated for preliminary numerical simulations the mesh lines were set in the east west and north south direction it was found that the coarser mesh 0 4 m 0 4 m could not resolve cross tillage topography properly as the undulating landform features were smoothed too much the simulated runoff in the tilled land were not reasonable it largely goes across the tillage lines and run along the direction of the hillslope the finer 0 1 m 0 1 m mesh was tested on average each tillage is resolved with 8 mesh lines the numerical solutions in tilled area are fully confined by tillage and would not vary with further mesh refinement the runoff on the ridge surface flows perpendicularly to the ridge line toward furrows the runoff in the furrows flows along the furrow line toward the main gullies this high resolution mesh captured the ridge furrow topography and produced reasonable runoff distribution in the tilled field this fine mesh contains 5 462 million elements leading to longer computation times no further mesh refinement was tested since the resolved runoff and soil erosion distributions were reasonably consistent to the general and micro morphological characteristics of the field 4 2 simulation results of overland flow in the tilled field two photogrammetric surveys were conducted on may 11 2017 to june 12 2017 several rainfall events occurred in this period a strong rainfall event on may 20 2017 was used for the numerical simulation the manning s coefficient for the numerical simulation was nc 0 1 and ns 0 02 for the sheet flow and concentrated flow areas water depth and velocity distribution of the watershed in the gullies furrows and over ridges were initiated by rainfall and solved by eq 1 2 and 3 the simulated runoff distribution aliened well with the general and micro tillage morphology of the land the rainfall hydrograph and the simulated discharge hydrograph at the common watershed outlet of w2 and w3 fig 2a are shown in fig 11 the simulated discharge hydrograph has a shape consistent to the rainfall hydrograph and has a phase delay about 10 min the simulated total volume of the runoff was very close to that of the measured rainfall 315 m3 the simulated distribution of specific flow discharge h u 2 v 2 near the upstream of the north gully is shown in fig 12 the flows in the gully were contributed from sub watershed w2 the flow rate in the gully was much higher due to the accumulative contributions from furrows along the gullies the runoff in the field is largely confined along the tillage lines minor cross tillage flows exist at an angle about 45 toward the gully which are probably due to the natural rills of the gully the feather like runoff distribution is uniquely determined by the gully and tillage pattern 4 3 simulation of sediment transport and gully erosion process tilled lands exhibit a special ridge furrow land surface morphology the observed aerial photogrammetry data indicated that in the tilled corn field erosion occurred along the tillage ridge tops and deposition occurred along the furrows rainfall is distributed evenly but the runoff over ridges is a thin sheet flow and the flow in furrows is concentrated fig 13 the ridges are narrow and have very high local slope gradient the rain splash detachment and transport effect are strong the ridge surface sheet flow and concentrated flow in furrows may largely reduce splash erosion and carry the detached soil away if the flow exceeds break point depth sediment deposition occurred in most of the furrows because flow is not strong enough to carry all the received splash and sheet flow sediments from ridge areas the model solves all processes without differentiating the local flow and geomorphological conditions these were made possible by this physically based model and the fine mesh resolution one observes that it is impossible to delineate this field landform into interrills rills and gullies and apply different methods for these geomorphic zones without rough simplifications simulated velocity magnitude distribution of runoff near a segment of the north gully is presented in fig 14 the maximum velocity of the color bar is set 0 5 m s to enhance visibility of low velocity in tilled areas the flow velocity magnitudes in different morphologic units have large differences the velocity field is therefore illustrated with unit vectors one can find the concentrated flows in the gully and furrows the runoff over the tilled land is separated by ridges runs into furrows and discharges into the gully the directions of the sheet flow and furrow flow are almost perpendicular and distributed alternately the simulated sediment load distribution near the flow peak time in the north channel is shown in fig 15 a receiving sediment contributions from the side furrows along the way the load in the gully is much higher than those in the furrows and the load in the furrows is higher than that over ridges the vectors in the gully and furrows indicate the flow distribution and the vectors on the ridges are too small to be seen the vectors have been coarsened for better visualization the simulated sediment load distributions of point 1 and point 2 turning around locations of the planting equipment fig 3b are shown in fig 15b and c respectively the color bar is adjusted for better clarity the planting operation does create a disturbed area within the tilled surface topography which has an effect on the runoff and sedimentation process 4 4 comparison of surveyed and simulated topographic change several rainfall events occurred during the 31 days between the two surveys and soil erosion over the tilled land and gully erosions did change the topography of the study area by taking the difference between the two datasets the surveyed soil erosion mapping of the watershed can be obtained comparing the survey and simulated topographic change the simulation results can be evaluated the aerial photogrammetry has a high precision to detect the detailed landform elevation the precision is influenced by many irregular factors such as wind relative drawn elevation survey area etc the topography surveys were in watershed scale the topographic erosion deposition over one month period is in the scale of millimeters to centimeters the elevation errors accumulated over the entire watershed are likely distributed unevenly an innovative technique was developed herein to extract the topographic change information from the field data sets this technique avoids errors accumulated in watershed scale survey and enhances overall accuracy reasonable and detailed topographic change results of the tilled field were thus obtained a comparison of the topographic change t2 t1 computed using observed elevation map fig 16 a and numerical simulation fig 16b near the south channel is presented soil erosion occurs along the tillage ridge lines and gully channels deposition occurs in the tillage furrows and along the gully banks a key difference between the two results are the linear tractor tracks present in the surveyed topography change that are absent in the simulated topography change the farmer applied fertilizer between the initial and final topographic surveys the soil surface along these spray rig tracks were disturbed and showed strong topographic change in the aerial survey results fig 16a the observed topographic changes including the deposition along the gully banks appear to be higher than those of the numerical simulation primarily due to the single event simulation the observed topographic change near the north gully in which the effects of the tractor tracks of the spray rig straight lines and planting equipment turn around circles within the field are shown in fig 16c 3d mosaic of t2 surveyed landform fig 16e showed the incision of the north gully which was smoothed at t1 fig 3b simulated topographic change fig 16d shows the gully incision and effect of planting equipment turnarounds at points 1 2 and 3 the soil erosion deposition pattern due to the circle track of point 1 fig 16e is not clear in fig 16c but the effect of sediment transport affected by circle landform can be seen in fig 15b because the straight spray rig lines were created mechanically between the two surveys they are not reflected in the simulation results measured and simulated elevation data cross the south gully in a 7 7 m short section were presented in fig 17 the section is along the mesh line from west to east direction and the data point spacing was 0 1 m the section is nearly normal to the tillage lines but cuts the gully at an angle about 45 the lowest point is the gully thalweg the irregular tillage ridges and furrows can be recognized by relatively high and low points along the land profile most of the erosion was in the gully the simulated result in the gully channel was good almost all tillage ridges were eroded and furrows have depositions the erosion and deposition depth varied at different locations affected by their up and downstream runoff and sediment transport conditions the measured t2 elevation and simulation results agreed quite well showing consistent deposition and erosion trend with few exceptions 4 5 comparison of measured and simulated gully thalweg profiles the observed and simulated thalweg profiles of the north and south gullies are shown in fig 18 the two gully profiles join at a point where the south gully is approximately 182 m in length from its upstream end very near the watershed outlet black triangle mark in fig 18 and fig 20 the steep slope of both gully profiles decreases at the lower part of the watershed the gully slope steepens after the two gullies join the observed and simulated bed change along the thalwegs of the north fig 19 a and south fig 19b gully are shown the observed and simulated erosion and deposition varied and fluctuated along the thalwegs the high variability in thalweg position is largely a result of farming activity across the gullies which build up dense ridge furrow barriers across the gully channels the flow in the gullies flattened the undulating landform by eroding the ridges and filling the furrows deposition occurs along banks where the undulating thalweg forces the water in the gully channel to overflow the bed changes in the upstream part of both gullies are small the middle reach of both channels from about 50 m to 150 m show stronger incision because more water is accumulated in the lower reach of both channels the channel bed erosion and incision are reduced because the general slope of the watershed and gullies are reduced significantly although the survey and simulation results differ the overall trend is reasonable because the thalweg line was created with straight segments linking miscellaneous points along the visually identified deep channel erosion points the thalweg lines of the survey and simulation do not always coincide resulting in additional comparison differences because the gully erosion depths are in the order of a few centimeters it is hard to visualize the changes of gully elevation profiles therefore the two gullies are plotted in five 40 m segments three profiles are plotted in fig 20 initial observed t2 and simulated t2 bed profile in many locations the simulations match the observations although deviations do occur the main trends of the simulations are quite close to the observed profiles some of the deviations may be attributed to thalweg lines in which the bed elevation of the observation and simulation have minor differences in their projected paths considering the complexity of the problem the simulations agree with the observed gully profiles the studied watershed empties into a stream fig 2a near its outlet the merged gully has a short segment of high gradient fig 18 in which the thalweg erosion was more significant fig 20 this incision may trigger further headcut erosion upstream into the watershed in the future 5 discussion this study improved the cche2d model with raindrop detachment transport and soil erosion capabilities and demonstrated the applicability of this physically based model detailed sheet flow and concentrated flow in flat surfaces rills and gullies and raindrop detachment transport and soil erosion due to these flows are simulated with this developed simulation system experimentally observed channel network development and landform evolution processes were reproduced and rainfall induced soil erosion and sediment transport in a tilled land of field scale were also predicted the model responded sensitively to micro morphology the effects of the tracks of planting equipment and spray rig tractors in the tilled land can be recognized in the numerical solutions considering the initial channel network of the experimental watershed was very simple and the consistency of the final observed and simulated stream networks the model predicted the channel network evolution well variable manning s coefficient is introduced in modeling watershed hydrology processes reasonable distribution and dynamic adaptation to water depth distribution of this parameter is important to produce better results high resolution meshes were used to fully resolve the processes in micro morphological units we do not analyze the watershed topography and manually delineate zones of rills interrills and gullies before simulation and apply different simplified methods according to local and surrounding conditions the two dimensional model solved variables such as velocity water depth sediment load and bed change processes in the watershed indiscriminately we have demonstrated that for situations so complex like the tilled cornfield it is not possible to delineate the watershed domain delineation is not applicable to the experimental case because the channel network changed and extended dramatically in the landform evolution process no previous numerical simulations have attempted hydrologic processes in a large scale experiment flume and agriculture field in such details and obtained results in such high resolutions combining high resolution topographic surveys and numerical simulations is an effective approach to soil and gully erosion research the method of non isotropic manning s n vieira and dabney 2011 had been applied to improve the 0 4 m 0 4 m mesh solution for the field case which would force the runoff along assigned directions a pre set n value and a larger n value force the runoff toward a specified direction if successful the coarse mesh solution could be improved to save computation time numerical tests indicated that the runoff direction was reasonably aligned along the tillage only when the ratio of the two coefficients was approximately 1 100 this method was not adopted since it would force the flow and sediment everywhere over the tilled field including those on ridges toward the tillage direction agriculture lands are complicated in order to simulate soil and gully erosions more accurately additional factors such as crops soil property and cultivation etc should be considered additional researches are needed to improve its applicability to field cases with more complex conditions due to the computer speed limitation the simulation results were obtained using one storm event although the computation algorisms of the model are quite efficient further improvements are needed for studying large areas longer time and more comprehensive conditions 6 conclusions a physically based model cche2d was modified and evaluated in simulating field scale watershed hydrology soil erosion sediment transport and landform evolution processes the rain splash induced erosion and transport mechanisms are developed manning s resistance coefficient considering local flow depth is formulated the spatial distributions of n vary dynamically in time as the gully and rills evolve distributive soil erosion due to raindrop erosion sheet flow on flat areas and concentrated flow in rills and gullies are computed over the entire watersheds continuously the model was evaluated using data of a large scale flume experiment designed to quantify soil erosion and gully development due to a rainfall event and base level adjustment the measured and simulated sediment yield processes gully topographic shape cross sections and stream channel network are compared the simulated evolution of the soil mantled experimental landscape stream network and sediment yield showed good agreement to the observations the model was also applied to simulate soil erosion processes in a field scale agricultural watershed the cornfield in the irregularly shaped watersheds was tilled uniformly the two gullies have been disturbed by tillage ridges and furrows across the gully channels a novel method was used to analyze the topographic maps of the watershed to obtain the topographic change due to soil erosion which were surveyed remotely through the high precision aerial photogrammetry because the spacing of the corn tillage is narrow a high resolution of computational mesh is found necessary to capture the flow and sediment transport characteristics of the cornfield one strong rainfall event was simulated to test the model s applicability the simulated flow hydrograph was consistent with the rainfall hydrograph unsteady rainfall runoff and soil erosion and sediment transport processes were simulated and reasonable results were obtained both survey data and simulation indicated that tillage top and gully channel are erosion zones affected by rain splash and concentrated flows respectively most furrows were areas of deposition because the concentrated flows here were incapable of transporting all sediments delivered from the ridges the simulated erosion deposition distributions closely reflect the tillage ridge furrow pattern as well as planting equipment and spray rig track activities this model made it possible to solves all processes without manually delineating field landforms with such a complexity into interrills rills and gullies and apply simplified methods for these geomorphic zones separately the modeling method represents an advancement in soil erosion prediction technology because it is physically based it includes explicit processes for flow hydrodynamics raindrop splash detachment transport soil erosion and sediment transport the technology suggests that detailed and continuous spatial and temporal information for the watershed runoff soil erosion sediment transport and morphologic change processes can be resolved at very fine temporal and spatial scales with an elevated accuracy this study is to meet the future demand for improved soil erosion science and for modeling capabilities as recently noted by the usda weltz et al 2020 further improvement and refinement of the numerical model s efficiency and capability will greatly enhance our ability to study soil and gully erosion and provide better
