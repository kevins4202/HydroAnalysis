15060,biofilm coated microplastics are omnipresent in aquatic environments carrying different organic matter om that in turn influences the flocculation and settling of microplastic aggregates in this study the effects of chitosan guar gum humic acid and xanthan gum on the flocculation of anthropogenic microplastics are examined under controlled shear through the mixing chamber experiments the results show that all of the selected oms have positive effects on biofilm culturing and thus enhance the growth of microplastic flocs with more evident promoting effects for cationic and neutral oms i e chitosan and guar gum than anionic oms i e humic acid and xanthan no critical shear rate is observed in the size vs shear relationship based on our measurements in addition the quadrature based two class population balance model is employed to track the development of bimodal floc size distributions fsds composed of small and large microplastic flocs the model predictions show reasonable agreement with the observed fsds the largest error of settling flux from the two class model is 7 8 in contrast with the reference value measured by the camera based fsds with 30 bins this study highlights the role of different oms on microplastic flocculation and indicates that a two class model may be sufficient to describe microplastic transport processes in estuaries graphical abstract

al 2013 with diameters less than 5 mm it is an environmental pollutant that has drawn great attention in recent decades thompson et al 2004 but was identified even back to the 1970s carpenter and smith 1972 currently microplastics are almost ubiquitous in aquatic environments such as rivers eerkes medrano et al 2015 estuaries xu et al 2018 coasts barnes et al 2009 oceans cole et al 2011 and even deep seas van cauwenberghe et al 2013 woodall et al 2014 understanding the transport of microplastics is critical to further control these particles and their leaching pollutants in open channel flows buoyant microplastics are present in two ways some floating on the surface cózar et al 2014 and others suspended in the water column kukulka et al 2012 2016 isobe et al 2014 enders et al 2015 this indicates that microplastics not only move horizontally due to hydrodynamic forcing but are also transported vertically due to both downward settling and upward mixing low density microplastics are supposed to float on the surface and hardly appear on the bed however high concentrations of microplastics have been observed in marine sediments worldwide e g galgani et al 2000 thompson et al 2004 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 woodall et al 2014 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 and 2015 for instance the number concentration of microplastics is up to 200 2200 l in the sediment bed of the 10 908 m deep mariana trench peng et al 2018 biological colonization may increase or decrease the density of microplastic flocs waldschläger et al 2022 for example biodeposits from mussels could aggregate with microplastic particles and accelerate their settling piarulli and airoldi 2020 some microplastic flocs eventually settle to the seabed due to biofilm formation macleod et al 2021 and may behave as sediment particles that undergo bedload transport resuspension and deposition zhang 2017 biofilm formation is a complex microbial process microplastic particles during the incubation periods are preferably rapidly colonized by microorganisms on the particle surface thereby forming dynamically varying biofilms this is mainly due to the large specific surface area of microplastic flocs and the abundant functional groups generated by surface weathering zettler et al 2013 lobelle and cunliffe 2011 thus microplastics interact closely with biofilms on their surfaces providing voids for the survival of microorganisms and acting as carriers for them to facilitate their migration tu et al 2020b as the structures of biofilms are not stationary the physiochemical properties of microplastics such as density chemical functional groups and roughness are also changing which in turn affect the migration and transport of microplastics tu et al 2020a oberbeckmann and labrenz 2020 rummel et al 2017 among the few recent studies addressing microplastic sinking processes khatmullina and isachenko 2017 systematically investigated the settling velocities of single particles ranging from 0 5 to 5 mm and kaiser et al 2017 focused on the effects of biofilms on polyethylene and polystyrenes however they did not consider the role of water turbulence that may facilitate microplastic coagulation fragmentation and settling as aggregates later nguyen et al 2020 found that the colonization of biofilms leads to a decrease in the settling velocity for microplastic particles denser than water e g polyurethane since the attachments of biofilms have reduced the density of microplastic flocs moreover van melkebeke et al 2020 estimated the biofilm thickness required for the settling of floating microplastics they found that the biofilm thickness grows with size linearly for spherical microplastics and logarithmically for thin film microplastics recently liu et al 2022 found that smaller buoyant microplastic particles start to settle faster than larger particles under the action of biofouling however none of the above experiments consider both organic matter om and turbulent shear rate as controlling parameters the measurement of floc or microplastic properties is vital to the success of the data and findings after early stages of installing an optical device on the settling tube to measure the settling velocity without knowing floc size kineke et al 1989 spinrad et al 1989 camera or video systems have become one of the most widely used approaches to observe suspended flocs for example fennessy et al 1994 used in situ settling velocity inssev to operate flocs passing through a deceleration chamber and finally entering a settling cylinder for image shooting the size shape and settling velocity of flocs can be directly achieved to indirectly find other floc properties such as excess density and fractal dimension despite the different particle resolutions of the camera system similar instruments were applied in situ by sternberg et al 1999 and manning and dyer 2002 to study the suspended aggregates in the northern california continental shelf and tamar estuary respectively manning and dyer 1999 used a camera system similar to inssev in the laboratory to take videos through the outer wall of the annular flume however in their experiment curvature correction was the major challenge for image postprocessing thus gratiot and manning 2004 chose to use a syringe or a pipette to extract flocs based on which manning et al 2007 developed the labsfloc system later mietta et al 2009b used a similar instrument with a modified floc extraction pipette to observe flocs although they claim that rapid and careful sampling may minimize any flocculation within the syringe pipette the ambient shear around the original floc is still significantly increased during sampling which may result in floc fragmentation due to large shear to permit turbulence within the settling column smith and friedrichs 2011 developed a rotated column in their particle imaging camera system pics to collect flocs this system is more trustworthy in situ for flocs larger than 30 μm fall et al 2021 and can be combined with the laser in situ scattering and transmissometry lisst instrument to identify smaller flocs one weakness of pics is the tedious and labor intensive manual tracking method therefore smith and friedrichs 2015 proposed an automatic particle tracking velocimetry ptv particle image velocimetry piv approach to separately monitor the velocities of solid and liquid sections in two phase turbulent flows for large and small particles nevertheless this system is expensive and is still limited by hydrodynamic biases when trapping sediment in a column simoncelli et al 2019 thus a relatively inexpensive device developed by strom and keyvani 2016 later integrated as the flocarazi system osborn et al 2021 is used to detect aggregates in the mixing chamber out of the flat and transparent wall their device is similar to that used in this study nevertheless note that although the flocs are more illuminated with an led strobe inside the chamber the flow may be significantly disturbed by the strobe and thus this design should be used with care the properties of polystyrene microplastics as substitutes for suspended cohesive sediments in laboratory experiments to eliminate sediment deposition have already been investigated in the past for example mietta et al 2009a used polystyrene as a substitute for kaolinite to study the effect of sedimentation on the floc size distribution fsd nevertheless there is still a gap in studies on the mechanisms of microplastics in turbulent environments where oms are also abundant thus this study aims to explore how the different types of oms affect the aggregation and settling of biofouled microplastic flocs the specific research questions examined are as follows 1 does the addition of om promote or reduce the flocculation of biofouled microplastics 2 how does turbulent shear affect the particle size volume of microplastic aggregates with om added and 3 how do different types of oms as proxies for different extracellular polymeric substances epss in natural environments affect the growth of microplastics to answer these questions four different oms i e chitosan guar gum humic acid and xanthan gum were after incubated with the biofilms next the mechanisms that led to the observed floc size volume distributions under different turbulence intensities and om dosages were analyzed finally the two class quadrature method of moments is used to track the fsds of the small and large microplastic size groups under the framework of population balance modeling 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the water samples were collected from the stone city park section 23 3 13 n 118 44 44 e of the qinhuai river nanjing china it is a typical urban river surrounded by densely populated areas with severe environmental stress caused by urban industrial and agricultural activities the water samples from the qinhuai river have rich bacterial diversity and complex bacterial community structure cai et al 2016 which provide good conditions for the rapid incubation of biofilms for experimentation in this experiment low density polyethylene pe particles 962 kg m3 which are often commonly observed and widely spread in natural waters auta et al 2017 xu et al 2018 peng et al 2020 were used as representative microplastics as a preliminary study microspheres with an average particle size of 75 0 μm were used in this experiment the concentration of pe microspheres used for mechanistic research in the experiment was 50 mg l note that the concentration of microplastics can also be expressed as particles per volume i e the number concentration nevertheless describing microplastics in mass may be more important e g to estimate the microplastic fluxes from land to sea bai et al 2022 the mass concentration in the experiment corresponds to approximately 104 microplastic particles per liter which is on the same order of magnitude as in the experiment by andersen et al 2021 although this concentration is higher than that in nature it could provide preliminary results for accelerated aggregation and fragmentation processes under turbulences and oms different anionic neutral and cationic oms purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd were selected to explore their roles in pe aggregation cationic chitosan cas 9012 76 4 is the support material for shrimp crab shells and other crustaceans or insects kumar 2000 and is obtained from the deacetylation process of chitin as shown in fig 1 a it consists of β 1 4 linked d glucosamine without side chains its positive charge comes from the hydrolysis of amino groups in water with a molecular weight of 1 3 105 da tan et al 2014 chitosan is soluble in solutions with ph values lower than 6 5 and is a positively charged bioadhesive it can bind particles and induce flocculation and aggregation of clay particles kang et al 2019 neutral guar gum cas 9000 30 0 is a water soluble polysaccharide extracted from guar bean risica et al 2005 nugent et al 2009 with a molecular weight as high as 2 106 da as shown in fig 1 b guar gum is a kind of nonionic polysaccharide in terms of molecular structure there are no nonpolar groups on the straight chain of guar gum most of the primary hydroxyl groups and secondary hydroxyl groups are on the outside and the lactose branches do not cover activity it is usually represented as an eps analog of a neutral microbial exopolymer tan et al 2014 anionic humic acid cas 68131 04 4 is a humus substance that can be detected in most environmental media such as water soil and sediment humic acid is the remnant of animals and plants mainly the remnant of plants a type of om that has undergone decomposition and transformation by microorganisms as well as a series of chemical processes and accumulation it is a macromolecular organic acid composed of aromatics and various functional groups see fig 1 c anionic xanthan gum cas 11138 66 2 is a water soluble bacterial extracellular polysaccharide produced by the fermentation of xanthomonas brassicas tan et al 2014 as shown in fig 1 d xanthan gum has the general performance of long chain high molecules but it contains more functional groups than general polymers and it displays unique performance under specific conditions it is a hydrophilic biopolymer that is often used as a substitute for microbial extracellular polymers in laboratory experiments furukawa et al 2014 the molecular weight of xanthan gum is usually in the range of 0 9 1 6 106 da as a result of different bacterial strains and growth environments which cause the molecular weight to oscillate sutherland 1994 the above four kinds of oms are selected as representatives of oms in aquatic environments and are widely used as flocculants tan et al 2014 furukawa et al 2014 zeichner et al 2021 to explore the effects of particle flocculation it is important to note that the concentration of natural oms cb in the surface water is generally between 0 1 mg l and 20 mg l rodrigues et al 2009 thus cb is fixed at 5 mg l in this study and the same was used by furukawa et al 2014 the biofilms were incubated using water samples collected in natural environments the samples were first filtered through a 20 μm nylon net merck millipore ltd to remove large impurities each organic powder of 10 mg was dissolved in 100 ml of ultrapure water and used within 48 h we noticed that sometimes the powder was difficult to dissolve and floated on the water surface during configuration if that happened a yps17b hb ultrasonicator hangzhou success ultrasonic equipment co ltd was employed to accelerate the dissolution of oms the ultrasonicator was only used during the preparation of om solution but not in the subsequent flocculation experiments the composition of the nutrient solution for culturing biofilm was set similar to that proposed by fang et al 2012 but with modified concentrations by trial and error the concentration of each component was set to four times higher than that proposed by fang et al 2012 as shown in table 1 a mixture of an 850 ml filtered water sample 50 ml om solution and 100 ml nutrient solution was prepared in a 1 l beaker then 50 mg of commercially available microplastic was added to the beaker the samples were cultivated for 7 days in an air conditioned room with indoor lighting and a controlled temperature of 25 c it should be noted that the om solution was added at the beginning of biofilm incubation which may affect the incubation speed of the biofilm some bacteria may produce enzymes to breakdown polymeric om during the incubation time during this period 100 ml of the culture solution was replaced with 100 ml of nutrient solution every day that is 100 ml of culture solution was carefully aspirated with a syringe from 1 cm below the liquid surface and replaced by another 100 ml of prepared nutrient solution after that a magnetic stirrer was adopted to agitate the solution for 5 min at a speed of 800 rpm this choice also had the benefits of avoiding the formation of unrealistically large sheets of biofilms from the comparison of the beginning and end of the incubation in fig 2 it can be seen that almost all the plastic microspheres settled at this time the conditions required for the experiment were reached after seven days of incubation all the experiments including the experiment without the addition of om underwent the same incubation time and conditions 2 2 experiments the cubic mixing chamber used in the experiments was the same as that shown in shen and maa 2016 with the tank averaged shear rate g already studied by others e g ducoste and clark 1998 1 g ρ n 3 d 5 n p μ v m where ρ is the density of water n is the rotational speed of the propeller d is the diameter of the impeller μ is the dynamic viscosity of water vm is the volume of solution and np is the fixed parameter of the impeller with a value of 0 3 nagata 1975 spicer et al 1996 in this study the 4ik25rgnc motor was used to control the shaft speed i e 33 52 68 and 83 rpm by changing the operating voltage i e 8 14 20 and 26 v thus providing shear rates of g 20 40 60 and 80 s 1 respectively before each experiment the preincubated microplastics were gently injected into the chamber and stirred with the highest shear rate i e 293 s 1 first to destroy the flocs as much as possible after 10 mins the voltage was changed to yield the required shear the system often reached quasi equilibrium after 11 h of stirring i e particles are generally in suspension and their floc volume concentration is stable at t 11 11 5 and 12 h the motor was stopped for 5 mins to record videos due to the inertia of water turbulent shear still exists when the motor stops and it decays gradually the flocs are still moving at high speed in the first minute after the motor stops while the characteristic floc sizes in the second to third minutes of the video differ very little from those of the fourth to fifth minutes zhu et al 2022 therefore although a small amount of deposition was observed at the bottom of the chamber during this period it had little effect on the observed fsds this is consistent with tran et al 2018 who also proposed a weak correlation of suspended particle concentrations with their characteristic floc sizes an hy 5099 camera shenzhen hayear electronics co ltd equipped with an ha 10a06 lens was used to take pictures at the tank side with an image resolution of 2 54 μm per pixel differing from shen and maa 2016 additional led lights were placed on the top of the chamber to illuminate the particles leading to a light intensity on the water surface of approximately 6000 lux measured with a ta8133 digital light meter suzhou tasi electronics co ltd after that the equilibrium fsd was determined by averaging the three fsds i e t 11 11 5 and 12 h a total of 100 frames were randomly selected in each video to analyze the fsds since using more frames had little effect on the fsd analysis the volume of the floc was calculated using the particle size obtained in the images each frame was extracted as an image for postprocessing with grayscale conversion background removal contrast stretching binarization noise removal dilation and erosion edge particle removal hole filling and pixel gradient inspection different from that illustrated in shen and maa 2016 the facula in the picture due to lighting was removed with a critical gray value the gradient of pixel intensities for each floc was used to judge whether a floc was in or out of focus as an example for the raw image taken under the led light fig 3 a particle no 1 is removed since it is on the boundary of the image window particle nos 2 7 are discarded as misty and distorted out of focus particles fig 3b providing the threshold for pixel gradient checking adjusted to 0 5 hence the processed fig 3c is used for analyzing the floc size and number the settling flux fs is often described as the product of the settling velocity ws and the particle volume or mass concentration since microplastic samples exhibit multiclass features the settling flux of microplastics in this study is then expressed as the volume weighted ws lee et al 2012 2 f s v i w s i v i 1 18 ρ f ρ w g μ d p 3 n f d i n f 1 1 0 15 r e i 0 687 where v 1 is the volume concentration of a subpopulation i and ws i is the settling velocity of each subpopulation i which is expressed by winterwerp s 1998 formula the number of subordinate microplastic class i is determined by measurements or simulation methods in this study we used 30 bins i 30 to represent the fsds in the experiments but only two classes i 2 for small and large microplastics were addressed in the modeling work section 2 4 in eq 2 ρw is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration μ is the dynamic viscosity re is the particle reynolds number dp is the size of primary microplastics which is estimated by the smallest microplastic detected in our camera system following that given by maggi et al 2007 and nf is the fractal dimension nguyen et al 2020 it is important to note that ρf is the density of microplastic flocs taking into account the formation of biofilm after adding oms here a value of 1250 kg m3 is used as suggested by webster et al 1988 1999 2 3 numerical model descriptions the volume based population balance model pbm was used to monitor the change in number density for flocs with volume v at any time t which can be expressed as marchisio et al 2003 3 n v t t 1 2 0 v β v ε ε α v ε ε n v ε t n ε t d ε n v t 0 β v ε α v ε n ε t d ε 0 a ε b v ε n ε t d ε a v n v t where n v t is the number density of microplastics in terms of particle volume v and ε is the integral variable with the same dimension as v thus the particle size can be expressed as d v 1 3 the flocculation kinetics are determined by 1 β v ε the collision frequency function describing the frequency at which two spheres of volume v and ε collide to form a particle of volume v ε 2 α v ε the collision efficiency of two spheres of volume v and ε 3 a v the breakup frequency of particles with volume v and 4 b v ε the fragmentation distribution function describing the fragmentation of a parent particle with volume ε creating daughter particles with volume v for aggregation processes the collision frequency β of particles with volumes vi and vj in shear dominated environments can be expressed by smoluchowski 1918 jiang and logan 1991 lee et al 2000 4 β v i v j g 6 v i 1 3 v j 1 3 3 in which g is the shear rate the collision efficiency α is often used as a calibration parameter e g mietta et al 2008 shen and maa 2015 verney et al 2011 to account for unknown biochemical or interparticle influences for deflocculation processes the breakup frequency function a can be described by winterwerp 1998 5 a v i c 2 μ f y 1 2 g 3 2 v i 1 3 v i 1 3 d p 1 3 n f in which c 2 is the breakage fitting parameter and nf is the fractal dimension the yield strength fy is empirically determined and usually set as 1 0 10 10 n as a first step estimation winterwerp 2002 maggi et al 2007 verney et al 2011 it is further hypothesized that a parent floc is partially deflocculated into primary particles and the rest decomposed evenly into several smaller flocs which can be expressed by zhang et al 2019 6 b v ε f ε d p 3 v d p 3 m v ε 1 f m which describes that when a parent particle with volume ε is destroyed it will result in a mass fraction f of primary particles and the rest break into number of m daughter particles other expressions of the fragmentation distribution functions can also be found in mcgraw 1997 marchisio et al 2003 and shen and maa 2015 the two class volume based quadrature method of moments is used to describe the characteristic volumes v 1 v 2 and corresponding weights w 1 w 2 of small and large microplastics respectively the fractional moment transform barrett and webb 1998 su et al 2007 closed by gaussian approximation barrett and webb 1998 mcgraw 1997 is hereby applied m k 3 q 0 v k 3 q n v t d v i 1 2 v i k 3 q ω i 7 k 0 q 2 q 3 q in which mk is the kth moment of the volume based number density function n v t and q is the adjustable factor a value of q 1 3 is selected to enable the tracking of m 1 to maintain volume conservation shen and maa 2015 it is critical to note that the 0th 1 3 th 2 3 th and 1st moments of volume based n v t are equivalent to the 0th 1st 2nd and 3rd moments of the length based number density function n l t as shown in marchisio et al 2003 kariwala et al 2012 and shen et al 2021 applying eq 7 to eq 3 the simplified moment transport equation becomes m k 3 q t 1 2 i 1 2 ω i j 1 2 β v i v j ω j v i v j k 3 q i

q b v ε d v f d p k 3 v i v i 1 f k 3 m 1 k to solve eq 8 the fractional moments mk at t 0 are first obtained by the initial particle volume concentration with the characteristic volume and weights vi wi i 1 2 extracted from the moments using wheeler s 1974 algorithm at this time the righthand side of eq 8 becomes a constant such that mk can be updated to solve this two class model for the next time step note that although the reverse process to find vi and wi from their finite moments is an ill conditioned mathematical problem using only two classes i e i 2 for their lower order moments is usually numerically robust efficient and physically meaningful in our applications 3 results 3 1 effects of oms on microplastic growth the characteristic sizes i e mean and median of microplastic flocs increase with the addition of oms indicating that the om species determined the flocculation rates for instance when the turbulent shear rate was g 20 s 1 the median size d 50 of microplastic flocs was 125 3 μm without any oms fig 4 a humic acid and xanthan gum have marginal effects on the flocculation of microplastic aggregates with an increase in the d 50 of only 10 4 and 8 0 respectively this result is slightly different from that given by zhang et al 2013 and furukawa et al 2012 2014 who have shown negligible effects for enhancing flocculation in their anionic om experiments this may be because their conclusions drawn from conventional experiments correspond to static flows rather than turbulent flows and the incubation of biofilms was not performed in their study chitosan and guar gum on the other hand significantly promote microplastic flocculation to form larger aggregates the d 50 with guar gum or chitosan added reached 177 0 μm and 164 4 μm after t 11 h corresponding to 41 6 and 31 2 increases respectively in comparison with the pure microplastic condition note that previous studies that explore the effects of guar gum on sediment aggregation also result in similar conclusions for example zhang et al 2013 experimentally illustrated the significant promoting effect of neutral guar gum on flocculation for cohesive sediments kang et al 2019 used chitosan as a flocculant for kaolinite showing strong effects to facilitate particle flocculation and thus accelerate their settling speeds in short the flocculation capability of biofilm coated microplastics under g 20 s 1 for different oms is guar gum chitosan humic acid xanthan gum under a higher shear rate g 40 s 1 the d 50 of pure suspended microplastics decreases to 110 6 μm due to additional fragile flocs tearing up due to higher energy in the flow in addition the resulting floc sizes after t 11 h show varying properties for different oms fig 4 b with guar gum or chitosan added the equilibrium d 50 values were 141 5 and 152 0 μm respectively corresponding to increases of 28 2 and 38 2 compared to the case without om addition this result shows that even under highly turbulent conditions the above two oms still have the ability to significantly promote flocculation the same conclusion was also obtained from shen and maa 2016 in the flocculation experiment of kaolinite microparticles on the other hand with humic acid or xanthan gum added the d 50 after t 11 h is in accordance with an additional 75 5 or 77 3 growth in comparison with previous turbulent environments i e g 20 s 1 these two substances are more efficient flocculation agents at high shear than at low shear for example the xanthan gum leads to an increase of 77 3 for the d 50 under g 40 s 1 compared with an increase of 8 0 under g 20 s 1 the possible reason is that the anionic humic acid or xanthan gum may enhance the stability of the flocs kretzschmar et al 1998 tolhurst et al 2002 resulting in the formation of a tighter and more stable structure that causes the flocs to be less likely to break up under increased turbulent shear rates thus under a high shear rate the influences of the above polymers to accelerate microplastic coagulation are xanthan gum humic acid chitosan guar gum it is important to note that the above results are based on the analysis of the median size of microplastic suspensions in quasi equilibrium using the mean size in general results in the same conclusion except for xanthan gum under a shear rate of g 20 s 1 the mean size of xanthan gum is 26 8 larger than the case without om addition i e 153 5 μm close to the case with guar gum added 36 6 increase thus xanthan gum may also be considered a relatively strong flocculant under g 20 s 1 the large differences in the mean and median sizes in equilibrium xanthan gum i e 135 and 194 2 μm respectively also indicate the possibility of creating a few large megaflocs in this circumstance 3 2 effects of the same om under different shear it is also interesting to see the effects of the same om under different shear rates g there could be an optimal threshold shear rate g beyond which the mean size will decrease due to breakage by large shear and below which the mean size could increase as g increases due to more frequent collisions in this study guar gum is chosen to examine the effect of shear this is because guar gum is reported to show more evident effects than other organic substances tan et al 2014 furukawa et al 2014 shen and maa 2016 thus as a preliminary study it was also selected to explore the effect of turbulent shear on the flocculation of pe the turbulence may cause the particles to collide and aggregate into larger flocs whereas the shear rate generated by the turbulence may also break the particles hunt 1980 as shown in fig 5 with an increase in shear from g 20 s 1 to g 80 s 1 both the median and mean floc sizes show a decreasing trend the median and mean sizes are 177 0 μm and 209 7 μm when the turbulent shear rate is g 20 s 1 and decrease to 92 9 μm and 103 0 μm until g reaches 80 s 1 the optimal shear rate g is not fixed often in the range of 20 30 s 1 for cohesive sediments zhang et al 2013 depending on the residence time and flocculation behavior mietta et al 2009b however in this experiment for microplastics with guar gum added the existence of g is not observed the minimum of g 20 s 1 in this study is selected to prevent significant particle settling which otherwise may lead to biased conclusions instead of a reliable g d relationship for microplastic flocculation nevertheless it would be interesting to use xanthan gum and possibly other om to test their aggregation behaviors in the future as the strength may increase with an increase in shear from g 20 s 1 to g 40 s 1 fig 4 this may indicate that xanthan gum could have this threshold value of g since the bonds formed between microplastics are stronger than that with guar gum this part can be improved in future studies 3 3 effect of oms on microplastic subpopulations during the incubation process the sizes of the microplastic flocs increase at first and are mostly shown as unimodal floc volume distributions fvds with additional om added large and fluffy flocs are produced lee et al 2017 and the distributions gradually change from unimodal to bimodal one possible reason is that these biocoated flocs are fragile so that the biological bridges between bioplastic particles are weak therefore more fragments are possibly created under turbulent shear shown as the small peak of the fvds due to floc breakage under abundant microbial activities and strong turbulence nguyen et al 2020 in this study the fvds were decomposed into two subordinate log normal distributions for small and large microplastics under a shear rate of g 20 s 1 without the addition of om fig 6 the sizes of small and large microplastics are 61 1 μm v 2 3 10 4 mm3 and 141 5 μm v 2 8 10 3 mm3 with volume concentrations of 0 3 μl l and 0 6 μl l respectively with different oms added the sizes of small microplastics l 1 are similar with a maximum difference of 13 9 note that the microplastic particles used in this study are polyethylene particles with nominal sizes of approximately75 0 μm nevertheless the l 1 values smaller than 75 0 μm were still possible as fragments formed under turbulent disruption the smallest pieces found in the experiment were approximately 40 μm the volume concentrations of small microplastics v 1 range from 0 2 to 0 6 μl l on the other hand the large microplastics vary significantly under different flocculant dosages the sizes of large microplastics l 2 show an increase of 102 4 44 2 23 7 and 61 4 for adding chitosan guar gum humic acid and xanthan gum respectively the volume concentrations for large floc groups v 2 are in the range of 0 3 0 6 μl l with the maximum value corresponding to the chitosan case the possible reason for the abundance of large microplastics with chitosan is that it has a strong promoting effect on flocculation when the turbulent shear rate is 20 s 1 neutral organic guar gum also shows a promotion effect on flocculation with v 2 significantly higher than that without om moreover as shown in fig 6 c and d the fvds under the influences of two negatively charged oms humic acid and xanthan gum show a more evident bimodal feature under shear rate of g 40 s 1 fig 7 with no oms added the characteristic sizes of subordinate microplastic groups are 56 0 μm v 1 7 10 4 mm3 and 127 9 μm v 2 1 10 3 mm3 providing only 8 4 and 9 6 decreases compared with l 1 and l 2 under g 20 s 1 in addition with a ratio of 0 3 for volume concentrations v 1 v 2 under g 40 s 1 against v 1 v 2 0 4 under g 20 s 1 the two pvds show similar features although the median size is reduced from 125 3 μm to 110 6 μm due to intensive breakage under high turbulence with oms included the size of the small microplastic group l 1 is generally close to that of the pure microplastic case one exception is that the l 1 with xanthan gum is much larger 82 5 μm the corresponding v 1 is also different as high as 0 6 μl l for xanthan gum and 0 3 0 5 μl l for guar gum and chitosan but as low as 0 2 μl l for humic acid in particular for xanthan gum more flocs with smaller particle sizes clearly show an approximately transparent solution in the experiment which can be explained by an evidently strong fragmentation by turbulent mixing furthermore the second peak l 2 is 233 5 μm 1 27 10 2 mm3 170 5 μm 5 0 10 3 mm3 205 2 μm 8 6 10 3 mm3 and 238 1 μm 1 4 10 2 mm3 as a result of additions of chitosan guar gum humic acid and xanthan gum respectively with an increase of 33 3 86 2 compared with the l 2 for pure microplastics the concentration of the second group v 2 with humic acid is dominant 1 0 μl l compared with a maximum value of 0 8 μl l for other oms it is crucial to note that the case with xanthan gum addition showed a similar feature this may be because the flocs have more stable structures generated by anionic flocculants in the water which contain a large amount of cations e g ca2 ma2 etc kretzschmar et al 1998 tolhurst et al 2002 chen and elimelech 2007 and thus are not easily broken under high shear conditions 3 4 model parameterization the quadrature based two class population balance model is used to track the evolution of the characteristic sizes and weights of two microplastic classes the initial particle size of the flocs is approximately40 μm and the aggregation and breakage parameters c1 and c 2 are the fitting parameters table 3 in general the simulated and measured fsds are compared reasonably well fig 8 under g 20 s 1 with null oms the simulated l 1 and l 2 are 48 5 μm and 152 3 μm with weights i e volume fractions of 28 5 and 71 5 respectively for small microplastics adding oms did not significantly change l 1 46 4 47 0 μm except for guar gum 84 9 μm while the weights w 1 apparently increased with chitosan or xanthan gum added 42 2 45 6 in contrast for large microplastics l 2 significantly increased to 293 1 μm 219 5 μm 274 1 μm and 186 5 μm for chitosan humic acid xanthan gum and guar gum respectively the weights w 2 of large microplastics increased only slightly after the addition of guar gum while with other om they decreased with the greatest decrease in xanthan gum and chitosan 54 4 57 8 under g 40 s 1 the corresponding weights of l 1 49 7 μm and l 2 131 8 μm in the absence of oms are 31 4 and 68 6 respectively after adding different oms l 1 l 2 w 1 and w 2 all showed the same trend as when the turbulent shear rate was 20 s 1 notice that the deviation of the simulated and observed results for humic acid is relatively large compared with the other cases this may be because the water samples with humic acid and other om were not collected at the same time it is worth noting that different fragmentation distribution functions must be used see also zhang et al 2019 to better account for the comprehensive breakage processes with oms included shen and maa 2016 in experiments with no om added when the larger floc is broken it may generate two smaller flocs i e m 2 to account for 92 of the original mass i e f 0 08 and the rest are elementary particles in this study it is similar to the parameters taken by the model of lee et al 2011 f 0 1 m 2 when chitosan was added 4 8 of the parent flocs decomposed into original particles i e f 0 048 and the rest of the parent particles remained i e m 1 with xanthan gum added the disintegration of a parent floc may result in 13 of the flocs breaking down into elementary particles i e f 0 13 while the remaining parent particles disintegrate into two smaller flocs i e m 2 for guar gum and humic acid no particles were broken into their constituent particles i e f 0 and all parent flocs decomposed into 1 3 and 1 79 smaller flocs i e m 1 3 1 79 respectively in both cases the reason that m is not an integer is that it is a statistic for example after some collisions between two flocs there are finally three flocs at this time m 1 5 in addition the model parameters of the same om under the two turbulent shears are identical this part can be enhanced by summarizing a process based on m and f for the breakage distribution functions selected under different biophysical environments while the measured settling flux is computed by the observed 30 bin fsds the simulations are based on li and wi i 1 2 from the two class pbe which accounts for the characteristic sizes and volume fractions of two subordinate microplastic groups the results show that the errors between the two class model and measurements are reasonable 0 4 7 8 see also table 2 which is comparable with a value of 9 5 reported by lee et al 2012 for cohesive sediments the largest error i e 7 8 is for the xanthan gum case under shear rate of g 20 s 1 which may be caused by the deposition of some large flocs at the bottom of the stirring chamber however when reducing the floc groups the errors between the one class model and the measured value are as high as 16 4 53 8 adding additional floc groups is supposed to be helpful to further reduce the errors but it also increases the computational costs and the possibility of numerical instability for quadrature based pbe and thus may not be necessary at this time 4 discussion 4 1 experimental uncertainty in this study the biofilms were cultured in microplastic suspensions for 7 days at room temperature 25 c controlled by an airconditioner and with natural light with day night cycles the nutrient solution was recirculated every 24 h since the density of pe microspheres is lower than water the particles were floating on the water surface at first as the biofilms gradually colonized a small amount of flocculent eps appeared around the microplastics on the second day and pe microspheres began to leave the water surface and were suspended in the water column during the third to fifth days the biofilms around the particles continued to increase with additional microspheres in suspension after 4 days particles still floating were rare and a few particles entrained by biofilms were deposited on the bottom by days 6 and 7 most of the microplastics covered with biofilms settled out of the water surface and deposited on the bottom as flocs note that the incubated particles with the addition of oms settled faster than the pure microplastic suspension but the difference in settling time with different oms was small here cases with and without guar gum after 7 days of incubation were taken as comparative examples without any om biofilm layers wrapped on the surface of the microplastic particles fig 9 a the shape of the originally nearly spherical plastic microspheres changed after biofilm attachment causing microplastic particles to agglomerate to form large flocs the flocs marked in fig 9 a are concentrated by the aggregation of multiple microplastics with their surface wrapped with biofilms a small number of filamentous biofilms was also connected between flocs which appeared firmer if the culture was continued under the experimental conditions nevertheless under the influence of guar gum the adhesion of biofilms on the particle surface seemed significantly improved the large microplastic flocs formed by the aggregation of multiple constituent particles were completely enclosed by the biofilms resulting in relatively compact and rigid flocs biofilms also developed connecting different flocs forming a network structure between flocs overall under the action of guar gum the biofilm in fig 9 b grew to a mature state and the structure of the floc reached a stable state fig 9 also revealed that an appropriate concentration of guar gum could significantly promote the flocculation of microplastics it should be mentioned that a magnetic stirrer was used daily to generate turbulence during the cultivation of the biofilm in the preliminary experiments we applied bubble aeration to make the water turbulent in the beaker the turbulence provided by this method was closer to the turbulence of the natural water environment when compared with that from using a magnetic stirrer and also significantly promoted the flocculation of microplastic particles however the bubble machine sent air to the bottom of the beaker and greatly increased the oxygen in the water sample presumably because of the increased microbial activity under these conditions many longer flocs were produced these flocs with large aspect ratios were surrounded by a large number of microplastic particles possibly occurring in static and nutrient rich water bodies in our later experiments we used a magnetic stirrer to generate turbulence when incubating the biofilm 4 2 microbial derived eps the observations for different oms are also affected by the eps and microbial cells created during the incubation note that the microplastic spheres were incubated for seven days with a relatively rich nutrient solution in river water and thus substantial microbial activity was expected the average particle size of the microplastics was initially 75 0 μm after incubation the median size without adding oms was approximately 125 155 μm fig 4 this means that the eps and microbial cells necromass created during the incubation also promoted flocculation since the same nutrient solution was used in all the experiments it is still possible to find the additional influences of different oms by comparing individual cases to the reference on the other hand the different observations compared to previous literature are likely because the effect observed in this study is not the sole effect from added om but rather is confounded by the naturally occurring eps and microbial dead cells due to enhanced microbial activity in the incubation in this study the effect of naturally occurring eps is not separated from that solely contributed by the added om rather they are the combined effects between added om and microbial derived om it is still meaningful to see the effects of different oms added to microbial derived om which could provide indications of which type of om could enhance or hinder microplastic growth however the results should be interpreted with caution since it is a mixture of om in natural water bodies it is more likely that om is a mixture of organic substances with different charges the overall effect is critical for transport modeling since typically the total organic content of the water samples rather than their composition or charges is measured in addition it may be more realistic if we test om naturally occurring in rivers to investigate the overall effect and interactions between om with different charges nevertheless it is also possible that the composition of the om is location specific meaning that it could change case by case depending on the study site adding controlled om could provide more insights into how different kinds of om could potentially influence microplastic biofilm formation hence in this study natural water is only used to incubate biofilms for microplastics we added additional om proxies in our experiments to address the effect of one major om for each condition an advanced model with connected effects may only be thoroughly parameterized after the effect of each om is better examined 4 3 implications 1 internal properties how to describe a microplastic microplastics like other particles have multiple internal properties such as their size shape color and composition the size is often the primary parameter used to identify different microplastic particles yang et al 2021 here we wanted to focus on the effect of oms on the growth of microplastics to avoid complexity spherical particles were used to focus on particle size the microplastics found in natural waters are not perfectly spherical they may also be in the forms of fibers fragments and films this indicates that shape may be another important property of microplastics nguyen et al 2020 thus the effects of shape should be investigated both in experiments and in numerical models in future studies to extend the results and conclusions in this study to naturally occurring microplastics that are not spherical 2 bedform developments what is the role of cohesion the role of cohesion in purely cohesive and naturally mixed sediment bedforms is interesting since this study also involves sedimentary organic and biofilm levels the bedforms can be influenced by both physical and biological cohesion parsons et al 2016 on the one hand the percentage of clay content will reduce the height length and steepness of the bed which is referred to as the effect of physical cohesion schindler et al 2015 the cohesive strength of the bed limits the ability of the water flow to erode the sediment thus limiting the height to which the bed can eventually grow parsons et al 2016 on the other hand the biofilm incubated by microorganisms shown as the effect of biological cohesion is more effective in changing the bed dimension and steepness since the cohesion between particles formed by biological activities is usually stronger paterson et al al 1990 paterson and hagerthey 2001 while substratum mud has a significant effect even small additions of eps dominate the combined effect of cohesion and have a dramatic effect on bed size and bed type at the same time bed formation is greatly slowed because bioaggregation inhibits the movement of individual particles malarkey et al 2015 lichtman et al 2018 the natural bedforms predicted based on pure sand experiments are not complete since the bedform dynamics are also controlled by bed composition in terms of different fractions of physically cohesive clays or biologically cohesive eps malarkey et al 2015 the erosion threshold τ cr is the bed shear stress needed to erode the surface of the bed thus clay and eps are often represented as physical and biological stabilizers which increase τ cr the effect of biological cohesion is demonstrated to be stronger than that of physical cohesion for example the eps even of dry weight as low as 0 0125 can influence ripple development malarkey et al 2015 whereas a similar phenomenon is only observed for clay contents larger than 16 baas et al 2013 however conclusions drawn from steady flow may not be true under other environments for instance chen et al 2021 showed that cohesive eps may also be a biodestabilizers under wave actions 3 local study how to extend to a wider context urban rivers play an important role in ecological balance and human life and are part of hydrology and nutrient cycling tiquia 2011 as the main link between terrestrial and aquatic environments they are characterized by low flow rates with minimal hydraulic exchanges resulting in a relatively stable environment xu et al 2011 the findings in the qinhuai river a typical urban river are critically compared with other studies for example kaiser et al 2017 also colonized biofilms on the surface of polyethylene pe after incubation in situ in the baltic sea area of germany the pe pellets began to sink with the occurrence of biofilms but the time for particles beginning to settle was six weeks or even longer after incubation nevertheless in our experiment this time is usually within one week this may be because of a higher microbe richness in urban rivers and the added oms also speed up the formation of biofilms additionally furukawa et al 2014 and tan et al 2014 investigated the effects of different oms on the flocculation of cohesive montmorillonite they found that humic acid and xanthan gum only have limited functions on floc growth in this study however the effects of the above oms on promoting flocculation are evident especially under high turbulent shear the lack of biofilm incubation processes may be responsible for the differences between their experiments and this study it is also crucial to note that the gradient of urban rivers is usually mild which helps to isolate various factors and focuses merely on the temporal variations in biofouled microplastics at the first stage for example fan et al 2022 stated that spatial factors both longitudinal and vertical do not significantly affect microplastic concentrations while more microplastics are found in the wet season than in the dry season in estuarine and coastal waters however the environmental gradients e g by salinity suspended sediment concentrations or water nutrients are strong which dictates more complicated spatiotemporal variations in the distributions of microplastics thus the conclusions drawn from a rapidly urbanizing region in this paper can be treated as a preliminary study with possible extension to better understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of microplastics in high energy coastal waters in the future 5 conclusion this study experimentally investigated the effects of four different oms i e chitosan guar gum humic acid and xanthan gum on the flocculation of biofilm coated microplastics under different turbulent shear conditions in addition a mathematic model that employed the two class quadrature method of moments was used to track the small and large microplastic subgroups under the framework of population balance modeling the following are the concluding remarks 1 all of the oms involved in this study regardless of whether anionic cationic or neutral show positive effects on the growth of biofilms to create biofilm mediated microplastic aggregates chitosan and guar gum have strong promoting effects on the flocculation of microplastic particles the effects of humic acid and xanthan gum become evident when the shear rate increases from 20 s 1 to 40 s 1 in addition no critical turbulent shear rate g is observed in the d g curve for biofilm coated microplastic with guar gum included based on our experiments 2 the observed floc volume distributions can be fairly decomposed into two lognormal distributions to illustrate the characteristic sizes or volumes and volumetric concentrations of small and large microplastics respectively under the same shear the sizes of small microplastics l 1 were similar to each other for all the test cases except for the cases with guar gum addition while other variables l 2 w 1 and w 2 often dynamically changed according to different environments 3 the adhesion of biofilms increases the size and density of microplastics resulting in the microplastic particles becoming heavier than the ambient fluids and thus gradually settling with time during the biofilm incubation process the presence of oms shortened the residence time of biomediated microplastics in comparison with that for null organic conditions 4 the quadrature based population balance model with only two classes provides good predictions of the flocculation and deflocculation processes of microplastics this model is robust efficient and physically meaningful the errors of the settling flux calculated by the two classes are less than 8 compared with the laboratory

15060,biofilm coated microplastics are omnipresent in aquatic environments carrying different organic matter om that in turn influences the flocculation and settling of microplastic aggregates in this study the effects of chitosan guar gum humic acid and xanthan gum on the flocculation of anthropogenic microplastics are examined under controlled shear through the mixing chamber experiments the results show that all of the selected oms have positive effects on biofilm culturing and thus enhance the growth of microplastic flocs with more evident promoting effects for cationic and neutral oms i e chitosan and guar gum than anionic oms i e humic acid and xanthan no critical shear rate is observed in the size vs shear relationship based on our measurements in addition the quadrature based two class population balance model is employed to track the development of bimodal floc size distributions fsds composed of small and large microplastic flocs the model predictions show reasonable agreement with the observed fsds the largest error of settling flux from the two class model is 7 8 in contrast with the reference value measured by the camera based fsds with 30 bins this study highlights the role of different oms on microplastic flocculation and indicates that a two class model may be sufficient to describe microplastic transport processes in estuaries graphical abstract

doi org 10 17632 rfz994zc8j 2 1 introduction in marine environments plastic waste may account for as much as 80 85 of marine debris auta et al 2017 the majority of which are microplastics galgani et al 2013 with diameters less than 5 mm it is an environmental pollutant that has drawn great attention in recent decades thompson et al 2004 but was identified even back to the 1970s carpenter and smith 1972 currently microplastics are almost ubiquitous in aquatic environments such as rivers eerkes medrano et al 2015 estuaries xu et al 2018 coasts barnes et al 2009 oceans cole et al 2011 and even deep seas van cauwenberghe et al 2013 woodall et al 2014 understanding the transport of microplastics is critical to further control these particles and their leaching pollutants in open channel flows buoyant microplastics are present in two ways some floating on the surface cózar et al 2014 and others suspended in the water column kukulka et al 2012 2016 isobe et al 2014 enders et al 2015 this indicates that microplastics not only move horizontally due to hydrodynamic forcing but are also transported vertically due to both downward settling and upward mixing low density microplastics are supposed to float on the surface and hardly appear on the bed however high concentrations of microplastics have been observed in marine sediments worldwide e g galgani et al 2000 thompson et al 2004 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 woodall et al 2014 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 and 2015 for instance the number concentration of microplastics is up to 200 2200 l in the sediment bed of the 10 908 m deep mariana trench peng et al 2018 biological colonization may increase or decrease the density of microplastic flocs waldschläger et al 2022 for example biodeposits from mussels could aggregate with microplastic particles and accelerate their settling piarulli and airoldi 2020 some microplastic flocs eventually settle to the seabed due to biofilm formation macleod et al 2021 and may behave as sediment particles that undergo bedload transport resuspension and deposition zhang 2017 biofilm formation is a complex microbial process microplastic particles during the incubation periods are preferably rapidly colonized by microorganisms on the particle surface thereby forming dynamically varying biofilms this is mainly due to the large specific surface area of microplastic flocs and the abundant functional groups generated by surface weathering zettler et al 2013 lobelle and cunliffe 2011 thus microplastics interact closely with biofilms on their surfaces providing voids for the survival of microorganisms and acting as carriers for them to facilitate their migration tu et al 2020b as the structures of biofilms are not stationary the physiochemical properties of microplastics such as density chemical functional groups and roughness are also changing which in turn affect the migration and transport of microplastics tu et al 2020a oberbeckmann and labrenz 2020 rummel et al 2017 among the few recent studies addressing microplastic sinking processes khatmullina and isachenko 2017 systematically investigated the settling velocities of single particles ranging from 0 5 to 5 mm and kaiser et al 2017 focused on the effects of biofilms on polyethylene and polystyrenes however they did not consider the role of water turbulence that may facilitate microplastic coagulation fragmentation and settling as aggregates later nguyen et al 2020 found that the colonization of biofilms leads to a decrease in the settling velocity for microplastic particles denser than water e g polyurethane since the attachments of biofilms have reduced the density of microplastic flocs moreover van melkebeke et al 2020 estimated the biofilm thickness required for the settling of floating microplastics they found that the biofilm thickness grows with size linearly for spherical microplastics and logarithmically for thin film microplastics recently liu et al 2022 found that smaller buoyant microplastic particles start to settle faster than larger particles under the action of biofouling however none of the above experiments consider both organic matter om and turbulent shear rate as controlling parameters the measurement of floc or microplastic properties is vital to the success of the data and findings after early stages of installing an optical device on the settling tube to measure the settling velocity without knowing floc size kineke et al 1989 spinrad et al 1989 camera or video systems have become one of the most widely used approaches to observe suspended flocs for example fennessy et al 1994 used in situ settling velocity inssev to operate flocs passing through a deceleration chamber and finally entering a settling cylinder for image shooting the size shape and settling velocity of flocs can be directly achieved to indirectly find other floc properties such as excess density and fractal dimension despite the different particle resolutions of the camera system similar instruments were applied in situ by sternberg et al 1999 and manning and dyer 2002 to study the suspended aggregates in the northern california continental shelf and tamar estuary respectively manning and dyer 1999 used a camera system similar to inssev in the laboratory to take videos through the outer wall of the annular flume however in their experiment curvature correction was the major challenge for image postprocessing thus gratiot and manning 2004 chose to use a syringe or a pipette to extract flocs based on which manning et al 2007 developed the labsfloc system later mietta et al 2009b used a similar instrument with a modified floc extraction pipette to observe flocs although they claim that rapid and careful sampling may minimize any flocculation within the syringe pipette the ambient shear around the original floc is still significantly increased during sampling which may result in floc fragmentation due to large shear to permit turbulence within the settling column smith and friedrichs 2011 developed a rotated column in their particle imaging camera system pics to collect flocs this system is more trustworthy in situ for flocs larger than 30 μm fall et al 2021 and can be combined with the laser in situ scattering and transmissometry lisst instrument to identify smaller flocs one weakness of pics is the tedious and labor intensive manual tracking method therefore smith and friedrichs 2015 proposed an automatic particle tracking velocimetry ptv particle image velocimetry piv approach to separately monitor the velocities of solid and liquid sections in two phase turbulent flows for large and small particles nevertheless this system is expensive and is still limited by hydrodynamic biases when trapping sediment in a column simoncelli et al 2019 thus a relatively inexpensive device developed by strom and keyvani 2016 later integrated as the flocarazi system osborn et al 2021 is used to detect aggregates in the mixing chamber out of the flat and transparent wall their device is similar to that used in this study nevertheless note that although the flocs are more illuminated with an led strobe inside the chamber the flow may be significantly disturbed by the strobe and thus this design should be used with care the properties of polystyrene microplastics as substitutes for suspended cohesive sediments in laboratory experiments to eliminate sediment deposition have already been investigated in the past for example mietta et al 2009a used polystyrene as a substitute for kaolinite to study the effect of sedimentation on the floc size distribution fsd nevertheless there is still a gap in studies on the mechanisms of microplastics in turbulent environments where oms are also abundant thus this study aims to explore how the different types of oms affect the aggregation and settling of biofouled microplastic flocs the specific research questions examined are as follows 1 does the addition of om promote or reduce the flocculation of biofouled microplastics 2 how does turbulent shear affect the particle size volume of microplastic aggregates with om added and 3 how do different types of oms as proxies for different extracellular polymeric substances epss in natural environments affect the growth of microplastics to answer these questions four different oms i e chitosan guar gum humic acid and xanthan gum were after incubated with the biofilms next the mechanisms that led to the observed floc size volume distributions under different turbulence intensities and om dosages were analyzed finally the two class quadrature method of moments is used to track the fsds of the small and large microplastic size groups under the framework of population balance modeling 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the water samples were collected from the stone city park section 23 3 13 n 118 44 44 e of the qinhuai river nanjing china it is a typical urban river surrounded by densely populated areas with severe environmental stress caused by urban industrial and agricultural activities the water samples from the qinhuai river have rich bacterial diversity and complex bacterial community structure cai et al 2016 which provide good conditions for the rapid incubation of biofilms for experimentation in this experiment low density polyethylene pe particles 962 kg m3 which are often commonly observed and widely spread in natural waters auta et al 2017 xu et al 2018 peng et al 2020 were used as representative microplastics as a preliminary study microspheres with an average particle size of 75 0 μm were used in this experiment the concentration of pe microspheres used for mechanistic research in the experiment was 50 mg l note that the concentration of microplastics can also be expressed as particles per volume i e the number concentration nevertheless describing microplastics in mass may be more important e g to estimate the microplastic fluxes from land to sea bai et al 2022 the mass concentration in the experiment corresponds to approximately 104 microplastic particles per liter which is on the same order of magnitude as in the experiment by andersen et al 2021 although this concentration is higher than that in nature it could provide preliminary results for accelerated aggregation and fragmentation processes under turbulences and oms different anionic neutral and cationic oms purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd were selected to explore their roles in pe aggregation cationic chitosan cas 9012 76 4 is the support material for shrimp crab shells and other crustaceans or insects kumar 2000 and is obtained from the deacetylation process of chitin as shown in fig 1 a it consists of β 1 4 linked d glucosamine without side chains its positive charge comes from the hydrolysis of amino groups in water with a molecular weight of 1 3 105 da tan et al 2014 chitosan is soluble in solutions with ph values lower than 6 5 and is a positively charged bioadhesive it can bind particles and induce flocculation and aggregation of clay particles kang et al 2019 neutral guar gum cas 9000 30 0 is a water soluble polysaccharide extracted from guar bean risica et al 2005 nugent et al 2009 with a molecular weight as high as 2 106 da as shown in fig 1 b guar gum is a kind of nonionic polysaccharide in terms of molecular structure there are no nonpolar groups on the straight chain of guar gum most of the primary hydroxyl groups and secondary hydroxyl groups are on the outside and the lactose branches do not cover activity it is usually represented as an eps analog of a neutral microbial exopolymer tan et al 2014 anionic humic acid cas 68131 04 4 is a humus substance that can be detected in most environmental media such as water soil and sediment humic acid is the remnant of animals and plants mainly the remnant of plants a type of om that has undergone decomposition and transformation by microorganisms as well as a series of chemical processes and accumulation it is a macromolecular organic acid composed of aromatics and various functional groups see fig 1 c anionic xanthan gum cas 11138 66 2 is a water soluble bacterial extracellular polysaccharide produced by the fermentation of xanthomonas brassicas tan et al 2014 as shown in fig 1 d xanthan gum has the general performance of long chain high molecules but it contains more functional groups than general polymers and it displays unique performance under specific conditions it is a hydrophilic biopolymer that is often used as a substitute for microbial extracellular polymers in laboratory experiments furukawa et al 2014 the molecular weight of xanthan gum is usually in the range of 0 9 1 6 106 da as a result of different bacterial strains and growth environments which cause the molecular weight to oscillate sutherland 1994 the above four kinds of oms are selected as representatives of oms in aquatic environments and are widely used as flocculants tan et al 2014 furukawa et al 2014 zeichner et al 2021 to explore the effects of particle flocculation it is important to note that the concentration of natural oms cb in the surface water is generally between 0 1 mg l and 20 mg l rodrigues et al 2009 thus cb is fixed at 5 mg l in this study and the same was used by furukawa et al 2014 the biofilms were incubated using water samples collected in natural environments the samples were first filtered through a 20 μm nylon net merck millipore ltd to remove large impurities each organic powder of 10 mg was dissolved in 100 ml of ultrapure water and used within 48 h we noticed that sometimes the powder was difficult to dissolve and floated on the water surface during configuration if that happened a yps17b hb ultrasonicator hangzhou success ultrasonic equipment co ltd was employed to accelerate the dissolution of oms the ultrasonicator was only used during the preparation of om solution but not in the subsequent flocculation experiments the composition of the nutrient solution for culturing biofilm was set similar to that proposed by fang et al 2012 but with modified concentrations by trial and error the concentration of each component was set to four times higher than that proposed by fang et al 2012 as shown in table 1 a mixture of an 850 ml filtered water sample 50 ml om solution and 100 ml nutrient solution was prepared in a 1 l beaker then 50 mg of commercially available microplastic was added to the beaker the samples were cultivated for 7 days in an air conditioned room with indoor lighting and a controlled temperature of 25 c it should be noted that the om solution was added at the beginning of biofilm incubation which may affect the incubation speed of the biofilm some bacteria may produce enzymes to breakdown polymeric om during the incubation time during this period 100 ml of the culture solution was replaced with 100 ml of nutrient solution every day that is 100 ml of culture solution was carefully aspirated with a syringe from 1 cm below the liquid surface and replaced by another 100 ml of prepared nutrient solution after that a magnetic stirrer was adopted to agitate the solution for 5 min at a speed of 800 rpm this choice also had the benefits of avoiding the formation of unrealistically large sheets of biofilms from the comparison of the beginning and end of the incubation in fig 2 it can be seen that almost all the plastic microspheres settled at this time the conditions required for the experiment were reached after seven days of incubation all the experiments including the experiment without the addition of om underwent the same incubation time and conditions 2 2 experiments the cubic mixing chamber used in the experiments was the same as that shown in shen and maa 2016 with the tank averaged shear rate g already studied by others e g ducoste and clark 1998 1 g ρ n 3 d 5 n p μ v m where ρ is the density of water n is the rotational speed of the propeller d is the diameter of the impeller μ is the dynamic viscosity of water vm is the volume of solution and np is the fixed parameter of the impeller with a value of 0 3 nagata 1975 spicer et al 1996 in this study the 4ik25rgnc motor was used to control the shaft speed i e 33 52 68 and 83 rpm by changing the operating voltage i e 8 14 20 and 26 v thus providing shear rates of g 20 40 60 and 80 s 1 respectively before each experiment the preincubated microplastics were gently injected into the chamber and stirred with the highest shear rate i e 293 s 1 first to destroy the flocs as much as possible after 10 mins the voltage was changed to yield the required shear the system often reached quasi equilibrium after 11 h of stirring i e particles are generally in suspension and their floc volume concentration is stable at t 11 11 5 and 12 h the motor was stopped for 5 mins to record videos due to the inertia of water turbulent shear still exists when the motor stops and it decays gradually the flocs are still moving at high speed in the first minute after the motor stops while the characteristic floc sizes in the second to third minutes of the video differ very little from those of the fourth to fifth minutes zhu et al 2022 therefore although a small amount of deposition was observed at the bottom of the chamber during this period it had little effect on the observed fsds this is consistent with tran et al 2018 who also proposed a weak correlation of suspended particle concentrations with their characteristic floc sizes an hy 5099 camera shenzhen hayear electronics co ltd equipped with an ha 10a06 lens was used to take pictures at the tank side with an image resolution of 2 54 μm per pixel differing from shen and maa 2016 additional led lights were placed on the top of the chamber to illuminate the particles leading to a light intensity on the water surface of approximately 6000 lux measured with a ta8133 digital light meter suzhou tasi electronics co ltd after that the equilibrium fsd was determined by averaging the three fsds i e t 11 11 5 and 12 h a total of 100 frames were randomly selected in each video to analyze the fsds since using more frames had little effect on the fsd analysis the volume of the floc was calculated using the particle size obtained in the images each frame was extracted as an image for postprocessing with grayscale conversion background removal contrast stretching binarization noise removal dilation and erosion edge particle removal hole filling and pixel gradient inspection different from that illustrated in shen and maa 2016 the facula in the picture due to lighting was removed with a critical gray value the gradient of pixel intensities for each floc was used to judge whether a floc was in or out of focus as an example for the raw image taken under the led light fig 3 a particle no 1 is removed since it is on the boundary of the image window particle nos 2 7 are discarded as misty and distorted out of focus particles fig 3b providing the threshold for pixel gradient checking adjusted to 0 5 hence the processed fig 3c is used for analyzing the floc size and number the settling flux fs is often described as the product of the settling velocity ws and the particle volume or mass concentration since microplastic samples exhibit multiclass features the settling flux of microplastics in this study is then expressed as the volume weighted ws lee et al 2012 2 f s v i w s i v i 1 18 ρ f ρ w g μ d p 3 n f d i n f 1 1 0 15 r e i 0 687 where v 1 is the volume concentration of a subpopulation i and ws i is the settling velocity of each subpopulation i which is expressed by winterwerp s 1998 formula the number of subordinate microplastic class i is determined by measurements or simulation methods in this study we used 30 bins i 30 to represent the fsds in the experiments but only two classes i 2 for small and large microplastics were addressed in the modeling work section 2 4 in eq 2 ρw is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration μ is the dynamic viscosity re is the particle reynolds number dp is the size of primary microplastics which is estimated by the smallest microplastic detected in our camera system following that given by maggi et al 2007 and nf is the fractal dimension nguyen et al 2020 it is important to note that ρf is the density of microplastic flocs taking into account the formation of biofilm after adding oms here a value of 1250 kg m3 is used as suggested by webster et al 1988 1999 2 3 numerical model descriptions the volume based population balance model pbm was used to monitor the change in number density for flocs with volume v at any time t which can be expressed as marchisio et al 2003 3 n v t t 1 2 0 v β v ε ε α v ε ε n v ε t n ε t d ε n v t 0 β v ε α v ε n ε t d ε 0 a ε b v ε n ε t d ε a v n v t where n v t is the number density of microplastics in terms of particle volume v and ε is the integral variable with the same dimension as v thus the particle size can be expressed as d v 1 3 the flocculation kinetics are determined by 1 β v ε the collision frequency function describing the frequency at which two spheres of volume v and ε collide to form a particle of volume v ε 2 α v ε the collision efficiency of two spheres of volume v and ε 3 a v the breakup frequency of particles with volume v and 4 b v ε the fragmentation distribution function describing the fragmentation of a parent particle with volume ε creating daughter particles with volume v for aggregation processes the collision frequency β of particles with volumes vi and vj in shear dominated environments can be expressed by smoluchowski 1918 jiang and logan 1991 lee et al 2000 4 β v i v j g 6 v i 1 3 v j 1 3 3 in which g is the shear rate the collision efficiency α is often used as a calibration parameter e g mietta et al 2008 shen and maa 2015 verney et al 2011 to account for unknown biochemical or interparticle influences for deflocculation processes the breakup frequency function a can be described by winterwerp 1998 5 a v i c 2 μ f y 1 2 g 3 2 v i 1 3 v i 1 3 d p 1 3 n f in which c 2 is the breakage fitting parameter and nf is the fractal dimension the yield strength fy is empirically determined and usually set as 1 0 10 10 n as a first step estimation winterwerp 2002 maggi et al 2007 verney et al 2011 it is further hypothesized that a parent floc is partially deflocculated into primary particles and the rest decomposed evenly into several smaller flocs which can be expressed by zhang et al 2019 6 b v ε f ε d p 3 v d p 3 m v ε 1 f m which describes that when a parent particle with volume ε is destroyed it will result in a mass fraction f of primary particles and the rest break into number of m daughter particles other expressions of the fragmentation distribution functions can also be found in mcgraw 1997 marchisio et al 2003 and shen and maa 2015 the two class volume based quadrature method of moments is used to describe the characteristic volumes v 1 v 2 and corresponding weights w 1 w 2 of small and large microplastics respectively the fractional moment transform barrett and webb 1998 su et al 2007 closed by gaussian approximation barrett and webb 1998 mcgraw 1997 is hereby applied m k 3 q 0 v k 3 q n v t d v i 1 2 v i k 3 q ω i 7 k 0 q 2 q 3 q in which mk is the kth moment of the volume based number density function n v t and q is the adjustable factor a value of q 1 3 is selected to enable the tracking of m 1 to maintain volume conservation shen and maa 2015 it is critical to note that the 0th 1 3 th 2 3 th and 1st moments of volume based n v t are equivalent to the 0th 1st 2nd and 3rd moments of the length based number density function n l t as shown in marchisio et al 2003 kariwala et al 2012 and shen et al 2021 applying eq 7 to eq 3 the simplified moment transport equation becomes m k 3 q t 1 2 i 1 2 ω i j 1 2 β v i v j ω j v i v j k 3 q i

q b v ε d v f d p k 3 v i v i 1 f k 3 m 1 k to solve eq 8 the fractional moments mk at t 0 are first obtained by the initial particle volume concentration with the characteristic volume and weights vi wi i 1 2 extracted from the moments using wheeler s 1974 algorithm at this time the righthand side of eq 8 becomes a constant such that mk can be updated to solve this two class model for the next time step note that although the reverse process to find vi and wi from their finite moments is an ill conditioned mathematical problem using only two classes i e i 2 for their lower order moments is usually numerically robust efficient and physically meaningful in our applications 3 results 3 1 effects of oms on microplastic growth the characteristic sizes i e mean and median of microplastic flocs increase with the addition of oms indicating that the om species determined the flocculation rates for instance when the turbulent shear rate was g 20 s 1 the median size d 50 of microplastic flocs was 125 3 μm without any oms fig 4 a humic acid and xanthan gum have marginal effects on the flocculation of microplastic aggregates with an increase in the d 50 of only 10 4 and 8 0 respectively this result is slightly different from that given by zhang et al 2013 and furukawa et al 2012 2014 who have shown negligible effects for enhancing flocculation in their anionic om experiments this may be because their conclusions drawn from conventional experiments correspond to static flows rather than turbulent flows and the incubation of biofilms was not performed in their study chitosan and guar gum on the other hand significantly promote microplastic flocculation to form larger aggregates the d 50 with guar gum or chitosan added reached 177 0 μm and 164 4 μm after t 11 h corresponding to 41 6 and 31 2 increases respectively in comparison with the pure microplastic condition note that previous studies that explore the effects of guar gum on sediment aggregation also result in similar conclusions for example zhang et al 2013 experimentally illustrated the significant promoting effect of neutral guar gum on flocculation for cohesive sediments kang et al 2019 used chitosan as a flocculant for kaolinite showing strong effects to facilitate particle flocculation and thus accelerate their settling speeds in short the flocculation capability of biofilm coated microplastics under g 20 s 1 for different oms is guar gum chitosan humic acid xanthan gum under a higher shear rate g 40 s 1 the d 50 of pure suspended microplastics decreases to 110 6 μm due to additional fragile flocs tearing up due to higher energy in the flow in addition the resulting floc sizes after t 11 h show varying properties for different oms fig 4 b with guar gum or chitosan added the equilibrium d 50 values were 141 5 and 152 0 μm respectively corresponding to increases of 28 2 and 38 2 compared to the case without om addition this result shows that even under highly turbulent conditions the above two oms still have the ability to significantly promote flocculation the same conclusion was also obtained from shen and maa 2016 in the flocculation experiment of kaolinite microparticles on the other hand with humic acid or xanthan gum added the d 50 after t 11 h is in accordance with an additional 75 5 or 77 3 growth in comparison with previous turbulent environments i e g 20 s 1 these two substances are more efficient flocculation agents at high shear than at low shear for example the xanthan gum leads to an increase of 77 3 for the d 50 under g 40 s 1 compared with an increase of 8 0 under g 20 s 1 the possible reason is that the anionic humic acid or xanthan gum may enhance the stability of the flocs kretzschmar et al 1998 tolhurst et al 2002 resulting in the formation of a tighter and more stable structure that causes the flocs to be less likely to break up under increased turbulent shear rates thus under a high shear rate the influences of the above polymers to accelerate microplastic coagulation are xanthan gum humic acid chitosan guar gum it is important to note that the above results are based on the analysis of the median size of microplastic suspensions in quasi equilibrium using the mean size in general results in the same conclusion except for xanthan gum under a shear rate of g 20 s 1 the mean size of xanthan gum is 26 8 larger than the case without om addition i e 153 5 μm close to the case with guar gum added 36 6 increase thus xanthan gum may also be considered a relatively strong flocculant under g 20 s 1 the large differences in the mean and median sizes in equilibrium xanthan gum i e 135 and 194 2 μm respectively also indicate the possibility of creating a few large megaflocs in this circumstance 3 2 effects of the same om under different shear it is also interesting to see the effects of the same om under different shear rates g there could be an optimal threshold shear rate g beyond which the mean size will decrease due to breakage by large shear and below which the mean size could increase as g increases due to more frequent collisions in this study guar gum is chosen to examine the effect of shear this is because guar gum is reported to show more evident effects than other organic substances tan et al 2014 furukawa et al 2014 shen and maa 2016 thus as a preliminary study it was also selected to explore the effect of turbulent shear on the flocculation of pe the turbulence may cause the particles to collide and aggregate into larger flocs whereas the shear rate generated by the turbulence may also break the particles hunt 1980 as shown in fig 5 with an increase in shear from g 20 s 1 to g 80 s 1 both the median and mean floc sizes show a decreasing trend the median and mean sizes are 177 0 μm and 209 7 μm when the turbulent shear rate is g 20 s 1 and decrease to 92 9 μm and 103 0 μm until g reaches 80 s 1 the optimal shear rate g is not fixed often in the range of 20 30 s 1 for cohesive sediments zhang et al 2013 depending on the residence time and flocculation behavior mietta et al 2009b however in this experiment for microplastics with guar gum added the existence of g is not observed the minimum of g 20 s 1 in this study is selected to prevent significant particle settling which otherwise may lead to biased conclusions instead of a reliable g d relationship for microplastic flocculation nevertheless it would be interesting to use xanthan gum and possibly other om to test their aggregation behaviors in the future as the strength may increase with an increase in shear from g 20 s 1 to g 40 s 1 fig 4 this may indicate that xanthan gum could have this threshold value of g since the bonds formed between microplastics are stronger than that with guar gum this part can be improved in future studies 3 3 effect of oms on microplastic subpopulations during the incubation process the sizes of the microplastic flocs increase at first and are mostly shown as unimodal floc volume distributions fvds with additional om added large and fluffy flocs are produced lee et al 2017 and the distributions gradually change from unimodal to bimodal one possible reason is that these biocoated flocs are fragile so that the biological bridges between bioplastic particles are weak therefore more fragments are possibly created under turbulent shear shown as the small peak of the fvds due to floc breakage under abundant microbial activities and strong turbulence nguyen et al 2020 in this study the fvds were decomposed into two subordinate log normal distributions for small and large microplastics under a shear rate of g 20 s 1 without the addition of om fig 6 the sizes of small and large microplastics are 61 1 μm v 2 3 10 4 mm3 and 141 5 μm v 2 8 10 3 mm3 with volume concentrations of 0 3 μl l and 0 6 μl l respectively with different oms added the sizes of small microplastics l 1 are similar with a maximum difference of 13 9 note that the microplastic particles used in this study are polyethylene particles with nominal sizes of approximately75 0 μm nevertheless the l 1 values smaller than 75 0 μm were still possible as fragments formed under turbulent disruption the smallest pieces found in the experiment were approximately 40 μm the volume concentrations of small microplastics v 1 range from 0 2 to 0 6 μl l on the other hand the large microplastics vary significantly under different flocculant dosages the sizes of large microplastics l 2 show an increase of 102 4 44 2 23 7 and 61 4 for adding chitosan guar gum humic acid and xanthan gum respectively the volume concentrations for large floc groups v 2 are in the range of 0 3 0 6 μl l with the maximum value corresponding to the chitosan case the possible reason for the abundance of large microplastics with chitosan is that it has a strong promoting effect on flocculation when the turbulent shear rate is 20 s 1 neutral organic guar gum also shows a promotion effect on flocculation with v 2 significantly higher than that without om moreover as shown in fig 6 c and d the fvds under the influences of two negatively charged oms humic acid and xanthan gum show a more evident bimodal feature under shear rate of g 40 s 1 fig 7 with no oms added the characteristic sizes of subordinate microplastic groups are 56 0 μm v 1 7 10 4 mm3 and 127 9 μm v 2 1 10 3 mm3 providing only 8 4 and 9 6 decreases compared with l 1 and l 2 under g 20 s 1 in addition with a ratio of 0 3 for volume concentrations v 1 v 2 under g 40 s 1 against v 1 v 2 0 4 under g 20 s 1 the two pvds show similar features although the median size is reduced from 125 3 μm to 110 6 μm due to intensive breakage under high turbulence with oms included the size of the small microplastic group l 1 is generally close to that of the pure microplastic case one exception is that the l 1 with xanthan gum is much larger 82 5 μm the corresponding v 1 is also different as high as 0 6 μl l for xanthan gum and 0 3 0 5 μl l for guar gum and chitosan but as low as 0 2 μl l for humic acid in particular for xanthan gum more flocs with smaller particle sizes clearly show an approximately transparent solution in the experiment which can be explained by an evidently strong fragmentation by turbulent mixing furthermore the second peak l 2 is 233 5 μm 1 27 10 2 mm3 170 5 μm 5 0 10 3 mm3 205 2 μm 8 6 10 3 mm3 and 238 1 μm 1 4 10 2 mm3 as a result of additions of chitosan guar gum humic acid and xanthan gum respectively with an increase of 33 3 86 2 compared with the l 2 for pure microplastics the concentration of the second group v 2 with humic acid is dominant 1 0 μl l compared with a maximum value of 0 8 μl l for other oms it is crucial to note that the case with xanthan gum addition showed a similar feature this may be because the flocs have more stable structures generated by anionic flocculants in the water which contain a large amount of cations e g ca2 ma2 etc kretzschmar et al 1998 tolhurst et al 2002 chen and elimelech 2007 and thus are not easily broken under high shear conditions 3 4 model parameterization the quadrature based two class population balance model is used to track the evolution of the characteristic sizes and weights of two microplastic classes the initial particle size of the flocs is approximately40 μm and the aggregation and breakage parameters c1 and c 2 are the fitting parameters table 3 in general the simulated and measured fsds are compared reasonably well fig 8 under g 20 s 1 with null oms the simulated l 1 and l 2 are 48 5 μm and 152 3 μm with weights i e volume fractions of 28 5 and 71 5 respectively for small microplastics adding oms did not significantly change l 1 46 4 47 0 μm except for guar gum 84 9 μm while the weights w 1 apparently increased with chitosan or xanthan gum added 42 2 45 6 in contrast for large microplastics l 2 significantly increased to 293 1 μm 219 5 μm 274 1 μm and 186 5 μm for chitosan humic acid xanthan gum and guar gum respectively the weights w 2 of large microplastics increased only slightly after the addition of guar gum while with other om they decreased with the greatest decrease in xanthan gum and chitosan 54 4 57 8 under g 40 s 1 the corresponding weights of l 1 49 7 μm and l 2 131 8 μm in the absence of oms are 31 4 and 68 6 respectively after adding different oms l 1 l 2 w 1 and w 2 all showed the same trend as when the turbulent shear rate was 20 s 1 notice that the deviation of the simulated and observed results for humic acid is relatively large compared with the other cases this may be because the water samples with humic acid and other om were not collected at the same time it is worth noting that different fragmentation distribution functions must be used see also zhang et al 2019 to better account for the comprehensive breakage processes with oms included shen and maa 2016 in experiments with no om added when the larger floc is broken it may generate two smaller flocs i e m 2 to account for 92 of the original mass i e f 0 08 and the rest are elementary particles in this study it is similar to the parameters taken by the model of lee et al 2011 f 0 1 m 2 when chitosan was added 4 8 of the parent flocs decomposed into original particles i e f 0 048 and the rest of the parent particles remained i e m 1 with xanthan gum added the disintegration of a parent floc may result in 13 of the flocs breaking down into elementary particles i e f 0 13 while the remaining parent particles disintegrate into two smaller flocs i e m 2 for guar gum and humic acid no particles were broken into their constituent particles i e f 0 and all parent flocs decomposed into 1 3 and 1 79 smaller flocs i e m 1 3 1 79 respectively in both cases the reason that m is not an integer is that it is a statistic for example after some collisions between two flocs there are finally three flocs at this time m 1 5 in addition the model parameters of the same om under the two turbulent shears are identical this part can be enhanced by summarizing a process based on m and f for the breakage distribution functions selected under different biophysical environments while the measured settling flux is computed by the observed 30 bin fsds the simulations are based on li and wi i 1 2 from the two class pbe which accounts for the characteristic sizes and volume fractions of two subordinate microplastic groups the results show that the errors between the two class model and measurements are reasonable 0 4 7 8 see also table 2 which is comparable with a value of 9 5 reported by lee et al 2012 for cohesive sediments the largest error i e 7 8 is for the xanthan gum case under shear rate of g 20 s 1 which may be caused by the deposition of some large flocs at the bottom of the stirring chamber however when reducing the floc groups the errors between the one class model and the measured value are as high as 16 4 53 8 adding additional floc groups is supposed to be helpful to further reduce the errors but it also increases the computational costs and the possibility of numerical instability for quadrature based pbe and thus may not be necessary at this time 4 discussion 4 1 experimental uncertainty in this study the biofilms were cultured in microplastic suspensions for 7 days at room temperature 25 c controlled by an airconditioner and with natural light with day night cycles the nutrient solution was recirculated every 24 h since the density of pe microspheres is lower than water the particles were floating on the water surface at first as the biofilms gradually colonized a small amount of flocculent eps appeared around the microplastics on the second day and pe microspheres began to leave the water surface and were suspended in the water column during the third to fifth days the biofilms around the particles continued to increase with additional microspheres in suspension after 4 days particles still floating were rare and a few particles entrained by biofilms were deposited on the bottom by days 6 and 7 most of the microplastics covered with biofilms settled out of the water surface and deposited on the bottom as flocs note that the incubated particles with the addition of oms settled faster than the pure microplastic suspension but the difference in settling time with different oms was small here cases with and without guar gum after 7 days of incubation were taken as comparative examples without any om biofilm layers wrapped on the surface of the microplastic particles fig 9 a the shape of the originally nearly spherical plastic microspheres changed after biofilm attachment causing microplastic particles to agglomerate to form large flocs the flocs marked in fig 9 a are concentrated by the aggregation of multiple microplastics with their surface wrapped with biofilms a small number of filamentous biofilms was also connected between flocs which appeared firmer if the culture was continued under the experimental conditions nevertheless under the influence of guar gum the adhesion of biofilms on the particle surface seemed significantly improved the large microplastic flocs formed by the aggregation of multiple constituent particles were completely enclosed by the biofilms resulting in relatively compact and rigid flocs biofilms also developed connecting different flocs forming a network structure between flocs overall under the action of guar gum the biofilm in fig 9 b grew to a mature state and the structure of the floc reached a stable state fig 9 also revealed that an appropriate concentration of guar gum could significantly promote the flocculation of microplastics it should be mentioned that a magnetic stirrer was used daily to generate turbulence during the cultivation of the biofilm in the preliminary experiments we applied bubble aeration to make the water turbulent in the beaker the turbulence provided by this method was closer to the turbulence of the natural water environment when compared with that from using a magnetic stirrer and also significantly promoted the flocculation of microplastic particles however the bubble machine sent air to the bottom of the beaker and greatly increased the oxygen in the water sample presumably because of the increased microbial activity under these conditions many longer flocs were produced these flocs with large aspect ratios were surrounded by a large number of microplastic particles possibly occurring in static and nutrient rich water bodies in our later experiments we used a magnetic stirrer to generate turbulence when incubating the biofilm 4 2 microbial derived eps the observations for different oms are also affected by the eps and microbial cells created during the incubation note that the microplastic spheres were incubated for seven days with a relatively rich nutrient solution in river water and thus substantial microbial activity was expected the average particle size of the microplastics was initially 75 0 μm after incubation the median size without adding oms was approximately 125 155 μm fig 4 this means that the eps and microbial cells necromass created during the incubation also promoted flocculation since the same nutrient solution was used in all the experiments it is still possible to find the additional influences of different oms by comparing individual cases to the reference on the other hand the different observations compared to previous literature are likely because the effect observed in this study is not the sole effect from added om but rather is confounded by the naturally occurring eps and microbial dead cells due to enhanced microbial activity in the incubation in this study the effect of naturally occurring eps is not separated from that solely contributed by the added om rather they are the combined effects between added om and microbial derived om it is still meaningful to see the effects of different oms added to microbial derived om which could provide indications of which type of om could enhance or hinder microplastic growth however the results should be interpreted with caution since it is a mixture of om in natural water bodies it is more likely that om is a mixture of organic substances with different charges the overall effect is critical for transport modeling since typically the total organic content of the water samples rather than their composition or charges is measured in addition it may be more realistic if we test om naturally occurring in rivers to investigate the overall effect and interactions between om with different charges nevertheless it is also possible that the composition of the om is location specific meaning that it could change case by case depending on the study site adding controlled om could provide more insights into how different kinds of om could potentially influence microplastic biofilm formation hence in this study natural water is only used to incubate biofilms for microplastics we added additional om proxies in our experiments to address the effect of one major om for each condition an advanced model with connected effects may only be thoroughly parameterized after the effect of each om is better examined 4 3 implications 1 internal properties how to describe a microplastic microplastics like other particles have multiple internal properties such as their size shape color and composition the size is often the primary parameter used to identify different microplastic particles yang et al 2021 here we wanted to focus on the effect of oms on the growth of microplastics to avoid complexity spherical particles were used to focus on particle size the microplastics found in natural waters are not perfectly spherical they may also be in the forms of fibers fragments and films this indicates that shape may be another important property of microplastics nguyen et al 2020 thus the effects of shape should be investigated both in experiments and in numerical models in future studies to extend the results and conclusions in this study to naturally occurring microplastics that are not spherical 2 bedform developments what is the role of cohesion the role of cohesion in purely cohesive and naturally mixed sediment bedforms is interesting since this study also involves sedimentary organic and biofilm levels the bedforms can be influenced by both physical and biological cohesion parsons et al 2016 on the one hand the percentage of clay content will reduce the height length and steepness of the bed which is referred to as the effect of physical cohesion schindler et al 2015 the cohesive strength of the bed limits the ability of the water flow to erode the sediment thus limiting the height to which the bed can eventually grow parsons et al 2016 on the other hand the biofilm incubated by microorganisms shown as the effect of biological cohesion is more effective in changing the bed dimension and steepness since the cohesion between particles formed by biological activities is usually stronger paterson et al al 1990 paterson and hagerthey 2001 while substratum mud has a significant effect even small additions of eps dominate the combined effect of cohesion and have a dramatic effect on bed size and bed type at the same time bed formation is greatly slowed because bioaggregation inhibits the movement of individual particles malarkey et al 2015 lichtman et al 2018 the natural bedforms predicted based on pure sand experiments are not complete since the bedform dynamics are also controlled by bed composition in terms of different fractions of physically cohesive clays or biologically cohesive eps malarkey et al 2015 the erosion threshold τ cr is the bed shear stress needed to erode the surface of the bed thus clay and eps are often represented as physical and biological stabilizers which increase τ cr the effect of biological cohesion is demonstrated to be stronger than that of physical cohesion for example the eps even of dry weight as low as 0 0125 can influence ripple development malarkey et al 2015 whereas a similar phenomenon is only observed for clay contents larger than 16 baas et al 2013 however conclusions drawn from steady flow may not be true under other environments for instance chen et al 2021 showed that cohesive eps may also be a biodestabilizers under wave actions 3 local study how to extend to a wider context urban rivers play an important role in ecological balance and human life and are part of hydrology and nutrient cycling tiquia 2011 as the main link between terrestrial and aquatic environments they are characterized by low flow rates with minimal hydraulic exchanges resulting in a relatively stable environment xu et al 2011 the findings in the qinhuai river a typical urban river are critically compared with other studies for example kaiser et al 2017 also colonized biofilms on the surface of polyethylene pe after incubation in situ in the baltic sea area of germany the pe pellets began to sink with the occurrence of biofilms but the time for particles beginning to settle was six weeks or even longer after incubation nevertheless in our experiment this time is usually within one week this may be because of a higher microbe richness in urban rivers and the added oms also speed up the formation of biofilms additionally furukawa et al 2014 and tan et al 2014 investigated the effects of different oms on the flocculation of cohesive montmorillonite they found that humic acid and xanthan gum only have limited functions on floc growth in this study however the effects of the above oms on promoting flocculation are evident especially under high turbulent shear the lack of biofilm incubation processes may be responsible for the differences between their experiments and this study it is also crucial to note that the gradient of urban rivers is usually mild which helps to isolate various factors and focuses merely on the temporal variations in biofouled microplastics at the first stage for example fan et al 2022 stated that spatial factors both longitudinal and vertical do not significantly affect microplastic concentrations while more microplastics are found in the wet season than in the dry season in estuarine and coastal waters however the environmental gradients e g by salinity suspended sediment concentrations or water nutrients are strong which dictates more complicated spatiotemporal variations in the distributions of microplastics thus the conclusions drawn from a rapidly urbanizing region in this paper can be treated as a preliminary study with possible extension to better understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of microplastics in high energy coastal waters in the future 5 conclusion this study experimentally investigated the effects of four different oms i e chitosan guar gum humic acid and xanthan gum on the flocculation of biofilm coated microplastics under different turbulent shear conditions in addition a mathematic model that employed the two class quadrature method of moments was used to track the small and large microplastic subgroups under the framework of population balance modeling the following are the concluding remarks 1 all of the oms involved in this study regardless of whether anionic cationic or neutral show positive effects on the growth of biofilms to create biofilm mediated microplastic aggregates chitosan and guar gum have strong promoting effects on the flocculation of microplastic particles the effects of humic acid and xanthan gum become evident when the shear rate increases from 20 s 1 to 40 s 1 in addition no critical turbulent shear rate g is observed in the d g curve for biofilm coated microplastic with guar gum included based on our experiments 2 the observed floc volume distributions can be fairly decomposed into two lognormal distributions to illustrate the characteristic sizes or volumes and volumetric concentrations of small and large microplastics respectively under the same shear the sizes of small microplastics l 1 were similar to each other for all the test cases except for the cases with guar gum addition while other variables l 2 w 1 and w 2 often dynamically changed according to different environments 3 the adhesion of biofilms increases the size and density of microplastics resulting in the microplastic particles becoming heavier than the ambient fluids and thus gradually settling with time during the biofilm incubation process the presence of oms shortened the residence time of biomediated microplastics in comparison with that for null organic conditions 4 the quadrature based population balance model with only two classes provides good predictions of the flocculation and deflocculation processes of microplastics this model is robust efficient and physically meaningful the errors of the settling flux calculated by the two classes are less than 8 compared with the laboratory

15061,microplastics mps are one of the most widespread contaminants worldwide yet their risks for freshwater ecosystems have seldom been investigated in this study we performed a large monitoring campaign to assess the presence and risks of mps in amazonian freshwater ecosystems we investigated mp pollution in 40 samples collected along 1500 km in the brazilian amazon including the amazon river three major tributaries and several streams next to the most important urban areas mps in the 55 5000 µm size range were characterized size shape color by microscopy and identified polymer composition by infrared spectroscopy ecotoxicological risks were assessed using chronic species sensitivity distributions for effects triggered by food dilution and tissue translocation using data alignment methods that correct for polydispersity of environmental mps and bioaccessibility this study shows that mps are ubiquitous contaminants in amazonian freshwater ecosystems with measured concentrations 55 5000 µm ranging between 5 and 152 mps m3 in the amazon river and its main tributaries and between 23 and 74 550 mps m3 in urban streams the calculated hazardous concentration for the 5 of species hc5 derived from the ssds for the entire mp range 1 5000 µm were 1 6 107 mps m3 95 ci 1 2 106 4 0 108 for food dilution and 1 8 107 mps m3 95 ci 1 5 106 4 3 108 for translocation rescaled exposure concentrations 1 5000 µm in the amazon river and tributaries ranged between 6 0 103 and 1 8 105 mps m3 and were significantly lower than the calculated hc5 values rescaled concentrations in urban streams ranged between 1 7 105 and 5 7 108 mps m3 and exceeded both calculated hc5 values in 20 of the locations this study shows that ecological impacts by mp contamination are not likely to happen in the amazon river and its major tributaries however risks for freshwater organisms may be expected in near densely populated areas such as the cities of manaus or belem which have limited wastewater treatment facilities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics amazon river urban pollution species sensitivity distributions ecological risk assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction environmental pollution from plastic has been considered a global threat due to its persistence and potential impacts on a wide range of living organisms including humans rochman et al 2013 yang et al 2022 plastic materials break down into smaller particles microplastics mps 1 5000 µm in length gesamp 2019 which can travel long distances and have been detected in a wide range of environmental compartments including air water and soil li et al 2018 gonzález pleiter et al 2021 jacques and prosser 2021 urban wastewater is considered one of the major pathways for mps into aquatic ecosystems as it has been found to contain up to 10 000 mps l most of them being fibres and fragments schell et al 2020 ngo et al 2019 in general over 90 of mps found in wastewater are retained by wastewater treatment plants schell et al 2020 iyare et al 2020 however only 52 of the global sewage is treated 74 in high income countries and 4 2 in developing countries jones et al 2021 this suggests that untreated wastewaters can be a major source of mps in areas with limited or unexisting access to sewage treatment facilities the amazon river is the largest river in the world it discharges more than 5 1012 m3 year into the atlantic coast representing about 17 of the total volume of freshwater entering the global ocean callède et al 2010 currently about 30 million people are living in the amazon basin wwf 2020 most of whom live in large cities that are undergoing continuous expansion côrtes et al 2020 it is estimated that only 8 12 of the population that live in the urban areas of the brazilian amazon have access to basic sanitation systems ana 2020 therefore the majority of urban wastewaters as well as urban runoff waters are discharged untreated into the river constituting a major pathway for mps moreover large amounts of plastic are dumped on the banks of the amazon river lucas solis et al 2021 which can break down due to erosion and microbial processes contributing to an in increase in mp exposure levels recent studies have reported the occurrence of mps in environmental samples collected in the amazon basin for example santos queiroz et al 2022 reported high mp exposure levels in water samples collected along the amazon continental shelf 320 13 000 mps m3 while gerolin et al 2020 denoted an increase in mp concentrations in sediment samples collected downstream of the urban area of manaus brazil moreover some studies have reported the occurrence of mps in the digestive tract of fish andrade et al 2019 pegado et al 2018 2021 as well as in anemones morais et al 2020 collected from the amazon river estuary suggesting that the amazon river is an important entry route for mps into the atlantic ocean in fact the study by lebreton et al 2017 suggested that the amazon river is one of the world s top ten polluting rivers in terms of plastic emissions into the ocean this study by lebreton et al 2017 was based on indirect extrapolations from a limited number of monitoring studies mostly conducted in europe and data on mismanaged plastic waste generation and overlooked regional social and environmental dynamics meijer et al 2021 therefore further investigations of mp pollution in the amazon are needed mps can affect a wide range of aquatic organisms through different effect mechanisms including blockage of the digestive tract food dilution sorption to the skin entanglement shading or even by translocation to the inner parts of the body and organs de sá et al 2018 schell et al 2022 few studies have attempted to assess the risks posed by mp pollution to aquatic organisms by comparing measured exposure concentrations with species sensitivity distributions ssds built with laboratory toxicity data burns and boxall 2018 besseling et al 2019 everaert et al 2020 however many of these comparisons are substantially flawed since they compare exposure and effect data from studies that target different mp size ranges furthermore they compare the results of toxicity studies that are usually performed with monodisperse particle distributions i e one single polymer type with a given shape size with the polydisperse particle distributions obtained from field exposure assessments recently koelmans et al 2020 and kooi et al 2021 have proposed a methodology to re scale exposure and effect data towards the full mp size range 1 5000 µm so that effect threshold concentrations and risk calculations can be aligned for the polydisperse distribution of environmental mps despite the fact that the methods have become accessible to a wide audience through the tomex web application thornton hampton et al 2022 only a limited number of studies have implemented this methodology koelmans et al 2020 coffin et al 2022 redondo hasselerharm et al 2023 koelmans et al 2020 compared a global distribution of mp samples taken in the water column of freshwater ecosystems with the hc5 hazardous concentration for 5 of species which is usually considered as threshold concentration for unacceptable ecological effects and concluded that risks may be expected at a reduced number of locations 1 5 which were close to anthropogenic pollution sources in a similar study redondo hasselerharm et al 2023 concluded that mp risks to freshwater benthic organisms are likely to occur in some hotspot areas and provided threshold concentrations for the risk assessment of mps in the sediment compartment to date the risks of mp contamination for amazonian freshwater ecosystems have not been evaluated the amazon constitutes one of the most important biodiversity biomes containing about 3500 species of fish junk et al 2007 former investigations on the impacts of urban wastewater into amazonian freshwater ecosystems have revealed unaceptable risks posed by pharmaceuticals and pesticides in rivers and streams close to the major urban areas rico et al 2021 2022 and have indicated the presence of large amounts of plastic debris accumulated in the shoreline of these urban areas therefore it is expected that mps constitute yet another threat for amazonian freshwater biodiversity for which specific risk assessment and management are needed therefore the main objectives of this study were to characterize mp exposure in several areas of the amazon river with different levels of anthropogenic impact and to assess mp risks for amazonian freshwater ecosystems for this we characterized mp exposure in water samples collected along a longitudinal gradient of over 1500 km including the amazon river and its main tributaries as well as small rivers and streams receiving wastewater from four important cities of the brazilian amazon mp risks for freshwater biodiversity at the catchment scale were calculated on the basis of ssds for effects triggered by food dilution and tissue translocation using data alignment methods to correct for the polydispersity and bioaccessibility of mps in environmental samples 2 material and methods 2 1 microplastic sampling our study included 40 water samples taken during november december of 2019 end of the dry season in the amazon river n 11 in three major tributaries negro tapajós tocantins n 9 and in the urban streams of manaus macapá santarém and belém n 20 fig 1 two of the samples in the negro river were taken in the anavilhanas national park n1 and n2 and two samples in the dilution area of manaus n4 and n5 the sampling locations in macapá as well as in the tocantins river and belém were subject to some tidal effects in these locations the sampling was preferably done during the low tide moments however in one sample taken in belém b2 we observed clear mixing of stream waters with up stream tidal currents sampling in the amazon river and in the tributaries was performed from small boats that remained in the same location as long as possible or from large passenger boats that were in continuous movement fig 1 sampling in urban areas was predominantly performed from bridges or small boats a given amount of water was pumped from the middle of the river section approximate water depth 0 5 1 m and filtered over a plankton net 55 µm after filtration the samples were stored in glass containers 0 5 l and filtered over a filter paper gf a ø 47 mm pore size 0 7 µm then the filter was folded and introduced into aluminum envelopes until further analysis the amount of sampled water was decided based on the expected level of anthropogenic impact in the sampling location and ranged between 0 3 4 6 m3 see table s1 2 2 microplastic extraction sample processing depended on the material observed on the filters if the filter content was mainly composed of organic matter the material was rinsed into erlenmeyer flasks with filtered reverse osmosis ro water the content of the erlenmeyer flasks was then left to settle overnight and the overlying water was filtered onto filter paper whatman gf a ø 47 mm pore size 0 7 µm the sedimented material was passed through a 53 µm stainless steel sieve to eliminate fine material mainly clay below the study s assessed mp sizes the material retained in the sieve was transferred to erlenmeyer flasks and treated to remove organic matter with h2o2 30 v v at 40 c on a shaker 100 rpm until the reaction stopped this was followed by two density separations using a sodium iodide solution density 1 8 g ml after each density separation the overlaying material was filtered onto separate filter papers and retained for analysis samples containing a large amount of sandy sediment were first dried at 45 c each sample was then transferred into clean pre rinsed polyethylene tubes and subjected to two density separations using a nai solution density 1 8 g ml the first density separation extract of each sample contained a large amount of organic material for this reason the extract was filtered through a 53 µm stainless steel sieve and followed by organic matter removal as described above the overlaying material was filtered onto separate filter papers the content remaining after organic matter removal and the extract from the second density separation were each filtered onto separate filters gf a ø 47 mm pore size 0 7 µm and retained for analysis 2 3 microplastic analysis all filters were first analysed visually for mps using a nikon smz 745t stereomicroscope at 20 50x magnification when the filters were too loaded with mps after a first visual check only a small fraction of the filter 1 8 or 1 4 was analysed and extrapolated to the rest of the filter this subsampling was performed by taking several segments from the filter paper to ensure that subsamples were as representative of the distribution of mps on the original filter as possible suspected mp particles were photographed using an infinity 1 camera the long and the short axis of each mp were measured using the infinity analyze v 6 5 4 software package following calibration using a measurement standard for a proportion of the particles c a 40 the particle depth was estimated with the microscope for the remaining particles the depth was calculated based on the ratio between the short axis and the estimated depth of the particles of the same shape for which the depth was estimated in the microscope each particle was classified according to shape into beads fibres fragments films or glitter particles some fibres formed clumps that could not be separated and were therefore reported as such as the dataset contained a huge number of mps 12 000 particles were sized and classified according to their shape only a proportion 12 of these suspected mp particles could be analysed for their polymer composition using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir particles were characterized using a perkin elmer spotlight 400 µftir in transmission mode the particles were first compressed using a diamond compression cell dc 3 perkin elmer before being loaded onto the machine to improve spectral quality four co scans were taken at a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 for each particle measurement a new background scan was made each time the diamond compression cell was loaded onto the machine approximately every 1 10 particles each spectrum was compared to a series of commercial perkinelmer polymer library agilent polymer library open source primpke et al 2018 and in house libraries a minimum hit quality index hqi of 70 was used as a threshold to accept a match for polymer identification in addition the reliability of each match was assessed by manually checking the characteristic peaks of each spectrum after evaluation the particles that did not comply with the above criteria 18 were excluded from the analysis 2 4 quality assurance quality control except for the pumping device all materials used in the field were non plastic and had been prewashed with distilled water furthermore organic cotton clothing was used during sampling all collected samples were transported from brazil to norway in aluminum foil envelopes then they were processed and analysed at the microplastic laboratory of the norwegian institute for water research niva in a positive pressure room with hepa filtered class h13 air input the contamination reduction measures implemented in this laboratory included the use of natural fiber clothing and lab coats removal of loose fibres using a lint roller upon entry to the laboratory and regular removal of dust from all laboratory areas furthermore all processing steps in which samples were exposed to the laboratory environment e g during rinsing of filters were done in a laminar flow cabinet all laboratory water or solutions used in the sample processing were pre filtered 0 22 μm for reverse osmosis water 1 2 μm for nai and h2o2 immediately before use glass containers and polyethylene tubes used during sample processing were rinsed three times with filtered reverse osmosis water before use three blanks were included with each set of samples that was processed simultaneously these blanks represent combined procedural container and solution blanks and were treated identically to the field samples all suspected mps observed in these blanks were visually and chemically characterized in the same way as the field samples most of the particles identified in the blanks were non plastic table s2 so no further corrections to the field samples were applied the method used here has been previously validated using spiked samples for a range of mp particle types the extraction efficiencies and recovery rates are provided in hurley et al 2018 and crossman et al 2020 2 5 microplastic mass estimation and exposure concentrations the mass of the mps was determined based on the volume of the measured particles and the density of the identified polymers particle volume was calculated based on the assigned morphology and the size of the analysed axes using the following approach beads were treated as spheres fibres as cylinders and films fragments and glitter as ellipsoids information on polymer densities is shown in table s3 the mass of the mps for which the polymer composition was not determined with ftir was assigned to 1 g cm 3 for beads 1 3 g cm 3 for fibres 1 1 g cm 3 for films and fragments and 1 4 g cm 3 for glitter based on the mean density of the mps with identified polymer type in the current dataset mps were grouped into four size classes according to their longest measured axis 55 150 μm 150 300 μm 300 1000 μm and 1000 5000 μm the particles with the longest axis beyond the 55 5000 μm range were excluded from the analysis microplastic exposure concentrations in the different samples were estimated based on the number of particles mps l and the mass of the mp particles mg l by dividing the mp particles or the total mass by the water volume passed over the sampling nets 2 6 ecological risk assessment to assess mp risks for aquatic organisms we first rescaled the measured exposure concentration data 55 5000 µm to the standard mp size range 1 5000 µm following the approach described by koelmans et al 2020 the approach is based on the application of a correction factor cf to the measured particle concentration c f 5000 1 a 1 1 a x 2 1 a x 1 1 a where x1 and x2 are the minimum 55 µm and maximum 5000 µm values of the targeted size range in the current study the α is the exponent of the power law distribution fitted to the measured mp concentrations based on particle size i e length of the longest axis the fitting of the power law distribution was done separately for the samples taken in the amazon river and tributaries and those taken in urban areas as it was expected they would show potential differences related to major mp sources environmental fate or fragmentation processes in both cases the fitting of the power law distribution was successfully done the fitting was done according to the maximum likelihood estimation mle method described in kooi et al 2021 based on 100 bootstraps and using the powerlaw package gillespie 2014 the α value for the amazon river and tributaries was 2 77 while the α value for the samples taken in urban streams was 3 23 based on these α values the calculated cfs for the amazon river and tributaries and for the urban areas were 1202 and 7604 respectively for the characterization of the ecotoxicological effects of mps in the aquatic environment ssds were constructed and the hc5 and their 95 confidence intervals cis were calculated for this purpose a literature search was conducted on publications until september 2022 using the web of science wos and proquest databases to obtain toxicity data for aquatic organisms exposed to mps via water the following strings were used effect or impact or toxicity and microplastic s or plastic particle or fiber or fragment or film and freshwater or marine or aquatic and species or organism or invertebrate or crustacean or fish from the studies collected we selected chronic toxicity data 3 days for phytoplankton 7 days for zooplankton 21 days for macrophytes and fish 28 days for benthic invertebrates for endpoints linked to effects at the individual level e g survival growth reproduction etc following rico et al 2019 the no observed effect concentration noec was used as the species effect threshold for the construction of the ssds and only those studies in which a noec and a lowest observed effect concentration loec could be obtained were included in the analysis excluding studies where no statistically significant effects were found and studies reporting non dose dependent effects when the noec was given in mg l only and the information provided in the study was insufficient to calculate the equivalent noec in mps m3 it was converted to mps m3 using the method described by leusch and ziajahromi 2021 then the noecs for animal species were aligned to the environmentally relevant and bioaccessible effective concentration following the calculations described in redondo hasselerharm et al 2023 these included data transformations for mps m3 for ingested particle volume and surface area as ecologically relevant metrics erms which correspond to the effect mechanisms of food dilution and tissue translocation respectively redondo hasselerharm et al 2023 for food dilution when the length of the largest mp axis was larger than the mouth opening of the test organism it was considered biologically unavailable for tissue translocation the particles with a length above the cut off value of 83 µm proposed by mehinto et al 2022 were considered biologically unavailable except for the species with a mouth opening size smaller than 83 µm for which the mouth opening size determined bioaccessibility following koelmans et al 2020 and redondo hasselerharm et al 2023 no alignments were applied to the microalgae data included in the ssds this is because effect mechanisms for algae and macrophytes are still unclear a summary of the characteristics of the toxicity data used to build the ssds including the original and rescaled noecs can be found in table s4 while the maximum ingestible sizes of mp used for each species to perform the data alignment can be found in table s5 two separate ssds were constructed with the rescaled noecs in mps m3 that correspond to the effect mechanisms of food dilution using ingested particle volume as erm and tissue translocation using particle surface area as erm for the construction of the ssds the geometric mean was calculated for those species with more than one toxicity value corresponding to different studies test materials or endpoints assessed the ssds were constructed based on a log normal distribution using the ssdtools package in rstudio version 4 1 3 thorley and schwarz 2018 the hc5 values and their 95 ci were calculated using parametric bootstrapping based on 1000 bootstrap iterations finally to characterize the ecological risks of mps the rescaled 1 5000 µm mp exposure concentrations in the amazon river and its tributaries and in the urban areas were plotted as two separate cumulative frequency distributions together with the calculated hc5 values and their 95 cis samples with concentrations within the 95 ci were expected to have a high probability to result in ecotoxicological effects additionally when the hc5 was exceeded the potentially affected fraction paf of species was calculated with the ssd parameters the ssd and cumulative frequency distribution graphs were made with ggplot2 in rstudio version 4 1 3 wickham 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 microplastic exposure mps were found in all water samples analysed in this study the concentrations in the amazon river ranged from 8 to 39 mps m3 which corresponds to 0 003 to 0 67 mg m3 fig 2 the concentrations in the tapajós river one of the tributaries were similar to the amazon river ones in terms of number of particles 11 16 mps m3 and slightly higher in terms of mass 0 53 1 9 mg m3 the mp concentrations in the negro river ranged from 5 to 152 mps m3 0 007 0 29 mg m3 with the lowest values being found in the samples taken in the anavilhanas national park n1 and n2 or a few km downstream n3 and the highest values being found in the dilution area of manaus n4 and n5 the mp concentrations in the tocantins river were 50 126 mps m3 0 31 0 33 mg m3 comparison of such results with other studies reporting mp concentrations in surface waters is hampered by the different sampling methods and size ranges evaluated in different studies dos santos queiroz et al 2022 sampled mps in the amazon continental shelf by filtering water collected with aluminum buckets over a 64 µm mesh during the rainy and dry periods the concentrations reported by their study are notably higher 323 5733 mps m3 than the ones reported here for nearly the same period of the year however in their study about 40 of the recorded particles were cellulose based fibres which were excluded from our study also their sampling methods could be more suitable to collect free floating particles than ours when focusing on other studies that used water filtration methods and evaluated a similar size range as the one used here i e 55 5000 µm it can be concluded that mp exposure levels in the amazon river and its tributaries fall within those reported in the seine river in france 3 108 mps m3 dris et al 2015 or the tagus river basin in spain 1 227 mps m3 schell et al 2021 considering the characteristic of the amazon catchment the very large dilution factor and the relatively low population inhabiting the region it is of particular concern that concentrations observed in the amazon river already fall in the same range of those found in some of the most impacted rivers of europe the mp concentrations in the streams crossing the main urban areas were in general between one to three orders of magnitude larger than those found in the amazon river fig 2 the largest concentrations were found in the streams of manaus 178 74 550 mps m3 or 0 45 271 mg m3 followed by belém 167 3095 mps m3 or 0 12 1 79 mg m3 excluding b2 which was highly influenced by the tides at sampling and macapá 59 248 mps m3 or 0 11 0 91 mg m3 however the mp concentrations in the streams crossing the city of santarém were found to be lower than in the other cities 23 71 mps m3 0 03 0 13 mg m3 overall the mp concentrations in the urban streams of manaus belém and macapá were similar to those reported in highly contaminated rivers such as the yangtze river in china 800 3089 mps m3 he et al 2021 while some samples taken during heavy precipitation events in manaus ms2 and ms3 resemble contamination levels found in untreated urban wastewaters schell et al 2020 the lower pollution status of the streams nearby santarém as compared to the other brazilian cities included here has been documented in previous studies rico et al 2021 2022 and has been attributed to the lower population density and the higher dilution rate of its urban wastewaters mp contamination was dominated by fibres 51 of the total number of particles followed by fragments 42 and films 6 while the presence of other particle types i e glitter beads was negligible fig 3 a based on the longest axis the most abundant size category was 300 1000 µm 47 followed by 100 300 µm 32 1000 5000 µm 18 and 55 100 µm 3 fig 3b the dominance of the 300 1000 µm size category was largely influenced by the occurrence of fibres which had a mean length of 923 µm sd 690 µm excluding fibres the most abundant size range was 100 300 µm 61 followed by 300 1000 µm 30 55 100 µm 6 and 1000 5000 µm 3 overall we could not identify a clear pattern regarding differences in mp shapes between sample groups i e urban streams vs large rivers which suggests that mp pollution in the amazon and its main tributaries is most likely of urban origin similar size ranges and shapes have been reported in scientific reviews analysing mp monitoring results from global rivers koelmans et al 2019 li et al 2020 wang et al 2021 although more accurate comparisons would require the derivation of continuous probability distributions for these parameters see kooi and koelmans 2019 also similar mp types have been documented at the amazon continental shelf dos santos queiroz 2022 except for the absence of foams which may be related to the fact that these particles are typically floating and may have escaped from the water pumping systems used in our study zheng et al 2021 in total we identified 32 different polymers through ftir analysis table s3 polyester was the most abundant polymer 32 followed by polypropylene 18 polystyrene 10 polyethylene 9 and alkyd varnish 9 fig 4 plastic particles were classified into 16 different colours most of the identified mps were blue 30 red 24 green 13 or black 12 figure s1 the polymer distribution found in this study slightly deviates from those reported in other studies referring to rivers in other locations of the world which report polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene as the most abundant particles koelmans et al 2019 schell et al 2020 wang et al 2021 here polyester fibres were the most abundant ones in all sample groups polyester fibres are produced by the breakdown of synthetic textiles during laundry and are abundant in untreated wastewaters schell et al 2021 these particles are usually well retained during wastewater treatment schell et al 2021 however the lack of wastewater treatment plant facilities in the amazonian region is likely the reason for their high occurrence 3 2 ecological risk assessment as the amount of studies assessing mps on amazonian species is very limited wen et al 2018 risk calculations were performed using available chronic toxicity data for non native species assuming that the distribution of biological traits affecting mp uptake and sensitivity are comparable between amazonian freshwater species and their marine and temperate counterparts the ssds used in our study contained chronic noecs for 17 freshwater and marine species belonging to 11 taxonomic groups and were dominated by algae and invertebrates the two calculated ssds show differences in relative sensitivity among aquatic species depending on the erm considered for example the two most sensitive taxa in the ssd using volume as erm were two species of green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii scenedesmus amatus while the most sensitive taxa considering area were a fish orizyias melastigma and a snail crepidula onyx fig 5 however the distribution parameters and the hc5 value derived from these two chronic ssds which can be used as threshold concentrations for preventing effects on aquatic species assemblages were relatively similar the hc5 for the chronic ssd considering volume as erm was 1 58 107 mps m3 95 ci 1 24 106 3 96 108 while the same value for the chronic ssd considering area as erm was 1 84 107 mps m3 95 ci 1 53 106 4 28 108 the calculated threshold values are in line with the hc5 provided by burns and boxall 2018 6 4 107 mps m3 but are at least one order of magnitude higher than the hc5 values provided by besseling et al 2019 1 0 106 mps m3 and everaert et al 2020 6 1 105 mps m3 however none of these threshold values were derived by making use of the re scaling methods applied here the hc5 value provided by koelmans et al 2020 using the same re scaling method for volume as erm resulted in 7 5 104 mps m3 which is three orders of magnitude lower than the one calculated here the difference between the hc5 value provided by koelmans et al 2020 and ours is most likely related to the source data used while koelmans et al 2020 used extrapolated noecs estimated with the acute to chronic and the ec50 to noec assessment factors provided by echa 2008 which have not been validated for mps we only used experimental noecs from studies showing statistically significant effects and derived under chronic exposure conditions the alignment of the measured mp exposure concentrations to the 1 5000 µm range based on koelmans et al 2020 and kooi et al 2021 suggests that the concentration of mps in the amazon river and its main tributaries will range between 6 0 103 and 1 8 105 mps m3 while in the monitored urban streams this concentration will range between 1 7 105 and 5 7 108 mps m3 the comparison of the data aligned mp concentrations in the amazon river and main tributaries with the calculated hc5 values shows that mp exposure is far from posing an ecotoxicological risk for aquatic organisms with a difference of 2 orders of magnitude between the highest measured concentration and the calculated hc5 values fig 6 however mp concentrations in 20 of the samples 4 out of 20 taken near urban areas exceeded the calculated hc5 values for volume and area for volume 65 of the samples 13 out of 20 fell within the hc5 95 ci and one sample 5 was above the upper ci for area 60 of the samples 12 out of 20 fell within the 95 ci of the calculated hc5 fig 6 the four samples that exceeded the hc5 for volume and area and therefore were considered to pose ecological risks were obtained from the most populated areas three in manaus ms2 ms3 ms1 and one in belem b3 the sample that exceeded the upper ci interval was collected in manaus ms2 the corresponding paf of species for these samples ranged between 7 and 23 for food dilution as effect mechanism and 7 and 22 for tissue translocation the results of this study show that small rivers and streams located near to the main urban areas of the amazon have mp concentrations that are high enough to exert ecotoxicological effects on aquatic organisms due to food dilution and or translocation across biological membranes although the fraction of species potentially affected was not very high i e 7 23 the results of this study confirm the outcomes of previous studies that point at urban areas with limited sewage collection and treatment facilities as hotspots for mp contamination besseling et al 2019 koelmans et al 2020 schell et al 2022 in the future higher demographic pressure over these ecosystems is expected to increase côrtes et al 2020 potentially increasing mp emissions and risks therefore the protection of aquatic biodiversity in the surroundings of urban areas of the amazon would benefit from the construction of sewage treatment facilities that retain part of the mps emitted in parallel social awareness to reduce single use

15061,microplastics mps are one of the most widespread contaminants worldwide yet their risks for freshwater ecosystems have seldom been investigated in this study we performed a large monitoring campaign to assess the presence and risks of mps in amazonian freshwater ecosystems we investigated mp pollution in 40 samples collected along 1500 km in the brazilian amazon including the amazon river three major tributaries and several streams next to the most important urban areas mps in the 55 5000 µm size range were characterized size shape color by microscopy and identified polymer composition by infrared spectroscopy ecotoxicological risks were assessed using chronic species sensitivity distributions for effects triggered by food dilution and tissue translocation using data alignment methods that correct for polydispersity of environmental mps and bioaccessibility this study shows that mps are ubiquitous contaminants in amazonian freshwater ecosystems with measured concentrations 55 5000 µm ranging between 5 and 152 mps m3 in the amazon river and its main tributaries and between 23 and 74 550 mps m3 in urban streams the calculated hazardous concentration for the 5 of species hc5 derived from the ssds for the entire mp range 1 5000 µm were 1 6 107 mps m3 95 ci 1 2 106 4 0 108 for food dilution and 1 8 107 mps m3 95 ci 1 5 106 4 3 108 for translocation rescaled exposure concentrations 1 5000 µm in the amazon river and tributaries ranged between 6 0 103 and 1 8 105 mps m3 and were significantly lower than the calculated hc5 values rescaled concentrations in urban streams ranged between 1 7 105 and 5 7 108 mps m3 and exceeded both calculated hc5 values in 20 of the locations this study shows that ecological impacts by mp contamination are not likely to happen in the amazon river and its major tributaries however risks for freshwater organisms may be expected in near densely populated areas such as the cities of manaus or belem which have limited wastewater treatment facilities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics amazon river urban pollution species sensitivity distributions ecological risk assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction environmental pollution from plastic has been considered a global threat due to its persistence and potential impacts on a wide range of living organisms including humans rochman et al 2013 yang et al 2022 plastic materials break down into smaller particles microplastics mps 1 5000 µm in length gesamp 2019 which can travel long distances and have been detected in a wide range of environmental compartments including air water and soil li et al 2018 gonzález pleiter et al 2021 jacques and prosser 2021 urban wastewater is considered one of the major pathways for mps into aquatic ecosystems as it has been found to contain up to 10 000 mps l most of them being fibres and fragments schell et al 2020 ngo et al 2019 in general over 90 of mps found in wastewater are retained by wastewater treatment plants schell et al 2020 iyare et al 2020 however only 52 of the global sewage is treated 74 in high income countries and 4 2 in developing countries jones et al 2021 this suggests that untreated wastewaters can be a major source of mps in areas with limited or unexisting access to sewage treatment facilities the amazon river is the largest river in the world it discharges more than 5 1012 m3 year into the atlantic coast representing about 17 of the total volume of freshwater entering the global ocean callède et al 2010 currently about 30 million people are living in the amazon basin wwf 2020 most of whom live in large cities that are undergoing continuous expansion côrtes et al 2020 it is estimated that only 8 12 of the population that live in the urban areas of the brazilian amazon have access to basic sanitation systems ana 2020 therefore the majority of urban wastewaters as well as urban runoff waters are discharged untreated into the river constituting a major pathway for mps moreover large amounts of plastic are dumped on the banks of the amazon river lucas solis et al 2021 which can break down due to erosion and microbial processes contributing to an in increase in mp exposure levels recent studies have reported the occurrence of mps in environmental samples collected in the amazon basin for example santos queiroz et al 2022 reported high mp exposure levels in water samples collected along the amazon continental shelf 320 13 000 mps m3 while gerolin et al 2020 denoted an increase in mp concentrations in sediment samples collected downstream of the urban area of manaus brazil moreover some studies have reported the occurrence of mps in the digestive tract of fish andrade et al 2019 pegado et al 2018 2021 as well as in anemones morais et al 2020 collected from the amazon river estuary suggesting that the amazon river is an important entry route for mps into the atlantic ocean in fact the study by lebreton et al 2017 suggested that the amazon river is one of the world s top ten polluting rivers in terms of plastic emissions into the ocean this study by lebreton et al 2017 was based on indirect extrapolations from a limited number of monitoring studies mostly conducted in europe and data on mismanaged plastic waste generation and overlooked regional social and environmental dynamics meijer et al 2021 therefore further investigations of mp pollution in the amazon are needed mps can affect a wide range of aquatic organisms through different effect mechanisms including blockage of the digestive tract food dilution sorption to the skin entanglement shading or even by translocation to the inner parts of the body and organs de sá et al 2018 schell et al 2022 few studies have attempted to assess the risks posed by mp pollution to aquatic organisms by comparing measured exposure concentrations with species sensitivity distributions ssds built with laboratory toxicity data burns and boxall 2018 besseling et al 2019 everaert et al 2020 however many of these comparisons are substantially flawed since they compare exposure and effect data from studies that target different mp size ranges furthermore they compare the results of toxicity studies that are usually performed with monodisperse particle distributions i e one single polymer type with a given shape size with the polydisperse particle distributions obtained from field exposure assessments recently koelmans et al 2020 and kooi et al 2021 have proposed a methodology to re scale exposure and effect data towards the full mp size range 1 5000 µm so that effect threshold concentrations and risk calculations can be aligned for the polydisperse distribution of environmental mps despite the fact that the methods have become accessible to a wide audience through the tomex web application thornton hampton et al 2022 only a limited number of studies have implemented this methodology koelmans et al 2020 coffin et al 2022 redondo hasselerharm et al 2023 koelmans et al 2020 compared a global distribution of mp samples taken in the water column of freshwater ecosystems with the hc5 hazardous concentration for 5 of species which is usually considered as threshold concentration for unacceptable ecological effects and concluded that risks may be expected at a reduced number of locations 1 5 which were close to anthropogenic pollution sources in a similar study redondo hasselerharm et al 2023 concluded that mp risks to freshwater benthic organisms are likely to occur in some hotspot areas and provided threshold concentrations for the risk assessment of mps in the sediment compartment to date the risks of mp contamination for amazonian freshwater ecosystems have not been evaluated the amazon constitutes one of the most important biodiversity biomes containing about 3500 species of fish junk et al 2007 former investigations on the impacts of urban wastewater into amazonian freshwater ecosystems have revealed unaceptable risks posed by pharmaceuticals and pesticides in rivers and streams close to the major urban areas rico et al 2021 2022 and have indicated the presence of large amounts of plastic debris accumulated in the shoreline of these urban areas therefore it is expected that mps constitute yet another threat for amazonian freshwater biodiversity for which specific risk assessment and management are needed therefore the main objectives of this study were to characterize mp exposure in several areas of the amazon river with different levels of anthropogenic impact and to assess mp risks for amazonian freshwater ecosystems for this we characterized mp exposure in water samples collected along a longitudinal gradient of over 1500 km including the amazon river and its main tributaries as well as small rivers and streams receiving wastewater from four important cities of the brazilian amazon mp risks for freshwater biodiversity at the catchment scale were calculated on the basis of ssds for effects triggered by food dilution and tissue translocation using data alignment methods to correct for the polydispersity and bioaccessibility of mps in environmental samples 2 material and methods 2 1 microplastic sampling our study included 40 water samples taken during november december of 2019 end of the dry season in the amazon river n 11 in three major tributaries negro tapajós tocantins n 9 and in the urban streams of manaus macapá santarém and belém n 20 fig 1 two of the samples in the negro river were taken in the anavilhanas national park n1 and n2 and two samples in the dilution area of manaus n4 and n5 the sampling locations in macapá as well as in the tocantins river and belém were subject to some tidal effects in these locations the sampling was preferably done during the low tide moments however in one sample taken in belém b2 we observed clear mixing of stream waters with up stream tidal currents sampling in the amazon river and in the tributaries was performed from small boats that remained in the same location as long as possible or from large passenger boats that were in continuous movement fig 1 sampling in urban areas was predominantly performed from bridges or small boats a given amount of water was pumped from the middle of the river section approximate water depth 0 5 1 m and filtered over a plankton net 55 µm after filtration the samples were stored in glass containers 0 5 l and filtered over a filter paper gf a ø 47 mm pore size 0 7 µm then the filter was folded and introduced into aluminum envelopes until further analysis the amount of sampled water was decided based on the expected level of anthropogenic impact in the sampling location and ranged between 0 3 4 6 m3 see table s1 2 2 microplastic extraction sample processing depended on the material observed on the filters if the filter content was mainly composed of organic matter the material was rinsed into erlenmeyer flasks with filtered reverse osmosis ro water the content of the erlenmeyer flasks was then left to settle overnight and the overlying water was filtered onto filter paper whatman gf a ø 47 mm pore size 0 7 µm the sedimented material was passed through a 53 µm stainless steel sieve to eliminate fine material mainly clay below the study s assessed mp sizes the material retained in the sieve was transferred to erlenmeyer flasks and treated to remove organic matter with h2o2 30 v v at 40 c on a shaker 100 rpm until the reaction stopped this was followed by two density separations using a sodium iodide solution density 1 8 g ml after each density separation the overlaying material was filtered onto separate filter papers and retained for analysis samples containing a large amount of sandy sediment were first dried at 45 c each sample was then transferred into clean pre rinsed polyethylene tubes and subjected to two density separations using a nai solution density 1 8 g ml the first density separation extract of each sample contained a large amount of organic material for this reason the extract was filtered through a 53 µm stainless steel sieve and followed by organic matter removal as described above the overlaying material was filtered onto separate filter papers the content remaining after organic matter removal and the extract from the second density separation were each filtered onto separate filters gf a ø 47 mm pore size 0 7 µm and retained for analysis 2 3 microplastic analysis all filters were first analysed visually for mps using a nikon smz 745t stereomicroscope at 20 50x magnification when the filters were too loaded with mps after a first visual check only a small fraction of the filter 1 8 or 1 4 was analysed and extrapolated to the rest of the filter this subsampling was performed by taking several segments from the filter paper to ensure that subsamples were as representative of the distribution of mps on the original filter as possible suspected mp particles were photographed using an infinity 1 camera the long and the short axis of each mp were measured using the infinity analyze v 6 5 4 software package following calibration using a measurement standard for a proportion of the particles c a 40 the particle depth was estimated with the microscope for the remaining particles the depth was calculated based on the ratio between the short axis and the estimated depth of the particles of the same shape for which the depth was estimated in the microscope each particle was classified according to shape into beads fibres fragments films or glitter particles some fibres formed clumps that could not be separated and were therefore reported as such as the dataset contained a huge number of mps 12 000 particles were sized and classified according to their shape only a proportion 12 of these suspected mp particles could be analysed for their polymer composition using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir particles were characterized using a perkin elmer spotlight 400 µftir in transmission mode the particles were first compressed using a diamond compression cell dc 3 perkin elmer before being loaded onto the machine to improve spectral quality four co scans were taken at a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 for each particle measurement a new background scan was made each time the diamond compression cell was loaded onto the machine approximately every 1 10 particles each spectrum was compared to a series of commercial perkinelmer polymer library agilent polymer library open source primpke et al 2018 and in house libraries a minimum hit quality index hqi of 70 was used as a threshold to accept a match for polymer identification in addition the reliability of each match was assessed by manually checking the characteristic peaks of each spectrum after evaluation the particles that did not comply with the above criteria 18 were excluded from the analysis 2 4 quality assurance quality control except for the pumping device all materials used in the field were non plastic and had been prewashed with distilled water furthermore organic cotton clothing was used during sampling all collected samples were transported from brazil to norway in aluminum foil envelopes then they were processed and analysed at the microplastic laboratory of the norwegian institute for water research niva in a positive pressure room with hepa filtered class h13 air input the contamination reduction measures implemented in this laboratory included the use of natural fiber clothing and lab coats removal of loose fibres using a lint roller upon entry to the laboratory and regular removal of dust from all laboratory areas furthermore all processing steps in which samples were exposed to the laboratory environment e g during rinsing of filters were done in a laminar flow cabinet all laboratory water or solutions used in the sample processing were pre filtered 0 22 μm for reverse osmosis water 1 2 μm for nai and h2o2 immediately before use glass containers and polyethylene tubes used during sample processing were rinsed three times with filtered reverse osmosis water before use three blanks were included with each set of samples that was processed simultaneously these blanks represent combined procedural container and solution blanks and were treated identically to the field samples all suspected mps observed in these blanks were visually and chemically characterized in the same way as the field samples most of the particles identified in the blanks were non plastic table s2 so no further corrections to the field samples were applied the method used here has been previously validated using spiked samples for a range of mp particle types the extraction efficiencies and recovery rates are provided in hurley et al 2018 and crossman et al 2020 2 5 microplastic mass estimation and exposure concentrations the mass of the mps was determined based on the volume of the measured particles and the density of the identified polymers particle volume was calculated based on the assigned morphology and the size of the analysed axes using the following approach beads were treated as spheres fibres as cylinders and films fragments and glitter as ellipsoids information on polymer densities is shown in table s3 the mass of the mps for which the polymer composition was not determined with ftir was assigned to 1 g cm 3 for beads 1 3 g cm 3 for fibres 1 1 g cm 3 for films and fragments and 1 4 g cm 3 for glitter based on the mean density of the mps with identified polymer type in the current dataset mps were grouped into four size classes according to their longest measured axis 55 150 μm 150 300 μm 300 1000 μm and 1000 5000 μm the particles with the longest axis beyond the 55 5000 μm range were excluded from the analysis microplastic exposure concentrations in the different samples were estimated based on the number of particles mps l and the mass of the mp particles mg l by dividing the mp particles or the total mass by the water volume passed over the sampling nets 2 6 ecological risk assessment to assess mp risks for aquatic organisms we first rescaled the measured exposure concentration data 55 5000 µm to the standard mp size range 1 5000 µm following the approach described by koelmans et al 2020 the approach is based on the application of a correction factor cf to the measured particle concentration c f 5000 1 a 1 1 a x 2 1 a x 1 1 a where x1 and x2 are the minimum 55 µm and maximum 5000 µm values of the targeted size range in the current study the α is the exponent of the power law distribution fitted to the measured mp concentrations based on particle size i e length of the longest axis the fitting of the power law distribution was done separately for the samples taken in the amazon river and tributaries and those taken in urban areas as it was expected they would show potential differences related to major mp sources environmental fate or fragmentation processes in both cases the fitting of the power law distribution was successfully done the fitting was done according to the maximum likelihood estimation mle method described in kooi et al 2021 based on 100 bootstraps and using the powerlaw package gillespie 2014 the α value for the amazon river and tributaries was 2 77 while the α value for the samples taken in urban streams was 3 23 based on these α values the calculated cfs for the amazon river and tributaries and for the urban areas were 1202 and 7604 respectively for the characterization of the ecotoxicological effects of mps in the aquatic environment ssds were constructed and the hc5 and their 95 confidence intervals cis were calculated for this purpose a literature search was conducted on publications until september 2022 using the web of science wos and proquest databases to obtain toxicity data for aquatic organisms exposed to mps via water the following strings were used effect or impact or toxicity and microplastic s or plastic particle or fiber or fragment or film and freshwater or marine or aquatic and species or organism or invertebrate or crustacean or fish from the studies collected we selected chronic toxicity data 3 days for phytoplankton 7 days for zooplankton 21 days for macrophytes and fish 28 days for benthic invertebrates for endpoints linked to effects at the individual level e g survival growth reproduction etc following rico et al 2019 the no observed effect concentration noec was used as the species effect threshold for the construction of the ssds and only those studies in which a noec and a lowest observed effect concentration loec could be obtained were included in the analysis excluding studies where no statistically significant effects were found and studies reporting non dose dependent effects when the noec was given in mg l only and the information provided in the study was insufficient to calculate the equivalent noec in mps m3 it was converted to mps m3 using the method described by leusch and ziajahromi 2021 then the noecs for animal species were aligned to the environmentally relevant and bioaccessible effective concentration following the calculations described in redondo hasselerharm et al 2023 these included data transformations for mps m3 for ingested particle volume and surface area as ecologically relevant metrics erms which correspond to the effect mechanisms of food dilution and tissue translocation respectively redondo hasselerharm et al 2023 for food dilution when the length of the largest mp axis was larger than the mouth opening of the test organism it was considered biologically unavailable for tissue translocation the particles with a length above the cut off value of 83 µm proposed by mehinto et al 2022 were considered biologically unavailable except for the species with a mouth opening size smaller than 83 µm for which the mouth opening size determined bioaccessibility following koelmans et al 2020 and redondo hasselerharm et al 2023 no alignments were applied to the microalgae data included in the ssds this is because effect mechanisms for algae and macrophytes are still unclear a summary of the characteristics of the toxicity data used to build the ssds including the original and rescaled noecs can be found in table s4 while the maximum ingestible sizes of mp used for each species to perform the data alignment can be found in table s5 two separate ssds were constructed with the rescaled noecs in mps m3 that correspond to the effect mechanisms of food dilution using ingested particle volume as erm and tissue translocation using particle surface area as erm for the construction of the ssds the geometric mean was calculated for those species with more than one toxicity value corresponding to different studies test materials or endpoints assessed the ssds were constructed based on a log normal distribution using the ssdtools package in rstudio version 4 1 3 thorley and schwarz 2018 the hc5 values and their 95 ci were calculated using parametric bootstrapping based on 1000 bootstrap iterations finally to characterize the ecological risks of mps the rescaled 1 5000 µm mp exposure concentrations in the amazon river and its tributaries and in the urban areas were plotted as two separate cumulative frequency distributions together with the calculated hc5 values and their 95 cis samples with concentrations within the 95 ci were expected to have a high probability to result in ecotoxicological effects additionally when the hc5 was exceeded the potentially affected fraction paf of species was calculated with the ssd parameters the ssd and cumulative frequency distribution graphs were made with ggplot2 in rstudio version 4 1 3 wickham 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 microplastic exposure mps were found in all water samples analysed in this study the concentrations in the amazon river ranged from 8 to 39 mps m3 which corresponds to 0 003 to 0 67 mg m3 fig 2 the concentrations in the tapajós river one of the tributaries were similar to the amazon river ones in terms of number of particles 11 16 mps m3 and slightly higher in terms of mass 0 53 1 9 mg m3 the mp concentrations in the negro river ranged from 5 to 152 mps m3 0 007 0 29 mg m3 with the lowest values being found in the samples taken in the anavilhanas national park n1 and n2 or a few km downstream n3 and the highest values being found in the dilution area of manaus n4 and n5 the mp concentrations in the tocantins river were 50 126 mps m3 0 31 0 33 mg m3 comparison of such results with other studies reporting mp concentrations in surface waters is hampered by the different sampling methods and size ranges evaluated in different studies dos santos queiroz et al 2022 sampled mps in the amazon continental shelf by filtering water collected with aluminum buckets over a 64 µm mesh during the rainy and dry periods the concentrations reported by their study are notably higher 323 5733 mps m3 than the ones reported here for nearly the same period of the year however in their study about 40 of the recorded particles were cellulose based fibres which were excluded from our study also their sampling methods could be more suitable to collect free floating particles than ours when focusing on other studies that used water filtration methods and evaluated a similar size range as the one used here i e 55 5000 µm it can be concluded that mp exposure levels in the amazon river and its tributaries fall within those reported in the seine river in france 3 108 mps m3 dris et al 2015 or the tagus river basin in spain 1 227 mps m3 schell et al 2021 considering the characteristic of the amazon catchment the very large dilution factor and the relatively low population inhabiting the region it is of particular concern that concentrations observed in the amazon river already fall in the same range of those found in some of the most impacted rivers of europe the mp concentrations in the streams crossing the main urban areas were in general between one to three orders of magnitude larger than those found in the amazon river fig 2 the largest concentrations were found in the streams of manaus 178 74 550 mps m3 or 0 45 271 mg m3 followed by belém 167 3095 mps m3 or 0 12 1 79 mg m3 excluding b2 which was highly influenced by the tides at sampling and macapá 59 248 mps m3 or 0 11 0 91 mg m3 however the mp concentrations in the streams crossing the city of santarém were found to be lower than in the other cities 23 71 mps m3 0 03 0 13 mg m3 overall the mp concentrations in the urban streams of manaus belém and macapá were similar to those reported in highly contaminated rivers such as the yangtze river in china 800 3089 mps m3 he et al 2021 while some samples taken during heavy precipitation events in manaus ms2 and ms3 resemble contamination levels found in untreated urban wastewaters schell et al 2020 the lower pollution status of the streams nearby santarém as compared to the other brazilian cities included here has been documented in previous studies rico et al 2021 2022 and has been attributed to the lower population density and the higher dilution rate of its urban wastewaters mp contamination was dominated by fibres 51 of the total number of particles followed by fragments 42 and films 6 while the presence of other particle types i e glitter beads was negligible fig 3 a based on the longest axis the most abundant size category was 300 1000 µm 47 followed by 100 300 µm 32 1000 5000 µm 18 and 55 100 µm 3 fig 3b the dominance of the 300 1000 µm size category was largely influenced by the occurrence of fibres which had a mean length of 923 µm sd 690 µm excluding fibres the most abundant size range was 100 300 µm 61 followed by 300 1000 µm 30 55 100 µm 6 and 1000 5000 µm 3 overall we could not identify a clear pattern regarding differences in mp shapes between sample groups i e urban streams vs large rivers which suggests that mp pollution in the amazon and its main tributaries is most likely of urban origin similar size ranges and shapes have been reported in scientific reviews analysing mp monitoring results from global rivers koelmans et al 2019 li et al 2020 wang et al 2021 although more accurate comparisons would require the derivation of continuous probability distributions for these parameters see kooi and koelmans 2019 also similar mp types have been documented at the amazon continental shelf dos santos queiroz 2022 except for the absence of foams which may be related to the fact that these particles are typically floating and may have escaped from the water pumping systems used in our study zheng et al 2021 in total we identified 32 different polymers through ftir analysis table s3 polyester was the most abundant polymer 32 followed by polypropylene 18 polystyrene 10 polyethylene 9 and alkyd varnish 9 fig 4 plastic particles were classified into 16 different colours most of the identified mps were blue 30 red 24 green 13 or black 12 figure s1 the polymer distribution found in this study slightly deviates from those reported in other studies referring to rivers in other locations of the world which report polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene as the most abundant particles koelmans et al 2019 schell et al 2020 wang et al 2021 here polyester fibres were the most abundant ones in all sample groups polyester fibres are produced by the breakdown of synthetic textiles during laundry and are abundant in untreated wastewaters schell et al 2021 these particles are usually well retained during wastewater treatment schell et al 2021 however the lack of wastewater treatment plant facilities in the amazonian region is likely the reason for their high occurrence 3 2 ecological risk assessment as the amount of studies assessing mps on amazonian species is very limited wen et al 2018 risk calculations were performed using available chronic toxicity data for non native species assuming that the distribution of biological traits affecting mp uptake and sensitivity are comparable between amazonian freshwater species and their marine and temperate counterparts the ssds used in our study contained chronic noecs for 17 freshwater and marine species belonging to 11 taxonomic groups and were dominated by algae and invertebrates the two calculated ssds show differences in relative sensitivity among aquatic species depending on the erm considered for example the two most sensitive taxa in the ssd using volume as erm were two species of green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii scenedesmus amatus while the most sensitive taxa considering area were a fish orizyias melastigma and a snail crepidula onyx fig 5 however the distribution parameters and the hc5 value derived from these two chronic ssds which can be used as threshold concentrations for preventing effects on aquatic species assemblages were relatively similar the hc5 for the chronic ssd considering volume as erm was 1 58 107 mps m3 95 ci 1 24 106 3 96 108 while the same value for the chronic ssd considering area as erm was 1 84 107 mps m3 95 ci 1 53 106 4 28 108 the calculated threshold values are in line with the hc5 provided by burns and boxall 2018 6 4 107 mps m3 but are at least one order of magnitude higher than the hc5 values provided by besseling et al 2019 1 0 106 mps m3 and everaert et al 2020 6 1 105 mps m3 however none of these threshold values were derived by making use of the re scaling methods applied here the hc5 value provided by koelmans et al 2020 using the same re scaling method for volume as erm resulted in 7 5 104 mps m3 which is three orders of magnitude lower than the one calculated here the difference between the hc5 value provided by koelmans et al 2020 and ours is most likely related to the source data used while koelmans et al 2020 used extrapolated noecs estimated with the acute to chronic and the ec50 to noec assessment factors provided by echa 2008 which have not been validated for mps we only used experimental noecs from studies showing statistically significant effects and derived under chronic exposure conditions the alignment of the measured mp exposure concentrations to the 1 5000 µm range based on koelmans et al 2020 and kooi et al 2021 suggests that the concentration of mps in the amazon river and its main tributaries will range between 6 0 103 and 1 8 105 mps m3 while in the monitored urban streams this concentration will range between 1 7 105 and 5 7 108 mps m3 the comparison of the data aligned mp concentrations in the amazon river and main tributaries with the calculated hc5 values shows that mp exposure is far from posing an ecotoxicological risk for aquatic organisms with a difference of 2 orders of magnitude between the highest measured concentration and the calculated hc5 values fig 6 however mp concentrations in 20 of the samples 4 out of 20 taken near urban areas exceeded the calculated hc5 values for volume and area for volume 65 of the samples 13 out of 20 fell within the hc5 95 ci and one sample 5 was above the upper ci for area 60 of the samples 12 out of 20 fell within the 95 ci of the calculated hc5 fig 6 the four samples that exceeded the hc5 for volume and area and therefore were considered to pose ecological risks were obtained from the most populated areas three in manaus ms2 ms3 ms1 and one in belem b3 the sample that exceeded the upper ci interval was collected in manaus ms2 the corresponding paf of species for these samples ranged between 7 and 23 for food dilution as effect mechanism and 7 and 22 for tissue translocation the results of this study show that small rivers and streams located near to the main urban areas of the amazon have mp concentrations that are high enough to exert ecotoxicological effects on aquatic organisms due to food dilution and or translocation across biological membranes although the fraction of species potentially affected was not very high i e 7 23 the results of this study confirm the outcomes of previous studies that point at urban areas with limited sewage collection and treatment facilities as hotspots for mp contamination besseling et al 2019 koelmans et al 2020 schell et al 2022 in the future higher demographic pressure over these ecosystems is expected to increase côrtes et al 2020 potentially increasing mp emissions and risks therefore the protection of aquatic biodiversity in the surroundings of urban areas of the amazon would benefit from the construction of sewage treatment facilities that retain part of the mps emitted in parallel social awareness to reduce single use

15062,during harmful algal blooms habs permanganate may be used as a preoxidant to improve drinking water quality by removing algal cells and degrading algal toxins however permanganate also lyses algal cells releasing intracellular algal organic matter aom aom further reacts with permanganate to alter the abundance of disinfection byproduct dbp precursors which in turn affects dbp formation during disinfection in this study we evaluated the impacts of preoxidation by permanganate applied at commonly used doses i e 1 5 mg l on dbp generation during chlorination and chloramination of aom we found that permanganate preoxidation increased trichloronitromethane tcnm formation by up to 3 fold and decreased dichloroacetonitrile dcan formation by up to 40 during chlorination indicating that permanganate oxidized organic amines in aom to organic nitro compounds rather than organic nitrile compounds to test this proposed mechanism we demonstrated that permanganate oxidized organic amines in known dbp precursors i e tyrosine tryptophan to favor the production of tcnm over dcan during chlorination compared to the decreased formation of dcan during chlorination permanganate increased dcan formation by 30 50 during chloramination of aom this difference likely arose from monochloramine s ability to react with non nitrogenous precursors e g organic aldehydes that formed during permanganate preoxidation of aom to generate nitrogen containing intermediates that go on to form dcan our results also showed that permanganate preoxidation favored the formation of dichlorobromomethane dcbm over trichloromethane tcm during chlorination and chloramination the increased formation of dbps especially nitrogenous dbps that are more toxic than carbonaceous dbps may increase the overall toxicity in finished drinking water when permanganate preoxidation is implemented graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords harmful algal blooms algal organic matter

et al 2020 perez benito 2009 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 permanganate has also been investigated for its impact on the formation of toxic disinfection byproducts dbps during subsequent disinfection for example prior studies reported that permanganate decreased the formation of trihalomethanes thms by 10 20 he and ren 2022 hidayah and yeh 2018 hu et al 2018 rougé et al 2020a 2020b and haloacetonitriles hans by 50 70 hu et al 2018 rougé et al 2020a 2020b during subsequent chlorination permanganate may also be used as a preoxidant during harmful algal blooms habs which threaten drinking water quality worldwide by causing taste and odor problems and producing toxins hallegraeff et al 2021a 2021b hudnell 2010 roberts et al 2020 during habs permanganate preoxidation has been applied to induce aggregation of algal cells for removal by coagulation flocculation chen and yeh 2005 naceradska et al 2017 piezer et al 2021 qi et al 2021 xie et al 2016 lyse cells to prevent

algal cell lysis caused by permanganate preoxidation also leads to the release of intracellular algal organic matter aom that is a precursor of dbps dong et al 2021 fang et al 2010a 2010b to date information regarding the impact of permanganate preoxidation on dbp formation during disinfection of intracellular aom remains limited when treating algal cell suspensions one study showed that permanganate decreased the abundance of trichloromethane tcm precursors by up to 40 from extracellular aom shi et al 2019 while another study found that permanganate preoxidation did not alter dbp formation during subsequent chlorination xie et al 2013 however the permanganate dosages applied in these studies were too low 2 mg l to lyse algal cells and release intracellular aom fan et al 2013 the impact of permanganate on intracellular aom from lysed cells was only investigated by one study which found that permanganate dosed at 4 mg l did not alter dbp formation e g tcm dichloroacetonitrile dcan trichloronitromethane tcnm during subsequent chlorination sheng et al 2022 however this study reported the impact of permanganate only under a single pair of preoxidant disinfectant doses sheng et al 2022 which may be insufficient to account for preoxidant effects that depend on the doses of preoxidant and disinfectant hua and reckhow 2008 rougé et al 2020a 2020b whereas preoxidants tend to decrease dbp formation from nom preoxidants other than permanganate have been found to increase the formation of dbps from aom for example preoxidation using chlorine dioxide decreased the formation of tcm by 10 and dcan by 60 during chlorination of nom yang et al 2013 but increased the formation of these dbps during chlorination of intracellular aom i e by 60 for tcm 50 for dcan sheng et al 2022 like chlorine dioxide ozone typically decreased thm formation by 20 50 during chlorination of nom jiang et al 2016 2019 rougé et al 2020b but increased thm formation by 30 70 during chlorination of aom chien et al 2018 sheng et al 2022 zhou et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 the increased formation of dbps from aom may result from specific changes made by the preoxidants to aom properties e g decreasing its molecular weight aromaticity or hydrophobicity dong et al 2021 sheng et al 2022 zhou et al 2015 in addition some preoxidants react with specific moieties from aom to generate dbps for example organic amines which are more abundant in aom than nom dong et al 2021 fang et al 2010b were oxidized by ozone to generate precursors of tcnm mccurry et al 2016 which could contribute to a greater extent of increase in the formation of tcnm by preozonation observed from aom i e 5 to 100 fold than nom i e 2 to 8 fold chien et al 2018 jiang et al 2016 2019 sheng et al 2022 zhou et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 in this study we hypothesized that permanganate preoxidation increases dbp formation during disinfection of aom in contrast to nom which was included as a control throughout the study using aom derived from cultivated microcystis aeruginosa we first tested the effects of permanganate on dbp formation during chlorination of aom and linked some of these effects to the reaction of permanganate with specific moieties in aom i e organic amines we next extended our work to investigate the impact of permanganate on dbp formation during chloramination of aom which we hypothesized would differ from chlorination due to monochloramine acting as a weaker oxidant that can also participate in unique reactions that generate new dbp precursors particularly for nitrogenous dbps fang et al 2010b pedersen et al 1999 shah and mitch 2012 finally we evaluated the impact of permanganate preoxidation on calculated toxicity associated with dbp formation szczuka et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 zeng et al 2016 in contrast to prior findings under limited conditions sheng et al 2022 our work demonstrated that permanganate preoxidation increased the formation of some dbps specifically from aom under relevant doses of permanganate and disinfectant 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals table s1 were used as received oxidant solutions were prepared in milli q water as described in text s1 we obtained aom from microcystis aeruginosa following the method described in text s2 for experiments aom was added to milli q water at a concentration of 5 mg c l which is approximately equivalent to the concentration of aom that would be released by algal cells present at 106 cells ml fang et al 2010a xie et al 2013 we obtained nom from natural water samples that were collected from the mississippi river at a location near the chain of rocks water treatment plant in st louis missouri where no hab was reported at the time of collection the water samples were filtered through 0 7 µm glass fiber filters fisher that were pre baked in an oven at 450 c for 4 h these water samples were directly used for experiments requiring nom and contained total organic carbon toc measured to be 3 mg c l water quality parameters including toc specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254nm and concentrations of inorganic ions were measured for solutions containing aom and nom as described in text s3 and are shown in table s2 all solutions containing either aom or nom were stored at 4 c 2 2 experimental procedure experiments were conducted to measure the concentrations of dbps generated during permanganate preoxidation and disinfection of aom and nom all solutions contained 5 mg c l aom or 3 mg c l nom 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 and permanganate at concentrations commonly used during preoxidation i e 1 5 mg l as potassium permanganate kmno4 dong et al 2021 piezer et al 2021 u s epa 1999 the solutions were prepared in 40 ml amber glass vials that were headspace free and reacted at room temperature in the dark for 3 d to allow sufficient time for reactions between permanganate and moieties in organic matter laszakovits et al 2022 after 3 d residual permanganate in solutions was measured to terminate the reaction a quencher was applied at 10 fold molar excess relative to permanganate concentrations in a 100 µl aliquot sodium thiosulfate was used to quench permanganate in an early experiment i e fig 1 a d but was replaced with ascorbic acid in all later experiments including fig 3a d that replicated identical experimental conditions to achieve the same results after permanganate preoxidation alone these quenched solutions were extracted into methyl tert butyl ether mtbe within 30 min as described in text s4 then dbp concentrations in the mtbe extracts were analyzed to determine the amount generated during permanganate preoxidation to a separate set of unquenched solutions after permanganate preoxidation small volumes i e 100 µl of disinfectant stock solutions were added into each vial to achieve a targeted concentration i e 15 mg l chlorine or 4 mg l monochloramine as chlorine cl2 for disinfection carried out over 3 d the disinfection time was selected to align with other studies investigating dbp formation from aom fang et al 2010a 2010b shi et al 2019 xie et al 2013 while oxidant concentrations were selected to maintain residuals after the disinfection period figure s1 subsequently solutions were quenched with ascorbic acid extracted and analyzed for dbp concentrations generated during disinfection for experiments investigating the impact of permanganate preoxidation on dbp formation during chlorination of model organic amines i e tyrosine and tryptophan 3 2 mg c l tyrosine or 4 0 mg c l tryptophan i e 30 µm were treated with 1 50 mg l permanganate as kmno4 i e 6 320 µm during preoxidation these concentrations spanned values above and below permanganate demand in these experiments after 3 d solutions were measured for residual permanganate concentrations or treated with chlorine as described above 2 3 analytical procedures concentrations of residual oxidants were measured as described in text s5 residual chlorine and monochloramine concentrations were measured after disinfection for 3 d without preoxidation figure s1 residual permanganate concentrations were measured after preoxidation of aom and nom figure s2 and model amino acids figure s3 each for 3 d four thms i e tcm dichlorobromomethane dcbm dibromochloromethane dbcm tribromomethane tbm three haloacetonitriles i e dcan bromochloroacetonitrile bcan dibromoacetonitrile dban and tcnm were measured on gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms text s4 in all of our experiments we only detected four of these dbps above the levels of their method detection limit tcm 0 1 µg l dcbm 0 1 µg l dcan 0 1 µg l and tcnm 0 1 µg l all other measured dbps never occurred at concentrations above the levels of their detection limit dbcm 0 1 µg l tbm 0 1 µg l bcan 0 2 µg l dban 0 1 µg l the toxicity associated with detected dbps was calculated by dividing the molar concentration of each dbp by their corresponding lc50 cytotoxicity values i e the dbp concentration that results in 50 reduction in growth of chinese hamster ovary cells compared to the untreated control which facilitates quantitative comparison of dbp toxicities determined using a common assay szczuka et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 zeng et al 2016 the calculated toxicity aggregates the contributions of several dbps measured on a consistent basis though notably it does not account for toxicity contributed by other dbps occurring below method detect limits nor excluded from the analytical method mckenna et al 2020 2 4 statistical analysis all experiments were conducted in triplicate error bars represent the standard deviations of the data obtained from triplicate experiments the significance of differences between dbp formation with and without preoxidation was assessed by two tail t tests in graphpad prism with a confidence level set to be 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 dbp formation from disinfection without preoxidation before investigating the impact of preoxidation on the abundance of dbp precursors we first measured the production of dbps from aom during chlorination or chloramination in the absence of preoxidation as a control during chlorination and chloramination we found that tcm dcbm dcan and tcnm were generated from aom while other four dbps included in our method were below their detection limits table s3 the yields of measurable dbps µg per mg c were comparable to those reported in previous literature during chlorination of aom indicating that our aom behaved similarly to aom used in other studies table s4 fang et al 2010a 2010b gu et al 2020 hua et al 2017 kralles et al 2020 li et al 2012 plummer and edzwald 2001 shi et al 2019 wert and rosario ortiz 2013 xie et al 2013 yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 2016 zhou et al 2015 2014 zhu et al 2015 similarly our results showed that the yields of tcm dcan and tcnm from chloramination of aom were also comparable to the previously reported ranges from aom table s5 fang et al 2010b gu et al 2020 yang et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 among the four dbps that formed at measurable quantities we found that dcbm formed at the lowest yield which was 30 to 80 fold lower than the previously reported yields table s5 obtained from aom samples amended with bromide i e 0 05 1 mg l gu et al 2020 to enable a comparison between aom and nom we also measured the production of dbps from nom during chlorination and chloramination similar to aom only four among eight dbps i e tcm dcbm dcan tcnm were detectable during disinfection of nom similar to the yields of dbps from aom the yields of these four dbps from nom were comparable to previously reported ranges during chlorination table s4 fang et al 2010a 2010b gallard and von gunten 2002 hua et al 2015 huang et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 liang and singer 2003 lu et al 2009 rougé et al 2020b xu et al 2011 yang et al 2013 2011 zhang et al 2020 and chloramination table s5 fang et al 2010b hua et al 2015 huang et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 lu et al 2009 yang et al 2013 compared to aom nom yielded more carbonaceous dbps c dbps during chlorination i e 2 fold more tcm and 10 fold more dcbm table s4 and chloramination i e 30 fold more dcbm table s5 the higher yields of c dbps particularly tcm may be attributed to a higher content of aromatic organic carbon from nom than aom fang et al 2010b that is correlated with a higher value of suva254 nm reckhow et al 1990 from nom i e 3 5 l mg c m than aom i e 1 0 l mg c m table s2 nom also yielded 3 fold less dcan and 5 fold more tcnm than aom during chlorination table s4 the total n dbp yield dominated by dcan from nom was less than from aom likely because aom has been reported to have 20 fold higher abundance of organic nitrogen relative to organic carbon than nom fang et al 2010b 3 2 dbp formation from permanganate preoxidation followed by chlorination to investigate the effects of permanganate preoxidation on the abundance of dbp precursors from aom and nom we next added 1 5 mg l permanganate before chlorination measured dbps were never detected after permanganate preoxidation of aom fig 1a d and nom fig 1e h for 3 d therefore the effects of permanganate on dbp formation after chlorination were entirely attributable to the effects of permanganate on precursors that subsequently reacted with chlorine rather than dbp formed from permanganate itself when we used 1 mg l initial permanganate during preoxidation the production of tcm during subsequent chlorination of aom was comparable to the control fig 1a when the concentration of permanganate was increased to 3 and 5 mg l the yield of tcm decreased by 20 10 and 42 4 respectively relative to the control fig 1a compared to aom we found similar effects of permanganate preoxidation on tcm yield from nom fig 1e our results showed marginally greater decreases in tcm yield from aom and nom than the slight decrease reported in a prior report i e by 5 during chlorination of nom under similar experimental conditions rougé et al 2020b the decreased tcm formation indicates that permanganate degrades tcm precursors from aom and nom in addition to tcm dcbm was also detected after chlorination of both aom and nom fig 1b f although we found low concentrations of bromide in solutions containing aom i e 0 01 mg l below the detection limit and nom i e 0 02 mg l table s2 oxidation of trace bromide may still have led to the formation of hypobromous acid heeb et al 2014 kumar and margerum 1987 or other brominating oxidants broadwater et al 2018 sivey et al 2015 2013 that react with organic matter to generate brominated dbps like dcbm in contrast to the decreased yield of tcm after permanganate preoxidation fig 1a e the yield of dcbm during chlorination was either unchanged or increased upon preoxidation of nom or aom respectively fig 1b f while the exact causes of the different effects of permanganate preoxidation on dcbm formation relative to tcm are unknown it is possible that permanganate reacts differently with their respective precursors which are somewhat distinct for example dbps with more brominated substituents were found to be preferentially generated from more hydrophilic organic matter fractions relative to their chlorinated analogues hua and reckhow 2007 liang and singer 2003 suggesting possible differences in the precursors of tcm and dcbm alter the effects of preoxidation on their eventual formation we next investigated the impact of permanganate preoxidation on the formation of n dbps including dcan we found that preoxidation by 1 5 mg l permanganate decreased the yield of dcan from aom by up to 40 relative to the control fig 1c similarly permanganate decreased the yield of dcan from nom fig 1g the decrease in dcan yield from nom was comparable to the previously reported decrease during chlorination of nom i e by 40 under similar experimental conditions rougé et al 2020b our results indicate that like its impact on dcan precursors from nom permanganate also degrades dcan precursors from aom during preoxidation although permanganate preoxidation decreased the formation of dcan it increased the formation of the other detected n dbp tcnm from both aom and nom specifically permanganate at 1 and 3 mg l increased the yield of tcnm from aom by 3 fold relative to the control fig 1d a moderate decrease in tcnm yield was observed when permanganate was increased to 5 mg l fig 1d possibly due to further oxidation of tcnm precursors similar to tcm precursors fig 1a compared to the large increase in tcnm yield from aom permanganate preoxidation only slightly increased the yield from nom by 20 relative to the control fig 1h the greater increase in tcnm yield from aom than nom may be explained by the higher amount of organic nitrogen in aom than nom fang et al 2010b which makes aom more susceptible to react with permanganate to form tcnm precursors the different effects of permanganate on the formation of dcan and tcnm from aom in our experiments might result from the fact that they were both proposed to be generated from organic amine precursors e g amino acids proteins during the chlorination of aom fang et al 2010b one key difference in their formation mechanisms is the transformation from organic amines to organic nitrile compounds i e r cn or organic nitro compounds i e r no2 which leads to the formation of dcan or tcnm respectively fang et al 2010b laszakovits et al 2022 shah and mitch 2012 we hypothesized that permanganate oxidizes organic amines from aom to form organic nitro compounds scheme 1 step 1 laszakovits et al 2022 li et al 2021 wei 1965 which contributes to the increased formation of tcnm during subsequent chlorination step 2 fang et al 2010b shah and mitch 2012 however oxidation of amines to nitro groups may reduce the abundance of precursors that go on to form organic nitrile compounds step 3 and subsequently dcan step 4 during chlorination fang et al 2010b shah and mitch 2012 to test our hypothesis regarding the effect of permanganate preoxidation on n dbp precursors from organic amines we measured the formation of both dcan and tcnm from two known amine containing precursors namely the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan jia et al 2016 yang et al 2012 notably even though the carbon based concentration of 30 µm solutions of tyrosine and tryptophan were similar to aom and nom i e 3 4 mg c l relative to 3 5 mg c l respectively the permanganate demands of the model compounds were much higher figure s3 likely due to a greater abundance of reactive sites present relative to carbon mass consequently for this mechanistic experiment permanganate was applied at both a lower concentration range 1 5 mg l corresponding to that used for aom and nom experiments and a higher concentration range 10 50 mg l spanning the measured permanganate demand of 3 2 mg c l tyrosine i e 27 6 0 7 mg l and 4 0 mg c l tryptophan i e 41 2 0 4 mg l figure s3 the greater permanganate demand by tryptophan than tyrosine likely resulted from permanganate selectively reacting with the indoleamine in tryptophan fig 2 laszakovits et al 2022 though tyrosine and tryptophan exert similar demands for other common preoxidants e g chlorine ozone hureki et al 1998 r wang et al 2020 the effect of permanganate preoxidation on dcan and tcnm formation during chlorination of tyrosine and tryptophan differed when permanganate was below or above the permanganate demand of the amino acid precursors in all cases where permanganate was applied below the permanganate demand of the amino acids i e 20 mg l or lower dcan yield tended to increase with increasing permanganate doses fig 2a b notably whereas dcan yield from tryptophan increased continuously as the permanganate dose was increased from 1 to 20 mg l fig 2b the dcan yield from tyrosine plateaued when permanganate dose was increased from 5 to 20 mg l fig 2a which may be related to tryptophan s greater permanganate demand relative to tyrosine figure s3 when permanganate dose was applied in excess of the demand i e when permanganate dose was increased from 20 to 50 mg l dcan yield from both tyrosine and tryptophan decreased in contrast to the dose dependent effect of permanganate on dcan yield tcnm increased consistently with increasing permanganate doses above 3 mg l fig 2c d the greatest increase in tcnm occurred when permanganate dose approached or exceeded the demand of the two amino acids overall our results collected using amino acids suggest that the effects of permanganate on dcan and tcnm formation from organic amine precursors depends on the amount of permanganate applied relative to the demand exerted by the precursors we found that higher doses of permanganate decreased dcan formation and increased tcnm but only under the condition where permanganate was applied in excess of the precursor s demand notably this condition was met during our experiments using aom wherein all permanganate doses 1 5 mg l exceeded the demand i e 1 mg l figure s2 at lower permanganate doses dcan formation from amino acids increased which suggests that partially oxidized intermediates generated from the reaction of the amino acids with permanganate serve as better precursors for dcan than the parent molecules this finding is in stark contrast to a prior study that reported preoxidation of amino acids by permanganate at doses ranging from 1 to 5 mg l resulted in decreased formation of both dcan and tcnm wang et al 2020 a possible cause for this difference is the elevated chlorine dose i e 213 mg l as cl2 employed by the prior study wang et al 2020 which may have sufficiently oxidized the amino acids in the absence of permanganate to mask the effect of preoxidation on n dbp precursors detectable under the more relevant conditions applied in our experiments using aom together results from both our study and the prior study point to important effects of both preoxidant and disinfectant concentrations in determining the overall effect of preoxidation on dbp formation 3 3 dbp formation from permanganate preoxidation followed by chloramination we next investigated the impact of permanganate on the abundance of dbp precursors from aom when monochloramine was applied during disinfection we hypothesized that dbp formation during chloramination is more sensitive to permanganate preoxidation because monochloramine is a weaker oxidant than chlorine and therefore reacts with a smaller pool of precursors the ability of monochloramine to react with fewer dbp precursors in both aom and nom relative to chlorine was further evidenced by both lower dbp yields i e fig 3 vs fig 1 and disinfectant demand figure s4 this difference between the reactivities of monochloramine and chlorine therefore may translate to differences in the effect of permanganate preoxidation on ultimate dbp formation whereas tcm formation during chlorination decreased after preoxidation by higher levels of permanganate fig 1a the impact of permanganate on tcm formation during chloramination of aom varied depending on permanganate concentration fig 3a surprisingly at the lowest dose of permanganate i e 1 mg l tcm yield increased by 70 fig 3a which suggests that permanganate at a relatively low concentration reacts with aom to form tcm precursors that more readily react with monochloramine but not chlorine however at higher permanganate doses i e 3 and 5 mg l tcm yield decreased down to 50 of the control fig 3a in closer alignment to decreasing yields observed from nom upon permanganate preoxidation fig 3e notably tcm yield during chloramination of nom was highly sensitive to permanganate preoxidation decreasing to below the method detection limit when permanganate was applied at its highest dose fig 3e consequently permanganate preoxidation appears capable of dramatically eliminating the relatively small pool of tcm precursors from nom that react with monochloramine but is less effective at degrading tcm precursors from aom in contrast to tcm the effects of permanganate preoxidation on the formation of dcbm during chloramination of both aom fig 3b and nom fig 3f were more similar to the effect observed during chlorination fig 1b f we again observed that permanganate preoxidation increased the yield of dcbm during chloramination of aom in this case by up to 3 fold fig 3b while the yield of dcan during chloramination of nom remained unchanged or slightly decreased fig 3f as observed for tcm the greatest increase in dcbm yield from aom was found at the lowest permanganate dose i e 1 mg l however dcbm yields remained above the control even at higher permanganate doses together our results from both chlorination and chloramination suggest that aom but not nom specifically reacts with permanganate to generate dcbm precursors another key difference between chlorination and chloramination was observed when comparing the impact of permanganate on dcan formation unlike the decreased yield of dcan during chlorination of both aom and nom fig 1c g the impact of permanganate preoxidation on dcan yield during chloramination differed between aom and nom fig 3c g while we still found a decreased yield of dcan during chloramination of nom i e up to 50 fig 3g permanganate preoxidation surprisingly increased the yield of dcan during chloramination of aom i e by 30 50 fig 3c when considering dcan formation during chlorination we proposed that permanganate preoxidation shifts n dbp formation from organic amines towards tcnm instead of dcan fig 2 possibly due to oxidation of amines to nitro compounds scheme 1 while permanganate may still convert organic amines to organic nitro compounds over organic nitrile compounds before chloramination monochloramine serves as an additional source of nitrogen for dcan formation fang et al 2010b pedersen et al 1999 shah and mitch 2012 in this case permanganate may have reacted with aom to form other dcan precursors such as organic aldehydes li et al 2021 rawalay and shechter 1967 shaabani et al 2005 shechter and rawalay 1964 wei 1965 the nucleophilic attack of monochloramine on the aldehyde leads to the formation of organic nitrile compounds fang et al 2010b pedersen et al 1999 shah and mitch 2012 which in turn increase the formation of dcan during chloramination scheme 2 similar to dcan the impact of permanganate preoxidation on the formation of tcnm also differed between chlorination and chloramination of aom while permanganate increased the yield of tcnm during chlorination fig 1d the yield of tcnm was comparable to the control except when we used 3 mg l permanganate i e the yield increased by 170 30 relative to the control fig 3d our results indicate that permanganate at an intermediate concentration i e 3 mg l oxidizes organic amines to organic nitro compounds that are reactive with monochloramine however these precursors may also contain other organic moieties e g aromatic groups that further react with permanganate laszakovits et al 2020 therefore a higher permanganate concentration i e 5 mg l may also oxidize these tcnm precursors to become less reactive with monochloramine compared to aom the yield of tcnm during chloramination of nom was either unchanged or slightly decreased fig 3h the increased formation of tcnm from only aom suggests that organic amines from aom are more susceptible than nom to react with permanganate to produce organic nitro compounds that go on to generate tcnm 3 4 impact of preoxidation on the toxicity of treated water because permanganate preoxidation had different effects on the formation of each dbp we next calculated the summed toxicity associated with detected dbps szczuka et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 zeng et al 2016 to estimate the overall impact of preoxidation on the toxicity of treated water after permanganate preoxidation we found that subsequent chlorination led to weighted toxicity that was an order of magnitude higher than subsequent chloramination which was attributed to the orders of magnitude higher concentrations of dbps generated by chlorination fig 1 than chloramination fig 3 in addition although dcan occurred at 1 2 orders of magnitude lower concentrations than the most abundant dbp tcm it contributed to 60 100 of the overall toxicity in all solutions fig 4 this observation was consistent with previous studies that identified haloacetonitriles as the primary contributors to the toxicity of treated aom and nom among dbps considered across these studies kralles et al 2020 lau et al 2020 muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2017 because dcan was found to be the primary toxicity driver from aom the changes in the overall toxicity were most closely related to the changes in dcan concentrations for example permanganate preoxidation decreased the formation of dcan from chlorination of aom relative to the control fig 1c leading to decreased toxicity relative to the control fig 4a however as the formation of dcan during the chloramination of aom increased fig 2c the estimated toxicity increased fig 4b although permanganate preoxidation increased the toxicity from chloramination of aom at all permanganate doses relative to the control the estimated toxicity after chloramination of aom was decreased as the initial permanganate concentration was increased from 1 to 5 mg l fig 4b therefore higher doses of permanganate reduced the toxicity after chloramination relative to lower doses our results showed that permanganate preoxidation decreased the estimated toxicity from nom after chlorination or chloramination fig 4c d similar to aom dcan was a primary contributor to the toxicity from nom however because chlorination of nom also yielded greater tcm and less dcan than aom tcm also contributed to a larger portion of the overall toxicity after chlorination of nom i e 30 40 fig 4c than aom i e 10 fig 4a as permanganate preoxidation decreased the formation of both tcm and dcan the estimated toxicity after chlorination of nom was decreased fig 4c 4 conclusions our work demonstrated that while permanganate preoxidation tended to decrease dbp formation from nom permanganate preoxidation increased the formation of certain dbps during chlorination and chloramination of aom the following conclusions were drawn among dbps considered in our study dcan was the primary toxicity driver in aom impacted water suggesting that the formation of dcan must be controlled to mitigate the toxicity of drinking water during habs while permanganate preoxidation consistently decreased the formation of dcan during both chlorination and chloramination of nom its effect on dcan formation from aom was variable when followed by chlorination permanganate preoxidation decreased dcan formation by up to 40 which we attributed to oxidation of organic amine moieties under excess permanganate conditions that reduces their availability to form organic nitrile compounds during chlorination scheme 1 in contrast to chlorination dcan formation during chloramination was increased by 30 50 when permanganate preoxidation was applied this distinction may relate to the ability of monochloramine to contribute its nitrogen when reacting with non nitrogenous precursors i e organic aldehydes generated during permanganate preoxidation of aom that can then become new precursors of dcan scheme 2 beyond dcan permanganate preoxidation also altered the formation of other dbps most notably by increasing the formation of tcnm from aom during both chlorination and chloramination at certain doses like dcan tcnm formation might also be related to the reaction of permanganate with organic amines which were oxidized to nitro groups that led to increased tcnm formation scheme 1 in addition to tcnm permanganate preoxidation also increased the formation of dcbm particularly in contrast to the decreased formation of its chlorinated analogue tcm during both chlorination and chloramination of aom overall our work indicated that permanganate increased the formation of some dbps during habs which will be specifically applicable when permanganate is applied at sufficient doses to lyse algal cells

15062,during harmful algal blooms habs permanganate may be used as a preoxidant to improve drinking water quality by removing algal cells and degrading algal toxins however permanganate also lyses algal cells releasing intracellular algal organic matter aom aom further reacts with permanganate to alter the abundance of disinfection byproduct dbp precursors which in turn affects dbp formation during disinfection in this study we evaluated the impacts of preoxidation by permanganate applied at commonly used doses i e 1 5 mg l on dbp generation during chlorination and chloramination of aom we found that permanganate preoxidation increased trichloronitromethane tcnm formation by up to 3 fold and decreased dichloroacetonitrile dcan formation by up to 40 during chlorination indicating that permanganate oxidized organic amines in aom to organic nitro compounds rather than organic nitrile compounds to test this proposed mechanism we demonstrated that permanganate oxidized organic amines in known dbp precursors i e tyrosine tryptophan to favor the production of tcnm over dcan during chlorination compared to the decreased formation of dcan during chlorination permanganate increased dcan formation by 30 50 during chloramination of aom this difference likely arose from monochloramine s ability to react with non nitrogenous precursors e g organic aldehydes that formed during permanganate preoxidation of aom to generate nitrogen containing intermediates that go on to form dcan our results also showed that permanganate preoxidation favored the formation of dichlorobromomethane dcbm over trichloromethane tcm during chlorination and chloramination the increased formation of dbps especially nitrogenous dbps that are more toxic than carbonaceous dbps may increase the overall toxicity in finished drinking water when permanganate preoxidation is implemented graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords harmful algal blooms algal organic matter

et al 2020 perez benito 2009 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 permanganate has also been investigated for its impact on the formation of toxic disinfection byproducts dbps during subsequent disinfection for example prior studies reported that permanganate decreased the formation of trihalomethanes thms by 10 20 he and ren 2022 hidayah and yeh 2018 hu et al 2018 rougé et al 2020a 2020b and haloacetonitriles hans by 50 70 hu et al 2018 rougé et al 2020a 2020b during subsequent chlorination permanganate may also be used as a preoxidant during harmful algal blooms habs which threaten drinking water quality worldwide by causing taste and odor problems and producing toxins hallegraeff et al 2021a 2021b hudnell 2010 roberts et al 2020 during habs permanganate preoxidation has been applied to induce aggregation of algal cells for removal by coagulation flocculation chen and yeh 2005 naceradska et al 2017 piezer et al 2021 qi et al 2021 xie et al 2016 lyse cells to prevent

algal cell lysis caused by permanganate preoxidation also leads to the release of intracellular algal organic matter aom that is a precursor of dbps dong et al 2021 fang et al 2010a 2010b to date information regarding the impact of permanganate preoxidation on dbp formation during disinfection of intracellular aom remains limited when treating algal cell suspensions one study showed that permanganate decreased the abundance of trichloromethane tcm precursors by up to 40 from extracellular aom shi et al 2019 while another study found that permanganate preoxidation did not alter dbp formation during subsequent chlorination xie et al 2013 however the permanganate dosages applied in these studies were too low 2 mg l to lyse algal cells and release intracellular aom fan et al 2013 the impact of permanganate on intracellular aom from lysed cells was only investigated by one study which found that permanganate dosed at 4 mg l did not alter dbp formation e g tcm dichloroacetonitrile dcan trichloronitromethane tcnm during subsequent chlorination sheng et al 2022 however this study reported the impact of permanganate only under a single pair of preoxidant disinfectant doses sheng et al 2022 which may be insufficient to account for preoxidant effects that depend on the doses of preoxidant and disinfectant hua and reckhow 2008 rougé et al 2020a 2020b whereas preoxidants tend to decrease dbp formation from nom preoxidants other than permanganate have been found to increase the formation of dbps from aom for example preoxidation using chlorine dioxide decreased the formation of tcm by 10 and dcan by 60 during chlorination of nom yang et al 2013 but increased the formation of these dbps during chlorination of intracellular aom i e by 60 for tcm 50 for dcan sheng et al 2022 like chlorine dioxide ozone typically decreased thm formation by 20 50 during chlorination of nom jiang et al 2016 2019 rougé et al 2020b but increased thm formation by 30 70 during chlorination of aom chien et al 2018 sheng et al 2022 zhou et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 the increased formation of dbps from aom may result from specific changes made by the preoxidants to aom properties e g decreasing its molecular weight aromaticity or hydrophobicity dong et al 2021 sheng et al 2022 zhou et al 2015 in addition some preoxidants react with specific moieties from aom to generate dbps for example organic amines which are more abundant in aom than nom dong et al 2021 fang et al 2010b were oxidized by ozone to generate precursors of tcnm mccurry et al 2016 which could contribute to a greater extent of increase in the formation of tcnm by preozonation observed from aom i e 5 to 100 fold than nom i e 2 to 8 fold chien et al 2018 jiang et al 2016 2019 sheng et al 2022 zhou et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 in this study we hypothesized that permanganate preoxidation increases dbp formation during disinfection of aom in contrast to nom which was included as a control throughout the study using aom derived from cultivated microcystis aeruginosa we first tested the effects of permanganate on dbp formation during chlorination of aom and linked some of these effects to the reaction of permanganate with specific moieties in aom i e organic amines we next extended our work to investigate the impact of permanganate on dbp formation during chloramination of aom which we hypothesized would differ from chlorination due to monochloramine acting as a weaker oxidant that can also participate in unique reactions that generate new dbp precursors particularly for nitrogenous dbps fang et al 2010b pedersen et al 1999 shah and mitch 2012 finally we evaluated the impact of permanganate preoxidation on calculated toxicity associated with dbp formation szczuka et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 zeng et al 2016 in contrast to prior findings under limited conditions sheng et al 2022 our work demonstrated that permanganate preoxidation increased the formation of some dbps specifically from aom under relevant doses of permanganate and disinfectant 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals table s1 were used as received oxidant solutions were prepared in milli q water as described in text s1 we obtained aom from microcystis aeruginosa following the method described in text s2 for experiments aom was added to milli q water at a concentration of 5 mg c l which is approximately equivalent to the concentration of aom that would be released by algal cells present at 106 cells ml fang et al 2010a xie et al 2013 we obtained nom from natural water samples that were collected from the mississippi river at a location near the chain of rocks water treatment plant in st louis missouri where no hab was reported at the time of collection the water samples were filtered through 0 7 µm glass fiber filters fisher that were pre baked in an oven at 450 c for 4 h these water samples were directly used for experiments requiring nom and contained total organic carbon toc measured to be 3 mg c l water quality parameters including toc specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254nm and concentrations of inorganic ions were measured for solutions containing aom and nom as described in text s3 and are shown in table s2 all solutions containing either aom or nom were stored at 4 c 2 2 experimental procedure experiments were conducted to measure the concentrations of dbps generated during permanganate preoxidation and disinfection of aom and nom all solutions contained 5 mg c l aom or 3 mg c l nom 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 and permanganate at concentrations commonly used during preoxidation i e 1 5 mg l as potassium permanganate kmno4 dong et al 2021 piezer et al 2021 u s epa 1999 the solutions were prepared in 40 ml amber glass vials that were headspace free and reacted at room temperature in the dark for 3 d to allow sufficient time for reactions between permanganate and moieties in organic matter laszakovits et al 2022 after 3 d residual permanganate in solutions was measured to terminate the reaction a quencher was applied at 10 fold molar excess relative to permanganate concentrations in a 100 µl aliquot sodium thiosulfate was used to quench permanganate in an early experiment i e fig 1 a d but was replaced with ascorbic acid in all later experiments including fig 3a d that replicated identical experimental conditions to achieve the same results after permanganate preoxidation alone these quenched solutions were extracted into methyl tert butyl ether mtbe within 30 min as described in text s4 then dbp concentrations in the mtbe extracts were analyzed to determine the amount generated during permanganate preoxidation to a separate set of unquenched solutions after permanganate preoxidation small volumes i e 100 µl of disinfectant stock solutions were added into each vial to achieve a targeted concentration i e 15 mg l chlorine or 4 mg l monochloramine as chlorine cl2 for disinfection carried out over 3 d the disinfection time was selected to align with other studies investigating dbp formation from aom fang et al 2010a 2010b shi et al 2019 xie et al 2013 while oxidant concentrations were selected to maintain residuals after the disinfection period figure s1 subsequently solutions were quenched with ascorbic acid extracted and analyzed for dbp concentrations generated during disinfection for experiments investigating the impact of permanganate preoxidation on dbp formation during chlorination of model organic amines i e tyrosine and tryptophan 3 2 mg c l tyrosine or 4 0 mg c l tryptophan i e 30 µm were treated with 1 50 mg l permanganate as kmno4 i e 6 320 µm during preoxidation these concentrations spanned values above and below permanganate demand in these experiments after 3 d solutions were measured for residual permanganate concentrations or treated with chlorine as described above 2 3 analytical procedures concentrations of residual oxidants were measured as described in text s5 residual chlorine and monochloramine concentrations were measured after disinfection for 3 d without preoxidation figure s1 residual permanganate concentrations were measured after preoxidation of aom and nom figure s2 and model amino acids figure s3 each for 3 d four thms i e tcm dichlorobromomethane dcbm dibromochloromethane dbcm tribromomethane tbm three haloacetonitriles i e dcan bromochloroacetonitrile bcan dibromoacetonitrile dban and tcnm were measured on gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms text s4 in all of our experiments we only detected four of these dbps above the levels of their method detection limit tcm 0 1 µg l dcbm 0 1 µg l dcan 0 1 µg l and tcnm 0 1 µg l all other measured dbps never occurred at concentrations above the levels of their detection limit dbcm 0 1 µg l tbm 0 1 µg l bcan 0 2 µg l dban 0 1 µg l the toxicity associated with detected dbps was calculated by dividing the molar concentration of each dbp by their corresponding lc50 cytotoxicity values i e the dbp concentration that results in 50 reduction in growth of chinese hamster ovary cells compared to the untreated control which facilitates quantitative comparison of dbp toxicities determined using a common assay szczuka et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 zeng et al 2016 the calculated toxicity aggregates the contributions of several dbps measured on a consistent basis though notably it does not account for toxicity contributed by other dbps occurring below method detect limits nor excluded from the analytical method mckenna et al 2020 2 4 statistical analysis all experiments were conducted in triplicate error bars represent the standard deviations of the data obtained from triplicate experiments the significance of differences between dbp formation with and without preoxidation was assessed by two tail t tests in graphpad prism with a confidence level set to be 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 dbp formation from disinfection without preoxidation before investigating the impact of preoxidation on the abundance of dbp precursors we first measured the production of dbps from aom during chlorination or chloramination in the absence of preoxidation as a control during chlorination and chloramination we found that tcm dcbm dcan and tcnm were generated from aom while other four dbps included in our method were below their detection limits table s3 the yields of measurable dbps µg per mg c were comparable to those reported in previous literature during chlorination of aom indicating that our aom behaved similarly to aom used in other studies table s4 fang et al 2010a 2010b gu et al 2020 hua et al 2017 kralles et al 2020 li et al 2012 plummer and edzwald 2001 shi et al 2019 wert and rosario ortiz 2013 xie et al 2013 yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 2016 zhou et al 2015 2014 zhu et al 2015 similarly our results showed that the yields of tcm dcan and tcnm from chloramination of aom were also comparable to the previously reported ranges from aom table s5 fang et al 2010b gu et al 2020 yang et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 among the four dbps that formed at measurable quantities we found that dcbm formed at the lowest yield which was 30 to 80 fold lower than the previously reported yields table s5 obtained from aom samples amended with bromide i e 0 05 1 mg l gu et al 2020 to enable a comparison between aom and nom we also measured the production of dbps from nom during chlorination and chloramination similar to aom only four among eight dbps i e tcm dcbm dcan tcnm were detectable during disinfection of nom similar to the yields of dbps from aom the yields of these four dbps from nom were comparable to previously reported ranges during chlorination table s4 fang et al 2010a 2010b gallard and von gunten 2002 hua et al 2015 huang et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 liang and singer 2003 lu et al 2009 rougé et al 2020b xu et al 2011 yang et al 2013 2011 zhang et al 2020 and chloramination table s5 fang et al 2010b hua et al 2015 huang et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 lu et al 2009 yang et al 2013 compared to aom nom yielded more carbonaceous dbps c dbps during chlorination i e 2 fold more tcm and 10 fold more dcbm table s4 and chloramination i e 30 fold more dcbm table s5 the higher yields of c dbps particularly tcm may be attributed to a higher content of aromatic organic carbon from nom than aom fang et al 2010b that is correlated with a higher value of suva254 nm reckhow et al 1990 from nom i e 3 5 l mg c m than aom i e 1 0 l mg c m table s2 nom also yielded 3 fold less dcan and 5 fold more tcnm than aom during chlorination table s4 the total n dbp yield dominated by dcan from nom was less than from aom likely because aom has been reported to have 20 fold higher abundance of organic nitrogen relative to organic carbon than nom fang et al 2010b 3 2 dbp formation from permanganate preoxidation followed by chlorination to investigate the effects of permanganate preoxidation on the abundance of dbp precursors from aom and nom we next added 1 5 mg l permanganate before chlorination measured dbps were never detected after permanganate preoxidation of aom fig 1a d and nom fig 1e h for 3 d therefore the effects of permanganate on dbp formation after chlorination were entirely attributable to the effects of permanganate on precursors that subsequently reacted with chlorine rather than dbp formed from permanganate itself when we used 1 mg l initial permanganate during preoxidation the production of tcm during subsequent chlorination of aom was comparable to the control fig 1a when the concentration of permanganate was increased to 3 and 5 mg l the yield of tcm decreased by 20 10 and 42 4 respectively relative to the control fig 1a compared to aom we found similar effects of permanganate preoxidation on tcm yield from nom fig 1e our results showed marginally greater decreases in tcm yield from aom and nom than the slight decrease reported in a prior report i e by 5 during chlorination of nom under similar experimental conditions rougé et al 2020b the decreased tcm formation indicates that permanganate degrades tcm precursors from aom and nom in addition to tcm dcbm was also detected after chlorination of both aom and nom fig 1b f although we found low concentrations of bromide in solutions containing aom i e 0 01 mg l below the detection limit and nom i e 0 02 mg l table s2 oxidation of trace bromide may still have led to the formation of hypobromous acid heeb et al 2014 kumar and margerum 1987 or other brominating oxidants broadwater et al 2018 sivey et al 2015 2013 that react with organic matter to generate brominated dbps like dcbm in contrast to the decreased yield of tcm after permanganate preoxidation fig 1a e the yield of dcbm during chlorination was either unchanged or increased upon preoxidation of nom or aom respectively fig 1b f while the exact causes of the different effects of permanganate preoxidation on dcbm formation relative to tcm are unknown it is possible that permanganate reacts differently with their respective precursors which are somewhat distinct for example dbps with more brominated substituents were found to be preferentially generated from more hydrophilic organic matter fractions relative to their chlorinated analogues hua and reckhow 2007 liang and singer 2003 suggesting possible differences in the precursors of tcm and dcbm alter the effects of preoxidation on their eventual formation we next investigated the impact of permanganate preoxidation on the formation of n dbps including dcan we found that preoxidation by 1 5 mg l permanganate decreased the yield of dcan from aom by up to 40 relative to the control fig 1c similarly permanganate decreased the yield of dcan from nom fig 1g the decrease in dcan yield from nom was comparable to the previously reported decrease during chlorination of nom i e by 40 under similar experimental conditions rougé et al 2020b our results indicate that like its impact on dcan precursors from nom permanganate also degrades dcan precursors from aom during preoxidation although permanganate preoxidation decreased the formation of dcan it increased the formation of the other detected n dbp tcnm from both aom and nom specifically permanganate at 1 and 3 mg l increased the yield of tcnm from aom by 3 fold relative to the control fig 1d a moderate decrease in tcnm yield was observed when permanganate was increased to 5 mg l fig 1d possibly due to further oxidation of tcnm precursors similar to tcm precursors fig 1a compared to the large increase in tcnm yield from aom permanganate preoxidation only slightly increased the yield from nom by 20 relative to the control fig 1h the greater increase in tcnm yield from aom than nom may be explained by the higher amount of organic nitrogen in aom than nom fang et al 2010b which makes aom more susceptible to react with permanganate to form tcnm precursors the different effects of permanganate on the formation of dcan and tcnm from aom in our experiments might result from the fact that they were both proposed to be generated from organic amine precursors e g amino acids proteins during the chlorination of aom fang et al 2010b one key difference in their formation mechanisms is the transformation from organic amines to organic nitrile compounds i e r cn or organic nitro compounds i e r no2 which leads to the formation of dcan or tcnm respectively fang et al 2010b laszakovits et al 2022 shah and mitch 2012 we hypothesized that permanganate oxidizes organic amines from aom to form organic nitro compounds scheme 1 step 1 laszakovits et al 2022 li et al 2021 wei 1965 which contributes to the increased formation of tcnm during subsequent chlorination step 2 fang et al 2010b shah and mitch 2012 however oxidation of amines to nitro groups may reduce the abundance of precursors that go on to form organic nitrile compounds step 3 and subsequently dcan step 4 during chlorination fang et al 2010b shah and mitch 2012 to test our hypothesis regarding the effect of permanganate preoxidation on n dbp precursors from organic amines we measured the formation of both dcan and tcnm from two known amine containing precursors namely the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan jia et al 2016 yang et al 2012 notably even though the carbon based concentration of 30 µm solutions of tyrosine and tryptophan were similar to aom and nom i e 3 4 mg c l relative to 3 5 mg c l respectively the permanganate demands of the model compounds were much higher figure s3 likely due to a greater abundance of reactive sites present relative to carbon mass consequently for this mechanistic experiment permanganate was applied at both a lower concentration range 1 5 mg l corresponding to that used for aom and nom experiments and a higher concentration range 10 50 mg l spanning the measured permanganate demand of 3 2 mg c l tyrosine i e 27 6 0 7 mg l and 4 0 mg c l tryptophan i e 41 2 0 4 mg l figure s3 the greater permanganate demand by tryptophan than tyrosine likely resulted from permanganate selectively reacting with the indoleamine in tryptophan fig 2 laszakovits et al 2022 though tyrosine and tryptophan exert similar demands for other common preoxidants e g chlorine ozone hureki et al 1998 r wang et al 2020 the effect of permanganate preoxidation on dcan and tcnm formation during chlorination of tyrosine and tryptophan differed when permanganate was below or above the permanganate demand of the amino acid precursors in all cases where permanganate was applied below the permanganate demand of the amino acids i e 20 mg l or lower dcan yield tended to increase with increasing permanganate doses fig 2a b notably whereas dcan yield from tryptophan increased continuously as the permanganate dose was increased from 1 to 20 mg l fig 2b the dcan yield from tyrosine plateaued when permanganate dose was increased from 5 to 20 mg l fig 2a which may be related to tryptophan s greater permanganate demand relative to tyrosine figure s3 when permanganate dose was applied in excess of the demand i e when permanganate dose was increased from 20 to 50 mg l dcan yield from both tyrosine and tryptophan decreased in contrast to the dose dependent effect of permanganate on dcan yield tcnm increased consistently with increasing permanganate doses above 3 mg l fig 2c d the greatest increase in tcnm occurred when permanganate dose approached or exceeded the demand of the two amino acids overall our results collected using amino acids suggest that the effects of permanganate on dcan and tcnm formation from organic amine precursors depends on the amount of permanganate applied relative to the demand exerted by the precursors we found that higher doses of permanganate decreased dcan formation and increased tcnm but only under the condition where permanganate was applied in excess of the precursor s demand notably this condition was met during our experiments using aom wherein all permanganate doses 1 5 mg l exceeded the demand i e 1 mg l figure s2 at lower permanganate doses dcan formation from amino acids increased which suggests that partially oxidized intermediates generated from the reaction of the amino acids with permanganate serve as better precursors for dcan than the parent molecules this finding is in stark contrast to a prior study that reported preoxidation of amino acids by permanganate at doses ranging from 1 to 5 mg l resulted in decreased formation of both dcan and tcnm wang et al 2020 a possible cause for this difference is the elevated chlorine dose i e 213 mg l as cl2 employed by the prior study wang et al 2020 which may have sufficiently oxidized the amino acids in the absence of permanganate to mask the effect of preoxidation on n dbp precursors detectable under the more relevant conditions applied in our experiments using aom together results from both our study and the prior study point to important effects of both preoxidant and disinfectant concentrations in determining the overall effect of preoxidation on dbp formation 3 3 dbp formation from permanganate preoxidation followed by chloramination we next investigated the impact of permanganate on the abundance of dbp precursors from aom when monochloramine was applied during disinfection we hypothesized that dbp formation during chloramination is more sensitive to permanganate preoxidation because monochloramine is a weaker oxidant than chlorine and therefore reacts with a smaller pool of precursors the ability of monochloramine to react with fewer dbp precursors in both aom and nom relative to chlorine was further evidenced by both lower dbp yields i e fig 3 vs fig 1 and disinfectant demand figure s4 this difference between the reactivities of monochloramine and chlorine therefore may translate to differences in the effect of permanganate preoxidation on ultimate dbp formation whereas tcm formation during chlorination decreased after preoxidation by higher levels of permanganate fig 1a the impact of permanganate on tcm formation during chloramination of aom varied depending on permanganate concentration fig 3a surprisingly at the lowest dose of permanganate i e 1 mg l tcm yield increased by 70 fig 3a which suggests that permanganate at a relatively low concentration reacts with aom to form tcm precursors that more readily react with monochloramine but not chlorine however at higher permanganate doses i e 3 and 5 mg l tcm yield decreased down to 50 of the control fig 3a in closer alignment to decreasing yields observed from nom upon permanganate preoxidation fig 3e notably tcm yield during chloramination of nom was highly sensitive to permanganate preoxidation decreasing to below the method detection limit when permanganate was applied at its highest dose fig 3e consequently permanganate preoxidation appears capable of dramatically eliminating the relatively small pool of tcm precursors from nom that react with monochloramine but is less effective at degrading tcm precursors from aom in contrast to tcm the effects of permanganate preoxidation on the formation of dcbm during chloramination of both aom fig 3b and nom fig 3f were more similar to the effect observed during chlorination fig 1b f we again observed that permanganate preoxidation increased the yield of dcbm during chloramination of aom in this case by up to 3 fold fig 3b while the yield of dcan during chloramination of nom remained unchanged or slightly decreased fig 3f as observed for tcm the greatest increase in dcbm yield from aom was found at the lowest permanganate dose i e 1 mg l however dcbm yields remained above the control even at higher permanganate doses together our results from both chlorination and chloramination suggest that aom but not nom specifically reacts with permanganate to generate dcbm precursors another key difference between chlorination and chloramination was observed when comparing the impact of permanganate on dcan formation unlike the decreased yield of dcan during chlorination of both aom and nom fig 1c g the impact of permanganate preoxidation on dcan yield during chloramination differed between aom and nom fig 3c g while we still found a decreased yield of dcan during chloramination of nom i e up to 50 fig 3g permanganate preoxidation surprisingly increased the yield of dcan during chloramination of aom i e by 30 50 fig 3c when considering dcan formation during chlorination we proposed that permanganate preoxidation shifts n dbp formation from organic amines towards tcnm instead of dcan fig 2 possibly due to oxidation of amines to nitro compounds scheme 1 while permanganate may still convert organic amines to organic nitro compounds over organic nitrile compounds before chloramination monochloramine serves as an additional source of nitrogen for dcan formation fang et al 2010b pedersen et al 1999 shah and mitch 2012 in this case permanganate may have reacted with aom to form other dcan precursors such as organic aldehydes li et al 2021 rawalay and shechter 1967 shaabani et al 2005 shechter and rawalay 1964 wei 1965 the nucleophilic attack of monochloramine on the aldehyde leads to the formation of organic nitrile compounds fang et al 2010b pedersen et al 1999 shah and mitch 2012 which in turn increase the formation of dcan during chloramination scheme 2 similar to dcan the impact of permanganate preoxidation on the formation of tcnm also differed between chlorination and chloramination of aom while permanganate increased the yield of tcnm during chlorination fig 1d the yield of tcnm was comparable to the control except when we used 3 mg l permanganate i e the yield increased by 170 30 relative to the control fig 3d our results indicate that permanganate at an intermediate concentration i e 3 mg l oxidizes organic amines to organic nitro compounds that are reactive with monochloramine however these precursors may also contain other organic moieties e g aromatic groups that further react with permanganate laszakovits et al 2020 therefore a higher permanganate concentration i e 5 mg l may also oxidize these tcnm precursors to become less reactive with monochloramine compared to aom the yield of tcnm during chloramination of nom was either unchanged or slightly decreased fig 3h the increased formation of tcnm from only aom suggests that organic amines from aom are more susceptible than nom to react with permanganate to produce organic nitro compounds that go on to generate tcnm 3 4 impact of preoxidation on the toxicity of treated water because permanganate preoxidation had different effects on the formation of each dbp we next calculated the summed toxicity associated with detected dbps szczuka et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 zeng et al 2016 to estimate the overall impact of preoxidation on the toxicity of treated water after permanganate preoxidation we found that subsequent chlorination led to weighted toxicity that was an order of magnitude higher than subsequent chloramination which was attributed to the orders of magnitude higher concentrations of dbps generated by chlorination fig 1 than chloramination fig 3 in addition although dcan occurred at 1 2 orders of magnitude lower concentrations than the most abundant dbp tcm it contributed to 60 100 of the overall toxicity in all solutions fig 4 this observation was consistent with previous studies that identified haloacetonitriles as the primary contributors to the toxicity of treated aom and nom among dbps considered across these studies kralles et al 2020 lau et al 2020 muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2017 because dcan was found to be the primary toxicity driver from aom the changes in the overall toxicity were most closely related to the changes in dcan concentrations for example permanganate preoxidation decreased the formation of dcan from chlorination of aom relative to the control fig 1c leading to decreased toxicity relative to the control fig 4a however as the formation of dcan during the chloramination of aom increased fig 2c the estimated toxicity increased fig 4b although permanganate preoxidation increased the toxicity from chloramination of aom at all permanganate doses relative to the control the estimated toxicity after chloramination of aom was decreased as the initial permanganate concentration was increased from 1 to 5 mg l fig 4b therefore higher doses of permanganate reduced the toxicity after chloramination relative to lower doses our results showed that permanganate preoxidation decreased the estimated toxicity from nom after chlorination or chloramination fig 4c d similar to aom dcan was a primary contributor to the toxicity from nom however because chlorination of nom also yielded greater tcm and less dcan than aom tcm also contributed to a larger portion of the overall toxicity after chlorination of nom i e 30 40 fig 4c than aom i e 10 fig 4a as permanganate preoxidation decreased the formation of both tcm and dcan the estimated toxicity after chlorination of nom was decreased fig 4c 4 conclusions our work demonstrated that while permanganate preoxidation tended to decrease dbp formation from nom permanganate preoxidation increased the formation of certain dbps during chlorination and chloramination of aom the following conclusions were drawn among dbps considered in our study dcan was the primary toxicity driver in aom impacted water suggesting that the formation of dcan must be controlled to mitigate the toxicity of drinking water during habs while permanganate preoxidation consistently decreased the formation of dcan during both chlorination and chloramination of nom its effect on dcan formation from aom was variable when followed by chlorination permanganate preoxidation decreased dcan formation by up to 40 which we attributed to oxidation of organic amine moieties under excess permanganate conditions that reduces their availability to form organic nitrile compounds during chlorination scheme 1 in contrast to chlorination dcan formation during chloramination was increased by 30 50 when permanganate preoxidation was applied this distinction may relate to the ability of monochloramine to contribute its nitrogen when reacting with non nitrogenous precursors i e organic aldehydes generated during permanganate preoxidation of aom that can then become new precursors of dcan scheme 2 beyond dcan permanganate preoxidation also altered the formation of other dbps most notably by increasing the formation of tcnm from aom during both chlorination and chloramination at certain doses like dcan tcnm formation might also be related to the reaction of permanganate with organic amines which were oxidized to nitro groups that led to increased tcnm formation scheme 1 in addition to tcnm permanganate preoxidation also increased the formation of dcbm particularly in contrast to the decreased formation of its chlorinated analogue tcm during both chlorination and chloramination of aom overall our work indicated that permanganate increased the formation of some dbps during habs which will be specifically applicable when permanganate is applied at sufficient doses to lyse algal cells

15063,low carbon water production technologies are indispensable for achieving sustainable development goals and mitigating global climate change however at present many advanced water treatment processes lack a systematic assessment of related greenhouse gas ghg emissions thus quantifying their life cycle ghg emissions and proposing strategies toward carbon neutrality is urgently needed this case study focuses on electrodialysis ed an electricity driven desalination technology to analyze the carbon footprint of ed desalination in various applications a life cycle assessment model was developed based on industrial scale ed processes for seawater desalination the carbon footprint is 59 74 kg co2 eq metric ton removed salt which is one order of magnitude lower than that of high salinity wastewater treatment and organic solvent desalination meanwhile the power consumption during operation is the main hotspot of ghg emissions power grid decarbonization and improved waste recycling in china are projected to reduce the carbon footprint up to 92 meanwhile the contribution of operation power consumption is expected to reduce from 95 83 to 77 84 for organic solvent desalination through sensitivity analysis significant non linear impacts of process variables on the carbon footprint were determined therefore it is recommended to optimize the process design and operation to reduce power consumption based on the current fossil based grid ghg reduction for module production and disposal should also be emphasized this method can be extended to general water treatment or other industrial technologies for carbon footprint assessment and reducing ghg emission graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrodialysis desalination life cycle assessment carbon footprint scenario analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the accessibility of freshwater resources is a challenge in modern society because of increasingly serious water pollution caused by human activities the world meteorological organization predicted that 5 billion people worldwide will experience water shortage by 2050 wmo 2021 in 2015 the united nations formulated 17 global sustainable development goals sdgs from the three dimensions of society economy and environment sdg 6 includes the sustainable management of water and environmental sanitation to ensure that everyone has access to clean drinking water un 2015 global production of freshwater is gradually growing to solve the scarcity of freshwater resources however freshwater production requires a large amount of high thermal energy and electricity which results in greenhouse gas ghg emissions gude 2016 it has been estimated that production of 1 metric ton mt freshwater requires approximately 9 to 10 mt of oil and results in environmental degradation through ghg emissions and discharged brine gude 2015 2016 kalogirou 2005 in addition the ghg emission of the water treatment industry accounts for 1 to 2 of the total social emissions dai et al 2021 meanwhile sdg 13 emphasizes the urgent action to deal with the climate change caused by anthropogenic ghg emissions un 2015 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc recommends that the increase of the global average temperature be controlled at 1 5 c to prevent irreversible damage to humans and the ecological environment and that net zero emission of ghg be achieved by 2050 masson delmotte et al 2021 japan the united states and the european union have established relevant legislation and promised to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 schreyer et al 2020 at the 75th united nations general assembly china put forward the goal of carbon peaking in 2030 and carbon neutrality in 2060 mallapaty 2020 therefore the development of low carbon water treatment process is essential to synergistically realize freshwater supply and climate change mitigation desalination is a promising method to increase global freshwater supply global seawater desalination capacity has reached 95 million mt daily in 2018 elsaid et al 2020 while the seawater desalination capacity in china has reached 64 850 mt daily in 2020 resources 2021 desalination technology can be categorized into thermal and membrane methods gude 2016 traditional thermal desalination technologies include multi effect distillation and multi stage flash distillation this process uses fossil fuel as the energy source thus it has a high environmental impact younos 2005 the most common membrane separation methods are electrodialysis ed and reverse osmosis ro gude et al 2010 ed is an efficient membrane separation technology that causes the cations and anions in the saline to migrate directionally through ion exchange membranes under an electrically driven force the ed module consists of positive and negative electrodes alternating cation and anion exchange membranes and alternating concentrated and dilute chambers divided by the membranes the pretreatment requirements and the desalination cost of ed are lower than those of ro under low salinity inlets lopez et al 2017 patel et al 2022 pilat 2001 due to the low pressure on the membrane the lifespan of an ed module is also longer than ro kim 2011 ed can desalinate solutions with different valence and concentration of ions it has been widely used in seawater desalination salt recovery and treatment of industrial wastewater e g high salinity and organic wastewater from chemical and pharmaceutical industries campione et al 2019 2018 electricity is the major resource consumption during ed operation because the power grid in china is dominated by fossil based thermal power generation at present electricity consumption indirectly causes a large amount of ghg emissions however current research on ed mainly focuses on two directions the experimental modification of ion exchange membranes and the ion mass transfer process al amshawee et al 2020 research considering ghg emissions of ed especially from a life cycle perspective are rare to our knowledge ghg emissions from ed module production and disposal are not quantified in current literature thus to promote the use of low carbon ed desalination it is necessary to model the cradle to grave ghg emissions associated with the ed process using life cycle assessment lca lca is a general tool to evaluate the life cycle environmental impact of a targeted object curran 1993 ross and evans 2002 in addition lca can identify the environmental hotspots among the cradle to grave processes for the green design of a product or a technology generally the results from lca can support green product development strategic planning public policy making and marketing at present few lca studies have been reported for the desalination by ed meanwhile quantitative research on its life cycle ghg emissions i e carbon footprint does not include the production and disposal of ed modules the impact of grid decarbonization on the carbon footprint of ed desalination is vital to achieve carbon neutrality lca has been widely applied to other water treatment technologies raluy et al 2006 2004 such as ro multi effect distillation and multi stage flash distillation technologies most of these studies quantified the carbon footprint based on a fixed module and the analysis on the effects of process variables was insufficient the environmental impact of seawater desalination technologies were compared under different electricity mixes and the results showed that applying renewable energies has a high potential to decrease the environmental impact raluy et al 2006 the energy consumption during operation is the hotspot of ghg emission in seawater desalination process which can be greatly reduced by improving energy efficiency integrating energy production systems and applying an electricity production model based mainly on renewable energies raluy et al 2004 thus the carbon footprint of the ed desalination process should be modeled including module production operation and disposal meanwhile the potential change of carbon footprint is also an essential factor for suggesting green designs for future scenarios therefore this study intended to evaluate the current carbon footprint of desalination by ed and quantify the effects of critical process variables different applications and future scenarios toward carbon neutrality first an lca model was developed based on the unit processes associated with ed to reveal the effects of process variables four applications were analyzed freshwater production by seawater desalination simultaneous freshwater and salt production high salinity wastewater treatment and organic solvent desalination scenario analysis was conducted to deduce the change of the carbon footprint with the gradual decarbonization progress which considered the increase of renewable energy capacity in china the application of carbon capture utilization and storage ccus and the promotion of waste recycling contribution analysis was applied to determine the main hotspots of ghg emissions under various circumstances furthermore the influence of critical operating conditions and design parameters on the carbon footprint was clarified by sensitivity analysis to include the technical dimensions in the lca model this deduction method to quantify the potential carbon footprint change during the decarbonization evolution may be widely applied to other water treatment technologies for suggesting low carbon designs 2 methods based on iso14040 iso 14040 2006 iso 14044 2006 the lca framework consists of goal and scope definition life cycle inventory lci life cycle impact assessment lcia and interpretation 2 1 goal and scope definition to compare different ed applications the functional unit is defined as the removal of 1 mt salt the system boundary of this study is mainly divided into three stages the production operation and waste disposal of ed module fig 1 the production stage includes the consumed raw materials and electricity for module manufacturing the ed module mainly includes three parts ion exchange membrane electrode and shell to prevent the increase of membrane resistance and decrease of desalination rate due to membrane fouling the membrane should be cleaned once a month with hydrochloric acid with a mass fraction of 1 for one hour within the service life of the module yang et al 2015 because this study focuses more on the ed desalination process the activated carbon adsorption and sand filtration pretreatment of raw water are considered and the treatment of brine is not considered within the system boundary as it can be discharged back to the seawater brine treatment will be considered within the system boundary in future studies thus the input of the ed operation stage includes the power consumption and membrane cleaning agent the waste disposal stage includes the treatment of the ion exchange membrane electrode and shell according to the investigation and literature incineration is the main method to treat solid waste in china at present guo et al 2018 havukainen et al 2017 thus the waste ion exchange membrane and shell were treated by incineration and the waste electrode was disposed in landfills in this study as the upstream and downstream supply chains are uncertain the transportation of raw materials ed module sale and waste management were not considered 2 2 inventory analysis the inventory data of ed module manufacturing was derived from a field investigation the ecoinvent v3 7 database was used to link the upstream production data of raw materials required for module production unavailable upstream process data in the database were obtained from the material suppliers meanwhile approximate substitution was applied for unavailable waste management processes for example due to the lack of data on electrode disposal similar materials were used instead detailed analysis of inventory data is shown in table 1 and the specific referenced ecoinvent data is shown in table s1 table s1 also includes the inventory of the membrane cleaning agent for the operation process and the activated carbon and sand filtration pretreatment based on factory investigation the power consumption of producing an ed module requires 165 kwh and the power consumption required by the fluid transfer pump is 370 w the conversion loss of high voltage ac to low voltage dc is 91 and the loss of power transmission and distribution is 6 6 detailed parameters of ed module operation are shown in table s5 2 3 impact assessment based on the inventory data in section 2 2 the carbon footprint of ed desalination was calculated using the ipcc 2013 gwp global warming potential 100a method this method normalizes various greenhouse gasses by the weight of carbon dioxide which is usually used to measure the impact on climate change muñoz and schmidt 2016 the lifespan of an ed module is generally five years so the whole device was assumed to be disposed after five years therefore the carbon footprint of ed module production can be calculated using eq 1 1 c f p p i m i k i m w k e 1 l y m where cfp p kg co2 eq mt removed salt is the carbon footprint of ed module production m mt is the total removed salt mi kg is the amount of different raw materials i are the types of raw materials required for module production ki kg co2 eq kg is the cradle to gate ghg emissions of each raw material w kwh is the electricity consumption of ed module production k e kg co2 eq kwh is the carbon footprint of electricity l is the loss ratio of power transmission and distribution from power plant to the user and y is the ac to dc efficiency of the ed power supply equipment the total removed salt of ed during the whole life cycle is given by eq 2 2 m r c q n t 0 001 where r is the desalination ratio c kg l is the inlet salt concentration q l h is the flow rate n year is the module lifespan and t h year is the annual operation time the carbon footprint during the operation can be calculated using eq 3 3 c f p o i u p k e 1 l y r c q m c p t where cfp o kg co2 eq mt removed salt is the carbon footprint of the operation i a is the operation current u v is the operation voltage p w is the power of the pump mc kg co2 eq mt removed salt is the carbon footprint of membrane cleaning and pt kg co2 eq mt removed salt is the carbon footprint of pretreatment the carbon footprint of the waste disposal stage is given by eq 4 4 c f p w j m j k j m where cfp w kg co2 eq mt removed salt is the carbon footprint of the waste disposal stage mj kg is the amount of different waste j is the types of waste and kj kg co2 eq kg is the carbon footprint of waste disposal therefore the total carbon footprint of 1 mt removed salt by ed can be obtained from eq 5 5 c f p c f p p c f p o c f p w 2 4 definition of different applications to investigate the carbon footprint of different ed applications four applications were defined seawater desalination simultaneous freshwater and salt production high salinity wastewater treatment and organic solvent desalination seawater desalination by ed is the basic application for constructing the aforementioned lca model which is developed to quantify the carbon footprint of industrial scale ed processes the other three applications were modified based on the seawater desalination to calculate carbon footprint for the second application the carbon footprint of salt production by evaporating the saturated saline is considered in addition based on the product environmental footprint pef manfredi et al 2012 the recovered salt was regarded as a 50 offset from avoiding production of virgin salt the details of the carbon footprint calculation are shown in si 2 for high salinity wastewater treatment the operating current was calculated from the amount of total removed salt under the same voltage in seawater desalination by ed and the electricity consumption during the operation is obtained for organic solvent desalination we focused on the desalination of ethylene glycol eg with sodium chloride to identify the influence of solvents on the carbon footprint for example the nacl eg solution can be generated from a dechlorination process for the chemical recycling of polyvinyl chloride waste lu et al 2019a tomohito kameda 2008 the detailed inventory data for eg desalination is modeled by the method in si 3 in si 2 5 scenario analysis the carbon footprint based on the current background in china was set as the benchmark scenario the decarbonization of the electricity sector toward carbon neutrality will significantly affect the carbon footprint of ed operation the potential carbon footprint of electricity is modeled by the weighted average of all energy sources according to the predicted electricity mix from 2030 to 2060 zou et al 2017 with the integration of ccus in thermal power generation the power grid will achieve further decarbonization thus the future power grid will be dominated by the combination of renewable energy and thermal power generation combined with ccus xiao et al 2022 the cradle to gate ghg emissions of various energy sources are shown in table s7 the proportion of renewable energy in the power grid and its carbon footprint from 2030 to 2060 are shown in table s8 and the case of thermal power combined with ccus is shown in table s9 in addition the analysis of carbon footprint under different applications based on the deep decarbonization of power grid is shown in si 5 no recycling for wasted ed modules was assumed in the benchmark case however waste recycling will be a significant contribution to carbon neutrality kurniawan et al 2022 where the primary production of raw materials and the corresponding carbon footprint can be greatly reduced according to the manufacturer the metal matrix of the electrode can be completely recycled meanwhile the recovery rate of plastics in china is about 30 plastic recycling association of crra 2020 and the recycling ratio of plastic waste will be further increased with carbon neutrality thus as the electrode matrix is completely recovered and recoated the recovery rate of plastic varies by 20 30 40 and 50 for 2030 2040 2050 and 2060 respectively meanwhile the materials in the end of life ed module are assumed to be recycled in a closed loop manner for module production based on the pef method manfredi et al 2012 the offsets from the recovered materials are allocated to the module production and waste disposal stages at a proportion of 50 the recycled waste can be used to offset the raw materials required for ed module production the detailed data sources of waste recycling disposal are shown in table s3 therefore the carbon footprint in 10 year intervals from 2030 to 2060 was predicted with an increasing proportion of renewable energy and waste recycling in addition to the impact of climate change we added the analysis result of other environmental impacts by recipe 2016 endpoint h such as human health ecosystem and resources under the current power grid as shown in table s11 the carbon footprint of ed seawater desalination under the power grids of different countries is analyzed in table s13 2 6 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis of process variables such as the current flow rate and inlet salt concentration were conducted considering the current efficiency of the ed process the current efficiency can be defined as the ratio of theoretical electricity consumption to a given applied electricity consumption which determines the optimum range of applicability of ed sadrzadeh and mohammadi 2009 principally the ed module should operate at a limit current with the highest current efficiency to balance the desalination efficiency and electricity consumption thus we assumed that the current efficiency is the highest in the different applications in section 2 4 the effect of the current flow rate and inlet salt concentration on the current efficiency in different applications was quantified based on previous studies sadrzadeh and mohammadi 2009 wei et al 2018 the detailed current efficiency for the different applications can be found in table s10 the influence of membrane pairs and membrane area on capacity is taken into account when the number of membrane pairs is doubled and the membrane area is increased by 1 to 4 times the influence of capacity on carbon footprint is analyzed due to the above changes in si 7 the change of carbon footprint of ion exchange membrane and shell made of polypropylene are analyzed under the current power grid in si 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbon footprint analysis of different applications the carbon footprint of four different applications under the benchmark scenario was quantified the results in table 2 show that electricity consumption during ed operation is the main source of ghg emissions because the operation electricity consumption and the carbon footprint of the electricity supplied by fossil based thermal power is too high the first application is seawater desalination there are some studies that show that when the inlet salt concentration is less than 3 g l ed is better for energy consumption and salt removal than ro ro is suitable for desalination with high salinity especially when the inlet salt concentration is greater than 5 g l thus ed is cost effective for desalinating brackish water compared to ro with low salinity lopez et al 2017 patel et al 2021 however it still suffers great challenges such as high ghg emissions electricity consumption and overall cost per cubic meter of water patel et al 2022 singh 2012 the carbon footprint of seawater desalination by ed is 59 74 kg co2 eq mt removed salt the electricity consumption during the operation stage contributes to 99 41 of the ghg emissions in its whole life cycle the high salinity and low electric resistance of seawater result in efficient separation of ions and moderate electricity consumption galama et al 2014 the large amount of removed salt reduces the contribution of the ghg emissions during module production and disposal to the total carbon footprint this result indicates that there is a great potential to design a more energy efficient ed module to reduce the carbon footprint from electricity consumption even though the emissions during the module production and disposal may increase the second application is simultaneous freshwater and salt production although the main product of seawater desalination is freshwater the rejected brine from desalination is a critical environmental issue afrasiabi and shahbazali 2012 al bazedi et al 2013 brine consists of highly concentrated salt organics and other contaminants and the proper disposal of brine represents significant environmental challenges currently several disposal options are surface water discharge deep well injection evaporation ponds and land application pramanik et al 2017 tanaka et al 2003 suggested that using the concentrate wastewater from ed for salt production might be more profitable than using seawater for salt production and save 20 of the energy in japan the brine concentrated by ed is already used in industrial salt production yamabe 1977 therefore ed can realize the simultaneous production of freshwater and salt the carbon footprint of simultaneous freshwater and salt production by ed is 185 69 kg co2 eq mt removed salt which is higher than seawater desalination by ed in the benchmark scenario meanwhile because the output from the concentrated chamber is saturated saline the intensity of ion reverse diffusion from the concentrated chamber to the dilute chamber significantly increases which leads to a decrease in the desalination rate and additional electricity consumption galama et al 2014 furthermore the additional energy consumption during salt production by saline evaporation will result in a large amount of ghg emissions despite of a few offsets from the produced salt the third application is high salinity wastewater treatment high salinity wastewater has a wide range of sources and complex components which is an urgent problem to be solved in industrial wastewater treatment in the treatment of high salinity wastewater with the same concentration the energy consumption of ed is 7 15 kwh m3 which is less than mechanical vapor compression tong and elimelech 2016 even so ed is still energy intensive and high electricity consumption and the carbon footprint is not quantified the carbon footprint of high salinity wastewater treatment is 137 58 kg co2 eq mt removed salt the carbon footprint of electricity consumption during operation accounts for 97 75 which obviously decreases from the value of the benchmark high salinity wastewater has a salinity of 3 g l which has a lower salt content than seawater so that the electric resistance of the solution is high resulting in lower current and desalination efficiency since the amount of removed salt is reduced the proportion of ghg emissions from module production and waste disposal stages slightly increased the fourth application is organic solvent desalination ed is increasingly applied in industries that rely on organic solvents kentish et al 2014 it was estimated that the recovery of eg is essential to the life cycle of the process lu et al 2021 2019b according to a laboratory scale experiment the industrial electricity consumption and desalination rate are estimated by the scaling up based on the difference of the applied voltage and membrane area lu et al 2020 the carbon footprint of organic solvent desalination is 261 63 kg co2 eq mt removed salt module production and waste disposal accounts for 4 17 of the total carbon footprint which is a considerable proportion for ghg reduction due to the electrochemical properties of organic solutions where there are fewer mobile ions the dissociation constant of sodium chloride is far lower than in water kentish et al 2014 thus the electric conductivity of organic solutions is significantly lower than those of aqueous solutions spiegler 1971 this results in reduction of the desalination rate and current efficiency as well as increased electricity consumption therefore the carbon footprint from the production and waste stages is significantly greater compared with those in desalination of aqueous solutions for all applications electricity consumption at the operation stage is the main contributor to ghg emissions meanwhile the critical factors affecting the carbon footprint and the process contribution is the life cycle amount of removed salt and current efficiency therefore predicting the potential change of the carbon footprint with a low carbon power grid is essential for suggesting the optimal design for different applications 3 2 scenario analysis on the potential carbon footprint toward a carbon neutral society based on the defined scenarios in section 2 5 the carbon footprint of electricity consumption would be reduced from 1 03 kg co2 eq kwh in 2020 to 0 06 kg co2 eq kwh in 2060 which indicates that the carbon footprint from electricity consumption can be significantly reduced the carbon footprint of the different applications is shown in fig 2 the sankey diagram of carbon footprint flow direction of the module production operation and waste disposal stages in the different applications are shown in fig 3 the total carbon footprint of seawater desalination by ed in 2060 is reduced by 93 4 compared to that in 2020 the contribution of the production and waste disposal stages would slightly increase to 3 77 although the power grid is substantially decarbonized the operating electricity consumption and allocable removed salt are still large hence there is still a potential to further reduce the carbon footprint from electricity consumption by improving the current efficiency at the same time ghg emissions from the module production and waste disposal stages should be more emphasized with the promotion of deep decarbonization of power grid and waste recycling the carbon footprint of ed in other applications is significantly reduced compared with the benchmark scenario the carbon footprint has been reduced by more than 92 the operation stage is still the largest contributor therefore optimizing the operation current is essential for reducing the carbon footprint in addition the total contribution of module production and waste disposal to ghg emissions has increased significantly for the four applications fig 3 especially that of organic solvent desalination which increased from 4 17 to 22 16 therefore while reducing operation power consumption and improving current efficiency more attention should be paid to module design and waste disposal methods for simultaneous freshwater and salt production by ed the carbon footprint of raw salt production is offset by 50 of the recovered salt its composition and proportion of the total carbon footprint is shown in fig 3 in particular with the decarbonization of power there is little difference between the carbon footprint of simultaneous freshwater and salt production and seawater desalination by ed in 2060 therefore ed will be a very low carbon and feasible method for simultaneous freshwater and salt production the amount of total removed salt is reduced in organic solvent desalination compared with that of aqueous solutions thus more ghg emissions are allocated to module production and waste disposal especially in the low carbon power generation meanwhile power consumption during the operation stage is still the main hotspot of its ghg emissions therefore it is necessary to balance the ghg emissions from the production and waste disposal while reducing electricity consumption to summarize with the low carbon power generation and the promotion of waste recycling the total carbon footprint of ed desalination can be greatly reduced during operation however the carbon footprint of power consumption during the operating stage is the largest especially for desalination of aqueous solutions therefore optimizing the module design and operating control for reducing electricity consumption would still be worthwhile however ghg emissions during the production and waste disposal stages of the ed module are comparable with those of the electricity consumption during the operation stage thus the potential increase of carbon footprint from the module production and disposal stages should be considered when designing an energy saving ed module 3 3 sensitivity analysis of process variables increasing the module lifespan slightly decreases the carbon footprint for all applications fig 4 a according to eqs 1 2 and 4 the module lifespan only affects the carbon footprint of the production and waste stages by changing the total removed salt in addition the carbon footprint from these stages is a minor fraction of the total carbon footprint under the benchmark scenario so increased lifespan has little impact on the carbon footprint however the carbon footprint of high salinity wastewater and organic solvent desalination is more sensitive to the module lifespan because of the reduced removed salt when the current is changed the carbon footprint decreases at values below the baseline and increases above the baseline fig 4b this is because it is assumed that the current baseline has the highest efficiency current efficiency increases as the current is increased below the limit current and decreases when the current is over the limit current wei et al 2018 according to eq 3 and the definition of current efficiency higher electricity consumption will be required for removing certain amounts of salt when the current efficiency is reduced increasing the flow rate decreases the residence time of ions in solution which results in a reduced amount of removed salt under a constant current a larger amount of removed salt has a higher current efficiency based on definition current efficiency consequently the carbon footprint rapidly decreases with the increase of the flow rate below the baseline and then decreases slightly over the baseline as shown in fig 4c when the flow rate is lower than the baseline the amount of removed salt decreases and the reduction rate of carbon footprint slows down as shown in fig 4d the carbon footprint decreases with the increase of inlet salt concentration which leads to the increase of total removed salt therefore a higher inlet salt concentration reduces the carbon footprint by reducing electricity consumption per unit removed salt to summarize the carbon footprint is more sensitive to the operation variables namely current flow rate and inlet salt concentration than the module lifespan these process variables have a non linear relationship with the carbon footprint as the electricity consumption per unit removed salt and desalination rate are comprehensively decided by the process variables in the future it is necessary to establish an lca model integrated with a mechanism based model to optimize the ed process and mitigate ghg emissions 3 4 future prospects according to the lca results based on the current situation in china the operating electricity consumption is the largest contributor of the carbon footprint for all applications therefore to reduce the carbon footprint of ed desalination the design and operation should be modified to significantly reduce the electricity consumption per unit removed salt increasing the membrane area to reduce current density can improve the current efficiency and conserve electricity lee et al 2002 however it will result in extra ghg emissions from the additional production of ion exchange membranes since electricity consumption accounts for more than 92 of ghg emissions in the benchmark case the total carbon footprint can be reduced reduction of electricity consumption during the operation stage will be still important even with a decarbonized grid meanwhile production and disposal of ed modules will become a considerable contributor to ghg emissions especially for the desalination of low salinity solutions and organic solvents meanwhile salt recovery in rejected brine is also a valuable and low carbon technology with the decarbonization of the power grid in addition renewable energy generation is expected to be further decarbonized with greener processes for the production of facilities e g solar panels and wind turbines therefore electricity consumption will be a smaller part of the total carbon footprint for minimizing the total carbon footprint it is necessary to balance the operating electricity consumption and the additional material input for enhancing the energy efficiency of the ed modules there is a great potential to reduce the ghg emissions of ed module production and waste disposal the carbon footprint from heat consumption during the material synthesis will be significantly reduced by using low carbon energy sources such as green hydrogen and geothermal energy bogdanov et al 2021 moreover the promotion of the low carbon materials and recycling of waste materials can further mitigate the ghg emissions from raw material production mangold and von vacano 2022 because conventional lca treats a unit process as a black box with constant or statistical input and output inventory data it can hardly give the technical solutions and the optimal process design for mitigating ghg emissions for instance there are many complex operation variables and design parameters e g membrane area dilute chamber width operating current and flow rate which comprehensively affect the life cycle inventory in addition the non linearity between the process variables and the carbon footprint are revealed in this study for different applications the quantitative relations among the input features desalination rate and current efficiency are also different thus it is difficult to suggest a green design based on expert experience or sensitivity analysis we propose that a mechanism based model of the ed process should be integrated with the lca model to reflect the effect of process variables on material and energy consumption and ultimately the carbon footprint by applying a non linear programming algorithm to the established model qian et al 2022 the optimal design and operating conditions can be quantified for minimizing the carbon footprint under the different application and temporal scenarios 4 conclusions to support the low carbon design of water treatment technologies a case study on the carbon footprint of ed desalination was conducted considering different applications and future scenarios the electricity consumption during operation accounts for more than 92 of the carbon footprint in the benchmark cases therefore at present an energy saving design of the ed process is favorable however with the gradual decarbonization of electricity generation and promotion of waste recycling the total carbon footprint can be significantly reduced meanwhile it is expected that the ed module production and waste disposal will have a considerable contribution to the carbon footprint with a decarbonized grid therefore when adopting an energy efficient design for ed modules at that time the total carbon footprint may increase if more materials are used than in the current design process variables were determined to have a nonlinear relationship with the carbon footprint which reveals the necessity to develop an advanced approach to optimize the process variables thus we suggest a general approach integrating a mechanism based model with the lca model to balance the operating energy consumption and additional ghg emissions from advanced equipment production then the optimal design and operation to minimize the carbon footprint under various scenarios can be determined this suggested strategy can be applied to water treatment processes or other technologies for reducing ghg emissions supporting information additional information related to this research is summarized in the supporting information file declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work

15063,low carbon water production technologies are indispensable for achieving sustainable development goals and mitigating global climate change however at present many advanced water treatment processes lack a systematic assessment of related greenhouse gas ghg emissions thus quantifying their life cycle ghg emissions and proposing strategies toward carbon neutrality is urgently needed this case study focuses on electrodialysis ed an electricity driven desalination technology to analyze the carbon footprint of ed desalination in various applications a life cycle assessment model was developed based on industrial scale ed processes for seawater desalination the carbon footprint is 59 74 kg co2 eq metric ton removed salt which is one order of magnitude lower than that of high salinity wastewater treatment and organic solvent desalination meanwhile the power consumption during operation is the main hotspot of ghg emissions power grid decarbonization and improved waste recycling in china are projected to reduce the carbon footprint up to 92 meanwhile the contribution of operation power consumption is expected to reduce from 95 83 to 77 84 for organic solvent desalination through sensitivity analysis significant non linear impacts of process variables on the carbon footprint were determined therefore it is recommended to optimize the process design and operation to reduce power consumption based on the current fossil based grid ghg reduction for module production and disposal should also be emphasized this method can be extended to general water treatment or other industrial technologies for carbon footprint assessment and reducing ghg emission graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrodialysis desalination life cycle assessment carbon footprint scenario analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the accessibility of freshwater resources is a challenge in modern society because of increasingly serious water pollution caused by human activities the world meteorological organization predicted that 5 billion people worldwide will experience water shortage by 2050 wmo 2021 in 2015 the united nations formulated 17 global sustainable development goals sdgs from the three dimensions of society economy and environment sdg 6 includes the sustainable management of water and environmental sanitation to ensure that everyone has access to clean drinking water un 2015 global production of freshwater is gradually growing to solve the scarcity of freshwater resources however freshwater production requires a large amount of high thermal energy and electricity which results in greenhouse gas ghg emissions gude 2016 it has been estimated that production of 1 metric ton mt freshwater requires approximately 9 to 10 mt of oil and results in environmental degradation through ghg emissions and discharged brine gude 2015 2016 kalogirou 2005 in addition the ghg emission of the water treatment industry accounts for 1 to 2 of the total social emissions dai et al 2021 meanwhile sdg 13 emphasizes the urgent action to deal with the climate change caused by anthropogenic ghg emissions un 2015 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc recommends that the increase of the global average temperature be controlled at 1 5 c to prevent irreversible damage to humans and the ecological environment and that net zero emission of ghg be achieved by 2050 masson delmotte et al 2021 japan the united states and the european union have established relevant legislation and promised to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 schreyer et al 2020 at the 75th united nations general assembly china put forward the goal of carbon peaking in 2030 and carbon neutrality in 2060 mallapaty 2020 therefore the development of low carbon water treatment process is essential to synergistically realize freshwater supply and climate change mitigation desalination is a promising method to increase global freshwater supply global seawater desalination capacity has reached 95 million mt daily in 2018 elsaid et al 2020 while the seawater desalination capacity in china has reached 64 850 mt daily in 2020 resources 2021 desalination technology can be categorized into thermal and membrane methods gude 2016 traditional thermal desalination technologies include multi effect distillation and multi stage flash distillation this process uses fossil fuel as the energy source thus it has a high environmental impact younos 2005 the most common membrane separation methods are electrodialysis ed and reverse osmosis ro gude et al 2010 ed is an efficient membrane separation technology that causes the cations and anions in the saline to migrate directionally through ion exchange membranes under an electrically driven force the ed module consists of positive and negative electrodes alternating cation and anion exchange membranes and alternating concentrated and dilute chambers divided by the membranes the pretreatment requirements and the desalination cost of ed are lower than those of ro under low salinity inlets lopez et al 2017 patel et al 2022 pilat 2001 due to the low pressure on the membrane the lifespan of an ed module is also longer than ro kim 2011 ed can desalinate solutions with different valence and concentration of ions it has been widely used in seawater desalination salt recovery and treatment of industrial wastewater e g high salinity and organic wastewater from chemical and pharmaceutical industries campione et al 2019 2018 electricity is the major resource consumption during ed operation because the power grid in china is dominated by fossil based thermal power generation at present electricity consumption indirectly causes a large amount of ghg emissions however current research on ed mainly focuses on two directions the experimental modification of ion exchange membranes and the ion mass transfer process al amshawee et al 2020 research considering ghg emissions of ed especially from a life cycle perspective are rare to our knowledge ghg emissions from ed module production and disposal are not quantified in current literature thus to promote the use of low carbon ed desalination it is necessary to model the cradle to grave ghg emissions associated with the ed process using life cycle assessment lca lca is a general tool to evaluate the life cycle environmental impact of a targeted object curran 1993 ross and evans 2002 in addition lca can identify the environmental hotspots among the cradle to grave processes for the green design of a product or a technology generally the results from lca can support green product development strategic planning public policy making and marketing at present few lca studies have been reported for the desalination by ed meanwhile quantitative research on its life cycle ghg emissions i e carbon footprint does not include the production and disposal of ed modules the impact of grid decarbonization on the carbon footprint of ed desalination is vital to achieve carbon neutrality lca has been widely applied to other water treatment technologies raluy et al 2006 2004 such as ro multi effect distillation and multi stage flash distillation technologies most of these studies quantified the carbon footprint based on a fixed module and the analysis on the effects of process variables was insufficient the environmental impact of seawater desalination technologies were compared under different electricity mixes and the results showed that applying renewable energies has a high potential to decrease the environmental impact raluy et al 2006 the energy consumption during operation is the hotspot of ghg emission in seawater desalination process which can be greatly reduced by improving energy efficiency integrating energy production systems and applying an electricity production model based mainly on renewable energies raluy et al 2004 thus the carbon footprint of the ed desalination process should be modeled including module production operation and disposal meanwhile the potential change of carbon footprint is also an essential factor for suggesting green designs for future scenarios therefore this study intended to evaluate the current carbon footprint of desalination by ed and quantify the effects of critical process variables different applications and future scenarios toward carbon neutrality first an lca model was developed based on the unit processes associated with ed to reveal the effects of process variables four applications were analyzed freshwater production by seawater desalination simultaneous freshwater and salt production high salinity wastewater treatment and organic solvent desalination scenario analysis was conducted to deduce the change of the carbon footprint with the gradual decarbonization progress which considered the increase of renewable energy capacity in china the application of carbon capture utilization and storage ccus and the promotion of waste recycling contribution analysis was applied to determine the main hotspots of ghg emissions under various circumstances furthermore the influence of critical operating conditions and design parameters on the carbon footprint was clarified by sensitivity analysis to include the technical dimensions in the lca model this deduction method to quantify the potential carbon footprint change during the decarbonization evolution may be widely applied to other water treatment technologies for suggesting low carbon designs 2 methods based on iso14040 iso 14040 2006 iso 14044 2006 the lca framework consists of goal and scope definition life cycle inventory lci life cycle impact assessment lcia and interpretation 2 1 goal and scope definition to compare different ed applications the functional unit is defined as the removal of 1 mt salt the system boundary of this study is mainly divided into three stages the production operation and waste disposal of ed module fig 1 the production stage includes the consumed raw materials and electricity for module manufacturing the ed module mainly includes three parts ion exchange membrane electrode and shell to prevent the increase of membrane resistance and decrease of desalination rate due to membrane fouling the membrane should be cleaned once a month with hydrochloric acid with a mass fraction of 1 for one hour within the service life of the module yang et al 2015 because this study focuses more on the ed desalination process the activated carbon adsorption and sand filtration pretreatment of raw water are considered and the treatment of brine is not considered within the system boundary as it can be discharged back to the seawater brine treatment will be considered within the system boundary in future studies thus the input of the ed operation stage includes the power consumption and membrane cleaning agent the waste disposal stage includes the treatment of the ion exchange membrane electrode and shell according to the investigation and literature incineration is the main method to treat solid waste in china at present guo et al 2018 havukainen et al 2017 thus the waste ion exchange membrane and shell were treated by incineration and the waste electrode was disposed in landfills in this study as the upstream and downstream supply chains are uncertain the transportation of raw materials ed module sale and waste management were not considered 2 2 inventory analysis the inventory data of ed module manufacturing was derived from a field investigation the ecoinvent v3 7 database was used to link the upstream production data of raw materials required for module production unavailable upstream process data in the database were obtained from the material suppliers meanwhile approximate substitution was applied for unavailable waste management processes for example due to the lack of data on electrode disposal similar materials were used instead detailed analysis of inventory data is shown in table 1 and the specific referenced ecoinvent data is shown in table s1 table s1 also includes the inventory of the membrane cleaning agent for the operation process and the activated carbon and sand filtration pretreatment based on factory investigation the power consumption of producing an ed module requires 165 kwh and the power consumption required by the fluid transfer pump is 370 w the conversion loss of high voltage ac to low voltage dc is 91 and the loss of power transmission and distribution is 6 6 detailed parameters of ed module operation are shown in table s5 2 3 impact assessment based on the inventory data in section 2 2 the carbon footprint of ed desalination was calculated using the ipcc 2013 gwp global warming potential 100a method this method normalizes various greenhouse gasses by the weight of carbon dioxide which is usually used to measure the impact on climate change muñoz and schmidt 2016 the lifespan of an ed module is generally five years so the whole device was assumed to be disposed after five years therefore the carbon footprint of ed module production can be calculated using eq 1 1 c f p p i m i k i m w k e 1 l y m where cfp p kg co2 eq mt removed salt is the carbon footprint of ed module production m mt is the total removed salt mi kg is the amount of different raw materials i are the types of raw materials required for module production ki kg co2 eq kg is the cradle to gate ghg emissions of each raw material w kwh is the electricity consumption of ed module production k e kg co2 eq kwh is the carbon footprint of electricity l is the loss ratio of power transmission and distribution from power plant to the user and y is the ac to dc efficiency of the ed power supply equipment the total removed salt of ed during the whole life cycle is given by eq 2 2 m r c q n t 0 001 where r is the desalination ratio c kg l is the inlet salt concentration q l h is the flow rate n year is the module lifespan and t h year is the annual operation time the carbon footprint during the operation can be calculated using eq 3 3 c f p o i u p k e 1 l y r c q m c p t where cfp o kg co2 eq mt removed salt is the carbon footprint of the operation i a is the operation current u v is the operation voltage p w is the power of the pump mc kg co2 eq mt removed salt is the carbon footprint of membrane cleaning and pt kg co2 eq mt removed salt is the carbon footprint of pretreatment the carbon footprint of the waste disposal stage is given by eq 4 4 c f p w j m j k j m where cfp w kg co2 eq mt removed salt is the carbon footprint of the waste disposal stage mj kg is the amount of different waste j is the types of waste and kj kg co2 eq kg is the carbon footprint of waste disposal therefore the total carbon footprint of 1 mt removed salt by ed can be obtained from eq 5 5 c f p c f p p c f p o c f p w 2 4 definition of different applications to investigate the carbon footprint of different ed applications four applications were defined seawater desalination simultaneous freshwater and salt production high salinity wastewater treatment and organic solvent desalination seawater desalination by ed is the basic application for constructing the aforementioned lca model which is developed to quantify the carbon footprint of industrial scale ed processes the other three applications were modified based on the seawater desalination to calculate carbon footprint for the second application the carbon footprint of salt production by evaporating the saturated saline is considered in addition based on the product environmental footprint pef manfredi et al 2012 the recovered salt was regarded as a 50 offset from avoiding production of virgin salt the details of the carbon footprint calculation are shown in si 2 for high salinity wastewater treatment the operating current was calculated from the amount of total removed salt under the same voltage in seawater desalination by ed and the electricity consumption during the operation is obtained for organic solvent desalination we focused on the desalination of ethylene glycol eg with sodium chloride to identify the influence of solvents on the carbon footprint for example the nacl eg solution can be generated from a dechlorination process for the chemical recycling of polyvinyl chloride waste lu et al 2019a tomohito kameda 2008 the detailed inventory data for eg desalination is modeled by the method in si 3 in si 2 5 scenario analysis the carbon footprint based on the current background in china was set as the benchmark scenario the decarbonization of the electricity sector toward carbon neutrality will significantly affect the carbon footprint of ed operation the potential carbon footprint of electricity is modeled by the weighted average of all energy sources according to the predicted electricity mix from 2030 to 2060 zou et al 2017 with the integration of ccus in thermal power generation the power grid will achieve further decarbonization thus the future power grid will be dominated by the combination of renewable energy and thermal power generation combined with ccus xiao et al 2022 the cradle to gate ghg emissions of various energy sources are shown in table s7 the proportion of renewable energy in the power grid and its carbon footprint from 2030 to 2060 are shown in table s8 and the case of thermal power combined with ccus is shown in table s9 in addition the analysis of carbon footprint under different applications based on the deep decarbonization of power grid is shown in si 5 no recycling for wasted ed modules was assumed in the benchmark case however waste recycling will be a significant contribution to carbon neutrality kurniawan et al 2022 where the primary production of raw materials and the corresponding carbon footprint can be greatly reduced according to the manufacturer the metal matrix of the electrode can be completely recycled meanwhile the recovery rate of plastics in china is about 30 plastic recycling association of crra 2020 and the recycling ratio of plastic waste will be further increased with carbon neutrality thus as the electrode matrix is completely recovered and recoated the recovery rate of plastic varies by 20 30 40 and 50 for 2030 2040 2050 and 2060 respectively meanwhile the materials in the end of life ed module are assumed to be recycled in a closed loop manner for module production based on the pef method manfredi et al 2012 the offsets from the recovered materials are allocated to the module production and waste disposal stages at a proportion of 50 the recycled waste can be used to offset the raw materials required for ed module production the detailed data sources of waste recycling disposal are shown in table s3 therefore the carbon footprint in 10 year intervals from 2030 to 2060 was predicted with an increasing proportion of renewable energy and waste recycling in addition to the impact of climate change we added the analysis result of other environmental impacts by recipe 2016 endpoint h such as human health ecosystem and resources under the current power grid as shown in table s11 the carbon footprint of ed seawater desalination under the power grids of different countries is analyzed in table s13 2 6 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis of process variables such as the current flow rate and inlet salt concentration were conducted considering the current efficiency of the ed process the current efficiency can be defined as the ratio of theoretical electricity consumption to a given applied electricity consumption which determines the optimum range of applicability of ed sadrzadeh and mohammadi 2009 principally the ed module should operate at a limit current with the highest current efficiency to balance the desalination efficiency and electricity consumption thus we assumed that the current efficiency is the highest in the different applications in section 2 4 the effect of the current flow rate and inlet salt concentration on the current efficiency in different applications was quantified based on previous studies sadrzadeh and mohammadi 2009 wei et al 2018 the detailed current efficiency for the different applications can be found in table s10 the influence of membrane pairs and membrane area on capacity is taken into account when the number of membrane pairs is doubled and the membrane area is increased by 1 to 4 times the influence of capacity on carbon footprint is analyzed due to the above changes in si 7 the change of carbon footprint of ion exchange membrane and shell made of polypropylene are analyzed under the current power grid in si 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbon footprint analysis of different applications the carbon footprint of four different applications under the benchmark scenario was quantified the results in table 2 show that electricity consumption during ed operation is the main source of ghg emissions because the operation electricity consumption and the carbon footprint of the electricity supplied by fossil based thermal power is too high the first application is seawater desalination there are some studies that show that when the inlet salt concentration is less than 3 g l ed is better for energy consumption and salt removal than ro ro is suitable for desalination with high salinity especially when the inlet salt concentration is greater than 5 g l thus ed is cost effective for desalinating brackish water compared to ro with low salinity lopez et al 2017 patel et al 2021 however it still suffers great challenges such as high ghg emissions electricity consumption and overall cost per cubic meter of water patel et al 2022 singh 2012 the carbon footprint of seawater desalination by ed is 59 74 kg co2 eq mt removed salt the electricity consumption during the operation stage contributes to 99 41 of the ghg emissions in its whole life cycle the high salinity and low electric resistance of seawater result in efficient separation of ions and moderate electricity consumption galama et al 2014 the large amount of removed salt reduces the contribution of the ghg emissions during module production and disposal to the total carbon footprint this result indicates that there is a great potential to design a more energy efficient ed module to reduce the carbon footprint from electricity consumption even though the emissions during the module production and disposal may increase the second application is simultaneous freshwater and salt production although the main product of seawater desalination is freshwater the rejected brine from desalination is a critical environmental issue afrasiabi and shahbazali 2012 al bazedi et al 2013 brine consists of highly concentrated salt organics and other contaminants and the proper disposal of brine represents significant environmental challenges currently several disposal options are surface water discharge deep well injection evaporation ponds and land application pramanik et al 2017 tanaka et al 2003 suggested that using the concentrate wastewater from ed for salt production might be more profitable than using seawater for salt production and save 20 of the energy in japan the brine concentrated by ed is already used in industrial salt production yamabe 1977 therefore ed can realize the simultaneous production of freshwater and salt the carbon footprint of simultaneous freshwater and salt production by ed is 185 69 kg co2 eq mt removed salt which is higher than seawater desalination by ed in the benchmark scenario meanwhile because the output from the concentrated chamber is saturated saline the intensity of ion reverse diffusion from the concentrated chamber to the dilute chamber significantly increases which leads to a decrease in the desalination rate and additional electricity consumption galama et al 2014 furthermore the additional energy consumption during salt production by saline evaporation will result in a large amount of ghg emissions despite of a few offsets from the produced salt the third application is high salinity wastewater treatment high salinity wastewater has a wide range of sources and complex components which is an urgent problem to be solved in industrial wastewater treatment in the treatment of high salinity wastewater with the same concentration the energy consumption of ed is 7 15 kwh m3 which is less than mechanical vapor compression tong and elimelech 2016 even so ed is still energy intensive and high electricity consumption and the carbon footprint is not quantified the carbon footprint of high salinity wastewater treatment is 137 58 kg co2 eq mt removed salt the carbon footprint of electricity consumption during operation accounts for 97 75 which obviously decreases from the value of the benchmark high salinity wastewater has a salinity of 3 g l which has a lower salt content than seawater so that the electric resistance of the solution is high resulting in lower current and desalination efficiency since the amount of removed salt is reduced the proportion of ghg emissions from module production and waste disposal stages slightly increased the fourth application is organic solvent desalination ed is increasingly applied in industries that rely on organic solvents kentish et al 2014 it was estimated that the recovery of eg is essential to the life cycle of the process lu et al 2021 2019b according to a laboratory scale experiment the industrial electricity consumption and desalination rate are estimated by the scaling up based on the difference of the applied voltage and membrane area lu et al 2020 the carbon footprint of organic solvent desalination is 261 63 kg co2 eq mt removed salt module production and waste disposal accounts for 4 17 of the total carbon footprint which is a considerable proportion for ghg reduction due to the electrochemical properties of organic solutions where there are fewer mobile ions the dissociation constant of sodium chloride is far lower than in water kentish et al 2014 thus the electric conductivity of organic solutions is significantly lower than those of aqueous solutions spiegler 1971 this results in reduction of the desalination rate and current efficiency as well as increased electricity consumption therefore the carbon footprint from the production and waste stages is significantly greater compared with those in desalination of aqueous solutions for all applications electricity consumption at the operation stage is the main contributor to ghg emissions meanwhile the critical factors affecting the carbon footprint and the process contribution is the life cycle amount of removed salt and current efficiency therefore predicting the potential change of the carbon footprint with a low carbon power grid is essential for suggesting the optimal design for different applications 3 2 scenario analysis on the potential carbon footprint toward a carbon neutral society based on the defined scenarios in section 2 5 the carbon footprint of electricity consumption would be reduced from 1 03 kg co2 eq kwh in 2020 to 0 06 kg co2 eq kwh in 2060 which indicates that the carbon footprint from electricity consumption can be significantly reduced the carbon footprint of the different applications is shown in fig 2 the sankey diagram of carbon footprint flow direction of the module production operation and waste disposal stages in the different applications are shown in fig 3 the total carbon footprint of seawater desalination by ed in 2060 is reduced by 93 4 compared to that in 2020 the contribution of the production and waste disposal stages would slightly increase to 3 77 although the power grid is substantially decarbonized the operating electricity consumption and allocable removed salt are still large hence there is still a potential to further reduce the carbon footprint from electricity consumption by improving the current efficiency at the same time ghg emissions from the module production and waste disposal stages should be more emphasized with the promotion of deep decarbonization of power grid and waste recycling the carbon footprint of ed in other applications is significantly reduced compared with the benchmark scenario the carbon footprint has been reduced by more than 92 the operation stage is still the largest contributor therefore optimizing the operation current is essential for reducing the carbon footprint in addition the total contribution of module production and waste disposal to ghg emissions has increased significantly for the four applications fig 3 especially that of organic solvent desalination which increased from 4 17 to 22 16 therefore while reducing operation power consumption and improving current efficiency more attention should be paid to module design and waste disposal methods for simultaneous freshwater and salt production by ed the carbon footprint of raw salt production is offset by 50 of the recovered salt its composition and proportion of the total carbon footprint is shown in fig 3 in particular with the decarbonization of power there is little difference between the carbon footprint of simultaneous freshwater and salt production and seawater desalination by ed in 2060 therefore ed will be a very low carbon and feasible method for simultaneous freshwater and salt production the amount of total removed salt is reduced in organic solvent desalination compared with that of aqueous solutions thus more ghg emissions are allocated to module production and waste disposal especially in the low carbon power generation meanwhile power consumption during the operation stage is still the main hotspot of its ghg emissions therefore it is necessary to balance the ghg emissions from the production and waste disposal while reducing electricity consumption to summarize with the low carbon power generation and the promotion of waste recycling the total carbon footprint of ed desalination can be greatly reduced during operation however the carbon footprint of power consumption during the operating stage is the largest especially for desalination of aqueous solutions therefore optimizing the module design and operating control for reducing electricity consumption would still be worthwhile however ghg emissions during the production and waste disposal stages of the ed module are comparable with those of the electricity consumption during the operation stage thus the potential increase of carbon footprint from the module production and disposal stages should be considered when designing an energy saving ed module 3 3 sensitivity analysis of process variables increasing the module lifespan slightly decreases the carbon footprint for all applications fig 4 a according to eqs 1 2 and 4 the module lifespan only affects the carbon footprint of the production and waste stages by changing the total removed salt in addition the carbon footprint from these stages is a minor fraction of the total carbon footprint under the benchmark scenario so increased lifespan has little impact on the carbon footprint however the carbon footprint of high salinity wastewater and organic solvent desalination is more sensitive to the module lifespan because of the reduced removed salt when the current is changed the carbon footprint decreases at values below the baseline and increases above the baseline fig 4b this is because it is assumed that the current baseline has the highest efficiency current efficiency increases as the current is increased below the limit current and decreases when the current is over the limit current wei et al 2018 according to eq 3 and the definition of current efficiency higher electricity consumption will be required for removing certain amounts of salt when the current efficiency is reduced increasing the flow rate decreases the residence time of ions in solution which results in a reduced amount of removed salt under a constant current a larger amount of removed salt has a higher current efficiency based on definition current efficiency consequently the carbon footprint rapidly decreases with the increase of the flow rate below the baseline and then decreases slightly over the baseline as shown in fig 4c when the flow rate is lower than the baseline the amount of removed salt decreases and the reduction rate of carbon footprint slows down as shown in fig 4d the carbon footprint decreases with the increase of inlet salt concentration which leads to the increase of total removed salt therefore a higher inlet salt concentration reduces the carbon footprint by reducing electricity consumption per unit removed salt to summarize the carbon footprint is more sensitive to the operation variables namely current flow rate and inlet salt concentration than the module lifespan these process variables have a non linear relationship with the carbon footprint as the electricity consumption per unit removed salt and desalination rate are comprehensively decided by the process variables in the future it is necessary to establish an lca model integrated with a mechanism based model to optimize the ed process and mitigate ghg emissions 3 4 future prospects according to the lca results based on the current situation in china the operating electricity consumption is the largest contributor of the carbon footprint for all applications therefore to reduce the carbon footprint of ed desalination the design and operation should be modified to significantly reduce the electricity consumption per unit removed salt increasing the membrane area to reduce current density can improve the current efficiency and conserve electricity lee et al 2002 however it will result in extra ghg emissions from the additional production of ion exchange membranes since electricity consumption accounts for more than 92 of ghg emissions in the benchmark case the total carbon footprint can be reduced reduction of electricity consumption during the operation stage will be still important even with a decarbonized grid meanwhile production and disposal of ed modules will become a considerable contributor to ghg emissions especially for the desalination of low salinity solutions and organic solvents meanwhile salt recovery in rejected brine is also a valuable and low carbon technology with the decarbonization of the power grid in addition renewable energy generation is expected to be further decarbonized with greener processes for the production of facilities e g solar panels and wind turbines therefore electricity consumption will be a smaller part of the total carbon footprint for minimizing the total carbon footprint it is necessary to balance the operating electricity consumption and the additional material input for enhancing the energy efficiency of the ed modules there is a great potential to reduce the ghg emissions of ed module production and waste disposal the carbon footprint from heat consumption during the material synthesis will be significantly reduced by using low carbon energy sources such as green hydrogen and geothermal energy bogdanov et al 2021 moreover the promotion of the low carbon materials and recycling of waste materials can further mitigate the ghg emissions from raw material production mangold and von vacano 2022 because conventional lca treats a unit process as a black box with constant or statistical input and output inventory data it can hardly give the technical solutions and the optimal process design for mitigating ghg emissions for instance there are many complex operation variables and design parameters e g membrane area dilute chamber width operating current and flow rate which comprehensively affect the life cycle inventory in addition the non linearity between the process variables and the carbon footprint are revealed in this study for different applications the quantitative relations among the input features desalination rate and current efficiency are also different thus it is difficult to suggest a green design based on expert experience or sensitivity analysis we propose that a mechanism based model of the ed process should be integrated with the lca model to reflect the effect of process variables on material and energy consumption and ultimately the carbon footprint by applying a non linear programming algorithm to the established model qian et al 2022 the optimal design and operating conditions can be quantified for minimizing the carbon footprint under the different application and temporal scenarios 4 conclusions to support the low carbon design of water treatment technologies a case study on the carbon footprint of ed desalination was conducted considering different applications and future scenarios the electricity consumption during operation accounts for more than 92 of the carbon footprint in the benchmark cases therefore at present an energy saving design of the ed process is favorable however with the gradual decarbonization of electricity generation and promotion of waste recycling the total carbon footprint can be significantly reduced meanwhile it is expected that the ed module production and waste disposal will have a considerable contribution to the carbon footprint with a decarbonized grid therefore when adopting an energy efficient design for ed modules at that time the total carbon footprint may increase if more materials are used than in the current design process variables were determined to have a nonlinear relationship with the carbon footprint which reveals the necessity to develop an advanced approach to optimize the process variables thus we suggest a general approach integrating a mechanism based model with the lca model to balance the operating energy consumption and additional ghg emissions from advanced equipment production then the optimal design and operation to minimize the carbon footprint under various scenarios can be determined this suggested strategy can be applied to water treatment processes or other technologies for reducing ghg emissions supporting information additional information related to this research is summarized in the supporting information file declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work

15064,citalopram cit and sertraline ser are highly consumed antidepressants worldwide and have been extensively detected in wastewater due to the incomplete mineralization transformation products tps of them can be detected in wastewater comparing with parent compounds knowledge on tps are limited to fill these research gaps lab scale batch experiments wwtps sampling and in silico toxicity prediction were implemented to investigate the structure occurrence and toxicity of tps based on molecular networking nontarget strategy 13 tps of cit and 12 tps of ser were tentatively identified among them 4 tps from cit and 5 tps from ser were newly found in present study tps identification results compared with results obtained from previous nontarget strategies demonstrated that the excellent performances for molecular networking strategy on candidate tps prioritizing and new tps finding especially for low abundance tps further transformation pathways for cit and ser in wastewater were proposed newly identified tps provided insights on defluorination formylation and methylation for cit and dehydrogenation n malonylation and n acetoxylation for ser transformed in wastewater nitrile hydrolysis and n succinylation were found to be the dominant transformation pathways for cit and ser in wastewater respectively wwtps sampling results shown the concentrations of ser and cit ranged from 0 46 to 28 66 ng l and 17 16 to 58 36 ng l in addition 7 tps of cit and 2 tps of ser found in lab scale wastewater samples were found in wwtps in silico results suggested 2 tps of cit may be more toxic than cit toward all three trophic levels organisms present study provides new insights into the transformation processes of cit and ser in wastewater in addition the necessity of paying more attention on tps was further highlighted from the aspects of toxicity for tps of cit and ser in effluent of wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords molecular networking citalopram sertraline transformation products wastewater nontarget screening data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sertraline ser and citalopram cit the mostly used antidepressants have raised increasing concerns in aquatic environment due to the extensive use frequent detection and adverse effects toward organisms ma et al 2018 minguez et al 2014 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are the major sources of antidepressants discharged into downstream surface water antidepressants are not entirely removed nor mineralized in wwtps which cause the formation of tps maculewicz et al 2022 it has been reported that some tps may remain similar or higher bioactivities compared with parent compounds gornik et al 2020 however knowledge on tps of ser and cit in wastewater was relatively scare beretsou et al 2016 gornik et al 2020 considering the potential ecological risks toward downstream water bodies tps and transformation processes of ser and cit in wastewater should be fully revealed identifying tps is essential to know the toxicity of tps and transformation processes of antidepressants in wastewater nontarget screening based on high resolution mass spectrometry hrms coupled to liquid chromatography lc is commonly used to elucidate the structure of tps bletsou et al 2015 however as the matrix of wastewater samples is highly complex the features for raw data acquired by hrms may be up to tens of thousands which brings huge challenges for candidate tps features prioritizing qiu et al 2021 presently although some methods such as case control strategy stable isotope labeling and mass defect filtering have been put forward li et al 2021 the issues of candidate tps features prioritizing have not been tackled well other than these methods molecular networking a nontarget strategy that has been widely used in metabolomics and the field of natural product identification can be extended into environment field to address this issues watrous et al 2012 the principles of molecular networking is that chemicals with similar structures will share similar fragmentation ions thus by clustering the precursor ions with similar ms2 into the same sub clusters chemicals with similar structures can be quickly found once certain known structures precursor ions can be found in the network aron et al 2020 generally the structure of tps is similar to that of the corresponding parent compounds schollee et al 2017 accordingly the candidate tps features can be quickly screened from the visual network that clusters features with similar ms2 together thus through molecular networking nontarget screening strategy the issues of candidate tps features prioritizing from complex raw spectral data can be effectively addressed identified tps pave the way of exploration on transformation pathways the occurrence and the toxicity of tps in wwtps during wastewater biological treatment processes pharmaceuticals transformed step by step and finally were mineralized to some extent hübner et al 2021 the profile of transformation processes benefits to reveal crucial steps on the removal of target pharmaceuticals which provide insights into measures on enhanced removal of pharmaceuticals in wwtps however knowledge on the transformation processes of cit and ser in wastewater is scarce up to date in addition the occurrence and toxicity of tps were another focus of issues for pharmaceuticals in wastewater compared with parent compounds knowledge on tps in wwtps was limited for example up to date only limited tps of ser and cit such as n desmethyl cit beretsou et al 2016 and norsertraline gornik et al 2020 were detected in wwtps in addition the toxicity of tps has raised increasing concerns because some tps such as gabapentin lactam have been found to be more toxic than parent compounds he et al 2021 therefore the toxicity of identified tps for cit and ser should be assessed in this study molecular networking nontarget strategy was used to identify tps of ser and cit for samples obtained from lab scale batch experiments subsequently transformation pathways of ser and cit were explored in addition the occurrence of ser cit and their tps in 12 wwtps of the region of yangtze river delta was investigated in the end the toxicity of tps was predicted and compared with parent compounds this research will provide holistic information of tps and transformation pathways of cit and ser in wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and consumes the reference standards of cit and ser are all with purity above 95 the solvents used in present study were of high performance liquid chromatography grade methanol hplc grade was purchased from merck darmstadt germany milli q water was prepared from a millipore purification system milli q millipore other chemicals analytical grade were purchased from the nanjing chemical reagent factory china 2 2 batch experiments lab scale batch experiments were carried out to obtain samples for tps identification briefly fresh activated sludge were obtained from the aeration tank of a municipal wwtp of nanjing china firstly after aerating for 12 h activated sludge were diluted to 2000 mg l and incubated in 2 l beakers wrapped in aluminum foil with a reaction volume of 1 l the do concentration was maintained at 2 5 mg l by controlling the air flow rates the ph was maintained at 7 5 0 05 by automatically adding nahco3 stock solution 500 mg l the targeted pharmaceuticals were added to 50 μg l in experiment groups rather than control groups the cod and nh4 n stock solutions were initially added to 300 and 15 mg l respectively and further added every 12 h at the same load during the experimental processes samples were collected by filtering through a 0 45 mm pore size filter xinya shanghai china with 20 ml at time points of 0 0 0 5 2 0 8 0 12 0 24 0 48 0 72 96 and 120 h all the experiments were implemented in triples 2 3 sampling samples preprocessing and detecting instantaneous influent and effluent wastewater samples were obtained in 12 municipal wwtps in october 2021 once the water samples arrive at the lab preparing were implemented including filtering through 0 45um and solid phase extraction three spe columns with different fillers oasis hlb cartridge 6 cc 500 mg waters usa oasis wax cartridge 6 cc 150 mg waters usa and oasis wcx cartridge 6 cc 150 mg waters usa are connected in series to perform spe pre treatment to recover compounds with different properties from wastewater wang et al 2020 finally 1 ml of the concentrated supernatant was filled in a polypropylene vial and stored at 20 c before instrument analysis the qualitative detection of tps was completed by an hplc system perkinelmer usa coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer in esi modes x500r ab sciex usa reversed phase liquid chromatographic separation was performed on an acquity infinity lab poroshell hphc18 column 2 1 100 mm 2 7 µm agilent the injection volume was 10 μl and the flow rate was 0 35 ml min 1 the mobile phase of the gradient elution conditions is presented in text s1 data dependent acquisition dda modes with ms and ms ms ranges of m z 70 1000 and 70 1000 respectively and was followed by five ms2 scans of the most 10 intense ions the collision energy for ms scan was 10 ev the collision energy was set on 35 15 ev the scan time for ms scan and ms2 scan were 0 15 s and 0 06 s respectively other information on parameters for q tof ms were provided in text s1 2 4 molecular networking developing and tps identification raw data were converted into the mzxml format centroid mode using proteowizard msconvert freeware kessner et al 2008 then the peak detection peak deconvolution peak alignment and adduct deducting were completed by msdial ver 4 7 tsugawa et al 2015 detailed information on parameters for data processing by msdial were seen in table s2 subsequently the exported data were uploaded to gnps platform an open access knowledge base for community wide organization and sharing of raw processed or identified tandem mass ms ms spectrometry data and can organize tandem mass ms ms spectrometry data based on molecular networking approach feature based molecular networking fbmn workflow was used to organize lc ms ms data wang et al 2016 parameters were set with a precursor ion mass tolerance of 0 02 da and a fragmentation ion mass tolerance of 0 02 da the minimum cluster size was set to 1 in addition links between nodes were created when the cosine score was greater than 0 50 and the minimum number of common fragment ions shared by two ms ms spectra was set as 2 then the molecular network was visualized by cytoscape 3 5 1 software for the structure elucidation of tps the ms ms spectra were interpreted based on literature database or predicted ms ms by cfm id 2 0 besides the peak area of the identified tps in the samples should be ten times higher than the procedural blank confidence levels were assigned to the identified tps based on the approach proposed by schymanski et al 2014 briefly level 1 corresponds to a structure confirmed by an authentic reference standard with ms ms ms and retention time matching and level 2 corresponds to a probable structure including level 2a with matching literature or library spectrum data and level 2b with diagnosis representing the case where no other structures fit experimental information but no standard or literature information is available for confirmation 2 5 acute toxicity prediction by ecosar the acute toxicity for cit ser and tps were predicted by the ecological structure activity relationships ecosar predictive model version 1 11 developed by the united states environmental protection agency briefly the smiles of targeted chemicals were inputted and the predicted results of acute toxicity toward were chosen to further analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation products identification for citalopram and sertraline in wastewater 3 1 1 candidate features prioritizing and structure elucidating for tps of citalopram through molecular networking based nontarget ms ms data processing for samples of cit transformed in wastewater the global map of network included 12 038 nodes shown as fig s1 then node represented m z of cit were searched from the network and m z of 344 1646 was speculated as cit thus the nodes 21 nodes connected with cit in the same sub cluster were regarded as the candidate tps features fig 1 a similarly the known tps of cit reported previously were taken as the seed nodes to search the sub cluster can contain the likely candidate tps features thus by known tps nodes of m z 344 1646 and 355 1442 other two sub clusters included 14 nodes were found as the candidate tps features fig 1 b and fig 1 c in view of the complicity of ms data for wastewater samples false positive features irrelevant interfering ions may be connected into the same sub cluster and should be filtered to reduce extra workloads for the subsequent structure elucidating schmid et al 2021 based on the thresholds of peak area change folds change 10 table s3 between control and experiment group used by gornik et al 2020 nodes of m z 353 1643 321 1392 429 1827 and 353 168 were filtered as false positive features based on rt and ms2 similar rt and fragmentation 8 nodes colored as cyan were filtered as in source fragments fig 1 thus 25 candidates tps features were finally prioritized as candidate tps features to be structure elucidated the information of edges in molecular networks suggest mass shift and specific transformation reactions which can facilitate structure elucidation of unknown tps starting from the known nodes of m z 325 1705 cit 6 candidate tps nodes m z 341 1658 341 1661 311 1558 323 172 339 1512 and 411 1715 connected with it for node of m z 311 1558 the mass shift of 14 0147 implied the loss of methyl group ms ms suggested that demethylation occurred at the location of nitrogen atoms absence of m z 58 c3h8n implied the transformation of the tertiary amino to secondary amino group thus the identity of m z 311 1558 was proposed as n desmethyl cit cit tp311 this tp was previously found as human metabolites silva et al 2012 and tps formed in wwtps beretsou et al 2016 likewise the structure for other four nodes were successfully elucidated and the detailed process can be found in text s2 taking the same methods nodes in another sub cluster fig 1 b were structure elucidated firstly the nodes represented known tps reported previously were tentatively identified they included nodes of m z 330 149 cit tp330 m z 344 1646 cit tp344 a m z 343 1816 cit tp343 m z 360 1608 cit tp360 and m z 329 1637 cit tp329 beretsou et al 2016 osawa et al 2019 the detailed information on structure and confidence level can be seen in table s5 then nodes represented likely new tps were further structure elucidated based on the neighboring nodes with known structure for node of m z 358 1432 the mass shift of 27 9942 compared with node of m z 330 149 implied the likely formylation from cit tp330 the fragmentation of m z 263 0751 suggested the loss of c5h8no from precursor of m z 358 1432 which validated the structure of formylation for cit tp330 thus node of m z 358 1432 was tentatively identified as cit tp358 a table s5 taking the same methods new tps for nodes of m z 358 1809 m z 344 1661 and m z 374 176 were further structure elucidated text s2 collectively 13 tps were tentatively identified in present study by molecular networking based nontarget strategy table s5 among them cit tp358 a cit tp358 b cit tp344 a and cit tp374 was new tps that not reported in previous literatures information of peak area suggested that the four new tps were all with low peak area except for cit tp358 b table s7 this may be the reason that they were not identified in previous studies beretsou et al 2016 nika et al 2021 in addition the reactions attributed the formation of these four tps were formyl and methylation of carboxylic acid which were not observed previously beretsou et al 2016 therefore the new tps identified in present study will provide insights into the transformation pathway of cit in wastewater biological treatment processes 3 1 2 candidate features prioritizing and structure elucidating for tps of sertraline through molecular networking based nontarget data processing two sub clusters included 43 nodes fig 2 were preliminarily prioritized as candidate tps features from 14 531 features in raw ms ms data fig s2 further manually inspecting the information on rt peak area table s4 and ms2 fig s6 for each nodes nodes represented false positives features 7 nodes isotopes features 15 nodes and in source fragment 1 node were colored as violet pink and cyan in fig 2 thus 20 remaining nodes colored as yellow and green were finally considered as the candidate tps features for subsequently structure elucidating starting from the known structure of node labeled as m z 306 0806 refer to ser 5 nodes refer to candidate tps features connected with ser m z as 404 0798 406 0962 334 0751 364 0884 and 392 0816 based on the known tps found in previous literatures gornik et al 2020 nodes of m z 334 0755 and 406 0962 were firstly annotated as formyl ser and succinylation ser similar ms2 and characteristics fragment then the mass shift implied transformation reactions were used to proposed the structure of likely tps for node of m z 392 0816 mass shift of 86 001 compared with node of m z 306 0806 indicated the additional c3o3h2 was added to ser which implied the likely n malonylation took place for ser by further inspecting the ms ms fragment of m z 275 0262 corresponding to the identity of c16h13cl2 which implied c3o3h2 was added to the side chain of ser gornik et al 2020 thus node of m z 392 0816 was proposed as n malonylation ser ser tp392 at level 2b table s6 ser tp392 was a new tp that has not reported in previous literatures while the n malonylation has been found a common transformation reactions for amides in wastewater gulde et al 2016 the detailed processes of structure elucidating for other nodes can be seen in text s3 collectively 12 tps were tentatively identified and 5 tps among them were newly discovered in present study it can be seen that the peak area of all new tps were relatively low lower than 4000 table s7 which suggested that low abundance candidate tps features cannot be prioritized by traditional nontarget ms ms data processing approach such as case control used by gornik et al 2020 but can be prioritized by molecular networking approach in addition the reactions acetyl n malonylation and son on for forming new tps were almost not reported previously for ser transformed in wastewater gornik et al 2020 which can provide new insights into the transformation processes of ser in wastewater 3 1 3 comprehensive evaluation of tps identification results by molecular network based nontarget strategy in view of that molecular networking based nontarget strategy has not yet been used for tps identifying of micro pollutants in the field of environment the performance of it was compared with case control strategy nontarget screening strategy extensively used previously and tps identified results reported previously beretsou et al 2016 gornik et al 2020 from the aspect of candidate tps features prioritizing through molecular networking based nontarget data processing the disturbing features were quickly filtered to 38 and 43 for cit and ser respectively table 1 however by taking case control approach that most frequently used for tps identifying previously gornik et al 2020 weizel et al 2020 the candidate tps features for cit and ser were high up to 453 and 301 respectively obviously molecular networking greatly outperformed case control strategy for identifying candidate tps features this may be because molecular networks use ms ms data rather than ms information used by case control strategy to identify candidate tps features aron et al 2020 ms ms can reflect the structural information of chemicals similar ms ms was a characteristic relationship between tps and corresponding parent compounds therefore by connecting the nodes with similar ms ms into network map molecular networking can identify the candidate tps features without bringing too many false positive results even for the complex wastewater samples in addition the visual network map can connect redundant features such as isomers adduct ions and in source fragmentations with parent compounds which facilitates filtered these redundant features all of these advantages provides the basis for identifying more tps while reducing unnecessary workloads for subsequent structural elucidating from the aspect of tps identified results 13 and 10 tps were tentatively identified by case control nontarget strategy for cit and ser in previous studies respectively beretsou et al 2016 gornik et al 2020 among these identified tps 7 and 5 tps were same to the results found in present study for other 6 and 5 tps for cit and ser identified in previous studies but not in present study we found no corresponding candidate tps features in the raw data this may be the reason that molecular networking strategy cannot identify them therefore for the known tps molecular networking exhibited performance comparable to case control strategy that extensively used in previous studies further inspecting the total number of tps and new tps it s worth noting that more tps were identified by molecular networking nontarget strategy 13 tps for cit and 12 tps for ser among them 9 tps 4 for cit and 5 for ser were reported for the first time this shows the potential for identifying new tps by molecular networking strategy molecular networking nontarget strategy exhibited superior performance on tps identifying compared with case control nontarget strategy extensively used in previous studies on the one hand molecular networking can facilitate to screen out the candidate tps features from raw ms data but without introducing much false positive features in addition the structure of unknown tps can be more efficiently elucidated by the visual network which facilitates to identify more novel tps in complex environmental samples however it is worth noting that the tps cannot be identified if the ms ms data of they were not acquired based on dda acquisition modes in addition the quality of ms ms also affect the tps identification due to adequate fragmentation ions information for ms ms should be needed for molecular networking nontarget approach collectively this approach deserve to be widely used for the tps identification of micro pollutants in the environmental field 3 2 transformation pathway of citalopram and sertraline in wastewater 3 2 1 transformation pathway of citalopram in wastewater base on the structure logic of parent compound and tps the transformation pathway of cit in wastewater was proposed as seen in fig 3 reactions participated in the transformation of cit mainly included nitrile hydrolysis epoxidation hydroxylation n oxidation n demethylation amide hydrolysis formylation methylation and defluorination defluorination reacton leading to the formation of cit tp323 was not found in wastewater biological transformation processes but in photodegradation process of cit previously osawa et al 2019 formylation and methylation reactions were not observed to participate in the transformation of cit while similar reactions were found for other micro pollutants such as sulfanilamide and diclofenac transformed in wastewater fu et al 2020 hu et al 2022 it should be noted that the newly found transformation processes for cit in wastewater formylation and methylation both attributed the findings of new tps cit tp358 a and cit tp358 b which demonstrated the significance of new tps identified in present study peak areas table s7 results revealed the major tps for cit transformed in activated sludge were cit tp341 b cit tp311 cit tp344 b and cit tp343 which partially consistent with the results reported by beretsou et al 2016 based on the whole transformation processes five main transformation pathways for cit were summarized fig 3 inspecting each pathway for cit transformed in activated sludge pathway ι obviously involved more tps 9 tps therefore nitrile hydrolysis to cit tp343 pathway ι was speculated as the crucial pathway for cit transformed in activated sludge in activated sludge nitrile hydrolysis was observed to be a slower reaction and can be enhanced in carbon limited conditions hübner et al 2021 in addition longer srt has also be found to benefit the reaction of nitrile hydrolysis achermann et al 2018 therefore the crucial transformation pathway found in present provided insight into the methods on enhanced removal of cit in wwtps 3 2 2 transformation pathway of sertraline in wastewater the transformation pathway of ser shown as fig 4 most of reactions such as hydroxylation oxidation n formylation and n succinylation have been reported in previous studies for ser transformed in wastewater gornik et al 2020 however the dehydrogenation of ser tp406 to ser tp404 and ser tp304 to ser tp275 the n malonylation of ser to ser tp392 and the n acetoxylation of ser to ser tp364 were not found in previous studies for ser transformed in wastewater peak areas information indicated that ser tp406 was the major tps table s7 the whole transformation process profiled by fig 4 shown 8 pathways for ser transformed in wastewater previously n succinylation was found to be a characteristics reaction for amine containing micro pollutants gulde et al 2016 however the factors affecting the rate of n succinylation are still unclear in the future the transformation reaction of n succinylation can be further studied to enhance the removal ser in wastewater 3 3 detection of citalopram sertraline and their tps in wwtps the quantitative results of cit and ser in 12 wwtps shown as fig 5 a cit and ser detected in all wastewater samples in influent the concentration of ser and cit ranged from 0 46 to 28 66 ng l and 17 16 to 58 36 ng l respectively obviously the concentration of cit was significantly higher than that of ser t test p 0 05 which implied the larger consumption of cit than ser in the yangtze river delta region china ma et al 2018 the clustering results show three consumption patterns of antidepressants in 12 wwtps cluster 1 sh3 hz cluster 2 wx cz yz nb aq cluster 3 hf sh2 sh1 wz nj fig s3 variance analysis suggested that the concentration of antidepressants in influent was significantly higher in megacity than it in small cities anova test p 0 05 for hz and aq this may be because that larger pressure for people lived under megacity which cause the larger consumption of antidepressants fuentes et al 2018 wilkinson et al 2022 in effluent cit was detected in all samples while the detection percent of ser was only 50 the concentration of cit and ser ranged from 11 81 41 78 ng l and n d 13 17 ng l respectively the average removal rate for cit and ser in 12 wwtps were 43 18 and 72 35 which was comparable to the removal rate reported in wwtps located in usa and europe beretsou et al 2016 then tps were further screened in wastewater samples form 12 wwtps 7 tps of cit and 2 tps of ser were found in wwtps comparing with tps identified in lab scale batch experiments we found that number of tps found in practical wwtps was less the reasons may be that the lower concentration of tps in practical wwtps for examples the tps were not detected in wwtps but found in lab scale batch experiments were all low abundance tps the peak area information in influent and effluent shown as fig s4 cit tp323 cit tp339 and cit tp311 were the dominant tps in influent which indicated these three tps may came from human metabolites previously beretsou et al 2016 suggested urine was an important source for tps detected in wwtps the dominant tps detected in effluent were cit tp374 cit tp330 cit tp311 and cit tp343 which was partially consistent with the results found in lab scale experiment the higher accumulation of peak area for tps of cit in influent comparing with it in effluent suggested that human metabolites was an important source for tps of cit in wwtps however the peak area in the inf luent was higher than that in the effluent for the tps of ser this implied that tps of ser mostly came from the biotransformation process in wwtps the dominant tps of ser in influent and effluent samples was ser tp406 which was consistent with the result found in lab scale experiment the tps available to reference standards were quantified and shown in fig 5 b the concentration of cit tp341 b and cit tp339 were 0 03 0 65 ng l and 0 87 2 12 ng l obviously cit tp339 was dominant tps based on quantified results which was ten folds higher than the concentration of cit tp341 b comparing with the parent compound of cit the sum of concentration of cit tp339 and cit tp341 b accounted for 6 7 of the concentration of cit in effluent of wwtp which suggested that the parent compound is the main form of cit in effluent of wwtps however it is worth noting that only two of the seven tps available reference standards detected in wwtps were quantified the total concentration of all tps may accounted for a considerable proportion of loads for cit in effluent and deserved to be further studied in the future 3 4 predicted toxicity for citalopram and sertraline in wastewater details of prediction toxicity of cit and ser were described in section 2 4 and fig 6 based on the results for acute toxicity by ecosar for endpoint of fish 96 h lc50 most of tps presented lower toxicity compared to ser and cit with the exception of ser tp275 cit tp358 b and cit tp344 a for endpoint of daphnid 48 h lc50 ser tp275 cit tp358 b and cit tp344 a exhibited higher toxicity compared to parent compound for endpoint of green algae 96 h lc50 cit tp358 b and cit tp344 a has higher toxicity than cit it should be noted that the tps with higher toxicity only were detected in lab scale batch experiments were all newly identified tps in present study further inspecting toxicity for tps detected in practical wwtps we found that the toxicity of ser tp334 a and cit tp311 comparable to ser and cit respectively however all the other tps 5 tps cit tp339 cit tp341 b cit tp374 cit tp330 and cit tp343 from cit and 1 tps ser tp406 from ser found in wwtps were toxicity low than their corresponding parent compounds the reason for tps with higher toxicity ser tp275 cit tp358 b and cit tp344 a was not detected in wwtps may be that the concentration of these tps in wwtps is below the detection limit of instrument for cit tp358 b and cit tp344 a the enhanced toxicity can be observed to be the methylation at carboxyl sites similar transformation reactions has also been found for diclofenac transformed during biological treatment processes which have also caused the enhanced toxicity of tps compared with diclofenac fu et al 2020 for ser tp275 similar transformation reactions attributed to the enhanced toxicity has not been found previously the toxicity of tps formed by similar transformation reactions should be paid attention in the future collectively these result indicated that the biological treatment processes generally cause toxicity reduction for compounds while certain tps with higher toxicity can also be occasionally formed during the processes similar results has also been observed for gabapentin lactam higher toxicity for tps he et al 2021 methylation triclosan bedoux et al 2012 and acridone from carbamazepine leclercq et al 2009 in previous literatures which raised increasing concern on the toxicity of tps present study provide powerful tool of molecular network based nontarget strategy to identify tps which is especially suitable for samples obtained from complex environmental matrices in addition by in silico prediction strategy two tps only detect in lab scale batch experiments but not detect in practical wwtps of cit were found to may be with higher toxicity than parent compound which suggested that not all tps were toxicity reduction during biological transformation processes therefore tps of pharmaceuticals in wastewater should be paid the same attention compared with parent compounds in the future 4 conclusion in this study molecular network based nontarget strategy was used to identify tps of cit and ser based on lab scale batch experiments further the occurrence of cit ser and their tps were investigated for wastewater samples obtained from 12 wwtps in yangtze river delta region then the acute toxicity of tps and parent compounds were predicted and compared by in silico method the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 13 tps from cit and 12 tps from ser were tentatively identified by molecular networking methods among them 10 tps 4 for cit and 5 for ser were newly found based on tps identification results molecular networking exhibit great advantages for candidate tps prioritizing and new tps finding compared with traditional nontarget strategies 2 transformation pathway were proposed for cit and ser in wastewater nitrile hydrolysis and n succinylation were speculated as the major transformation pathways for cit and ser in wastewater respectively cit tp341 b and ser tp406 were the dominant tps during transformation processes 3 the concentration of ser and cit at the ng l level in wastewater the accumulative peak area information suggested that tps may account a larger proportion compared with corresponding parent compounds in effluent of wwtps 4 predicted toxicity results suggested that most of tps presented lower toxicity than their corresponding

15064,citalopram cit and sertraline ser are highly consumed antidepressants worldwide and have been extensively detected in wastewater due to the incomplete mineralization transformation products tps of them can be detected in wastewater comparing with parent compounds knowledge on tps are limited to fill these research gaps lab scale batch experiments wwtps sampling and in silico toxicity prediction were implemented to investigate the structure occurrence and toxicity of tps based on molecular networking nontarget strategy 13 tps of cit and 12 tps of ser were tentatively identified among them 4 tps from cit and 5 tps from ser were newly found in present study tps identification results compared with results obtained from previous nontarget strategies demonstrated that the excellent performances for molecular networking strategy on candidate tps prioritizing and new tps finding especially for low abundance tps further transformation pathways for cit and ser in wastewater were proposed newly identified tps provided insights on defluorination formylation and methylation for cit and dehydrogenation n malonylation and n acetoxylation for ser transformed in wastewater nitrile hydrolysis and n succinylation were found to be the dominant transformation pathways for cit and ser in wastewater respectively wwtps sampling results shown the concentrations of ser and cit ranged from 0 46 to 28 66 ng l and 17 16 to 58 36 ng l in addition 7 tps of cit and 2 tps of ser found in lab scale wastewater samples were found in wwtps in silico results suggested 2 tps of cit may be more toxic than cit toward all three trophic levels organisms present study provides new insights into the transformation processes of cit and ser in wastewater in addition the necessity of paying more attention on tps was further highlighted from the aspects of toxicity for tps of cit and ser in effluent of wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords molecular networking citalopram sertraline transformation products wastewater nontarget screening data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sertraline ser and citalopram cit the mostly used antidepressants have raised increasing concerns in aquatic environment due to the extensive use frequent detection and adverse effects toward organisms ma et al 2018 minguez et al 2014 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are the major sources of antidepressants discharged into downstream surface water antidepressants are not entirely removed nor mineralized in wwtps which cause the formation of tps maculewicz et al 2022 it has been reported that some tps may remain similar or higher bioactivities compared with parent compounds gornik et al 2020 however knowledge on tps of ser and cit in wastewater was relatively scare beretsou et al 2016 gornik et al 2020 considering the potential ecological risks toward downstream water bodies tps and transformation processes of ser and cit in wastewater should be fully revealed identifying tps is essential to know the toxicity of tps and transformation processes of antidepressants in wastewater nontarget screening based on high resolution mass spectrometry hrms coupled to liquid chromatography lc is commonly used to elucidate the structure of tps bletsou et al 2015 however as the matrix of wastewater samples is highly complex the features for raw data acquired by hrms may be up to tens of thousands which brings huge challenges for candidate tps features prioritizing qiu et al 2021 presently although some methods such as case control strategy stable isotope labeling and mass defect filtering have been put forward li et al 2021 the issues of candidate tps features prioritizing have not been tackled well other than these methods molecular networking a nontarget strategy that has been widely used in metabolomics and the field of natural product identification can be extended into environment field to address this issues watrous et al 2012 the principles of molecular networking is that chemicals with similar structures will share similar fragmentation ions thus by clustering the precursor ions with similar ms2 into the same sub clusters chemicals with similar structures can be quickly found once certain known structures precursor ions can be found in the network aron et al 2020 generally the structure of tps is similar to that of the corresponding parent compounds schollee et al 2017 accordingly the candidate tps features can be quickly screened from the visual network that clusters features with similar ms2 together thus through molecular networking nontarget screening strategy the issues of candidate tps features prioritizing from complex raw spectral data can be effectively addressed identified tps pave the way of exploration on transformation pathways the occurrence and the toxicity of tps in wwtps during wastewater biological treatment processes pharmaceuticals transformed step by step and finally were mineralized to some extent hübner et al 2021 the profile of transformation processes benefits to reveal crucial steps on the removal of target pharmaceuticals which provide insights into measures on enhanced removal of pharmaceuticals in wwtps however knowledge on the transformation processes of cit and ser in wastewater is scarce up to date in addition the occurrence and toxicity of tps were another focus of issues for pharmaceuticals in wastewater compared with parent compounds knowledge on tps in wwtps was limited for example up to date only limited tps of ser and cit such as n desmethyl cit beretsou et al 2016 and norsertraline gornik et al 2020 were detected in wwtps in addition the toxicity of tps has raised increasing concerns because some tps such as gabapentin lactam have been found to be more toxic than parent compounds he et al 2021 therefore the toxicity of identified tps for cit and ser should be assessed in this study molecular networking nontarget strategy was used to identify tps of ser and cit for samples obtained from lab scale batch experiments subsequently transformation pathways of ser and cit were explored in addition the occurrence of ser cit and their tps in 12 wwtps of the region of yangtze river delta was investigated in the end the toxicity of tps was predicted and compared with parent compounds this research will provide holistic information of tps and transformation pathways of cit and ser in wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and consumes the reference standards of cit and ser are all with purity above 95 the solvents used in present study were of high performance liquid chromatography grade methanol hplc grade was purchased from merck darmstadt germany milli q water was prepared from a millipore purification system milli q millipore other chemicals analytical grade were purchased from the nanjing chemical reagent factory china 2 2 batch experiments lab scale batch experiments were carried out to obtain samples for tps identification briefly fresh activated sludge were obtained from the aeration tank of a municipal wwtp of nanjing china firstly after aerating for 12 h activated sludge were diluted to 2000 mg l and incubated in 2 l beakers wrapped in aluminum foil with a reaction volume of 1 l the do concentration was maintained at 2 5 mg l by controlling the air flow rates the ph was maintained at 7 5 0 05 by automatically adding nahco3 stock solution 500 mg l the targeted pharmaceuticals were added to 50 μg l in experiment groups rather than control groups the cod and nh4 n stock solutions were initially added to 300 and 15 mg l respectively and further added every 12 h at the same load during the experimental processes samples were collected by filtering through a 0 45 mm pore size filter xinya shanghai china with 20 ml at time points of 0 0 0 5 2 0 8 0 12 0 24 0 48 0 72 96 and 120 h all the experiments were implemented in triples 2 3 sampling samples preprocessing and detecting instantaneous influent and effluent wastewater samples were obtained in 12 municipal wwtps in october 2021 once the water samples arrive at the lab preparing were implemented including filtering through 0 45um and solid phase extraction three spe columns with different fillers oasis hlb cartridge 6 cc 500 mg waters usa oasis wax cartridge 6 cc 150 mg waters usa and oasis wcx cartridge 6 cc 150 mg waters usa are connected in series to perform spe pre treatment to recover compounds with different properties from wastewater wang et al 2020 finally 1 ml of the concentrated supernatant was filled in a polypropylene vial and stored at 20 c before instrument analysis the qualitative detection of tps was completed by an hplc system perkinelmer usa coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer in esi modes x500r ab sciex usa reversed phase liquid chromatographic separation was performed on an acquity infinity lab poroshell hphc18 column 2 1 100 mm 2 7 µm agilent the injection volume was 10 μl and the flow rate was 0 35 ml min 1 the mobile phase of the gradient elution conditions is presented in text s1 data dependent acquisition dda modes with ms and ms ms ranges of m z 70 1000 and 70 1000 respectively and was followed by five ms2 scans of the most 10 intense ions the collision energy for ms scan was 10 ev the collision energy was set on 35 15 ev the scan time for ms scan and ms2 scan were 0 15 s and 0 06 s respectively other information on parameters for q tof ms were provided in text s1 2 4 molecular networking developing and tps identification raw data were converted into the mzxml format centroid mode using proteowizard msconvert freeware kessner et al 2008 then the peak detection peak deconvolution peak alignment and adduct deducting were completed by msdial ver 4 7 tsugawa et al 2015 detailed information on parameters for data processing by msdial were seen in table s2 subsequently the exported data were uploaded to gnps platform an open access knowledge base for community wide organization and sharing of raw processed or identified tandem mass ms ms spectrometry data and can organize tandem mass ms ms spectrometry data based on molecular networking approach feature based molecular networking fbmn workflow was used to organize lc ms ms data wang et al 2016 parameters were set with a precursor ion mass tolerance of 0 02 da and a fragmentation ion mass tolerance of 0 02 da the minimum cluster size was set to 1 in addition links between nodes were created when the cosine score was greater than 0 50 and the minimum number of common fragment ions shared by two ms ms spectra was set as 2 then the molecular network was visualized by cytoscape 3 5 1 software for the structure elucidation of tps the ms ms spectra were interpreted based on literature database or predicted ms ms by cfm id 2 0 besides the peak area of the identified tps in the samples should be ten times higher than the procedural blank confidence levels were assigned to the identified tps based on the approach proposed by schymanski et al 2014 briefly level 1 corresponds to a structure confirmed by an authentic reference standard with ms ms ms and retention time matching and level 2 corresponds to a probable structure including level 2a with matching literature or library spectrum data and level 2b with diagnosis representing the case where no other structures fit experimental information but no standard or literature information is available for confirmation 2 5 acute toxicity prediction by ecosar the acute toxicity for cit ser and tps were predicted by the ecological structure activity relationships ecosar predictive model version 1 11 developed by the united states environmental protection agency briefly the smiles of targeted chemicals were inputted and the predicted results of acute toxicity toward were chosen to further analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation products identification for citalopram and sertraline in wastewater 3 1 1 candidate features prioritizing and structure elucidating for tps of citalopram through molecular networking based nontarget ms ms data processing for samples of cit transformed in wastewater the global map of network included 12 038 nodes shown as fig s1 then node represented m z of cit were searched from the network and m z of 344 1646 was speculated as cit thus the nodes 21 nodes connected with cit in the same sub cluster were regarded as the candidate tps features fig 1 a similarly the known tps of cit reported previously were taken as the seed nodes to search the sub cluster can contain the likely candidate tps features thus by known tps nodes of m z 344 1646 and 355 1442 other two sub clusters included 14 nodes were found as the candidate tps features fig 1 b and fig 1 c in view of the complicity of ms data for wastewater samples false positive features irrelevant interfering ions may be connected into the same sub cluster and should be filtered to reduce extra workloads for the subsequent structure elucidating schmid et al 2021 based on the thresholds of peak area change folds change 10 table s3 between control and experiment group used by gornik et al 2020 nodes of m z 353 1643 321 1392 429 1827 and 353 168 were filtered as false positive features based on rt and ms2 similar rt and fragmentation 8 nodes colored as cyan were filtered as in source fragments fig 1 thus 25 candidates tps features were finally prioritized as candidate tps features to be structure elucidated the information of edges in molecular networks suggest mass shift and specific transformation reactions which can facilitate structure elucidation of unknown tps starting from the known nodes of m z 325 1705 cit 6 candidate tps nodes m z 341 1658 341 1661 311 1558 323 172 339 1512 and 411 1715 connected with it for node of m z 311 1558 the mass shift of 14 0147 implied the loss of methyl group ms ms suggested that demethylation occurred at the location of nitrogen atoms absence of m z 58 c3h8n implied the transformation of the tertiary amino to secondary amino group thus the identity of m z 311 1558 was proposed as n desmethyl cit cit tp311 this tp was previously found as human metabolites silva et al 2012 and tps formed in wwtps beretsou et al 2016 likewise the structure for other four nodes were successfully elucidated and the detailed process can be found in text s2 taking the same methods nodes in another sub cluster fig 1 b were structure elucidated firstly the nodes represented known tps reported previously were tentatively identified they included nodes of m z 330 149 cit tp330 m z 344 1646 cit tp344 a m z 343 1816 cit tp343 m z 360 1608 cit tp360 and m z 329 1637 cit tp329 beretsou et al 2016 osawa et al 2019 the detailed information on structure and confidence level can be seen in table s5 then nodes represented likely new tps were further structure elucidated based on the neighboring nodes with known structure for node of m z 358 1432 the mass shift of 27 9942 compared with node of m z 330 149 implied the likely formylation from cit tp330 the fragmentation of m z 263 0751 suggested the loss of c5h8no from precursor of m z 358 1432 which validated the structure of formylation for cit tp330 thus node of m z 358 1432 was tentatively identified as cit tp358 a table s5 taking the same methods new tps for nodes of m z 358 1809 m z 344 1661 and m z 374 176 were further structure elucidated text s2 collectively 13 tps were tentatively identified in present study by molecular networking based nontarget strategy table s5 among them cit tp358 a cit tp358 b cit tp344 a and cit tp374 was new tps that not reported in previous literatures information of peak area suggested that the four new tps were all with low peak area except for cit tp358 b table s7 this may be the reason that they were not identified in previous studies beretsou et al 2016 nika et al 2021 in addition the reactions attributed the formation of these four tps were formyl and methylation of carboxylic acid which were not observed previously beretsou et al 2016 therefore the new tps identified in present study will provide insights into the transformation pathway of cit in wastewater biological treatment processes 3 1 2 candidate features prioritizing and structure elucidating for tps of sertraline through molecular networking based nontarget data processing two sub clusters included 43 nodes fig 2 were preliminarily prioritized as candidate tps features from 14 531 features in raw ms ms data fig s2 further manually inspecting the information on rt peak area table s4 and ms2 fig s6 for each nodes nodes represented false positives features 7 nodes isotopes features 15 nodes and in source fragment 1 node were colored as violet pink and cyan in fig 2 thus 20 remaining nodes colored as yellow and green were finally considered as the candidate tps features for subsequently structure elucidating starting from the known structure of node labeled as m z 306 0806 refer to ser 5 nodes refer to candidate tps features connected with ser m z as 404 0798 406 0962 334 0751 364 0884 and 392 0816 based on the known tps found in previous literatures gornik et al 2020 nodes of m z 334 0755 and 406 0962 were firstly annotated as formyl ser and succinylation ser similar ms2 and characteristics fragment then the mass shift implied transformation reactions were used to proposed the structure of likely tps for node of m z 392 0816 mass shift of 86 001 compared with node of m z 306 0806 indicated the additional c3o3h2 was added to ser which implied the likely n malonylation took place for ser by further inspecting the ms ms fragment of m z 275 0262 corresponding to the identity of c16h13cl2 which implied c3o3h2 was added to the side chain of ser gornik et al 2020 thus node of m z 392 0816 was proposed as n malonylation ser ser tp392 at level 2b table s6 ser tp392 was a new tp that has not reported in previous literatures while the n malonylation has been found a common transformation reactions for amides in wastewater gulde et al 2016 the detailed processes of structure elucidating for other nodes can be seen in text s3 collectively 12 tps were tentatively identified and 5 tps among them were newly discovered in present study it can be seen that the peak area of all new tps were relatively low lower than 4000 table s7 which suggested that low abundance candidate tps features cannot be prioritized by traditional nontarget ms ms data processing approach such as case control used by gornik et al 2020 but can be prioritized by molecular networking approach in addition the reactions acetyl n malonylation and son on for forming new tps were almost not reported previously for ser transformed in wastewater gornik et al 2020 which can provide new insights into the transformation processes of ser in wastewater 3 1 3 comprehensive evaluation of tps identification results by molecular network based nontarget strategy in view of that molecular networking based nontarget strategy has not yet been used for tps identifying of micro pollutants in the field of environment the performance of it was compared with case control strategy nontarget screening strategy extensively used previously and tps identified results reported previously beretsou et al 2016 gornik et al 2020 from the aspect of candidate tps features prioritizing through molecular networking based nontarget data processing the disturbing features were quickly filtered to 38 and 43 for cit and ser respectively table 1 however by taking case control approach that most frequently used for tps identifying previously gornik et al 2020 weizel et al 2020 the candidate tps features for cit and ser were high up to 453 and 301 respectively obviously molecular networking greatly outperformed case control strategy for identifying candidate tps features this may be because molecular networks use ms ms data rather than ms information used by case control strategy to identify candidate tps features aron et al 2020 ms ms can reflect the structural information of chemicals similar ms ms was a characteristic relationship between tps and corresponding parent compounds therefore by connecting the nodes with similar ms ms into network map molecular networking can identify the candidate tps features without bringing too many false positive results even for the complex wastewater samples in addition the visual network map can connect redundant features such as isomers adduct ions and in source fragmentations with parent compounds which facilitates filtered these redundant features all of these advantages provides the basis for identifying more tps while reducing unnecessary workloads for subsequent structural elucidating from the aspect of tps identified results 13 and 10 tps were tentatively identified by case control nontarget strategy for cit and ser in previous studies respectively beretsou et al 2016 gornik et al 2020 among these identified tps 7 and 5 tps were same to the results found in present study for other 6 and 5 tps for cit and ser identified in previous studies but not in present study we found no corresponding candidate tps features in the raw data this may be the reason that molecular networking strategy cannot identify them therefore for the known tps molecular networking exhibited performance comparable to case control strategy that extensively used in previous studies further inspecting the total number of tps and new tps it s worth noting that more tps were identified by molecular networking nontarget strategy 13 tps for cit and 12 tps for ser among them 9 tps 4 for cit and 5 for ser were reported for the first time this shows the potential for identifying new tps by molecular networking strategy molecular networking nontarget strategy exhibited superior performance on tps identifying compared with case control nontarget strategy extensively used in previous studies on the one hand molecular networking can facilitate to screen out the candidate tps features from raw ms data but without introducing much false positive features in addition the structure of unknown tps can be more efficiently elucidated by the visual network which facilitates to identify more novel tps in complex environmental samples however it is worth noting that the tps cannot be identified if the ms ms data of they were not acquired based on dda acquisition modes in addition the quality of ms ms also affect the tps identification due to adequate fragmentation ions information for ms ms should be needed for molecular networking nontarget approach collectively this approach deserve to be widely used for the tps identification of micro pollutants in the environmental field 3 2 transformation pathway of citalopram and sertraline in wastewater 3 2 1 transformation pathway of citalopram in wastewater base on the structure logic of parent compound and tps the transformation pathway of cit in wastewater was proposed as seen in fig 3 reactions participated in the transformation of cit mainly included nitrile hydrolysis epoxidation hydroxylation n oxidation n demethylation amide hydrolysis formylation methylation and defluorination defluorination reacton leading to the formation of cit tp323 was not found in wastewater biological transformation processes but in photodegradation process of cit previously osawa et al 2019 formylation and methylation reactions were not observed to participate in the transformation of cit while similar reactions were found for other micro pollutants such as sulfanilamide and diclofenac transformed in wastewater fu et al 2020 hu et al 2022 it should be noted that the newly found transformation processes for cit in wastewater formylation and methylation both attributed the findings of new tps cit tp358 a and cit tp358 b which demonstrated the significance of new tps identified in present study peak areas table s7 results revealed the major tps for cit transformed in activated sludge were cit tp341 b cit tp311 cit tp344 b and cit tp343 which partially consistent with the results reported by beretsou et al 2016 based on the whole transformation processes five main transformation pathways for cit were summarized fig 3 inspecting each pathway for cit transformed in activated sludge pathway ι obviously involved more tps 9 tps therefore nitrile hydrolysis to cit tp343 pathway ι was speculated as the crucial pathway for cit transformed in activated sludge in activated sludge nitrile hydrolysis was observed to be a slower reaction and can be enhanced in carbon limited conditions hübner et al 2021 in addition longer srt has also be found to benefit the reaction of nitrile hydrolysis achermann et al 2018 therefore the crucial transformation pathway found in present provided insight into the methods on enhanced removal of cit in wwtps 3 2 2 transformation pathway of sertraline in wastewater the transformation pathway of ser shown as fig 4 most of reactions such as hydroxylation oxidation n formylation and n succinylation have been reported in previous studies for ser transformed in wastewater gornik et al 2020 however the dehydrogenation of ser tp406 to ser tp404 and ser tp304 to ser tp275 the n malonylation of ser to ser tp392 and the n acetoxylation of ser to ser tp364 were not found in previous studies for ser transformed in wastewater peak areas information indicated that ser tp406 was the major tps table s7 the whole transformation process profiled by fig 4 shown 8 pathways for ser transformed in wastewater previously n succinylation was found to be a characteristics reaction for amine containing micro pollutants gulde et al 2016 however the factors affecting the rate of n succinylation are still unclear in the future the transformation reaction of n succinylation can be further studied to enhance the removal ser in wastewater 3 3 detection of citalopram sertraline and their tps in wwtps the quantitative results of cit and ser in 12 wwtps shown as fig 5 a cit and ser detected in all wastewater samples in influent the concentration of ser and cit ranged from 0 46 to 28 66 ng l and 17 16 to 58 36 ng l respectively obviously the concentration of cit was significantly higher than that of ser t test p 0 05 which implied the larger consumption of cit than ser in the yangtze river delta region china ma et al 2018 the clustering results show three consumption patterns of antidepressants in 12 wwtps cluster 1 sh3 hz cluster 2 wx cz yz nb aq cluster 3 hf sh2 sh1 wz nj fig s3 variance analysis suggested that the concentration of antidepressants in influent was significantly higher in megacity than it in small cities anova test p 0 05 for hz and aq this may be because that larger pressure for people lived under megacity which cause the larger consumption of antidepressants fuentes et al 2018 wilkinson et al 2022 in effluent cit was detected in all samples while the detection percent of ser was only 50 the concentration of cit and ser ranged from 11 81 41 78 ng l and n d 13 17 ng l respectively the average removal rate for cit and ser in 12 wwtps were 43 18 and 72 35 which was comparable to the removal rate reported in wwtps located in usa and europe beretsou et al 2016 then tps were further screened in wastewater samples form 12 wwtps 7 tps of cit and 2 tps of ser were found in wwtps comparing with tps identified in lab scale batch experiments we found that number of tps found in practical wwtps was less the reasons may be that the lower concentration of tps in practical wwtps for examples the tps were not detected in wwtps but found in lab scale batch experiments were all low abundance tps the peak area information in influent and effluent shown as fig s4 cit tp323 cit tp339 and cit tp311 were the dominant tps in influent which indicated these three tps may came from human metabolites previously beretsou et al 2016 suggested urine was an important source for tps detected in wwtps the dominant tps detected in effluent were cit tp374 cit tp330 cit tp311 and cit tp343 which was partially consistent with the results found in lab scale experiment the higher accumulation of peak area for tps of cit in influent comparing with it in effluent suggested that human metabolites was an important source for tps of cit in wwtps however the peak area in the inf luent was higher than that in the effluent for the tps of ser this implied that tps of ser mostly came from the biotransformation process in wwtps the dominant tps of ser in influent and effluent samples was ser tp406 which was consistent with the result found in lab scale experiment the tps available to reference standards were quantified and shown in fig 5 b the concentration of cit tp341 b and cit tp339 were 0 03 0 65 ng l and 0 87 2 12 ng l obviously cit tp339 was dominant tps based on quantified results which was ten folds higher than the concentration of cit tp341 b comparing with the parent compound of cit the sum of concentration of cit tp339 and cit tp341 b accounted for 6 7 of the concentration of cit in effluent of wwtp which suggested that the parent compound is the main form of cit in effluent of wwtps however it is worth noting that only two of the seven tps available reference standards detected in wwtps were quantified the total concentration of all tps may accounted for a considerable proportion of loads for cit in effluent and deserved to be further studied in the future 3 4 predicted toxicity for citalopram and sertraline in wastewater details of prediction toxicity of cit and ser were described in section 2 4 and fig 6 based on the results for acute toxicity by ecosar for endpoint of fish 96 h lc50 most of tps presented lower toxicity compared to ser and cit with the exception of ser tp275 cit tp358 b and cit tp344 a for endpoint of daphnid 48 h lc50 ser tp275 cit tp358 b and cit tp344 a exhibited higher toxicity compared to parent compound for endpoint of green algae 96 h lc50 cit tp358 b and cit tp344 a has higher toxicity than cit it should be noted that the tps with higher toxicity only were detected in lab scale batch experiments were all newly identified tps in present study further inspecting toxicity for tps detected in practical wwtps we found that the toxicity of ser tp334 a and cit tp311 comparable to ser and cit respectively however all the other tps 5 tps cit tp339 cit tp341 b cit tp374 cit tp330 and cit tp343 from cit and 1 tps ser tp406 from ser found in wwtps were toxicity low than their corresponding parent compounds the reason for tps with higher toxicity ser tp275 cit tp358 b and cit tp344 a was not detected in wwtps may be that the concentration of these tps in wwtps is below the detection limit of instrument for cit tp358 b and cit tp344 a the enhanced toxicity can be observed to be the methylation at carboxyl sites similar transformation reactions has also been found for diclofenac transformed during biological treatment processes which have also caused the enhanced toxicity of tps compared with diclofenac fu et al 2020 for ser tp275 similar transformation reactions attributed to the enhanced toxicity has not been found previously the toxicity of tps formed by similar transformation reactions should be paid attention in the future collectively these result indicated that the biological treatment processes generally cause toxicity reduction for compounds while certain tps with higher toxicity can also be occasionally formed during the processes similar results has also been observed for gabapentin lactam higher toxicity for tps he et al 2021 methylation triclosan bedoux et al 2012 and acridone from carbamazepine leclercq et al 2009 in previous literatures which raised increasing concern on the toxicity of tps present study provide powerful tool of molecular network based nontarget strategy to identify tps which is especially suitable for samples obtained from complex environmental matrices in addition by in silico prediction strategy two tps only detect in lab scale batch experiments but not detect in practical wwtps of cit were found to may be with higher toxicity than parent compound which suggested that not all tps were toxicity reduction during biological transformation processes therefore tps of pharmaceuticals in wastewater should be paid the same attention compared with parent compounds in the future 4 conclusion in this study molecular network based nontarget strategy was used to identify tps of cit and ser based on lab scale batch experiments further the occurrence of cit ser and their tps were investigated for wastewater samples obtained from 12 wwtps in yangtze river delta region then the acute toxicity of tps and parent compounds were predicted and compared by in silico method the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 13 tps from cit and 12 tps from ser were tentatively identified by molecular networking methods among them 10 tps 4 for cit and 5 for ser were newly found based on tps identification results molecular networking exhibit great advantages for candidate tps prioritizing and new tps finding compared with traditional nontarget strategies 2 transformation pathway were proposed for cit and ser in wastewater nitrile hydrolysis and n succinylation were speculated as the major transformation pathways for cit and ser in wastewater respectively cit tp341 b and ser tp406 were the dominant tps during transformation processes 3 the concentration of ser and cit at the ng l level in wastewater the accumulative peak area information suggested that tps may account a larger proportion compared with corresponding parent compounds in effluent of wwtps 4 predicted toxicity results suggested that most of tps presented lower toxicity than their corresponding
