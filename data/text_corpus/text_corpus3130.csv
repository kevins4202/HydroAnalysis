15650,acidic waters such as groundwater drainage and lakes in mining area contain high strength acids and metal ions posing serious threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr based processes are attractive technologies for remediating acidic waters because it produces alkalinity and sulfide for metal precipitation and acid neutralization however the effects of ph elevation achieved by dsr based processes are case sensitive and difficult to be quantitively assessed which limits the application of dsr process for acidic water remediation therefore in this study a sulfidogenic acid mine water remediation model sarm considering the dsr process weak acids balance metal sulfide and hydroxide precipitations and gas liquid exchanges of h2s and co2 was developed to quantitatively assess the effects of various environmental factors on the ph elevation by a dsr process in acidic waters a long term trial of a dsr reactor was conducted to calibrate and validate the sarm the experimental results revealed that the dsr based process is effective to relieve acidity the calibrated sarm demonstrated the excellent performance to predict the ph variation in the dsr reactor under the varied conditions of influent ph and organic concentration the calibrated sarm was further validated with data collected from literatures and the results verified that the proposed model is capable to accurately assess the effect of dsr process on acid neutralization and metal removals under various conditions in steady state the model was employed to systematically evaluate the impacts of environmental factors on acid remediation within a dsr based process the results revealed that the background alkalinity plays an important role in acid neutralization however with an increase in sulfate reduction biogenic sulfide and carbonate become the dominant buffering substances to neutralize acidity furthermore the sarm was used to evaluate the applicability of the dsr based process for the remediation of acidic waters by evaluating the sulfide production thresholds for acid neutralization and metal removal the simulation results demonstrated that the dsr based process is recommended for the remediation of acidic waters with low background alkalinity collectively the sarm proposed in this study was found to be a useful and efficient tool for quantitatively assessing the potential of dsr based processes for neutralizing acidic waters which is vital for biogeochemistry and environmental engineering research graphical abstract image graphical abstract

introduction surface waters and groundwaters in mining areas contaminated with acid mine drainage amd contain high strength acids and metal ions and thus pose severe environmental pollution risks when released untreated akcil and koldas 2006 dold 2017 kefeni et al 2017 pavelic et al 2012 dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr based processes such as artificial wetlands and biological sulfide production bsp processes driven by sulfate reducing bacteria have been considered to be attractive technologies for remediating acidic mining waters eqs 1 to 5 kaksonen and puhakka 2007 nogueira et al 2021 sato et al 2022 widdel and pfennig 1977 dsr based processes have shown excellent capacities for metal removal by inducing the formation of insoluble metal sulfides or metal hydroxides liamleam and annachhatre 2007 poinapen and ekama 2010a sun et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 1 c h 2 o 2 s o 4 2 2 h 2 h 2 c o 3 h 2 s 2 h 2 c o 3 h h c o 3 2 h c o 3 2 3 h 2 s h h s 2 h s 2 4 2 m e a a h 2 s 2 a h m e 2 s a 5 2 m e a a h 2 o 2 a h m e 2 o a in practice dsr based processes need to be controlled well because the excessive formation of sulfide can introduce new toxic pollutant into aquatic systems however the effect of acid neutralization by dsr based processes is difficult to quantitively assess various factors affect the neutralization process for acidic waters by dsr based processes for example the direct consumption of protons by the dsr process the weak acid balance e g the ionization of organic substances inorganic salts and biogenic carbonate and sulfide the precipitation of metal ions e g metal sulfide precipitation and hydroxide precipitation and the material transfer between the gas and liquid phases e g escape of co2 and h2s play different roles in the ph neutralization process costa et al 2021 gupta et al 1994b among them the dsr process plays a fundamental role in ph neutralization kaksonen and puhakka 2007 sanchez andrea et al 2014 zeng et al 2019 as a result the effect of ph elevation by dsr based processes is not linearly related to the strength of sulfate reduction for example bilek and wagner 2012 found that the ph in a dsr based reactor increased from 4 3 to 7 5 with 387 mg s l sulfate reduction but triple the sulfate reduction strength 1200 mg s l was needed to increase the ph from 4 0 to 6 5 in another dsr based reactor study conducted by dos santos et al 2021 the combination of these environmental factors makes it difficult to accurately assess the effect of dsr based processes during the actual remediation of acidic waters which limits the applicability of this technique a mathematical model is an effective tool for understanding the mechanisms and evaluating the performance of acidic water remediation via dsr based processes within complex environmental systems in previous studies mathematical models were developed to simulate the dsr process gupta et al 1994a 1994b herrera et al 1993 ingvorsen et al 1984 however these previous models mainly focused on the organic matter degradation and metal removal by biogenic hydrogen sulfide leading to a gap in the understanding of the relationship between acid neutralization and sulfate reduction poinapen and ekama 2010a 2010b to the best of our knowledge the existing mathematical models are not designed to quantitatively evaluate the performance of dsr based processes on the remediation of acidic waters e g neutralization of acidity therefore a mathematical model must be developed specifically for acidic water remediation under various environmental conditions to fill this knowledge gap we conducted a long term trial to evaluate the effect of dsr based processes on the remediation of acidic waters and established a sulfidogenic acid mine water remediation model sarm to quantitatively assess the effects of various environmental factors on ph neutralization the developed model was also employed to simulate the effects of multiple sources of alkalinity on the neutralization of acidity to investigate the design of dsr based processes on acidic water remediation finally the application potential for dsr based processes for acidic water remediation under different environmental conditions was proposed with the developed model 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental investigation the detailed experimental setup used in this study was adopted from our previous study guo et al 2021 briefly a plexiglass column reactor with an effective volume of 1 15 l i e diameter 6 0 cm height 60 0 cm was used as the dsr based reactor and it was previously operated for 135 days with synthetic wastewater with decreasing influent ph i e stages i to ⅳ guo et al 2021 in this study the reactor was operated for another 285 days i e stages ⅴ to ⅹ to study the effect of sulfate reduction on the neutralization of acidity thus the reactor was fed synthetic wastewater see table s1 as described in our previous study jiang et al 2013 and continuously operated for a total of 420 days which was divided into 10 stages based on the different influent ph values ranging from 2 5 to 5 0 and total organic carbon toc concentrations ranging from 100 to 400 mg c l table s2 notably additional sodium sulfate was provided for the sulfate reducing bioreactor to enrich the sulfate reducer the influent and effluent samples of the reactor were collected regularly and subjected to the measurements for ph toc inorganic carbon ic sulfate and dissolved sulfide the measurement methods followed the methods used in our previous studies liang et al 2019 qiu et al 2020 accordingly the ph was measured using a multi meter equipped with the corresponding probes hq40d hach the toc concentration was determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc 5000a and dissolved sulfide concentration was determined by the methylene blue method apha 2005 sulfate concentration was quantified using an ion chromatograph system dionex aquion ics 900 fremont ca usa with an ionpac analytical column as19 4 250 mm 2 2 modelling investigation 2 2 1 model approach and procedure previous modelling studies have shown that the kinetic processes of biological sulfate reduction occur rapidly generally taking less than 5 h to reach equilibrium gupta et al 1994b nagpal et al 2000a therefore the modelling procedure started with the thermodynamic processes of the water chemistry system including the redox and ionization hydrolysis processes a reaction network was designed correspondingly and then integrated into a white box model constants were referenced from the crc handbook of chemistry and physics lide 2007 based on the data from the 420 day reactor and supported by the date from literature the model testing was carried out the model designs were optimized based on the measured data and literature data 2 2 2 conceptual model and numerical implementation the construction of the model equation was based on the conservation of protons which means that the total absorption of the proton sink is equal to the total release of the proton source the different net fluxes of proton migration and conversion processes were summed to give an equation equalling zero eq 6 6 j c j i m i j 0 the migration and conversion of protons can be divided into four stages the dsr process a weak acid balance the precipitation of metal ions and materials transfer between the gas and liquid phases the dsr process included organic carbon depletion proton and sulfate consumption and sulfide and carbonate generation a weak acid balance stage included the ionizations of sulfide carbonate acetate ammonia and phosphate the precipitation of metal ions stage included the precipitation processes for sulfide precipitable ions and hydroxide precipitable ions the gas liquid transfer included the evaporation process of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide in gas liquid transformation all processes were static thermodynamic simulations except the carbon dioxide volatilization process which was pseudo static simulated because this process is much slower than other processes gupta et al 1994b module 1 direct proton consumption by the dsr process table 1 this module considered the redox effects of the dsr process in an acidic environment 2 moles of protons were proposed to be consumed per 1 mole of dsr furthermore the effect of biogenic alkalinity i e carbonate and sulfide on ph neutralization was discussed in the module 2 module 2 ionization table 1 the model took the major buffer substances into account including the ionizable carbon source carbonate and sulfide which present in the influent and were generated by the dsr process the ionizing process is a major part of the proton conservation equation minor buffers such as ammonium and phosphate were set to be in fixed ratios to the influent organic matter concentration reflecting the additional alkalinity from nutrients eqs 7 8 7 m i m i o c c s p m i s 2 c s p c i c i m i c 1 μ a

influents and effluents of the dsr based process may be different the microbial community of the dsr based process always has a higher abundance of fermenting bacteria and the fermenting bacteria can convert the carbon source to acetate which was the antecedent step to the dsr costa et al 2021 therefore the remaining carbon source in the effluent could be considered another independent mixture rather than following the proportion of carbon sources in the influent for example consider a mixed carbon source consisting of acetate and glucose eq 9 9 m i o c c o c i 2 c s u l p 2 1 k a c e h e 1

transformations can be added for different conditions metal ions can be classified as sulfide precipitable ions and hydroxide precipitable ions according to their ability to bind to these anions the precipitation processes for sulfide precipitable ions and hydroxide precipitable ions consume equal ratios of protons but the former also consumes the alkalinity of the water kaksonen and puhakka 2007 each metal element can be individually considered in this model and fe ii cu ii al iii zn ii ca ii and mg ii were chosen into simulations in this study the complete metal element classification table is shown in table s3 a resolution of metal precipitation is possible but it will not exceed the mass of precipitable solid phase metals in the environment before the dsr process eqs 10 13 10 m m i m s

process of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide in liquid gas transformation depends mainly on the ratio of the liquid volume and the volume of the gas chamber the air flow rate and the concentration of carbonate in the liquid when the reactor was fixed the volume ratio and gas flow rate were also fixed and the gas liquid transfer process depended on the carbonate concentration in the solution eq

sources of the system the interrelationship between dsr and ph changes under different conditions can be simulated evaluating the effects of dsr based processes on acidic wastewater bodies requires the concentration of each metal ion present and the gas liquid exchange rate of the bodies 2 2 3 model calibration and validation data from the first 5 stages of the experiment were selected for model calibration and data from the last 5 stages were used for model validation in addition some literature data were also selected for the validation of the model and the specific literature settings and parameters are shown in the supporting information si 2 3 statistical and analytical method the data are expressed as the mean standard deviation of at least two duplicate batch experiments the statistical analysis was conducted using origin 2021 software in this study the fzero function of matlab r2019b was used to solve the one dimensional i e proton concentration high order equation of the darm and further calculate the effluent equilibrium concentrations of various substances the variation curves of different model parameters or predicted values with the change of dsr reaction intensity were plotted by small step loop function 3 results 3 1 dsr submodel calibration and validation 3 1 1 acidic water remediated by the dsr based reactor the dsr based reactor showed an excellent ability to relieve acidity as the effluent ph values of the reactor remained stable throughout the 420 day trial except stage ⅴ as shown in fig 1 as the influent ph decreased gradually from 5 31 0 15 to 3 10 0 05 from stage i to stage iv the effluent sulfide concentration increased from 233 45 to 366 30 mg s l the reported sulfidogenic performance results in stages i and ii were adopted here as references guo et al 2021 importantly the effluent ph was neutralized to 6 88 0 16 in these four stages however it should be noted that an extremely acidic influent spike significantly suppressed the activity of the sulfate reducing bacteria leading to the failure of acidity neutralization in stage ⅴ subsequently the dsr based reactor recovered gradually as the influent ph increased to 4 88 0 13 in stage ⅵ resulting in effective sulfide production 312 77 mg s l and a neutral effluent ph 6 87 0 37 also as shown in fig s1 the results indicated that the neutralization of acidity was mainly driven by sulfate reduction however the acid neutralization was not positively related to the strength of sulfate reduction as mentioned above although the effluent sulfide concentration increased from stage i to stage iv the effluent ph remained stable at 6 88 0 16 furthermore the effluent sulfide concentration of the dsr based reactor decreased from stage vii to stage x i e 382 35 229 13 211 9 and 88 21 mg s l as shown in figs 1b and s1 which markedly decreased with the decline in influent toc fig 1c however the effluent ph in these four stages was 7 12 0 15 7 11 0 06 6 99 0 02 and 6 75 0 12 respectively fig 1a the results indicated that the effluent ph of the dsr based reactor was neutralized and remained stable even though the sulfate reduction fluctuated significantly therefore it is imperative to develop a comprehensive model to predict the neutralization of acidity by sulfate reduction 3 1 2 dsr submodel calibration with a data pool from the dsr based reactor in this study the data collected from the dsr based reactor from stage ⅰ to stage ⅴ were used to calibrate the sarm fig 2 shows the fit between the measured and simulated effluent ph values in the dsr based reactor from stage i to stage ⅴ the process of ionization was taken into account and weighted as 1 the compounds in the carbon source in the influent were set as nonionized carbon source ionized carbon source 1 1 corresponding to the experiment the external gas exchange of the reactor was assumed to be negligible weighted as 0 the deviations between the measured and simulated average effluent ph values were below 3 fig s2 suggesting that the sarm can satisfactorily describe the variations in the effluent ph profiles the present results also indicate that although the influent ph values had dramatic variations the model can precisely simulate the process of alkalinity production in the reactor and then predict the effluent ph values at the outlet 3 1 3 dsr submodel validation with a data pool from the dsr based reactors with different sulfide production the calibrated sarm was validated with the measured ph values of the dsr based reactor from stage vi to stage x in this study the simulated results match well with the measured ph values fig 3 a the differences ranged from 0 7 to 4 9 fig s2 although the operating conditions for stages i v and stages vi x in this study were quite different table s2 the model could still reproduce the measured data closely the present result confirms that the model could adequately predict the variations in effluent ph furthermore the effluent ph values were also simulated for a dsr based reactor conducted by nagpal et al 2000b with sulfide production ranging from 118 to 407 mg s l detailed information of the dsr based reactor is described in table s4 and the ph profile was found to be similar to the measured data fig 3b the result indicates that the developed model can indeed predict the dynamics of acid neutralization at different sulfate reduction strengths 3 2 sarm validation with a data pool from the dsr based reactors with metal removal and gas liquid transfer the calibrated model was further validated with the measured ph values from a dsr based reactor operated for amd remediation dos santos et al 2021 detailed information on the dsr based reactor is described in table s4 as shown in fig 4 a the simulated effluent ph curve matched well with the measured values when metal precipitation was included the results showed that 95 of the fe precipitated and that the effluent ph was at 6 55 with 400 mg s l of sulfide production fig 4a also shows that the simulated values were higher than the measured ph values when metal precipitation was not considered this result is consistent with the stoichiometric equation for metal precipitation which revealed that the ph would drop as h was produced during metal precipitation table s5 kaksonen and puhakka 2007 however it should be noted that the sulfide production was excessive in this experimental investigation according to the simulation results which may cause secondary pollution if left untreated the threshold for sulfide production during the remediation of acidic waters by dsr based processes is further discussed in section 3 3 3 the calibrated model was also validated by considering the releases of gaseous h2s and co2 in a dsr based system with an open surface bilek and wagner 2012 detailed information on the dsr based system is described in table s5 as shown in fig 4b the simulated results match well with the measured values although the ph was higher than that of the airtight dsr based process the escape of h2s and co2 was spontaneous and consumed h under acidic conditions leading to an increase in ph gupta et al 1994b the results indicated that the sarm can indeed predict the dynamics of ph variation in a dsr based process under different conditions 3 3 model application 3 3 1 the effect of the dsr based process on the neutralization of acidity the mechanism for acid neutralization by the dsr based process was evaluated by sarm with different parametric considerations fig 5 according to the results of the sensitivity analysis fig s3 three alkaline substances including background alkalinity carbonate organic substrates biogenic sulfide and carbonate were the key factors for the neutralization of acidity during the dsr based process the background alkalinity played an important role in acid neutralization when sulfate reduction was limited the predicted effluent ph showed that the h consumed by the dsr process was effectively buffered by the background alkalinity when sulfide production was lower than 30 mg s l fig 5 however it should be noted that the predicted effluent ph with only background alkalinity included was much higher than the measured values with higher sulfate reduction the effects of background alkalinity on acidity neutralization are further discussed in section 3 3 2 with increasing sulfide production the sulfide and carbonate produced by sulfate reduction became the key buffering substances to maintain the effluent ph at near neutral as illustrated in fig 5 the effluent ph was simulated under strongly alkaline conditions ph 10 12 12 31 without considering the buffering effect of biogenic sulfide and carbonate when sulfide or carbonate was considered the effluent ph was simulated to be 6 79 8 28 or 8 66 11 69 only when both sulfide and carbonate were taken into account did the simulation for ph remediation fit well with the measured values fig 5 3 3 2 effects of background alkalinity on acid neutralization by the dsr based process as discussed above the background alkalinity was the dominant buffer source for neutralizing acidity especially under limited sulfate reduction conditions the effect of background alkalinity on acid neutralization by the dsr based process was further evaluated by the sarm by considering different influent ph and alkalinity conditions the results showed that high alkalinity in the influent high sulfide production were needed for acid neutralization by the dsr based process fig 6 for example under a low influent alkalinity condition total alk 1 mmol l the effluent ph was simulated to be at neutral conditions ph 6 5 with limited sulfide production 29 5 mg s l even though the influent ph was lower than 4 0 however the threshold for sulfide production increased to 54 7 mg s l if the influent ph 4 0 included 2 mmol l of total alkalinity furthermore the threshold for sulfide production for acid neutralization increased with decreasing influent ph indicating that the effect of alkalinity on acid neutralization by the dsr based process was more important under highly acidic conditions the results indicated that acid neutralization by the dsr based process heavily depended on the level of background alkalinity 3 3 3 case simulation the threshold for sulfide production during the remediation of acidic waters by a dsr based process an effective acidic water remediation system with sulfate reduction not only requires the efficient removal of heavy metals and the neutralization of acidity but also avoids any excessive hydrogen sulfide gas leaks the sarm was thus employed to guide the design of the dsr based processes for amd or for acidic groundwater remediation by evaluating the sulfide concentration thresholds required for acid neutralization and metal removal taking the acidic and extremely metal rich waters in a pit lake that originated after the cease of mining activities la zarza pit lake sw spain as a representative sample of amd case 1 detailed information on the pit lake is described in table s7 olias et al 2019 the potential threshold for sulfide production for metal precipitation and acid neutralization via the dsr process was assessed by the sarm as calculated by the sarm the precipitation rate of cu zn and al was 100 with 106 mg s l sulfide production data not shown subsequently the precipitation of fe was 95 with 266 mg s l sulfide production fig 7 a more importantly the ph increased from 4 1 to 5 6 as sulfide production increased from 86 to 148 mg s l according to the simulation results 435 mg s l was needed to achieve the goal of amd remediation fe 0 3 mg l and ph 6 5 furthermore amd in the babu subterranean stream zhijin county guizhou province china that had a high concentration of sulfate 2567 mg s l and fe was taken as another representative case ren et al 2021 case 2 table s7 and fig s4a as shown in fig s4a the ph increased from 4 1 to 6 5 with 227 mg s l sulfide production and 140 mg s l sulfide production was needed to achieve effective metal removal furthermore the sarm was also employed to assess the potential of dsr based processes for acidic groundwater remediation by taking the lower offin basin ghana and abeokuta area nigeria as representative acidic aquifers ben moussa et al 2021 kortatsi et al 2008 the groundwater in the lower offin basin which is a cocoa and food crop production area disturbed by upstream gold mining had a mildly acidic ph 5 90 and contained fe as the major contaminating metal ion kortatsi et al 2008 detailed information on the groundwater is described in table s7 case 3 according to the simulation results the ph increased from 5 90 to 6 50 with 12 mg s l sulfide production fig 7b furthermore 22 mg s l sulfide was predicted to be produced to achieve the who guideline for drinking water quality who 2011 additionally the groundwater in the abeokuta area was also polluted upstream resulting in a mildly acidic ph 5 93 and exceeding fe and al limits ben moussa et al 2021 case 4 table s7 and fig s4b the ph theoretically increased from 5 93 to 6 50 with 9 mg s l sulfide production and 17 mg s l sulfide had to be produced to achieve effective metal removal these results show that the newly developed sarm can be used to assess the threshold for sulfide production on metal precipitation and acid neutralization for the remediation of acidic waters under different environmental conditions 4 discussion the neutralization of acidity and metal removal are the main objectives of acidic water remediation strategies dsr based processes have been considered to be an attractive technology for the remediation of acidic waters because the alkalinity and sulfide produced by sulfate reduction are not only conducive to metal precipitation but also conducive to acid neutralization kiran et al 2017 however to accurately remove metal ions and neutralize acidity without excess sulfide leakage the dsr based process needs to be controlled via the addition of organic substrates or sulfate which invokes the need for mathematical modelling before on site applications costa et al 2021 although several mathematical models have been developed to understand the mechanisms involved in metal removal via sulfate reduction the relationship between acid neutralization and sulfate reduction is generally unpredictable the doses of the additional substances are difficult to determine due to the lack of quantitative models which increases the operational costs and might lead to severe potential odour problems during the treatment of acidic waters dos santos et al 2021 muthumbi et al 2001 the sarm proposed in this study was specifically developed for the remediation of acidic waters under different environmental conditions by analyzing the effects of various factors on the neutralization of acidity the sarm incorporated the dsr process a weak acid balance e g the ionization of organic substances inorganic salts and biogenic carbonate and sulfide the precipitation of metal ions e g metal sulfide precipitation and hydroxide precipitation and materials transfer between the gas and liquid phases e g escape of co2 and h2s into the model to accurately simulate the dynamics of ph variation in the dsr based process compared with the previously reported models the sarm could adequately predict the variations in effluent ph in a dsr based reactor evaluated in this study and from other studies in the literature with different operating parameters see section 3 2 poinapen and ekama 2010a 2010b the mechanism for the neutralization of acidity by the dsr based process was elucidated by the sarm the simulation results revealed that the background alkalinity played an important role in acid neutralization however with the increase in sulfate reduction biogenic sulfide and carbonate became the dominant buffering substances to neutralize the acidic ph section 3 3 1 accordingly the reason that ph neutralization was not positively related to the degree of sulfate reduction in the dsr based process may be due to differences in the levels of background alkalinity for example by considering the low background alkalinity of the dsr reactor in this study the calculated threshold for sulfide production was lower than the measured sulfide concentration except in stages v and x table s6 the simulation results were consistent with the performance of the dsr reactor fig 1 which shows that the effluent ph was neutralized to 6 8 even though sulfide production fluctuated in each stage meanwhile for acidic waters with high alkalinity the calculated threshold for sulfide production for acid neutralization was higher the result was consistent with previous experimental results which showed that the ph of acidic waters with high alkalinity increased from 4 0 to above 6 5 and had a 95 fe removal rate only when high sulfide production 143 281 mg s l was achieved dos santos et al 2021 the results indicated that a dsr based process can be recommended for the remediation of acidic waters under low alkalinity conditions but it is not applicable under high alkalinity conditions furthermore the sulfide concentration thresholds required for acid neutralization and metal removal under different environmental conditions were evaluated by the sarm with different model considerations for example 12 mg s l sulfide production was predicted to be necessary for acidity neutralization and 22 mg s l sulfide was predicted to be necessary for metal removal in the acidic groundwaters in the lower offin basin fig 7b kortatsi et al 2008 however no less than 1000 mg s l of sulfide production was required to neutralize the ph from 2 3 to 5 5 in the groundwaters contaminated by acidic rock drainage in boulder creek california cases 5 and 6 table s7 and fig s5 keith et al 2001 in addition to the wastage of organic substances excess hydrogen sulfide escaping from the effluent of sulfidogenic systems might lead to severe potential odour problems sun et al 2020 collectively the sarm developed in this study is essential for wastewater engineers to design and operate a dsr process under different ph and alkalinity levels to achieve stable and cost efficient sulfide production for acidity neutralization and metal removal by avoiding excessive organic substrate additions and excessive sulfide production furthermore the sarm in this study provides a useful scientific tool to explain the geochemical behaviour of various elements as the dsr process affects the geochemical cycle of a series of elements e g as and fe for example the sulfide and carbonate generated by the dsr process significantly increases ph levels which is considered to be the main cause of arsenic mobilization in groundwaters in the form of thioarsenic under excess sulfide and near neutral ph conditions battaglia brunet et al 2012 bostick et al 2005 wilkin et al 2003 thus the proposed model is a fundamental tool for understanding the different chemical behaviours that take place during sulfate reduction under various conditions 5 conclusions by utilizing a laboratory scale dsr based reactor for 420 days under different operating conditions as a representative system we revealed that dsr based processes have excellent capacities to relieve acidity but the degree of acid neutralization was not related to the strength of sulfate reduction subsequently a new sarm was developed calibrated and validated using experimental data collected from the dsr based process in this study and from previous literature the model could predict the variations in ph values under changing sulfide production conditions it can also be extended to predict the effects of different factors e g dsr process background alkalinity metal precipitation and gas liquid exchange on the remediation of acidic waters according to the simulation results the background alkalinity biogenic sulfide and carbonate played important but different roles on acid neutralization when using a dsr process to remediate acidic waters the alkalinity present in the acidic waters could be a fundamental factor in acid neutralization furthermore the sarm was used to assess the threshold for sulfide production on metal precipitation and acid neutralization in acidic waters which was essential for optimizing a dosing strategy and avoiding excessive hydrogen sulfide production by preventing an overdose of organic substances on a large scale during an in situ experimental investigation the sarm was found to be a useful and efficient tool for determining a suitable dsr based process design for the remediation of

15650,acidic waters such as groundwater drainage and lakes in mining area contain high strength acids and metal ions posing serious threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr based processes are attractive technologies for remediating acidic waters because it produces alkalinity and sulfide for metal precipitation and acid neutralization however the effects of ph elevation achieved by dsr based processes are case sensitive and difficult to be quantitively assessed which limits the application of dsr process for acidic water remediation therefore in this study a sulfidogenic acid mine water remediation model sarm considering the dsr process weak acids balance metal sulfide and hydroxide precipitations and gas liquid exchanges of h2s and co2 was developed to quantitatively assess the effects of various environmental factors on the ph elevation by a dsr process in acidic waters a long term trial of a dsr reactor was conducted to calibrate and validate the sarm the experimental results revealed that the dsr based process is effective to relieve acidity the calibrated sarm demonstrated the excellent performance to predict the ph variation in the dsr reactor under the varied conditions of influent ph and organic concentration the calibrated sarm was further validated with data collected from literatures and the results verified that the proposed model is capable to accurately assess the effect of dsr process on acid neutralization and metal removals under various conditions in steady state the model was employed to systematically evaluate the impacts of environmental factors on acid remediation within a dsr based process the results revealed that the background alkalinity plays an important role in acid neutralization however with an increase in sulfate reduction biogenic sulfide and carbonate become the dominant buffering substances to neutralize acidity furthermore the sarm was used to evaluate the applicability of the dsr based process for the remediation of acidic waters by evaluating the sulfide production thresholds for acid neutralization and metal removal the simulation results demonstrated that the dsr based process is recommended for the remediation of acidic waters with low background alkalinity collectively the sarm proposed in this study was found to be a useful and efficient tool for quantitatively assessing the potential of dsr based processes for neutralizing acidic waters which is vital for biogeochemistry and environmental engineering research graphical abstract image graphical abstract

introduction surface waters and groundwaters in mining areas contaminated with acid mine drainage amd contain high strength acids and metal ions and thus pose severe environmental pollution risks when released untreated akcil and koldas 2006 dold 2017 kefeni et al 2017 pavelic et al 2012 dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr based processes such as artificial wetlands and biological sulfide production bsp processes driven by sulfate reducing bacteria have been considered to be attractive technologies for remediating acidic mining waters eqs 1 to 5 kaksonen and puhakka 2007 nogueira et al 2021 sato et al 2022 widdel and pfennig 1977 dsr based processes have shown excellent capacities for metal removal by inducing the formation of insoluble metal sulfides or metal hydroxides liamleam and annachhatre 2007 poinapen and ekama 2010a sun et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 1 c h 2 o 2 s o 4 2 2 h 2 h 2 c o 3 h 2 s 2 h 2 c o 3 h h c o 3 2 h c o 3 2 3 h 2 s h h s 2 h s 2 4 2 m e a a h 2 s 2 a h m e 2 s a 5 2 m e a a h 2 o 2 a h m e 2 o a in practice dsr based processes need to be controlled well because the excessive formation of sulfide can introduce new toxic pollutant into aquatic systems however the effect of acid neutralization by dsr based processes is difficult to quantitively assess various factors affect the neutralization process for acidic waters by dsr based processes for example the direct consumption of protons by the dsr process the weak acid balance e g the ionization of organic substances inorganic salts and biogenic carbonate and sulfide the precipitation of metal ions e g metal sulfide precipitation and hydroxide precipitation and the material transfer between the gas and liquid phases e g escape of co2 and h2s play different roles in the ph neutralization process costa et al 2021 gupta et al 1994b among them the dsr process plays a fundamental role in ph neutralization kaksonen and puhakka 2007 sanchez andrea et al 2014 zeng et al 2019 as a result the effect of ph elevation by dsr based processes is not linearly related to the strength of sulfate reduction for example bilek and wagner 2012 found that the ph in a dsr based reactor increased from 4 3 to 7 5 with 387 mg s l sulfate reduction but triple the sulfate reduction strength 1200 mg s l was needed to increase the ph from 4 0 to 6 5 in another dsr based reactor study conducted by dos santos et al 2021 the combination of these environmental factors makes it difficult to accurately assess the effect of dsr based processes during the actual remediation of acidic waters which limits the applicability of this technique a mathematical model is an effective tool for understanding the mechanisms and evaluating the performance of acidic water remediation via dsr based processes within complex environmental systems in previous studies mathematical models were developed to simulate the dsr process gupta et al 1994a 1994b herrera et al 1993 ingvorsen et al 1984 however these previous models mainly focused on the organic matter degradation and metal removal by biogenic hydrogen sulfide leading to a gap in the understanding of the relationship between acid neutralization and sulfate reduction poinapen and ekama 2010a 2010b to the best of our knowledge the existing mathematical models are not designed to quantitatively evaluate the performance of dsr based processes on the remediation of acidic waters e g neutralization of acidity therefore a mathematical model must be developed specifically for acidic water remediation under various environmental conditions to fill this knowledge gap we conducted a long term trial to evaluate the effect of dsr based processes on the remediation of acidic waters and established a sulfidogenic acid mine water remediation model sarm to quantitatively assess the effects of various environmental factors on ph neutralization the developed model was also employed to simulate the effects of multiple sources of alkalinity on the neutralization of acidity to investigate the design of dsr based processes on acidic water remediation finally the application potential for dsr based processes for acidic water remediation under different environmental conditions was proposed with the developed model 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental investigation the detailed experimental setup used in this study was adopted from our previous study guo et al 2021 briefly a plexiglass column reactor with an effective volume of 1 15 l i e diameter 6 0 cm height 60 0 cm was used as the dsr based reactor and it was previously operated for 135 days with synthetic wastewater with decreasing influent ph i e stages i to ⅳ guo et al 2021 in this study the reactor was operated for another 285 days i e stages ⅴ to ⅹ to study the effect of sulfate reduction on the neutralization of acidity thus the reactor was fed synthetic wastewater see table s1 as described in our previous study jiang et al 2013 and continuously operated for a total of 420 days which was divided into 10 stages based on the different influent ph values ranging from 2 5 to 5 0 and total organic carbon toc concentrations ranging from 100 to 400 mg c l table s2 notably additional sodium sulfate was provided for the sulfate reducing bioreactor to enrich the sulfate reducer the influent and effluent samples of the reactor were collected regularly and subjected to the measurements for ph toc inorganic carbon ic sulfate and dissolved sulfide the measurement methods followed the methods used in our previous studies liang et al 2019 qiu et al 2020 accordingly the ph was measured using a multi meter equipped with the corresponding probes hq40d hach the toc concentration was determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc 5000a and dissolved sulfide concentration was determined by the methylene blue method apha 2005 sulfate concentration was quantified using an ion chromatograph system dionex aquion ics 900 fremont ca usa with an ionpac analytical column as19 4 250 mm 2 2 modelling investigation 2 2 1 model approach and procedure previous modelling studies have shown that the kinetic processes of biological sulfate reduction occur rapidly generally taking less than 5 h to reach equilibrium gupta et al 1994b nagpal et al 2000a therefore the modelling procedure started with the thermodynamic processes of the water chemistry system including the redox and ionization hydrolysis processes a reaction network was designed correspondingly and then integrated into a white box model constants were referenced from the crc handbook of chemistry and physics lide 2007 based on the data from the 420 day reactor and supported by the date from literature the model testing was carried out the model designs were optimized based on the measured data and literature data 2 2 2 conceptual model and numerical implementation the construction of the model equation was based on the conservation of protons which means that the total absorption of the proton sink is equal to the total release of the proton source the different net fluxes of proton migration and conversion processes were summed to give an equation equalling zero eq 6 6 j c j i m i j 0 the migration and conversion of protons can be divided into four stages the dsr process a weak acid balance the precipitation of metal ions and materials transfer between the gas and liquid phases the dsr process included organic carbon depletion proton and sulfate consumption and sulfide and carbonate generation a weak acid balance stage included the ionizations of sulfide carbonate acetate ammonia and phosphate the precipitation of metal ions stage included the precipitation processes for sulfide precipitable ions and hydroxide precipitable ions the gas liquid transfer included the evaporation process of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide in gas liquid transformation all processes were static thermodynamic simulations except the carbon dioxide volatilization process which was pseudo static simulated because this process is much slower than other processes gupta et al 1994b module 1 direct proton consumption by the dsr process table 1 this module considered the redox effects of the dsr process in an acidic environment 2 moles of protons were proposed to be consumed per 1 mole of dsr furthermore the effect of biogenic alkalinity i e carbonate and sulfide on ph neutralization was discussed in the module 2 module 2 ionization table 1 the model took the major buffer substances into account including the ionizable carbon source carbonate and sulfide which present in the influent and were generated by the dsr process the ionizing process is a major part of the proton conservation equation minor buffers such as ammonium and phosphate were set to be in fixed ratios to the influent organic matter concentration reflecting the additional alkalinity from nutrients eqs 7 8 7 m i m i o c c s p m i s 2 c s p c i c i m i c 1 μ a

influents and effluents of the dsr based process may be different the microbial community of the dsr based process always has a higher abundance of fermenting bacteria and the fermenting bacteria can convert the carbon source to acetate which was the antecedent step to the dsr costa et al 2021 therefore the remaining carbon source in the effluent could be considered another independent mixture rather than following the proportion of carbon sources in the influent for example consider a mixed carbon source consisting of acetate and glucose eq 9 9 m i o c c o c i 2 c s u l p 2 1 k a c e h e 1

transformations can be added for different conditions metal ions can be classified as sulfide precipitable ions and hydroxide precipitable ions according to their ability to bind to these anions the precipitation processes for sulfide precipitable ions and hydroxide precipitable ions consume equal ratios of protons but the former also consumes the alkalinity of the water kaksonen and puhakka 2007 each metal element can be individually considered in this model and fe ii cu ii al iii zn ii ca ii and mg ii were chosen into simulations in this study the complete metal element classification table is shown in table s3 a resolution of metal precipitation is possible but it will not exceed the mass of precipitable solid phase metals in the environment before the dsr process eqs 10 13 10 m m i m s

process of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide in liquid gas transformation depends mainly on the ratio of the liquid volume and the volume of the gas chamber the air flow rate and the concentration of carbonate in the liquid when the reactor was fixed the volume ratio and gas flow rate were also fixed and the gas liquid transfer process depended on the carbonate concentration in the solution eq

sources of the system the interrelationship between dsr and ph changes under different conditions can be simulated evaluating the effects of dsr based processes on acidic wastewater bodies requires the concentration of each metal ion present and the gas liquid exchange rate of the bodies 2 2 3 model calibration and validation data from the first 5 stages of the experiment were selected for model calibration and data from the last 5 stages were used for model validation in addition some literature data were also selected for the validation of the model and the specific literature settings and parameters are shown in the supporting information si 2 3 statistical and analytical method the data are expressed as the mean standard deviation of at least two duplicate batch experiments the statistical analysis was conducted using origin 2021 software in this study the fzero function of matlab r2019b was used to solve the one dimensional i e proton concentration high order equation of the darm and further calculate the effluent equilibrium concentrations of various substances the variation curves of different model parameters or predicted values with the change of dsr reaction intensity were plotted by small step loop function 3 results 3 1 dsr submodel calibration and validation 3 1 1 acidic water remediated by the dsr based reactor the dsr based reactor showed an excellent ability to relieve acidity as the effluent ph values of the reactor remained stable throughout the 420 day trial except stage ⅴ as shown in fig 1 as the influent ph decreased gradually from 5 31 0 15 to 3 10 0 05 from stage i to stage iv the effluent sulfide concentration increased from 233 45 to 366 30 mg s l the reported sulfidogenic performance results in stages i and ii were adopted here as references guo et al 2021 importantly the effluent ph was neutralized to 6 88 0 16 in these four stages however it should be noted that an extremely acidic influent spike significantly suppressed the activity of the sulfate reducing bacteria leading to the failure of acidity neutralization in stage ⅴ subsequently the dsr based reactor recovered gradually as the influent ph increased to 4 88 0 13 in stage ⅵ resulting in effective sulfide production 312 77 mg s l and a neutral effluent ph 6 87 0 37 also as shown in fig s1 the results indicated that the neutralization of acidity was mainly driven by sulfate reduction however the acid neutralization was not positively related to the strength of sulfate reduction as mentioned above although the effluent sulfide concentration increased from stage i to stage iv the effluent ph remained stable at 6 88 0 16 furthermore the effluent sulfide concentration of the dsr based reactor decreased from stage vii to stage x i e 382 35 229 13 211 9 and 88 21 mg s l as shown in figs 1b and s1 which markedly decreased with the decline in influent toc fig 1c however the effluent ph in these four stages was 7 12 0 15 7 11 0 06 6 99 0 02 and 6 75 0 12 respectively fig 1a the results indicated that the effluent ph of the dsr based reactor was neutralized and remained stable even though the sulfate reduction fluctuated significantly therefore it is imperative to develop a comprehensive model to predict the neutralization of acidity by sulfate reduction 3 1 2 dsr submodel calibration with a data pool from the dsr based reactor in this study the data collected from the dsr based reactor from stage ⅰ to stage ⅴ were used to calibrate the sarm fig 2 shows the fit between the measured and simulated effluent ph values in the dsr based reactor from stage i to stage ⅴ the process of ionization was taken into account and weighted as 1 the compounds in the carbon source in the influent were set as nonionized carbon source ionized carbon source 1 1 corresponding to the experiment the external gas exchange of the reactor was assumed to be negligible weighted as 0 the deviations between the measured and simulated average effluent ph values were below 3 fig s2 suggesting that the sarm can satisfactorily describe the variations in the effluent ph profiles the present results also indicate that although the influent ph values had dramatic variations the model can precisely simulate the process of alkalinity production in the reactor and then predict the effluent ph values at the outlet 3 1 3 dsr submodel validation with a data pool from the dsr based reactors with different sulfide production the calibrated sarm was validated with the measured ph values of the dsr based reactor from stage vi to stage x in this study the simulated results match well with the measured ph values fig 3 a the differences ranged from 0 7 to 4 9 fig s2 although the operating conditions for stages i v and stages vi x in this study were quite different table s2 the model could still reproduce the measured data closely the present result confirms that the model could adequately predict the variations in effluent ph furthermore the effluent ph values were also simulated for a dsr based reactor conducted by nagpal et al 2000b with sulfide production ranging from 118 to 407 mg s l detailed information of the dsr based reactor is described in table s4 and the ph profile was found to be similar to the measured data fig 3b the result indicates that the developed model can indeed predict the dynamics of acid neutralization at different sulfate reduction strengths 3 2 sarm validation with a data pool from the dsr based reactors with metal removal and gas liquid transfer the calibrated model was further validated with the measured ph values from a dsr based reactor operated for amd remediation dos santos et al 2021 detailed information on the dsr based reactor is described in table s4 as shown in fig 4 a the simulated effluent ph curve matched well with the measured values when metal precipitation was included the results showed that 95 of the fe precipitated and that the effluent ph was at 6 55 with 400 mg s l of sulfide production fig 4a also shows that the simulated values were higher than the measured ph values when metal precipitation was not considered this result is consistent with the stoichiometric equation for metal precipitation which revealed that the ph would drop as h was produced during metal precipitation table s5 kaksonen and puhakka 2007 however it should be noted that the sulfide production was excessive in this experimental investigation according to the simulation results which may cause secondary pollution if left untreated the threshold for sulfide production during the remediation of acidic waters by dsr based processes is further discussed in section 3 3 3 the calibrated model was also validated by considering the releases of gaseous h2s and co2 in a dsr based system with an open surface bilek and wagner 2012 detailed information on the dsr based system is described in table s5 as shown in fig 4b the simulated results match well with the measured values although the ph was higher than that of the airtight dsr based process the escape of h2s and co2 was spontaneous and consumed h under acidic conditions leading to an increase in ph gupta et al 1994b the results indicated that the sarm can indeed predict the dynamics of ph variation in a dsr based process under different conditions 3 3 model application 3 3 1 the effect of the dsr based process on the neutralization of acidity the mechanism for acid neutralization by the dsr based process was evaluated by sarm with different parametric considerations fig 5 according to the results of the sensitivity analysis fig s3 three alkaline substances including background alkalinity carbonate organic substrates biogenic sulfide and carbonate were the key factors for the neutralization of acidity during the dsr based process the background alkalinity played an important role in acid neutralization when sulfate reduction was limited the predicted effluent ph showed that the h consumed by the dsr process was effectively buffered by the background alkalinity when sulfide production was lower than 30 mg s l fig 5 however it should be noted that the predicted effluent ph with only background alkalinity included was much higher than the measured values with higher sulfate reduction the effects of background alkalinity on acidity neutralization are further discussed in section 3 3 2 with increasing sulfide production the sulfide and carbonate produced by sulfate reduction became the key buffering substances to maintain the effluent ph at near neutral as illustrated in fig 5 the effluent ph was simulated under strongly alkaline conditions ph 10 12 12 31 without considering the buffering effect of biogenic sulfide and carbonate when sulfide or carbonate was considered the effluent ph was simulated to be 6 79 8 28 or 8 66 11 69 only when both sulfide and carbonate were taken into account did the simulation for ph remediation fit well with the measured values fig 5 3 3 2 effects of background alkalinity on acid neutralization by the dsr based process as discussed above the background alkalinity was the dominant buffer source for neutralizing acidity especially under limited sulfate reduction conditions the effect of background alkalinity on acid neutralization by the dsr based process was further evaluated by the sarm by considering different influent ph and alkalinity conditions the results showed that high alkalinity in the influent high sulfide production were needed for acid neutralization by the dsr based process fig 6 for example under a low influent alkalinity condition total alk 1 mmol l the effluent ph was simulated to be at neutral conditions ph 6 5 with limited sulfide production 29 5 mg s l even though the influent ph was lower than 4 0 however the threshold for sulfide production increased to 54 7 mg s l if the influent ph 4 0 included 2 mmol l of total alkalinity furthermore the threshold for sulfide production for acid neutralization increased with decreasing influent ph indicating that the effect of alkalinity on acid neutralization by the dsr based process was more important under highly acidic conditions the results indicated that acid neutralization by the dsr based process heavily depended on the level of background alkalinity 3 3 3 case simulation the threshold for sulfide production during the remediation of acidic waters by a dsr based process an effective acidic water remediation system with sulfate reduction not only requires the efficient removal of heavy metals and the neutralization of acidity but also avoids any excessive hydrogen sulfide gas leaks the sarm was thus employed to guide the design of the dsr based processes for amd or for acidic groundwater remediation by evaluating the sulfide concentration thresholds required for acid neutralization and metal removal taking the acidic and extremely metal rich waters in a pit lake that originated after the cease of mining activities la zarza pit lake sw spain as a representative sample of amd case 1 detailed information on the pit lake is described in table s7 olias et al 2019 the potential threshold for sulfide production for metal precipitation and acid neutralization via the dsr process was assessed by the sarm as calculated by the sarm the precipitation rate of cu zn and al was 100 with 106 mg s l sulfide production data not shown subsequently the precipitation of fe was 95 with 266 mg s l sulfide production fig 7 a more importantly the ph increased from 4 1 to 5 6 as sulfide production increased from 86 to 148 mg s l according to the simulation results 435 mg s l was needed to achieve the goal of amd remediation fe 0 3 mg l and ph 6 5 furthermore amd in the babu subterranean stream zhijin county guizhou province china that had a high concentration of sulfate 2567 mg s l and fe was taken as another representative case ren et al 2021 case 2 table s7 and fig s4a as shown in fig s4a the ph increased from 4 1 to 6 5 with 227 mg s l sulfide production and 140 mg s l sulfide production was needed to achieve effective metal removal furthermore the sarm was also employed to assess the potential of dsr based processes for acidic groundwater remediation by taking the lower offin basin ghana and abeokuta area nigeria as representative acidic aquifers ben moussa et al 2021 kortatsi et al 2008 the groundwater in the lower offin basin which is a cocoa and food crop production area disturbed by upstream gold mining had a mildly acidic ph 5 90 and contained fe as the major contaminating metal ion kortatsi et al 2008 detailed information on the groundwater is described in table s7 case 3 according to the simulation results the ph increased from 5 90 to 6 50 with 12 mg s l sulfide production fig 7b furthermore 22 mg s l sulfide was predicted to be produced to achieve the who guideline for drinking water quality who 2011 additionally the groundwater in the abeokuta area was also polluted upstream resulting in a mildly acidic ph 5 93 and exceeding fe and al limits ben moussa et al 2021 case 4 table s7 and fig s4b the ph theoretically increased from 5 93 to 6 50 with 9 mg s l sulfide production and 17 mg s l sulfide had to be produced to achieve effective metal removal these results show that the newly developed sarm can be used to assess the threshold for sulfide production on metal precipitation and acid neutralization for the remediation of acidic waters under different environmental conditions 4 discussion the neutralization of acidity and metal removal are the main objectives of acidic water remediation strategies dsr based processes have been considered to be an attractive technology for the remediation of acidic waters because the alkalinity and sulfide produced by sulfate reduction are not only conducive to metal precipitation but also conducive to acid neutralization kiran et al 2017 however to accurately remove metal ions and neutralize acidity without excess sulfide leakage the dsr based process needs to be controlled via the addition of organic substrates or sulfate which invokes the need for mathematical modelling before on site applications costa et al 2021 although several mathematical models have been developed to understand the mechanisms involved in metal removal via sulfate reduction the relationship between acid neutralization and sulfate reduction is generally unpredictable the doses of the additional substances are difficult to determine due to the lack of quantitative models which increases the operational costs and might lead to severe potential odour problems during the treatment of acidic waters dos santos et al 2021 muthumbi et al 2001 the sarm proposed in this study was specifically developed for the remediation of acidic waters under different environmental conditions by analyzing the effects of various factors on the neutralization of acidity the sarm incorporated the dsr process a weak acid balance e g the ionization of organic substances inorganic salts and biogenic carbonate and sulfide the precipitation of metal ions e g metal sulfide precipitation and hydroxide precipitation and materials transfer between the gas and liquid phases e g escape of co2 and h2s into the model to accurately simulate the dynamics of ph variation in the dsr based process compared with the previously reported models the sarm could adequately predict the variations in effluent ph in a dsr based reactor evaluated in this study and from other studies in the literature with different operating parameters see section 3 2 poinapen and ekama 2010a 2010b the mechanism for the neutralization of acidity by the dsr based process was elucidated by the sarm the simulation results revealed that the background alkalinity played an important role in acid neutralization however with the increase in sulfate reduction biogenic sulfide and carbonate became the dominant buffering substances to neutralize the acidic ph section 3 3 1 accordingly the reason that ph neutralization was not positively related to the degree of sulfate reduction in the dsr based process may be due to differences in the levels of background alkalinity for example by considering the low background alkalinity of the dsr reactor in this study the calculated threshold for sulfide production was lower than the measured sulfide concentration except in stages v and x table s6 the simulation results were consistent with the performance of the dsr reactor fig 1 which shows that the effluent ph was neutralized to 6 8 even though sulfide production fluctuated in each stage meanwhile for acidic waters with high alkalinity the calculated threshold for sulfide production for acid neutralization was higher the result was consistent with previous experimental results which showed that the ph of acidic waters with high alkalinity increased from 4 0 to above 6 5 and had a 95 fe removal rate only when high sulfide production 143 281 mg s l was achieved dos santos et al 2021 the results indicated that a dsr based process can be recommended for the remediation of acidic waters under low alkalinity conditions but it is not applicable under high alkalinity conditions furthermore the sulfide concentration thresholds required for acid neutralization and metal removal under different environmental conditions were evaluated by the sarm with different model considerations for example 12 mg s l sulfide production was predicted to be necessary for acidity neutralization and 22 mg s l sulfide was predicted to be necessary for metal removal in the acidic groundwaters in the lower offin basin fig 7b kortatsi et al 2008 however no less than 1000 mg s l of sulfide production was required to neutralize the ph from 2 3 to 5 5 in the groundwaters contaminated by acidic rock drainage in boulder creek california cases 5 and 6 table s7 and fig s5 keith et al 2001 in addition to the wastage of organic substances excess hydrogen sulfide escaping from the effluent of sulfidogenic systems might lead to severe potential odour problems sun et al 2020 collectively the sarm developed in this study is essential for wastewater engineers to design and operate a dsr process under different ph and alkalinity levels to achieve stable and cost efficient sulfide production for acidity neutralization and metal removal by avoiding excessive organic substrate additions and excessive sulfide production furthermore the sarm in this study provides a useful scientific tool to explain the geochemical behaviour of various elements as the dsr process affects the geochemical cycle of a series of elements e g as and fe for example the sulfide and carbonate generated by the dsr process significantly increases ph levels which is considered to be the main cause of arsenic mobilization in groundwaters in the form of thioarsenic under excess sulfide and near neutral ph conditions battaglia brunet et al 2012 bostick et al 2005 wilkin et al 2003 thus the proposed model is a fundamental tool for understanding the different chemical behaviours that take place during sulfate reduction under various conditions 5 conclusions by utilizing a laboratory scale dsr based reactor for 420 days under different operating conditions as a representative system we revealed that dsr based processes have excellent capacities to relieve acidity but the degree of acid neutralization was not related to the strength of sulfate reduction subsequently a new sarm was developed calibrated and validated using experimental data collected from the dsr based process in this study and from previous literature the model could predict the variations in ph values under changing sulfide production conditions it can also be extended to predict the effects of different factors e g dsr process background alkalinity metal precipitation and gas liquid exchange on the remediation of acidic waters according to the simulation results the background alkalinity biogenic sulfide and carbonate played important but different roles on acid neutralization when using a dsr process to remediate acidic waters the alkalinity present in the acidic waters could be a fundamental factor in acid neutralization furthermore the sarm was used to assess the threshold for sulfide production on metal precipitation and acid neutralization in acidic waters which was essential for optimizing a dosing strategy and avoiding excessive hydrogen sulfide production by preventing an overdose of organic substances on a large scale during an in situ experimental investigation the sarm was found to be a useful and efficient tool for determining a suitable dsr based process design for the remediation of

15651,methane emissions from aquatic ecosystems play an important role in global carbon cycle and climate change reclamation of coastal wetlands for aquaculture use has been shown to have opposite effects on sediment ch4 production potential and ch4 emission flux but the underlying mechanism remained unclear in this study we compared sediment properties ch4 production potential emission flux and ch4 transport pathways between a brackish marsh and the nearby reclaimed aquaculture ponds in the min river estuary in southeastern china despite that the sediment ch4 production potential in the ponds was significantly lower than the marsh ch4 emission flux in the ponds 17 4 2 7 mg m 2 h 1 was 11 9 times higher than the marsh 1 3 0 2 mg m 2 h 1 plant mediated transport accounted for 75 of the total ch4 emission in the marsh whereas ebullition accounted for 95 of the total ch4 emission in the ponds ch4 emission fluxes in both habitat types were highest in the summer these results suggest that the increase in ch4 emission following the conversion of brackish marsh to aquaculture ponds was not caused by increased sediment ch4 production but rather by eliminating rhizospheric oxidation and shifting the major transport pathway to ebullition allowing sediment ch4 to bypass oxidative loss this study improves our understanding of the impacts of modification of coastal wetlands on

2016 coastal wetlands alone are estimated to sequester approximately 44 6 tg c yr 1 thanks to their high sedimentation rate chmura et al 2003 however large areas of coastal wetlands around the world have been lost or degraded in the past century due to land development and modification murray et al 2019 which may increase the release of terrestrial co2 and ch4 to the atmosphere pendleton et al 2012 tan et al 2020 verhoeven and setter 2010 with potentially dire consequences on the climate coastal wetlands in mainland china cover about 5 79 m ha across its southern and eastern seaboards in the recent decades china has experienced among the worst coastal wetland degradations due to continuous population and economic growth rapid urbanization and infrastructure development sun et al 2015 a large area of its coastal wetlands has been converted for agroforestry uses since the 1950s he et al 2021 wang et al 2014 and the reclamation of wetlands into aquaculture ponds is also widespread along the coast ren et al 2019 duan et al 2020 in vegetated wetlands plant mediated transport of sediment ch4 can be a dominant pathway for ch4 emission to air bhullar et al 2013 jeffrey et al 2019 however construction of earthen aquaculture ponds not only removes the wetland vegetation but also changes the hydrology from free flowing water to standing water modifies the sediment physical properties and microbial communities and alters nutrient and organic loading to the sediment all potentially affect ch4 production and emission tan et al 2020 the shanyutan wetland 26 00 36 26 03 42 n 119 34 12 119 40 40 e is the largest tidal wetland within the min river estuary in southeastern china fig 1 about 30 of its area has been converted into shrimp aquaculture ponds since 2011 a study has shown that ch4 emission from the aquaculture ponds was much higher than the nearby vegetated wetland yang et al 2017b yet a follow on study showed that the sediment ch4 production potential in the ponds was significantly lower than the vegetated wetland yang et al 2022 to resolve this paradox we hypothesized that conversion of vegetated wetland to aquaculture ponds changes the transport pathways of sediment ch4 leading to an overall higher emission flux in the aquaculture ponds to test our hypothesis we compared ch4 emission flux and the main transport pathways between the aquaculture ponds and nearby wetland over a 33 month period we also collected monthly samples of sediment and porewater from both habitat types over a 10 month period to measure sediment properties and ch4 production potential the results improve our understanding of how conversion of vegetated wetland to aquaculture ponds impacts the climate by changing sediment ch4 production and transport mechanisms and subsequent emission to air 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling frequency the shanyutan wetland region is characterized by a subtropical humid monsoonal climate with 1390

alterniflora and reclaimed for shrimp litopenaeus vannamei aquaculture over the past decade yang et al 2020 a brackish c malaccensis marsh stand and three nearby aquaculture ponds were selected for the study fig 1c to measure plant mediated ch4 emission in the marsh two sets of 1 m 1 m plots in triplicate 5 m distance between plots were established one set of the plots was used as shoot clipping

porewater top 15 cm in the brackish marsh was sampled by in situ dialysis strack and waddington 2008 tong et al 2018 porewater within the pond sediment was extracted by centrifugation in the

and yuan et al 2021 2 3 determination of ch4 transport pathways within the marsh stand the ch4 flux measured in the uct plot was a combination of diffusive ebullitive and plant mediated ch4 fluxes whereas the ch4 flux measured in the sct plot represented the combination of diffusive and ebullitive ch4 fluxes therefore plant mediated ch4 flux was deduced from the difference in ch4 flux between uct and sct plots ding et al 2005 hu et al 2016 the ch4 flux measured by the fc method f t in the aquaculture ponds represented the combination of ebullitive flux f e and diffusive flux f d chuang et

best explained the variation in ch4 emission flux in the marsh fig 6 a of which t s accounted for the highest percentage 38 9 followed by nh4 n 21 3 so4 2 13 6 and tc 11 7 the ch4 emission flux from the aquaculture ponds was mostly driven by tc which explained 63 8 of the variation followed by nh4 n 15 and t s 5 5 fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of land conversion on ch4 dynamics ch4 is produced in the sediment by methanogenic archaea through the stepwise degradation of organic matter under anoxic condition segers 1998 villa et al 2020 once produced ch4 can be exported from the sediment to the atmosphere via different pathways bastviken et al 2004 jeffrey et al 2019 villa et al 2020 the presence of marsh plants may affect ch4 dynamics in several ways deposition of organic carbon by the plants may increase sediment methanogenesis as plants use their vascular systems for gaseous exchange between tissues the process brings o2 to the below ground biomass but may also accelerate the transport and release of sediment ch4 to air sorrell and boon 1994 the overall effect may depend on the plant species leading to different degrees of increase or decrease in ch4 emission relative to bare sediment gurbir et al 2013 the contributions of plant mediated transport to total ch4 emission vary widely between different wetlands ranging from 8 to 98 jeffrey et al 2019 knoblauch et al 2015 korrensalo et al 2022 morrissey and livingston 1992 in the present study we found that the marsh plots with clipped above ground vegetation 0 3 0 1 mg m 2 h 1 had lower ch4 emission flux than the plots with intact vegetation 1 3 0 2 mg m 2 h 1 indicating that the presence of c malaccensis increased ch4 emission relative to bare marsh sediment and plant mediated transport accounted for on average 75 at times close to 100 of the ch4 emission in the marsh fig 3a a notable observation in this study was that ch4 emission flux in the aquaculture ponds on average was much higher than the marsh fig s1b suggesting that conversion of marsh stand to aquaculture ponds would increase the areal output of ch4 from the shanyutan wetland these results are consistent with an earlier study yang et al 2017 and are in line with a meta analysis showing that ch4 emission fluxes increased by 347 following the conversion of coastal wetlands to aquaculture ponds tan et al 2020 however ch4 production potential independently measured by incubation experiment was actually lower in the aquaculture pond sediment than in the marsh sediment fig s1 confirming the observations in an earlier study and which could be attributed to the lower organic content lower methanogen diversity and weaker interactions among the methanogens in the pond sediment yang et al 2022 it should be noted that the ch4 production was measured by anoxic incubation of slurry and therefore it reflected the potential capacity of ch4 production rather than actual in situ ch4 production nevertheless the paradoxical observations suggest that a higher ch4 emission was not necessarily an indication of a higher capacity of the sediment to produce ch4 rather other factors need to be taken into consideration that might affect the fate of ch4 in the system net ch4 emission is determined by the balance between ch4 production and ch4 consumption schimel 1995 korrensalo et al 2022 yang et al 2019a methanogenesis in the sediment is driven by organic carbon substrates and activity of methanogens under anoxic condition ch4 from the sediment may be consumed by methanotrophs in the overlying oxic water before reaching the atmosphere bastviken et al 2008 yang et al 2015 the vascular systems of the marsh plants that facilitate ch4 transport can also bring atmospheric oxygen belowground blossfeld et al 2011 korrensalo et al 2022 turner et al 2020 potentially increasing ch4 oxidation around the roots laanbroek 2010 some studies have reported that rhizospheric oxidation removes most of the ch4 produced in the sediment e g calhoun and king 1997 popp et al 2000 fritz et al 2011 in addition river flow and periodic tidal flushing within the marsh would increase do level in surface sediment well et al 2018 thereby enhancing ch4 oxidation and minimizing ch4 accumulation within the sediment tan et al 2020 yamamoto et al 2011 these altogether perhaps cause the low ch4 emission flux in our marsh stand despite the higher sediment ch4 production potential marsh vegetation was removed to create the aquaculture ponds within the shanyutan wetland therefore plant mediated ch4 emission and rhizospheric oxidation were absent in the ponds instead ch4 diffusing out of the sediment could be consumed by ch4 oxidation within the water column before reaching the air indeed our results showed that ch4 emission flux in the ponds was strongly and negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen concentration figs 5 and 6 on the other hand the stagnant nature of the pond water may allow ch4 to accumulate and form bubbles in the sediment and subsequent ebullition would allow the ch4 to bypass oxidation within the water column yuan et al 2021 earlier studies have shown that porewater ch4 in the pond sediment accumulated to a much higher level 51 5 μm yang et al 2019b than the marsh sediment 17 1 μm tong et al 2018 consequently despite the lower sediment ch4 production potential in the ponds fig s1a the ch4 emission flux was more than 10 fold higher than the marsh with ebullition accounting for on average 85 of the total ch4 emission fig 3b this percentage is similar to the observations in freshwater aquaculture ponds yuan et al 2021 and it falls within the range 50 95 via ebullition reported for organic rich shallow aquatic systems natchimuthu et al 2014 wang et al 2021a wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 4 2 environmental drivers of temporal variations in ch4 emission our results show that both the brackish marsh and the aquaculture ponds in the shanyutan wetland were atmospheric ch4 sources with similar seasonal variabilities fig 2 higher ch4 emissions occurred in the summer and lower emissions in the winter in both habitats fig s2 which is consistent with observations in others coastal wetlands jacotot et al 2019 olsson et al 2015 yang et al 2021 and aquatic systems borges et al 2018 praetzel et al 2021 sierra et al 2017 wu et al 2019 despite the similar seasonal patterns we suggest that the underlying causes differed when considering the respective dominant transport pathway and environmental drivers in each habitat type in the marsh stand sediment carbon content tc was only moderately important in driving ch4 emission flux explaining 11 7 of the variation fig 6 suggesting that ch4 emission flux in the marsh was weakly coupled to methanogenesis in the sediment rather sediment temperature t s was the strongest factor driving ch4 emission flux explaining 39 8 of the variation rather sediment temperature t s was the strongest factor driving ch4 emission flux explaining 39 8 of the variation given that plant mediated transport was the dominant ch4 emission pathway in the marsh higher t s in the summer might increase evapotranspiration rate leading to higher ch4 emission as has been observed in other vegetated wetlands macdonald et al 1998 however plant mediated emission was irrelevant in the aquaculture ponds instead the rise and fall of ch4 emission flux followed the farming cycle the start of farming activity in the summer would have increased organic substrate availability from feeds and animal wastes in the sediment and driven up ch4 emission indeed rda analysis showed that sediment carbon content tc was the overwhelming factor that determined ch4 emission flux in the aquaculture ponds 63 8 as the farming season came to an end in the winter ch4 emission decreased accordingly in the present study ch4 emissions from the marsh and ponds also exhibited substantial inter annual variability with the coefficients of variation of 58 and 39 respectively this may be attributed to the differences in salinity f df 2 452 362 p 0 001 as a result of interannual variations in precipitation 1807 mm in 2019 1516 mm in 2020 and 1439 mm in 2021 the mre weather station which affected competition between sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens chambers et al 2013 neubauer et al 2013 vizza et al 2017 this was further confirmed by the significant and negative relationship between ch4 flux and sediment salinity in both habitat types p 0 01 table s2 4 3 limitations and future research there are some limitations and caveats in this study firstly sediment ch4 production potential was measured by incubating slurry in anoxic condition which may not reflect the actual ch4 production rate where the sediment oxygen level varies in situ measurements using tracer technique without the need for incubation may give more accurate ch4 production rates ashley et al 2021 wang et al 2021b the conversion of coastal wetland to aquaculture ponds can exert significant impacts on sediment physicochemical properties and various microorganisms including methanotrophs gao et al 2019 however we did not investigate ch4 oxidizers or oxidation rate in this study a knowledge gap in a fuller understanding of ch4 dynamics in the system in the aquaculture ponds the shrimp may increase the release of sediment ch4 via bioturbation bezerra et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 but the effect can be patchy and difficult to quantify with the floating chamber method lastly land conversion is widespread along the coast of china and other countries but different wetlands can be dominated by different types of vegetation and likewise different aquaculture systems have different farmed species and management practices e g feed applications aeration because of the highly variable species specific effects of vegetation on sediment ch4 dynamics bridgham et al 2013 laanbroek 2010 a more detailed comparative study across regions and system types will improve our understanding of the climate impact of aquaculture related landscape modification 5 conclusions overall the conversion of marsh stand to aquaculture ponds in the shanyutan wetland changed not only the sediment capacity to produce ch4 but also the main ch4 emission pathway despite the lower ch4 production potential in the pond sediment ch4 emission flux was higher thanks to the effective transport pathway through ebullition plant mediated transport was the main pathway for ch4 emission in the marsh but rhizospheric oxidation by the rooted vegetation likely had resulted in the much lower ch4 emission flux despite the higher sediment ch4 production potential therefore the overall effect of land conversion was to increase the areal ch4 output to air which raises concerns of the climate impact of the fast growing small hold aquaculture sector declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

shown that ch4 emission from the aquaculture ponds was much higher than the nearby vegetated wetland yang et al 2017b yet a follow on study showed that the sediment ch4 production potential in the ponds was significantly lower than the vegetated wetland yang et al 2022 to resolve this paradox we hypothesized that conversion of vegetated wetland to aquaculture ponds changes the transport pathways of sediment ch4 leading to an overall higher emission flux in the aquaculture ponds to test our hypothesis we compared ch4 emission flux and the main transport pathways between the aquaculture ponds and nearby wetland over a 33 month period we also collected monthly samples of sediment and porewater from both habitat types over a 10 month period to measure sediment properties and ch4 production potential the results improve our understanding of how conversion of vegetated wetland to aquaculture ponds impacts the climate by changing sediment ch4 production and transport mechanisms and subsequent emission to air 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling frequency the shanyutan wetland region is characterized by a subtropical humid monsoonal climate with 1390 mm annual mean precipitation 19 6 c air temperature and 77 0 relative humidity yang et al 2020 a large area of the wetland has been cleared of vegetation mainly cyperus malaccensis and spartina alterniflora and reclaimed for shrimp litopenaeus vannamei aquaculture over the past decade yang et al 2020 a brackish c malaccensis marsh stand and three nearby aquaculture ponds were selected for the study fig 1c to measure plant mediated ch4 emission in the marsh two sets of 1 m 1 m plots in triplicate 5 m distance between plots were established one set of the plots was used as shoot clipping treatment sct where the aboveground vegetation was removed and petroleum jelly was used to seal the clipped end of the stems to prevent gas release tong et al 2012 the plants in the other set were left intact as the unclipped control treatment uct hu et al 2016 tong et al 2012 the selected shrimp aquaculture ponds were 1 0 3 0 ha in area with a mean water depth of 1 5 m during the farming period the ponds were filled with seawater drawn from the estuary shrimp farming started in may and ended in november producing a single crop the shrimp was fed commercial food pellets daily further details of the aquaculture pond system and farming practice can be found elsewhere yang et al 2020 ch4 flux measurements were taken 1 2 times each month between april 2019 and december 2021 sediment

porewater top 15 cm in the brackish marsh was sampled by in situ dialysis strack and waddington 2008 tong et al 2018 porewater within the pond sediment was extracted by centrifugation in the laboratory bodmer et al 2020 matos et al 2016 all field samples were stored in an ice packed cooler and transported back to the laboratory within 4 6 hr 2 2 ch4 emission flux measurements within the marsh stand gas samples from the sct and uct plots were collected using a static chamber tong et al 2012 xiang et al 2015 the static chamber was made of transparent polyvinyl chloride pvc with a top chamber 35 cm length 35 cm width 100 cm height and a bottom collar 35 cm length 35 cm width 30 cm height the bottom collar was inserted into the marsh sediment leaving only 5 cm above the sediment surface gas samples from the aquaculture ponds were collected using a floating chamber fc as described in previous studies natchimuthu et al 2016 yang et al 2020 the fc was made from an inverted plastic basin polyethylene plexiglas covering an area of 0 1 m2 and a volume of 5 2 l and was fitted with styrofoam on the sides for floatation on each sampling date gas samples were taken from each chamber headspace with a syringe into 50 ml aluminum foil gas sample bags dalian delin gas packing co ltd china at 0 15 30 and 45 min intervals upon return to the laboratory the ch4 concentrations in the gas sample bags were measured using a shimadzu gc 2010 gas chromatograph kyoto japan with a flame ionization detector fid the ch4 fluxes mg m 2 h 1 were calculated according to hirota et al 2004 and yuan et al 2021 2 3 determination of ch4 transport pathways within the marsh stand the ch4 flux measured in the uct plot was a combination of diffusive ebullitive and plant mediated ch4 fluxes whereas the ch4 flux measured in the sct plot represented the combination of diffusive and ebullitive ch4 fluxes therefore plant mediated ch4 flux was deduced from the difference in ch4 flux between uct and sct plots ding et al 2005 hu et al 2016 the ch4 flux measured by the fc method f t in the aquaculture ponds represented the combination of ebullitive flux f e and diffusive flux f d chuang et

shimadzu kyoto japan borges et al 2018 musenze et al 2014 yang et al 2019a 2020 diffusive flux f d mg m 2 h 1 across the water air interface was calculated as 1 f d k x c w c eq m 1000 where k x is the gas transfer coefficient m h 1 calculated from wind speed cole and caraco 1998 c w is the dissolved ch4 concentration μmol l 1 c eq is the air equilibrated dissolved ch4 concentration μmol l 1 in surface water for the in situ temperature and salinity and m is the molar mass of ch4 16 g mol 1 afterward ebullitive flux f e was calculated as the difference between f t and f d chuang et al 2017 xiao et al 2017 2 4 measurement of sediment ch4 production potential triplicate sediment samples top 15 cm collected from each site were used in anaerobic slurry incubation experiment to measure ch4

bottles were incubated for 15 days at in situ temperature 14 30 c on days 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 and 15 a 5 ml headspace gas sample was taken with a syringe from each bottle and 5 ml pure n2 gas was added back to maintain the pressure ch4 concentrations in the extracted gas samples were analyzed on a gas chromatograph gc 2010 with fid shimadzu kyoto japan sediment ch4 production potential was calculated from the slope of linear regression between headspace ch4 concentration and incubation time for each sample bottle liu et al 2019 wassmann et al 1998 2 5 ancillary environmental variables

the aquaculture ponds was mostly driven by tc which explained 63 8 of the variation followed by nh4 n 15 and t s 5 5 fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of land conversion on ch4 dynamics ch4 is produced in the sediment by methanogenic archaea through the stepwise degradation of organic matter under anoxic condition segers 1998 villa et al 2020 once produced ch4 can be exported from the sediment to the atmosphere via different pathways bastviken et al 2004 jeffrey et al 2019 villa et al 2020 the presence of marsh plants may affect ch4 dynamics in several ways deposition of organic carbon by the plants may increase sediment methanogenesis as plants use their vascular systems for gaseous exchange between tissues the process brings o2 to the below ground biomass but may also accelerate the transport and release of sediment ch4 to air sorrell and boon 1994 the overall effect may depend on the plant species leading to different degrees of increase or decrease in ch4 emission relative to bare sediment gurbir et al 2013 the contributions of plant mediated transport to total ch4 emission vary widely between different wetlands ranging from 8 to 98 jeffrey et al 2019 knoblauch et al 2015 korrensalo et al 2022 morrissey and livingston 1992 in the present study we found that the marsh plots with clipped above ground vegetation 0 3 0 1 mg m 2 h 1 had lower ch4 emission flux than the plots with intact vegetation 1 3 0 2 mg m 2 h 1 indicating that the presence of c malaccensis increased ch4 emission relative to bare marsh sediment and plant mediated transport accounted for on average 75 at times close to 100 of the ch4 emission in the marsh fig 3a a notable observation in this study was that ch4 emission flux in the aquaculture ponds on average was much higher than the marsh fig s1b suggesting that conversion of marsh stand to aquaculture ponds would increase the areal output of ch4 from the shanyutan wetland these results are consistent with an earlier study yang et al 2017 and are in line with a meta analysis showing that ch4 emission fluxes increased by 347 following the conversion of coastal wetlands to aquaculture ponds tan et al 2020 however ch4 production potential independently measured by incubation experiment was actually lower in the aquaculture pond sediment than in the marsh sediment fig s1 confirming the observations in an earlier study and which could be attributed to the lower organic content lower methanogen diversity and weaker interactions among the methanogens in the pond sediment yang et al 2022 it should be noted that the ch4 production was measured by anoxic incubation of slurry and therefore it reflected the potential capacity of ch4 production rather than actual in situ ch4 production nevertheless the paradoxical observations suggest that a higher ch4 emission was not necessarily an indication of a higher capacity of the sediment to produce ch4 rather other factors need to be taken into consideration that might affect the fate of ch4 in the system net ch4 emission is determined by the balance between ch4 production and ch4 consumption schimel 1995 korrensalo et al 2022 yang et al 2019a methanogenesis in the sediment is driven by organic carbon substrates and activity of methanogens under anoxic condition ch4 from the sediment may be consumed by methanotrophs in the overlying oxic water before reaching the atmosphere bastviken et al 2008 yang et al 2015 the vascular systems of the marsh plants that facilitate ch4 transport can also bring atmospheric oxygen belowground blossfeld et al 2011 korrensalo et al 2022 turner et al 2020 potentially increasing ch4 oxidation around the roots laanbroek 2010 some studies have reported that rhizospheric oxidation removes most of the ch4 produced in the sediment e g calhoun and king 1997 popp et al 2000 fritz et al 2011 in addition river flow and periodic tidal flushing within the marsh would increase do level in surface sediment well et al 2018 thereby enhancing ch4 oxidation and minimizing ch4 accumulation within the sediment tan et al 2020 yamamoto et al 2011 these altogether perhaps cause the low ch4 emission flux in our marsh stand despite the higher sediment ch4 production potential marsh vegetation was removed to create the aquaculture ponds within the shanyutan wetland therefore plant mediated ch4 emission and rhizospheric oxidation were absent in the ponds instead ch4 diffusing out of the sediment could be consumed by ch4 oxidation within the water column before reaching the air indeed our results showed that ch4 emission flux in the ponds was strongly and negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen concentration figs 5 and 6 on the other hand the stagnant nature of the pond water may allow ch4 to accumulate and form bubbles in the sediment and subsequent ebullition would allow the ch4 to bypass oxidation within the water column yuan et al 2021 earlier studies have shown that porewater ch4 in the pond sediment accumulated to a much higher level 51 5 μm yang et al 2019b than the marsh sediment 17 1 μm tong et al 2018 consequently despite the lower sediment ch4 production potential in the ponds fig s1a the ch4 emission flux was more than 10 fold higher than the marsh with ebullition accounting for on average 85 of the total ch4 emission fig 3b this percentage is similar to the observations in freshwater aquaculture ponds yuan et al 2021 and it falls within the range 50 95 via ebullition reported for organic rich shallow aquatic systems natchimuthu et al 2014 wang et al 2021a wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 4 2 environmental drivers of temporal variations in ch4 emission our results show that both the brackish marsh and the aquaculture ponds in the shanyutan wetland were atmospheric ch4 sources with similar seasonal variabilities fig 2 higher ch4 emissions occurred in the summer and lower emissions in the winter in both habitats fig s2 which is consistent with observations in others coastal wetlands jacotot et al 2019 olsson et al 2015 yang et al 2021 and aquatic systems borges et al 2018 praetzel et al 2021 sierra et al 2017 wu et al 2019 despite the similar seasonal patterns we suggest that the underlying causes differed when considering the respective dominant transport pathway and environmental drivers in each habitat type in the marsh stand sediment carbon content tc was only moderately important in driving ch4 emission flux explaining 11 7 of the variation fig 6 suggesting that ch4 emission flux in the marsh was weakly coupled to methanogenesis in the sediment rather sediment temperature t s was the strongest factor driving ch4 emission flux explaining 39 8 of the variation rather sediment temperature t s was the strongest factor driving ch4 emission flux explaining 39 8 of the variation given that plant mediated transport was the dominant ch4 emission pathway in the marsh higher t s in the summer might increase evapotranspiration rate leading to higher ch4 emission as has been observed in other vegetated wetlands macdonald et al 1998 however plant mediated emission was irrelevant in the aquaculture ponds instead the rise and fall of ch4 emission flux followed the farming cycle the start of farming activity in the summer would have increased organic substrate availability from feeds and animal wastes in the sediment and driven up ch4 emission indeed rda analysis showed that sediment carbon content tc was the overwhelming factor that determined ch4 emission flux in the aquaculture ponds 63 8 as the farming season came to an end in the winter ch4 emission decreased accordingly in the present study ch4 emissions from the marsh and ponds also exhibited substantial inter annual variability with the coefficients of variation of 58 and 39 respectively this may be attributed to the differences in salinity f df 2 452 362 p 0 001 as a result of interannual variations in precipitation 1807 mm in 2019 1516 mm in 2020 and 1439 mm in 2021 the mre weather station which affected competition between sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens chambers et al 2013 neubauer et al 2013 vizza et al 2017 this was further confirmed by the significant and negative relationship between ch4 flux and sediment salinity in both habitat types p 0 01 table s2 4 3 limitations and future research there are some limitations and caveats in this study firstly sediment ch4 production potential was measured by incubating slurry in anoxic condition which may not reflect the actual ch4 production rate where the sediment oxygen level varies in situ measurements using tracer technique without the need for incubation may give more accurate ch4 production rates ashley et al 2021 wang et al 2021b the conversion of coastal wetland to aquaculture ponds can exert significant impacts on sediment physicochemical properties and various microorganisms including methanotrophs gao et al 2019 however we did not investigate ch4 oxidizers or oxidation rate in this study a knowledge gap in a fuller understanding of ch4 dynamics in the system in the aquaculture ponds the shrimp may increase the release of sediment ch4 via bioturbation bezerra et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 but the effect can be patchy and difficult to quantify with the floating chamber method lastly land conversion is widespread along the coast of china and other countries but different wetlands can be dominated by different types of vegetation and likewise different aquaculture systems have different farmed species and management practices e g feed applications aeration because of the highly variable species specific effects of vegetation on sediment ch4 dynamics bridgham et al 2013 laanbroek 2010 a more detailed comparative study across regions and system types will improve our understanding of the climate impact of aquaculture related landscape modification 5 conclusions overall the conversion of marsh stand to aquaculture ponds in the shanyutan wetland changed not only the sediment capacity to produce ch4 but also the main ch4 emission pathway despite the lower ch4 production potential in the pond sediment ch4 emission flux was higher thanks to the effective transport pathway through ebullition plant mediated transport was the main pathway for ch4 emission in the marsh but rhizospheric oxidation by the rooted vegetation likely had resulted in the much lower ch4 emission flux despite the higher sediment ch4 production potential therefore the overall effect of land conversion was to increase the areal ch4 output to air which raises concerns of the climate impact of the fast growing small hold aquaculture sector declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

helping reduce water withdrawal and improve water reliability these benefits only emerge when decentralized water technologies are widely implemented several decision supporting frameworks have been developed to identify suitable locations for deploying decentralized water technologies in a city yet the support remains inadequate regarding 1 the evaluation of the trade off between environmental benefits and economic costs in selecting locations and 2 the interpretation of the transition of optimal selections from low to high investment to assist in the promotion this study presents an integrated analytic framework that combines multi objective optimization and data driven interpretation to direct the city wide sustainable promotion of building based decentralized water technologies we select single family houses in the city of boston and apply the framework to study the promotion of building based rwh and gwr the framework starts with multi objective spatial optimization to identify the non dominant optimal selections i e pareto front of houses and technologies at the trade off between maximizing energy savings and minimizing financial investment then we evaluate the impact of the initial selection setting and the community based maximum water saving constraint on the pareto optimal front the spatial optimization shows that rwh is much more applicable than gwr for single family house communities in boston when interpreting the pareto front two clusters of census blocks stand out based on the change in the percentages of houses selected to invest rwh and gwr in each census block along with different investment levels one cluster demonstrates its priority of being first selected to deploy rwh using random forest critical features explain why one cluster should be selected first for promotion including the larger demand for non potable water use longer distance from the centralized facilities and larger rooftop for collecting rainwater finally we discuss possible future improvements of the proposed spatial optimization and interpretation framework overall our study can be useful to promote decentralized water technologies in cities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords multi objective spatial optimization data driven interpretation rainwater harvesting greywater recycling sustainable promotion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the world most urban water and wastewater services tend to be centralized derrible 2019 but aging centralized water systems result in substantial loss of treated water and are vulnerable in the face of climate change the maintenance extension and upgrade of centralized water systems are costly and the increase in water cost can cause water unaffordability for low income urban communities asce 2021 it is therefore imperative to investigate alternative urban water and wastewater management strategies that can yield both economic and environmental benefits one such alternative management strategy is to implement building based decentralized water treatment solutions as a supplement to centralized water systems derrible et al 2021 by diversifying the portfolio of water sources such as harvested rainwater and recycled greywater decentralized water treatment in buildings can help reduce the volumes of water withdrawn from the environment marinoski and ghisi 2019 yu et al 2015 decentralized water treatment in buildings can also reduce pumping energy use by placing the treatment units adjacent to the point of use and by providing fit for purpose water supplies hendrickson et al 2015 however decentralized water technologies can also consume more energy for water treatment than centralized systems because of the economies of scale without properly locating decentralized water treatment solutions the city can face an increase in water use energy consumption cornejo et al 2016 kavvada et al 2016 liu et al 2021 therefore to sustainably promote city wide building based decentralized water technologies the optimal selections of buildings for implementation first need to be identified to avoid any unintended energy use increase several decision support frameworks have been developed for the city wide planning of decentralized water technologies stang et al 2021 developed an optimization method for designing building based rainwater harvesting rwh and greywater recycling gwr to minimize the life cycle energy or cost the ranking of buildings to be selected for installing rwh or gwr was determined based on the life cycle energy or cost of the optimal rwh or gwr kavvada et al 2018 developed an optimization method to identify the optimal size of the water reuse facility that minimizes the energy cost or greenhouse gas emissions for treating and supplying reclaimed water like stang et al 2021 the ranking of locations to be selected for implementing water reuse was determined based on the energy cost or greenhouse gas emissions of the optimized design of the water reuse facility liu et al 2021 created an iterative process to identify the consumers with high energy intensity for water supply as the location for gwr deployment these decision support frameworks are useful and insightful to understand the potential locations for deploying decentralized water technologies in a city but these frameworks only use one performance metric to identify the most suitable locations the impacts of the trade offs among different performance metrics are not thoroughly evaluated on the optimal selection of locations in a city for deploying decentralized water technologies moreover one optimal spatial plan was presented as a common concluding result of previous studies it should be noted that the city wide promotion of building based decentralized water technologies is a long term process governments should create incentives to promote building based decentralized water technologies as the promotion moves on and the investment accumulates the prioritized building locations and technologies are changing to maximize the benefits of investing in decentralized water technologies therefore the change of optimal building locations and technologies should be examined from low to high financial investment at the same time built environment and socio economic features such as building design distance to centralized water and wastewater plants and household size can influence the performance of decentralized water technologies hargreaves et al 2019 it is useful to summarize the association of critical built environment and socio economic features and the decisions of when buildings should be included and what technologies should be invested revealing this transition dynamic and interpreting critical features of prioritized locations can improve how a city can adaptively manage the promotion of building based decentralized water technologies however such an interpretation remains inadequate in the literature of decision support frameworks for city wide planning of decentralized water technologies therefore in this article we present an integrated analytic framework to help establish city wide sustainable promotions of building based decentralized water technologies fig 1 we selected the city of boston as our study area and focused on the plan of promoting rainwater harvesting rwh and greywater recycling gwr for non potable water use in single family house communities in the phase of optimization we developed a multi objective spatial optimization model to evaluate the trade off between maximizing energy savings and minimizing investment costs in selecting buildings and technologies for deploying decentralized water technologies fig 1 as a popular algorithm genetic algorithm ga was selected to develop a non dominated solution set i e pareto front through the selection crossover and mutation of optimal solutions deb 1999 generating a pareto front that approximates the best solutions is key to understanding the optimal solutions and their trade offs deng et al 2022 dong et al 2012 vairavamoorthy and ali 2000 therefore we first examined the impact of ga solution initialization on the pareto front when interpreting the results a series of data driven approaches were developed to analyze the change in the percentage of houses selected at the census block level from low to high financial investment fig 1 these data driven approaches enable a clear identification of prioritized census blocks and their critical features at different stages of investment overall our spatial optimization and interpretation framework can provide insights into the promotion of building based decentralized water technologies in the future our integrated analytic framework can be further expanded to include on site wastewater reuse advanced treatment for portable use and be applied to study other building types the rest of the article consists of four sections in section 2 we describe our study area data preparation spatial optimization model and interpretation steps the results are reported in section 3 including the impact of ga solution initialization on the pareto front the outcome of spatial optimization and the interpretation of prioritized locations and their critical features at different stages of investment a discussion about the results and the framework is presented in section 4 finally a conclusion is offered in section 5 2 materials and methods in this section we firstly introduce the study area i e the city of boston and its current central water and wastewater system section 2 1 we describe the data preparation process to initialize the proposed integrated framework including data about rwh and gwr design and evaluation of the cost and energy savings section 2 2 sections 2 3 and 2 4 introduce the methods selected for multi objective spatial optimization and data driven interpretation respectively key variables for completing these two sections are summarized at the end 2 1 study area boston purchases water from the massachusetts water resource authority mwra which oversees the wholesale water and wastewater services provided to metropolitan boston mb communities mwra 2012 the mwra water supply system withdraws water from the quabbin and wachusett reservoirs and treats water at the john j carroll water treatment plant jcwtp the treated water is sent to several covered water tanks at norumbega and loring road as transit stations fig 2 the transit stations then transfer the treated water to three tanks at blue hills fells and spot ponds prior to being distributed to boston communities water is transported by gravity from the supply reservoirs to the covered water tanks detailed information about service areas of the covered water tanks can be found in section 1 of supporting information si boston has a combined sewer system that collects both stormwater and sanitary sewer mwra 2018 the collected wastewater is first sent to two remote headworks the columbus park and the ward street to remove grits and screen out debris to minimize solid accumulations the cross harbor tunnel i e boston main drainage tunnel then transports wastewater to the deer island treatment plant ditp for treatment before discharging the effluent into the massachusetts bay the collection and transfer of wastewater mainly rely on gravity fig 2 shows the centralized facilities for water supply and wastewater treatment in the city of boston to simplify the distribution network for visualization the sewer segments that collect and transport wastewater from census blocks to headworks were not included in boston residential areas occupy approximately 30 of the city area most of which consist of single family dwellings bpda 2018 single family houses consumed around 47 of the city s total potable water supply a single family home typically with three residents is estimated to consume 34 more of its potable water for irrigation purposes i e lawn watering than a multifamily home indicating a higher chance of introducing and planning alternative water sources yu et al 2015 moreover single family houses have a more evident housing property ownership which makes it easier to calculate a household s daily water use balance and design decentralized water tanks in this article we focused on existing single family houses to study the promotion of building based decentralized water technologies as for new single family houses the city should revise the zoning building codes to incentivize the installation of decentralized water technologies when the house is built 2 2 data preparation 2 2 1 building household and water demand we collected the building information from the arcgis server rest api including lot size roof area and building height for designing and evaluating rwh and gwr we then created synthetic households that represent the socio economic characteristics of single family households in each of the census blocks in the city of boston the household demographic information includes household size and household income which was used to interpret and characterize critical features of census blocks the synthetic households were randomly allocated to buildings within the same census block about 40 000 synthetic households were successfully allocated to the single family houses the details of household synthesis can be found in a previous study lu et al 2019 further the daily indoor and outdoor water use of individual households were estimated based on annual water bills monthly temperature variations and the ratio for various end uses li et al 2021 2 2 2 decentralized water technology design and cost rwh and gwr were selected as building based decentralized water treatment technologies rwh collects and treats rainwater from rooftops gwr collects and treats greywater from shower sink and laundry both harvested rainwater and collected greywater supplement households daily non potable uses i e toilet flushing and landscape irrigation the tank size of rwh and gwr is determined by simulating the need to treat and store daily water balance through a year based on eqs 1 and 2 li et al 2021 the cost of rwh and gwr is estimated as a linear function of tank size li et al 2021 due to a limited number of case studies and data samples we did not include the possible extra investment costs that might be needed in low income communities in this study we only evaluated the capital cost of installing rwh and gwr to calculate the investment cost 1 s t s t 1 i t o t 2 ts min max s t ξ where s represents daily water storage in tanks i is daily water inflow into tanks i e collected rainwater or greywater o is daily water outflow from tanks i e daily non potable water usage t is a time scalar and t 1 2 365 ξ represents a tank design constraint to restrict the tank size ts we used the accumulative non potable water demand for the longest dry period in the city of boston for rwh and the maximum daily non potable water use for gwr to set up the tank design constraint 2 2 3 energy saving from rwh and gwr to estimate the pumping energy for drinking water distribution we first created a water pumping network based on the city road network assuming that the road network can be a good approximation of water pumping distances stang et al 2021 we used the network analysis in arcgis 10 5 to calculate the shortest water paths from the water storage tank to each census block the pumping energy was quantified based on head loss from the water storage tank to census blocks and water consumed by households section s3 1 in si the energy uses for water and wastewater treatment were estimated based on monthly energy intensities provided by jcwtp and ditp tables s2 s3 rwh and gwr consume electricity for on site treatment and pumping we assumed that water use for outdoor irrigation is gravity fed head loss and energy consumption for pumping water to flush toilets were estimated based on building height section s3 3 in si harvested rainwater consumes minimal energy for non potable uses the energy intensity for greywater treatment was collected from the literature i e 1 1 kwh m3 menger krug et al 2015 the synthetic households show that 85 of households live in self owned single family houses we assume no significant change in the water demand of rental single family houses over the years accordingly the one year energy saving was quantified for using rwh and gwr of each single family household respectively a summary of the required input data and collection methods for completing the calculations in this section is available in section s2 of si to benefit studying the promotion of decentralized water technologies in other cities 2 3 multi objective spatial optimization model 2 3 1 spatial optimization model we developed a multi objective spatial optimization model for the city wide implementation of building based decentralized water technologies two objectives were evaluated 1 maximizing the energy saving of using water and 2 minimizing the financial investment of building based decentralized water technologies eq 3 the decision variables to optimize are the building location and the technology for implementing building based decentralized water technologies although water can be saved by decentralized water technologies water age in the distribution network will increase and water quality may degrade as water demand decreases robert et al 2020 which may in turn demand a higher treatment level at the centralized plant and increase its associated cost and energy consumption this can raise a significant health concern around water quality of potable use liu et al 2020 the reduction in wastewater from buildings can slow down wastewater flow and result in more sediment deposition in the sewer network and a higher cost for cleaning the sewer network penn et al 2013 sitzenfrei and rauch 2014 to avoid these negative impacts we included constraints of 20 40 and 60 of the maximum water saving from building based decentralized water technologies at the census block level we assessed the impact of this maximum water saving constraint on the optimal solutions as single family households in the city of boston consume less than 20 of mrwa s total water supply we assumed that the water saving from building based decentralized water technologies among single family household communities does not affect the energy intensity of treating water and wastewater in the centralized systems 3 where e i t represents the energy use for water of household i with the decentralization choice t e i 0 represents the energy use for water from the centralized water system c i t is the capital cost for the decentralization choice t d w i is the annual water consumption of household i δ d w i t is the water saving of household i with the decentralization choice t w w i is the annual wastewater generation of household i δ d w i t is the reduction of wastewater generation of household i with the decentralization choice t r w is the maximum percentage of drinking water and wastewater reduction at the census block level n is the total number of single family houses in the city of boston and n j is the number of single family houses in census block j the choice t includes rwh gwr and neither and the optimization is to identify the optimal choices for all single family houses considering the trade off between water use energy saving and investment costs 2 3 2 ga hyperparameter and operator setting ga was selected to solve the multi objective spatial optimization problem to understand the trade offs between energy savings and financial costs of investing in building based decentralized among single family houses in the city of boston the steps of ga include the initialization of individual solutions evaluation of individual solutions solution ranking and selection and generation of new solutions the individual solution is about the choices of building based decentralized water technologies i e rwh gwr or neither of about 40 000 single family houses in the city of boston key hyperparameters of ga include the number of generations i e the number of iterations of evaluating ranking generating solutions before the ga stops the number of individual solutions i e these individual solutions formulate a population mutation rate and crossover rate hassanat et al 2019 timofeev et al 2019 table 1 lists the setting of our hyperparameters we set a maximum number of 200 generations to stop the ga and a population size of 200 i e 200 individual solutions mutation means a small random tweak of individual solutions and mutation rate is 0 05 which means 5 of individual solutions are mutated to generate new solutions crossover means a generation of new solution from parts of parent solutions and crossover rate is 0 95 the choices of mutation and crossover operators are listed in table 1 the nsga ii selection operator was used to keep top individual solutions with high fitness values deb et al 2002 this multi objective spatial optimization problem was solved by the distributed evolutionary algorithms dea in the python 3 7 working environment 2 3 3 initialization of individual solutions we tested several settings of initial individual solutions and evaluated the impact of individual solution initialization on the pareto front the setting considers the variances in the percentage of houses using decentralized water technologies and the percentages of rwh and gwr in the baseline scenario the percentage of houses using decentralized water technologies was fixed at 50 among these 50 half of the selected houses use rwh while the other half use gwr houses were randomly selected based on these percentages to formulate initial individual solutions in the first test the percentage of houses using decentralized water technologies is a random number from 0 to 1 while the share of rwh and gwr used by selected houses remains equal in the second test the percentage of houses using decentralized water technologies is fixed at 50 while the share of rwh and gwr used by the selected houses is random to formulate initial individual solutions we also evaluated the percentage of houses using decentralized water technologies at 30 and 70 in the second test in the last test both the percentage of houses using decentralized water technologies and the share of rwh and gwr used by the selected houses are random to formulate the initial individual solutions table 2 shows the settings of individual solution initialization the evaluation of individual solution initialization was developed considering the constrain of maximum water and wastewater saving at 40 2 4 interpretation of optimal spatial plans 2 4 1 cluster census blocks based on the change in percentage of houses selected as the investment increases the pareto front from the ga shows a trade off between energy saving and the financial investment of building based decentralized water technologies meanwhile the optimal solutions listed in the pareto front also spatial explicitly reveal the dynamic of the selection of houses as the investment increases to reveal this dynamic we first calculated the percentage of houses selected by census blocks for each optimal solution listed in the pareto front each census block has trajectories of the change in the percentage of houses selected to install rwh and gwr as the investment increases respectively then we applied k means clustering to identify the clusters with differential trajectories we set the silhouette score to decide the optimal number of clusters section s4 of si the tslearn python package was used to complete the cluster analysis 2 4 2 modeling of cluster membership the clusters reveal differential trajectories of the change in the percentage of houses selected to install rwh and gwr as the financial investment increases to better understand the spatial distribution of these clusters we modeled the cluster membership of each census block with its average features including the size of yard roof area household size household income and the pumping distance from the covered storage tank of the centralized water supply system to the census block the selection of input features can be found in section s5 of si we developed the cluster membership model using random forest rf and quantified the impact of the listed census block average features on the cluster membership using the shapley value the shapley value of one feature is the weighted average of the difference between the estimation of the probability of belonging to a certain cluster with and without the input feature of interest for all possible combinations of the rest input features a positive shapley value means that the increase of the input feature value contributes to a higher probability of belonging to the cluster of interest key variables for completing sections 2 3 and 2 4 are summarized in table 3 3 results 3 1 the impact of individual solution initialization on the pareto front fig 3 summarizes the impact of individual solution initialization on the pareto front when both the percentage of houses selected and the ratio of rwh and gwr used by selected houses are fixed the optimal solutions in the pareto front are relatively concentrated by randomizing the percentage of houses selected to initialize individual solutions the pareto front was improved to cover more optimal solutions fig 3a when we fix 50 of houses selected to deploy rwh or gwr in the initial solution setting the percentage of houses selected in the new solution through the crossover of the initial two solutions follows a hypergeometric distribution with a mean of 50 more solutions with a percentage other than 50 can be generated in the procedure of mutation but only 5 of solutions are muted as a result the solutions with a percentage other than 50 are much less likely to be included as candidates for searching optimal solutions the explanation was validated by comparing pareto fronts through fixing the percentage of houses selected while randomizing the ratio of rwh and gwr used by selected houses fig 3b the range of optimal solutions is more limited when we set up a higher fixed percentage of houses selected to develop initial solutions the new solutions in the procedure of crossover can violate the constraints of the optimization model more often and further limit the search of new more optimal solutions by further randomizing the ratio of rwh versus gwr used by selected houses a more dominating pareto front was identified fig 3a this improvement is because we have a high use of gwr when we set the 1 1 ratio of using rwh or gwr among the selected houses in the solution gwr is more expensive than rwh and therefore when we randomize the ratio of using rwh or gwr among the selected houses in the solution the optimal solutions are much less costly to achieve the same level of energy saving the comparison of pareto fronts between baseline fix level ratio in fig 3a and fixlevel randratio 50 in fig 3b can also validate the explanation of the improvement by testing the impact of individual solution initialization on the pareto front we conclude that randomizing the percentage of houses selected and the ratio of rwh and gwr used by selected houses can help develop a pareto front close to the true optimal solutions 3 2 spatial optimization of planning the building based decentralized water technologies 3 2 1 the impact of maximum water saving constraint the maximum water saving constraint is evaluated regarding its impact on the pareto front fig 4 when the percentage of water saved is allowed to increase from 20 to 40 by investing in building based decentralized water technologies the selection of houses can be improved to save more energy given the same amount of financial investment furthermore more optimal solutions can be identified with higher energy savings and lower financial investments by allowing more water saving from investing in building based decentralized water technologies however the improvement of the pareto front is less significant when the percentage of water saved is allowed to increase from 40 to 60 as the relaxation of the maximum water saving enables the selection of more cost effective houses the average non potable water use is about 47 of total water which should open more applications of gwr but the energy intensity of gwr recycling water is higher than that of the centralized water system the improvement of the pareto front depends on the availability of houses that can save energy when using gwr in our study the limited availability of these houses suitable for using gwr can explain the less significant improvement of the pareto front when the percentage of water saved is allowed to increase from 40 to 60 3 2 2 the ratio of rwh and gwr in the optimal spatial plan in the city of boston the optimized spatial plan reveals that rwh has a higher potential than gwr fig 5 rwh is firstly selected when the investment is low and 70 of single family houses can be selected to install rwh at the cost of 13 million usd gwr is selected when the financial investment is higher than 7 5 million usd gwr can save more water at the cost of higher energy intensity and higher financial investment accordingly the marginal energy saving decreases as the financial investment increases only less than 5 of single family houses are selected to use gwr our spatial analysis of the percentage of single family houses selected to implement rwh shows an emergence of priority census blocks for promotion fig 6 a about 44 of the census blocks start to implement rwh at the investment of 0 3 million usd fig 6b as the investment goes up priority census blocks with a high percentage of implementing rwh emerge in southwest and southeast communities and expand across the southern region fig 6a when the investment reaches 6 million usd more than 30 of census blocks have an implementation ratio of rwh exceeding 75 fig 6b the north and central census blocks begin to implement rwh when the investment continues to increase our spatial analysis of the percentage of single family houses selected to implement gwr does not show a clear distinction of priority census blocks for promotion fig 6a only about 5 of census blocks are found to have a low percentage of single family houses selected to implement gwr when the financial investment is lower than 6 million usd fig 6b as the investment increases a cluster of census blocks emerge from the southeast to implement gwr and then the implementation of gwr can be found in most census blocks across the city fig 6a we calculated the potable water saving of four selected pareto fronts with the investment of 0 3 2 6 6 0 and 13 3 million usd the promotion of building based rwh and gwr can save about 18 of annual potable water for single family houses in the city of boston at the investment of 13 3 million usd assuming a lifespan of 5 years for both rwh and gwr the potable water saved per usd invested declines from 148 5 gallons usd to 50 0 gallons usd as the financial investment increases from 0 3 to 13 3 million usd the high capital cost of gwr explains the decline of the marginal potable water saved per usd invested currently the city charges more than 20usd 1000 gallons to maintain and upgrade water and wastewater services bwsc 2021 in other words 1 usd spent can provide no more than 50 gallons of water it is more economically effective to invest in rwh and gwr to save potable water than to fund the centralized system such effectiveness can be higher when the lifespan of both rwh and gwr can be longer 3 2 3 the clustering of census blocks two clusters are identified based on the silhouette score namely more demanding and less demanding clusters to distinguish the census blocks that show differential change in the percentage of houses selected as the investment increases fig 7 the more demanding cluster shows the continuous and rapid increase in the percentage of houses selected to use rwh as the investment increases the average percentage of houses selected to use rwh is close to 100 under a high investment in contrast the less demanding cluster is not considered as the priority to invest in rwh when the investment ranges between 2 6 and 6 0 million usd there is a slightly more rapid increase when the investment goes higher than 6 0 million usd and the percentage of houses selected to use rwh increases from 10 to around 40 as the investment further increases the percentage of houses selected to use rwh in the less demanding cluster approaches 50 overall the second cluster has a lower priority to invest in rwh meanwhile gwr was not selected by the more demanding cluster even under a high investment instead gwr was selected in the less demanding cluster which indicates some houses in this cluster are more cost effective to use gwr through the cluster analysis 256 census blocks are considered as the less demanding cluster and the other 191 census blocks are considered as the more demanding cluster 3 2 4 the cluster membership modeling we applied the under sampling method to create a sample dataset of both less demanding and more demanding census blocks the dataset was further split into 70 for training and 30 for testing the accuracy of the rf model is 74 and we conclude that it is acceptable to interpret the impact of selected urban built and socio economic environment on the priority of locations to use building based decentralized water technologies spatial mapping of the two clusters reveals the locations of the two clusters across the city of boston fig 8 a the two clusters are relatively separated from each other rather than scattered across each other the more demanding cluster is in the southern part of the city while the less demanding cluster is in the northern part of the city without considering matters of equity we conclude that if the city plans to promote rwh with a limited financial budget it should focus on the more demanding cluster the city can decide whether more financial budgets should be allocated to expand to the less demanding cluster the spatial separation of clusters allows the city to actively promote the use of building based rwh in the census block belonging to the more demanding cluster and maximize energy saving we consider the emergence of the spatial separation of the two clusters as a result influenced by urban built and socio economic environment fig 8b based on the shapley value of the size of yard single family houses with larger yards are more likely to belong to the more demanding cluster the larger yards mean a higher demand of non potable water for irrigation a longer pumping distance from the covered storage tank of the centralized water system to the census block also contributes to a higher probability of belonging to the more demanding cluster a larger roof area also contributes to a higher probability of belonging to the more demanding cluster indicating more rainwater can be harvested for non potable water both larger household size and higher household income contribute to a higher estimated probability of being the more demanding cluster as both indicate higher water consumption and non potable water use we conclude that the more demanding cluster has features including higher demand for non potable water use measured by the size of the yard household size and household income and a long distance away from the centralized water system measured by the pumping distance larger roof areas of the more demanding cluster can explain the use of rwh as the optimal choice of building based decentralized water technologies the emergence of more demanding raises a concern that wealthier communities should be prioritized to study incentives for promoting rwh based on the objectives of maximizing the energy saving of using water and minimizing investment costs a previous study shows that the low property value communities in boston have a higher demand for decentralized water technologies lu et al 2019 the objectives of maximizing energy saving and minimizing investment costs do not help low income communities improve their water and sanitation services first therefore adding more objectives to improve social equality in access to water and sanitation services should be included as well to help the city promote decentralized water technologies 4 discussion in this study two clusters were identified that reveal differential needs of building based decentralized water technologies and rwh is a more applicable decentralized solution than gwr among single family house communities in the city of boston our result can be explained by the urban built and socio economic environment other cities have their unique urban built and socio economic environment and this can lead to different results regarding the number of clusters and more applicable solutions by including more objectives such as maximizing equitable access to water and sanitation services our spatial optimization and interpretation framework can be valuable to provide a comprehensive understanding of where and when the decentralized water technologies should be promoted this understanding will allow the city to follow up on other non technical e g willingness to accept or pay and technical issues e g water quality facility maintenance in the prioritized communities and explore location specific policy incentives to increase the adoption and accelerate the implementation our study can be improved from at least three aspects to provide a more robust and comprehensive planning support for promoting decentralized water technologies first we only tested rwh and gwr as the decentralized water technologies rwh and gwr can be integrated as a system to provide more non potable water and secure more stable supply however the benefit of integrated rwh and gwr is limited because of the high cost and electricity intensity of gwr as well as the maximum water saving constraint for ensuring the operation of the centralized water system wastewater reuse can be another decentralized alternative that treats the wastewater for non potable use decentralized water reuse has the same problem of high electricity intensity as gwr although decentralized water technologies can reduce water consumption these technologies do not address the energy related impact of treating and supplying water the solution to reducing the energy related impact of decentralized water technologies is needed to improve urban water sustainability second future studies should also consider the scale of decentralized water technologies besides locations and technologies we only considered building based decentralized water technologies having each building install its decentralized water system may not be optimal than having a community based decentralized water facility serving these buildings to quantify the benefits of decentralized water technologies the variability in building water demand and rainfall resources should be included to reflect the relocation of households and climate change in the long run third the impact of promoting decentralized water technologies on the energy intensity of the centralized water system especially the wastewater treatment is assumed to be negligible in this study since we only focused on single family houses we did not include the impact of reduced rainfall on the operation of the wastewater treatment plants in evaluating the benefit of city wide use of rwh when expanding the promotion of decentralized water technologies to other building types more water saving from greywater recycling reduces the inflow of wastewater to the centralized system which may increase the energy intensity of treating wastewater meanwhile more water saving can increase the organic content of influent wastewater and improve the energy recovery from anaerobic digestion but the increased organic loading in the influent can increase the electricity consumption in the activated sludge system the impact of city wide planning of decentralized water technologies on the energy consumption of the centralized system should be investigated in future studies khalkhali et al 2021 by adding these dynamics in evaluating the objectives the complexity of solving the optimization will increase and it is useful to test other algorithms such as multi objective particle swarm optimization and multi objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition these tests will help identify the most efficient algorithms to solve the spatial optimization of decentralized water technologies and verify the consistency of pareto fronts with the above improvements our analysis can produce a more robust and comprehensive plan for promoting decentralized water technologies 5 conclusion investments in city wide decentralized water technologies should be made to benefit existing central urban water systems this study presents an integrated spatial optimization and interpretation framework that can help cities prioritize the promotion of decentralized water technologies the optimal solutions for single family houses in the city of boston suggest that rwh is more applicable than gwr to minimize investment costs and maximize water use energy savings this finding can be useful for the city to further investigate possible incentives focusing on rwh the data driven interpretation of optimal solutions separates the census blocks into the more demanding and less demanding clusters for the building based rwh and gwr this finding offers insights to customize incentives for the more demanding cluster to improve the welfare of individual buildings as well as to maximize the benefits of the urban water system the characteristics of the more demanding cluster were identified to recognize the critical features of the single family houses selected to implement rwh or gwr in the optimization this improved the understanding of the rationale behind optimal choices associated with given objectives our framework can also be applied to other cities for the planning and promotion of decentralized water technologies different cities have their unique urban socioeconomic characteristics and built environment the objectives can be more inclusive beyond water use energy savings and investments such as to improve water and sanitation services in low income communities the findings in other cities using our framework with more inclusive objectives can be different but will be significant to enrich the understanding of city wide promotion of decentralized water technologies to improve the applicability of our method future research could also include more types of decentralized water technologies an optimization of the scale of decentralized water

helping reduce water withdrawal and improve water reliability these benefits only emerge when decentralized water technologies are widely implemented several decision supporting frameworks have been developed to identify suitable locations for deploying decentralized water technologies in a city yet the support remains inadequate regarding 1 the evaluation of the trade off between environmental benefits and economic costs in selecting locations and 2 the interpretation of the transition of optimal selections from low to high investment to assist in the promotion this study presents an integrated analytic framework that combines multi objective optimization and data driven interpretation to direct the city wide sustainable promotion of building based decentralized water technologies we select single family houses in the city of boston and apply the framework to study the promotion of building based rwh and gwr the framework starts with multi objective spatial optimization to identify the non dominant optimal selections i e pareto front of houses and technologies at the trade off between maximizing energy savings and minimizing financial investment then we evaluate the impact of the initial selection setting and the community based maximum water saving constraint on the pareto optimal front the spatial optimization shows that rwh is much more applicable than gwr for single family house communities in boston when interpreting the pareto front two clusters of census blocks stand out based on the change in the percentages of houses selected to invest rwh and gwr in each census block along with different investment levels one cluster demonstrates its priority of being first selected to deploy rwh using random forest critical features explain why one cluster should be selected first for promotion including the larger demand for non potable water use longer distance from the centralized facilities and larger rooftop for collecting rainwater finally we discuss possible future improvements of the proposed spatial optimization and interpretation framework overall our study can be useful to promote decentralized water technologies in cities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords multi objective spatial optimization data driven interpretation rainwater harvesting greywater recycling sustainable promotion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the world most urban water and wastewater services tend to be centralized derrible 2019 but aging centralized water systems result in substantial loss of treated water and are vulnerable in the face of climate change the maintenance extension and upgrade of centralized water systems are costly and the increase in water cost can cause water unaffordability for low income urban communities asce 2021 it is therefore imperative to investigate alternative urban water and wastewater management strategies that can yield both economic and environmental benefits one such alternative management strategy is to implement building based decentralized water treatment solutions as a supplement to centralized water systems derrible et al 2021 by diversifying the portfolio of water sources such as harvested rainwater and recycled greywater decentralized water treatment in buildings can help reduce the volumes of water withdrawn from the environment marinoski and ghisi 2019 yu et al 2015 decentralized water treatment in buildings can also reduce pumping energy use by placing the treatment units adjacent to the point of use and by providing fit for purpose water supplies hendrickson et al 2015 however decentralized water technologies can also consume more energy for water treatment than centralized systems because of the economies of scale without properly locating decentralized water treatment solutions the city can face an increase in water use energy consumption cornejo et al 2016 kavvada et al 2016 liu et al 2021 therefore to sustainably promote city wide building based decentralized water technologies the optimal selections of buildings for implementation first need to be identified to avoid any unintended energy use increase several decision support frameworks have been developed for the city wide planning of decentralized water technologies stang et al 2021 developed an optimization method for designing building based rainwater harvesting rwh and greywater recycling gwr to minimize the life cycle energy or cost the ranking of buildings to be selected for installing rwh or gwr was determined based on the life cycle energy or cost of the optimal rwh or gwr kavvada et al 2018 developed an optimization method to identify the optimal size of the water reuse facility that minimizes the energy cost or greenhouse gas emissions for treating and supplying reclaimed water like stang et al 2021 the ranking of locations to be selected for implementing water reuse was determined based on the energy cost or greenhouse gas emissions of the optimized design of the water reuse facility liu et al 2021 created an iterative process to identify the consumers with high energy intensity for water supply as the location for gwr deployment these decision support frameworks are useful and insightful to understand the potential locations for deploying decentralized water technologies in a city but these frameworks only use one performance metric to identify the most suitable locations the impacts of the trade offs among different performance metrics are not thoroughly evaluated on the optimal selection of locations in a city for deploying decentralized water technologies moreover one optimal spatial plan was presented as a common concluding result of previous studies it should be noted that the city wide promotion of building based decentralized water technologies is a long term process governments should create incentives to promote building based decentralized water technologies as the promotion moves on and the investment accumulates the prioritized building locations and technologies are changing to maximize the benefits of investing in decentralized water technologies therefore the change of optimal building locations and technologies should be examined from low to high financial investment at the same time built environment and socio economic features such as building design distance to centralized water and wastewater plants and household size can influence the performance of decentralized water technologies hargreaves et al 2019 it is useful to summarize the association of critical built environment and socio economic features and the decisions of when buildings should be included and what technologies should be invested revealing this transition dynamic and interpreting critical features of prioritized locations can improve how a city can adaptively manage the promotion of building based decentralized water technologies however such an interpretation remains inadequate in the literature of decision support frameworks for city wide planning of decentralized water technologies therefore in this article we present an integrated analytic framework to help establish city wide sustainable promotions of building based decentralized water technologies fig 1 we selected the city of boston as our study area and focused on the plan of promoting rainwater harvesting rwh and greywater recycling gwr for non potable water use in single family house communities in the phase of optimization we developed a multi objective spatial optimization model to evaluate the trade off between maximizing energy savings and minimizing investment costs in selecting buildings and technologies for deploying decentralized water technologies fig 1 as a popular algorithm genetic algorithm ga was selected to develop a non dominated solution set i e pareto front through the selection crossover and mutation of optimal solutions deb 1999 generating a pareto front that approximates the best solutions is key to understanding the optimal solutions and their trade offs deng et al 2022 dong et al 2012 vairavamoorthy and ali 2000 therefore we first examined the impact of ga solution initialization on the pareto front when interpreting the results a series of data driven approaches were developed to analyze the change in the percentage of houses selected at the census block level from low to high financial investment fig 1 these data driven approaches enable a clear identification of prioritized census blocks and their critical features at different stages of investment overall our spatial optimization and interpretation framework can provide insights into the promotion of building based decentralized water technologies in the future our integrated analytic framework can be further expanded to include on site wastewater reuse advanced treatment for portable use and be applied to study other building types the rest of the article consists of four sections in section 2 we describe our study area data preparation spatial optimization model and interpretation steps the results are reported in section 3 including the impact of ga solution initialization on the pareto front the outcome of spatial optimization and the interpretation of prioritized locations and their critical features at different stages of investment a discussion about the results and the framework is presented in section 4 finally a conclusion is offered in section 5 2 materials and methods in this section we firstly introduce the study area i e the city of boston and its current central water and wastewater system section 2 1 we describe the data preparation process to initialize the proposed integrated framework including data about rwh and gwr design and evaluation of the cost and energy savings section 2 2 sections 2 3 and 2 4 introduce the methods selected for multi objective spatial optimization and data driven interpretation respectively key variables for completing these two sections are summarized at the end 2 1 study area boston purchases water from the massachusetts water resource authority mwra which oversees the wholesale water and wastewater services provided to metropolitan boston mb communities mwra 2012 the mwra water supply system withdraws water from the quabbin and wachusett reservoirs and treats water at the john j carroll water treatment plant jcwtp the treated water is sent to several covered water tanks at norumbega and loring road as transit stations fig 2 the transit stations then transfer the treated water to three tanks at blue hills fells and spot ponds prior to being distributed to boston communities water is transported by gravity from the supply reservoirs to the covered water tanks detailed information about service areas of the covered water tanks can be found in section 1 of supporting information si boston has a combined sewer system that collects both stormwater and sanitary sewer mwra 2018 the collected wastewater is first sent to two remote headworks the columbus park and the ward street to remove grits and screen out debris to minimize solid accumulations the cross harbor tunnel i e boston main drainage tunnel then transports wastewater to the deer island treatment plant ditp for treatment before discharging the effluent into the massachusetts bay the collection and transfer of wastewater mainly rely on gravity fig 2 shows the centralized facilities for water supply and wastewater treatment in the city of boston to simplify the distribution network for visualization the sewer segments that collect and transport wastewater from census blocks to headworks were not included in boston residential areas occupy approximately 30 of the city area most of which consist of single family dwellings bpda 2018 single family houses consumed around 47 of the city s total potable water supply a single family home typically with three residents is estimated to consume 34 more of its potable water for irrigation purposes i e lawn watering than a multifamily home indicating a higher chance of introducing and planning alternative water sources yu et al 2015 moreover single family houses have a more evident housing property ownership which makes it easier to calculate a household s daily water use balance and design decentralized water tanks in this article we focused on existing single family houses to study the promotion of building based decentralized water technologies as for new single family houses the city should revise the zoning building codes to incentivize the installation of decentralized water technologies when the house is built 2 2 data preparation 2 2 1 building household and water demand we collected the building information from the arcgis server rest api including lot size roof area and building height for designing and evaluating rwh and gwr we then created synthetic households that represent the socio economic characteristics of single family households in each of the census blocks in the city of boston the household demographic information includes household size and household income which was used to interpret and characterize critical features of census blocks the synthetic households were randomly allocated to buildings within the same census block about 40 000 synthetic households were successfully allocated to the single family houses the details of household synthesis can be found in a previous study lu et al 2019 further the daily indoor and outdoor water use of individual households were estimated based on annual water bills monthly temperature variations and the ratio for various end uses li et al 2021 2 2 2 decentralized water technology design and cost rwh and gwr were selected as building based decentralized water treatment technologies rwh collects and treats rainwater from rooftops gwr collects and treats greywater from shower sink and laundry both harvested rainwater and collected greywater supplement households daily non potable uses i e toilet flushing and landscape irrigation the tank size of rwh and gwr is determined by simulating the need to treat and store daily water balance through a year based on eqs 1 and 2 li et al 2021 the cost of rwh and gwr is estimated as a linear function of tank size li et al 2021 due to a limited number of case studies and data samples we did not include the possible extra investment costs that might be needed in low income communities in this study we only evaluated the capital cost of installing rwh and gwr to calculate the investment cost 1 s t s t 1 i t o t 2 ts min max s t ξ where s represents daily water storage in tanks i is daily water inflow into tanks i e collected rainwater or greywater o is daily water outflow from tanks i e daily non potable water usage t is a time scalar and t 1 2 365 ξ represents a tank design constraint to restrict the tank size ts we used the accumulative non potable water demand for the longest dry period in the city of boston for rwh and the maximum daily non potable water use for gwr to set up the tank design constraint 2 2 3 energy saving from rwh and gwr to estimate the pumping energy for drinking water distribution we first created a water pumping network based on the city road network assuming that the road network can be a good approximation of water pumping distances stang et al 2021 we used the network analysis in arcgis 10 5 to calculate the shortest water paths from the water storage tank to each census block the pumping energy was quantified based on head loss from the water storage tank to census blocks and water consumed by households section s3 1 in si the energy uses for water and wastewater treatment were estimated based on monthly energy intensities provided by jcwtp and ditp tables s2 s3 rwh and gwr consume electricity for on site treatment and pumping we assumed that water use for outdoor irrigation is gravity fed head loss and energy consumption for pumping water to flush toilets were estimated based on building height section s3 3 in si harvested rainwater consumes minimal energy for non potable uses the energy intensity for greywater treatment was collected from the literature i e 1 1 kwh m3 menger krug et al 2015 the synthetic households show that 85 of households live in self owned single family houses we assume no significant change in the water demand of rental single family houses over the years accordingly the one year energy saving was quantified for using rwh and gwr of each single family household respectively a summary of the required input data and collection methods for completing the calculations in this section is available in section s2 of si to benefit studying the promotion of decentralized water technologies in other cities 2 3 multi objective spatial optimization model 2 3 1 spatial optimization model we developed a multi objective spatial optimization model for the city wide implementation of building based decentralized water technologies two objectives were evaluated 1 maximizing the energy saving of using water and 2 minimizing the financial investment of building based decentralized water technologies eq 3 the decision variables to optimize are the building location and the technology for implementing building based decentralized water technologies although water can be saved by decentralized water technologies water age in the distribution network will increase and water quality may degrade as water demand decreases robert et al 2020 which may in turn demand a higher treatment level at the centralized plant and increase its associated cost and energy consumption this can raise a significant health concern around water quality of potable use liu et al 2020 the reduction in wastewater from buildings can slow down wastewater flow and result in more sediment deposition in the sewer network and a higher cost for cleaning the sewer network penn et al 2013 sitzenfrei and rauch 2014 to avoid these negative impacts we included constraints of 20 40 and 60 of the maximum water saving from building based decentralized water technologies at the census block level we assessed the impact of this maximum water saving constraint on the optimal solutions as single family households in the city of boston consume less than 20 of mrwa s total water supply we assumed that the water saving from building based decentralized water technologies among single family household communities does not affect the energy intensity of treating water and wastewater in the centralized systems 3 where e i t represents the energy use for water of household i with the decentralization choice t e i 0 represents the energy use for water from the centralized water system c i t is the capital cost for the decentralization choice t d w i is the annual water consumption of household i δ d w i t is the water saving of household i with the decentralization choice t w w i is the annual wastewater generation of household i δ d w i t is the reduction of wastewater generation of household i with the decentralization choice t r w is the maximum percentage of drinking water and wastewater reduction at the census block level n is the total number of single family houses in the city of boston and n j is the number of single family houses in census block j the choice t includes rwh gwr and neither and the optimization is to identify the optimal choices for all single family houses considering the trade off between water use energy saving and investment costs 2 3 2 ga hyperparameter and operator setting ga was selected to solve the multi objective spatial optimization problem to understand the trade offs between energy savings and financial costs of investing in building based decentralized among single family houses in the city of boston the steps of ga include the initialization of individual solutions evaluation of individual solutions solution ranking and selection and generation of new solutions the individual solution is about the choices of building based decentralized water technologies i e rwh gwr or neither of about 40 000 single family houses in the city of boston key hyperparameters of ga include the number of generations i e the number of iterations of evaluating ranking generating solutions before the ga stops the number of individual solutions i e these individual solutions formulate a population mutation rate and crossover rate hassanat et al 2019 timofeev et al 2019 table 1 lists the setting of our hyperparameters we set a maximum number of 200 generations to stop the ga and a population size of 200 i e 200 individual solutions mutation means a small random tweak of individual solutions and mutation rate is 0 05 which means 5 of individual solutions are mutated to generate new solutions crossover means a generation of new solution from parts of parent solutions and crossover rate is 0 95 the choices of mutation and crossover operators are listed in table 1 the nsga ii selection operator was used to keep top individual solutions with high fitness values deb et al 2002 this multi objective spatial optimization problem was solved by the distributed evolutionary algorithms dea in the python 3 7 working environment 2 3 3 initialization of individual solutions we tested several settings of initial individual solutions and evaluated the impact of individual solution initialization on the pareto front the setting considers the variances in the percentage of houses using decentralized water technologies and the percentages of rwh and gwr in the baseline scenario the percentage of houses using decentralized water technologies was fixed at 50 among these 50 half of the selected houses use rwh while the other half use gwr houses were randomly selected based on these percentages to formulate initial individual solutions in the first test the percentage of houses using decentralized water technologies is a random number from 0 to 1 while the share of rwh and gwr used by selected houses remains equal in the second test the percentage of houses using decentralized water technologies is fixed at 50 while the share of rwh and gwr used by the selected houses is random to formulate initial individual solutions we also evaluated the percentage of houses using decentralized water technologies at 30 and 70 in the second test in the last test both the percentage of houses using decentralized water technologies and the share of rwh and gwr used by the selected houses are random to formulate the initial individual solutions table 2 shows the settings of individual solution initialization the evaluation of individual solution initialization was developed considering the constrain of maximum water and wastewater saving at 40 2 4 interpretation of optimal spatial plans 2 4 1 cluster census blocks based on the change in percentage of houses selected as the investment increases the pareto front from the ga shows a trade off between energy saving and the financial investment of building based decentralized water technologies meanwhile the optimal solutions listed in the pareto front also spatial explicitly reveal the dynamic of the selection of houses as the investment increases to reveal this dynamic we first calculated the percentage of houses selected by census blocks for each optimal solution listed in the pareto front each census block has trajectories of the change in the percentage of houses selected to install rwh and gwr as the investment increases respectively then we applied k means clustering to identify the clusters with differential trajectories we set the silhouette score to decide the optimal number of clusters section s4 of si the tslearn python package was used to complete the cluster analysis 2 4 2 modeling of cluster membership the clusters reveal differential trajectories of the change in the percentage of houses selected to install rwh and gwr as the financial investment increases to better understand the spatial distribution of these clusters we modeled the cluster membership of each census block with its average features including the size of yard roof area household size household income and the pumping distance from the covered storage tank of the centralized water supply system to the census block the selection of input features can be found in section s5 of si we developed the cluster membership model using random forest rf and quantified the impact of the listed census block average features on the cluster membership using the shapley value the shapley value of one feature is the weighted average of the difference between the estimation of the probability of belonging to a certain cluster with and without the input feature of interest for all possible combinations of the rest input features a positive shapley value means that the increase of the input feature value contributes to a higher probability of belonging to the cluster of interest key variables for completing sections 2 3 and 2 4 are summarized in table 3 3 results 3 1 the impact of individual solution initialization on the pareto front fig 3 summarizes the impact of individual solution initialization on the pareto front when both the percentage of houses selected and the ratio of rwh and gwr used by selected houses are fixed the optimal solutions in the pareto front are relatively concentrated by randomizing the percentage of houses selected to initialize individual solutions the pareto front was improved to cover more optimal solutions fig 3a when we fix 50 of houses selected to deploy rwh or gwr in the initial solution setting the percentage of houses selected in the new solution through the crossover of the initial two solutions follows a hypergeometric distribution with a mean of 50 more solutions with a percentage other than 50 can be generated in the procedure of mutation but only 5 of solutions are muted as a result the solutions with a percentage other than 50 are much less likely to be included as candidates for searching optimal solutions the explanation was validated by comparing pareto fronts through fixing the percentage of houses selected while randomizing the ratio of rwh and gwr used by selected houses fig 3b the range of optimal solutions is more limited when we set up a higher fixed percentage of houses selected to develop initial solutions the new solutions in the procedure of crossover can violate the constraints of the optimization model more often and further limit the search of new more optimal solutions by further randomizing the ratio of rwh versus gwr used by selected houses a more dominating pareto front was identified fig 3a this improvement is because we have a high use of gwr when we set the 1 1 ratio of using rwh or gwr among the selected houses in the solution gwr is more expensive than rwh and therefore when we randomize the ratio of using rwh or gwr among the selected houses in the solution the optimal solutions are much less costly to achieve the same level of energy saving the comparison of pareto fronts between baseline fix level ratio in fig 3a and fixlevel randratio 50 in fig 3b can also validate the explanation of the improvement by testing the impact of individual solution initialization on the pareto front we conclude that randomizing the percentage of houses selected and the ratio of rwh and gwr used by selected houses can help develop a pareto front close to the true optimal solutions 3 2 spatial optimization of planning the building based decentralized water technologies 3 2 1 the impact of maximum water saving constraint the maximum water saving constraint is evaluated regarding its impact on the pareto front fig 4 when the percentage of water saved is allowed to increase from 20 to 40 by investing in building based decentralized water technologies the selection of houses can be improved to save more energy given the same amount of financial investment furthermore more optimal solutions can be identified with higher energy savings and lower financial investments by allowing more water saving from investing in building based decentralized water technologies however the improvement of the pareto front is less significant when the percentage of water saved is allowed to increase from 40 to 60 as the relaxation of the maximum water saving enables the selection of more cost effective houses the average non potable water use is about 47 of total water which should open more applications of gwr but the energy intensity of gwr recycling water is higher than that of the centralized water system the improvement of the pareto front depends on the availability of houses that can save energy when using gwr in our study the limited availability of these houses suitable for using gwr can explain the less significant improvement of the pareto front when the percentage of water saved is allowed to increase from 40 to 60 3 2 2 the ratio of rwh and gwr in the optimal spatial plan in the city of boston the optimized spatial plan reveals that rwh has a higher potential than gwr fig 5 rwh is firstly selected when the investment is low and 70 of single family houses can be selected to install rwh at the cost of 13 million usd gwr is selected when the financial investment is higher than 7 5 million usd gwr can save more water at the cost of higher energy intensity and higher financial investment accordingly the marginal energy saving decreases as the financial investment increases only less than 5 of single family houses are selected to use gwr our spatial analysis of the percentage of single family houses selected to implement rwh shows an emergence of priority census blocks for promotion fig 6 a about 44 of the census blocks start to implement rwh at the investment of 0 3 million usd fig 6b as the investment goes up priority census blocks with a high percentage of implementing rwh emerge in southwest and southeast communities and expand across the southern region fig 6a when the investment reaches 6 million usd more than 30 of census blocks have an implementation ratio of rwh exceeding 75 fig 6b the north and central census blocks begin to implement rwh when the investment continues to increase our spatial analysis of the percentage of single family houses selected to implement gwr does not show a clear distinction of priority census blocks for promotion fig 6a only about 5 of census blocks are found to have a low percentage of single family houses selected to implement gwr when the financial investment is lower than 6 million usd fig 6b as the investment increases a cluster of census blocks emerge from the southeast to implement gwr and then the implementation of gwr can be found in most census blocks across the city fig 6a we calculated the potable water saving of four selected pareto fronts with the investment of 0 3 2 6 6 0 and 13 3 million usd the promotion of building based rwh and gwr can save about 18 of annual potable water for single family houses in the city of boston at the investment of 13 3 million usd assuming a lifespan of 5 years for both rwh and gwr the potable water saved per usd invested declines from 148 5 gallons usd to 50 0 gallons usd as the financial investment increases from 0 3 to 13 3 million usd the high capital cost of gwr explains the decline of the marginal potable water saved per usd invested currently the city charges more than 20usd 1000 gallons to maintain and upgrade water and wastewater services bwsc 2021 in other words 1 usd spent can provide no more than 50 gallons of water it is more economically effective to invest in rwh and gwr to save potable water than to fund the centralized system such effectiveness can be higher when the lifespan of both rwh and gwr can be longer 3 2 3 the clustering of census blocks two clusters are identified based on the silhouette score namely more demanding and less demanding clusters to distinguish the census blocks that show differential change in the percentage of houses selected as the investment increases fig 7 the more demanding cluster shows the continuous and rapid increase in the percentage of houses selected to use rwh as the investment increases the average percentage of houses selected to use rwh is close to 100 under a high investment in contrast the less demanding cluster is not considered as the priority to invest in rwh when the investment ranges between 2 6 and 6 0 million usd there is a slightly more rapid increase when the investment goes higher than 6 0 million usd and the percentage of houses selected to use rwh increases from 10 to around 40 as the investment further increases the percentage of houses selected to use rwh in the less demanding cluster approaches 50 overall the second cluster has a lower priority to invest in rwh meanwhile gwr was not selected by the more demanding cluster even under a high investment instead gwr was selected in the less demanding cluster which indicates some houses in this cluster are more cost effective to use gwr through the cluster analysis 256 census blocks are considered as the less demanding cluster and the other 191 census blocks are considered as the more demanding cluster 3 2 4 the cluster membership modeling we applied the under sampling method to create a sample dataset of both less demanding and more demanding census blocks the dataset was further split into 70 for training and 30 for testing the accuracy of the rf model is 74 and we conclude that it is acceptable to interpret the impact of selected urban built and socio economic environment on the priority of locations to use building based decentralized water technologies spatial mapping of the two clusters reveals the locations of the two clusters across the city of boston fig 8 a the two clusters are relatively separated from each other rather than scattered across each other the more demanding cluster is in the southern part of the city while the less demanding cluster is in the northern part of the city without considering matters of equity we conclude that if the city plans to promote rwh with a limited financial budget it should focus on the more demanding cluster the city can decide whether more financial budgets should be allocated to expand to the less demanding cluster the spatial separation of clusters allows the city to actively promote the use of building based rwh in the census block belonging to the more demanding cluster and maximize energy saving we consider the emergence of the spatial separation of the two clusters as a result influenced by urban built and socio economic environment fig 8b based on the shapley value of the size of yard single family houses with larger yards are more likely to belong to the more demanding cluster the larger yards mean a higher demand of non potable water for irrigation a longer pumping distance from the covered storage tank of the centralized water system to the census block also contributes to a higher probability of belonging to the more demanding cluster a larger roof area also contributes to a higher probability of belonging to the more demanding cluster indicating more rainwater can be harvested for non potable water both larger household size and higher household income contribute to a higher estimated probability of being the more demanding cluster as both indicate higher water consumption and non potable water use we conclude that the more demanding cluster has features including higher demand for non potable water use measured by the size of the yard household size and household income and a long distance away from the centralized water system measured by the pumping distance larger roof areas of the more demanding cluster can explain the use of rwh as the optimal choice of building based decentralized water technologies the emergence of more demanding raises a concern that wealthier communities should be prioritized to study incentives for promoting rwh based on the objectives of maximizing the energy saving of using water and minimizing investment costs a previous study shows that the low property value communities in boston have a higher demand for decentralized water technologies lu et al 2019 the objectives of maximizing energy saving and minimizing investment costs do not help low income communities improve their water and sanitation services first therefore adding more objectives to improve social equality in access to water and sanitation services should be included as well to help the city promote decentralized water technologies 4 discussion in this study two clusters were identified that reveal differential needs of building based decentralized water technologies and rwh is a more applicable decentralized solution than gwr among single family house communities in the city of boston our result can be explained by the urban built and socio economic environment other cities have their unique urban built and socio economic environment and this can lead to different results regarding the number of clusters and more applicable solutions by including more objectives such as maximizing equitable access to water and sanitation services our spatial optimization and interpretation framework can be valuable to provide a comprehensive understanding of where and when the decentralized water technologies should be promoted this understanding will allow the city to follow up on other non technical e g willingness to accept or pay and technical issues e g water quality facility maintenance in the prioritized communities and explore location specific policy incentives to increase the adoption and accelerate the implementation our study can be improved from at least three aspects to provide a more robust and comprehensive planning support for promoting decentralized water technologies first we only tested rwh and gwr as the decentralized water technologies rwh and gwr can be integrated as a system to provide more non potable water and secure more stable supply however the benefit of integrated rwh and gwr is limited because of the high cost and electricity intensity of gwr as well as the maximum water saving constraint for ensuring the operation of the centralized water system wastewater reuse can be another decentralized alternative that treats the wastewater for non potable use decentralized water reuse has the same problem of high electricity intensity as gwr although decentralized water technologies can reduce water consumption these technologies do not address the energy related impact of treating and supplying water the solution to reducing the energy related impact of decentralized water technologies is needed to improve urban water sustainability second future studies should also consider the scale of decentralized water technologies besides locations and technologies we only considered building based decentralized water technologies having each building install its decentralized water system may not be optimal than having a community based decentralized water facility serving these buildings to quantify the benefits of decentralized water technologies the variability in building water demand and rainfall resources should be included to reflect the relocation of households and climate change in the long run third the impact of promoting decentralized water technologies on the energy intensity of the centralized water system especially the wastewater treatment is assumed to be negligible in this study since we only focused on single family houses we did not include the impact of reduced rainfall on the operation of the wastewater treatment plants in evaluating the benefit of city wide use of rwh when expanding the promotion of decentralized water technologies to other building types more water saving from greywater recycling reduces the inflow of wastewater to the centralized system which may increase the energy intensity of treating wastewater meanwhile more water saving can increase the organic content of influent wastewater and improve the energy recovery from anaerobic digestion but the increased organic loading in the influent can increase the electricity consumption in the activated sludge system the impact of city wide planning of decentralized water technologies on the energy consumption of the centralized system should be investigated in future studies khalkhali et al 2021 by adding these dynamics in evaluating the objectives the complexity of solving the optimization will increase and it is useful to test other algorithms such as multi objective particle swarm optimization and multi objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition these tests will help identify the most efficient algorithms to solve the spatial optimization of decentralized water technologies and verify the consistency of pareto fronts with the above improvements our analysis can produce a more robust and comprehensive plan for promoting decentralized water technologies 5 conclusion investments in city wide decentralized water technologies should be made to benefit existing central urban water systems this study presents an integrated spatial optimization and interpretation framework that can help cities prioritize the promotion of decentralized water technologies the optimal solutions for single family houses in the city of boston suggest that rwh is more applicable than gwr to minimize investment costs and maximize water use energy savings this finding can be useful for the city to further investigate possible incentives focusing on rwh the data driven interpretation of optimal solutions separates the census blocks into the more demanding and less demanding clusters for the building based rwh and gwr this finding offers insights to customize incentives for the more demanding cluster to improve the welfare of individual buildings as well as to maximize the benefits of the urban water system the characteristics of the more demanding cluster were identified to recognize the critical features of the single family houses selected to implement rwh or gwr in the optimization this improved the understanding of the rationale behind optimal choices associated with given objectives our framework can also be applied to other cities for the planning and promotion of decentralized water technologies different cities have their unique urban socioeconomic characteristics and built environment the objectives can be more inclusive beyond water use energy savings and investments such as to improve water and sanitation services in low income communities the findings in other cities using our framework with more inclusive objectives can be different but will be significant to enrich the understanding of city wide promotion of decentralized water technologies to improve the applicability of our method future research could also include more types of decentralized water technologies an optimization of the scale of decentralized water

15653,human and animal source separated urine stored and allowed to naturally hydrolyse the bio catalysed transformation of urea to ammonia and bicarbonate has been used for millennia as a fertiliser in agriculture in a context of growing water scarcity and climate uncertainty source separation of urine is facing a strong revival thanks to the emergence of cost effective waterless collection systems concomitantly urine source separation can be used as a method for nutrient recovery and subsequent reuse in its simplest form such recovery consists of collection followed by urea hydrolysis and storage as sole treatment numerous guidelines including by the world health organisation consider that this is sufficient to stabilise the nutrients and inactivate any potential pathogens in the urine however it is still unclear whether said urine is effectively free from other compounds of concern such as anthropogenic micropollutants with known toxicological effects moreover it is also currently unknown if the metabolites produced by human consumption of these products behave in similar way during short and long term storage i e whether any changes in chemical structure mean that these could be sorbed and or precipitated in a different way or if they can potentially be degraded by the biomass inherently present in urine collection systems finally there is currently no knowledge of whether the observed concentrations of micropollutants in stored hydrolysed urine could potentially have toxicological effects if when applied to soils and edible crops to fill these research gaps 20 commonly consumed compounds were selected in this study and their concentrations in the liquid and solid phases studied in the short and long term up to 2 years during the initial process of urea hydrolysis 5 days ethyl glucuronide was the sole compound effectively removed by deconjugation while only two other compounds erythromycin and its metabolite saw a reduction in their concentration likely due to biomass sorption subsequently during early storage 15 days only three additional compounds were removed paracetamol 99 acesulfame 11 5 and carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide 40 7 finally long term storage of up to 24 months did not result in any further significant removal for any of the measured compounds indicating that the procedure of hydrolysis storage is not effective for the removal of anthropogenic micropollutants the results of this investigation raise strong concerns about the direct reuse of hydrolysed stored human source separated urine and evidence the need for post processing before implementation as fertiliser into edible crops due to the inherent toxicological risk particularly to infants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords source

2021 however around 60 30 of the pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers consumed by humans are also excreted via urine with approximately half of them present as unchanged parent compounds and the rest as human metabolites lienert et al 2007a which end up in wastewater kümmerer 2013 some human metabolites such as conjugates of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole the anti convulsant carbamazepine

properties may have detrimental effects on the environment wildlife and human health janssens et al 1997 joss et al 2006 metabolism by the human body usually makes pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers more hydrophilic hence less likely to accumulate via the food chain lienert et al 2007b however some pharmaceuticals such as the anti convulsant carbamazepine and the anti depressant fluoxetine are known to form metabolites with an increased toxicity potential compared to their parent compounds besse et al 2008 lienert et al 2007b current research in the fields of wastewater treatment and pharmaceutical removal focuses mostly on the removal of parent compounds while excreted metabolites are often overlooked even though they remain structurally similar to the parent

biosolids animal manure and struvite from waste streams are already used as soil amendments in agriculture in many parts of the world as these substrates originate from human and or animal waste they can contain pathogens heavy metals and human or veterinary pharmaceuticals ho et al 2013 jensen et al 2012 motoyama et al 2011 not only have pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine been shown to be taken up by plants winker 2010 2009 but the effect of the consumption of these plants on human health has been understudied lemonde fewless 2015 winker 2010 and there is a growing concern regarding

other lifestyle biomarkers ang and sparkes 2000 pritchard et al 2010 queensland government 2011 however no limits are currently defined on the basis that it is unlikely they would be harmful yet no extensive research has been conducted to date to demonstrate whether this is truly the case to understand the whole picture it is critical to determine which compounds are present in human urine and whether the use of the latter as soil amendment is safe for the environment and for human health currently the minimum treatment for the reuse of source separated human urine recommended by the world health organization who is storage of urine for 6 months at 20 c who 2006 which has proven sufficient to inactivate several key human pathogens chandran et al 2009 lahr et al 2016 fresh urine is collected through urine diverting technologies pipes and storage tanks where it is colonised by ubiquitous micro organisms these organisms naturally produce the enzyme urease which catalyses the ureolysis of urea to ammonium and carbonates mobley and hausinger 1989 this naturally occurring phenomenon transforms urea to free ammonia and elevates the ph of urine to 9 which leads to

did not achieve a removal of more than 10 for the mentioned pharmaceuticals and it was unclear whether the observed removal was due to chemical or biological pathways schürmann et al 2012 it is also worth noting that in the presence of microbial communities the removal of parent compounds as well as human metabolites may occur via various physico chemical processes such as adsorption onto the surface of the biomass or absorption into the biomass jelic et al 2015 verlicchi et al 2012 in these cases these compounds would be effectively removed from the liquid phase however the possibility remains that adsorbed compounds could naturally desorb over time and be found back in the liquid phase torresi et al 2017 removal can also occur via bio transformations which add or remove functional groups to from the molecule leading to transformation products which may be more or less harmful than the parent compound jaatinen et al 2016 at this point even though the parent compound is not detected its transformation products may still be present and bioactive in the liquid phase these transformations are complex and the elucidation of their structure and metabolic pathways is beyond scope of this study the goal of the present study was to determine through two short term and one long term experiments whether the hydrolysis and storage of urine contributes to the removal of pharmaceutical and lifestyle biomarker parent compounds and their human metabolites the first short term experiment tested the impact of the process of urea hydrolysis on pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers removal in both liquid and solid fractions i e the precipitates that form after hydrolysis the second short term experiment tested the exposure of said compounds to readily hydrolysed urine in the long term experiment the pharmaceutical and lifestyle biomarker concentrations in three different hydrolysed urine volumes were measured to determine whether extended storage times 24 months i e larger than the 6 months recommended by the who for pathogens inactivation who 2006 could result in their complete removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers 2 1 1 active ingredients twelve active ingredients were selected from two different categories lifestyle biomarkers and pharmaceuticals table 1 amongst the lifestyle biomarkers two artificial sweeteners acesulfame k cyclamate one stimulant caffeine and an ethanol metabolite resulting from alcohol consumption ethyl glucuronide were chosen the selected pharmaceuticals consisted of an anti convulsant carbamazepine two analgesics diclofenac and paracetamol an anti depressant fluoxetine three antibiotics sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and erythromycin and an x ray contrast medium iopromide these twelve micropollutants vary in terms of pharmacological activities and were selected according to whether they were previously studied in literature and if they are known to be widespread and or persistent in urine see further details in table s3 2 1 2 determination of dosing concentrations the objective of the method described below was to replicate human urine containing pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers in concentrations representative of the australian population on average data on pharmaceuticals concentrations in wastewater is widely available choi et al 2019 jelic et al 2011 ortiz de garcía et al 2013 verlicchi et al 2012 however little to no data is available for human urine winker et al 2008 and literature describing results from experiments using spiked doses typically overestimate the feed concentrations to accommodate for the detection limits of the instrumentation jaatinen et al 2016 pronk et al 2006a therefore realistic pharmaceutical concentrations were approximated through a number of steps as described in fig 1 in order to spike doses of pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers relevant to a real life scenario see further details in section 2 2 in supplementary information the concentrations in urine ci mg l 1 were determined using two different equations from literature see eqs s1 and s2 in the supplementary information based on data about pharmaceutical consumption table s5 these values were then compared with data based on the modelling of the chemical mass load vs population size in australia from o brien et al 2014 eq s3 values resulting from eqs s1 and s2 were subsequently averaged and rounded up to the next whole number section 2 2 2 in supplementary information the order of magnitude of the resulting concentrations of active ingredients cai was compared with values from literature table s8 after selecting these twelve active ingredients and calculating their concentrations in urine the excreted fractions of parent compounds and their human metabolites in urine were gathered from pharmacological literature table s9 only the most abundant metabolite of each parent compound was studied with the following exceptions 10 11 dihydroxycarbamazepine is the carbamazepine metabolite present in largest quantities 20 but is not pharmaceutically active winker et al 2008 whereas the metabolite carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide is active besse et al 2008 paracetamol acetaminophen metabolites were not included as analytical methods to detect these compounds were not readily available 3 desmethyl trimethoprim and 4 desmethyl trimethoprim are respectively excreted at 7 and 6 sigel 1983 for simplification only 3 desmethyl trimethoprim was selected and the excretion fractions summed as a final control the doses of the parent compounds dpc and their human metabolites dm were compared to a set of measurements from real urine table s10 concentrations were adjusted to the higher concentration in order to represent a worst case scenario the selected target concentrations based on the procedure above can be found in table 1 2 1 3 standards preparation and pharmaceutical analyses a mixed working standard solution containing all target analytes was prepared in lc ms grade methanol and used for spiking of micropollutants into the tested source separated urine for the short term experiments and for use as mixed calibration standard for analysis the mixed standards solution was prepared in a volumetric flask by directly adding weighed dry chemical for compounds with final concentration 2 mg l 1 table 1 and by dosing the corresponding volume of individually prepared stock solutions in meoh for compounds with final concentrations 2 mg l 1 the stock solution used for spiking of urine at 1 50 ratio was stored at 20 c and used within two weeks the characteristics of the analytes and concentrations of individual standards can be found in tables s12 and s13 the chemical analyses are described in section 2 4 in the supplementary information when both parent compound and human metabolite of an active ingredient were present in solution their fate was studied jointly in order to account for conjugation deconjugation phenomena 2 2 urine hydrolysis short term experiments the fate of the selected compounds during and after urine hydrolysis was investigated in batch tests conducted in 20 ml triplicate serum bottles fig 2 fresh urine was collected from 20 anonymous volunteers within 6 h of donation and used as the medium for two short term tests that were conducted in parallel in the first experiment hydrolysis the micropollutants were added at the start to study the impact of the process of urea hydrolysis on micropollutant removal where compounds could precipitate adsorb onto the formed precipitates biomass or undergo some transformations through physico chemical and or microbially induced pathways at the same time as the urea was being hydrolysed in the second experiment exposure to hydrolysed urine micropollutants were added after completion of urea hydrolysis with the aim of determining whether any chemical removal could happen in a solution which was supposedly not undergoing further physical or chemical transformations a bacteria free control experiment was set up for this experiment using a high nh3 and high ph solution see si section 3 3 1 for full composition in order to determine whether the biomass had an effect on the removal of pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers a mother solution was prepared for use in all these batch tests by inoculating 500 ml of the collected fresh urine with 5 ml of hydrolysed urine the hydrolysed urine was collected from a storage tank hydraulic retention time of 1 2 weeks linked to waterless urinals at a dedicated pilot plant installation ledezma et al 2019 the composition of all media can be found in table s16 at the start of the first short term experiment hydrolysis triplicate serum bottles were filled with 20 ml of the inoculated fresh urine and spiked with 0 4 ml of the stock solution to match the target concentrations of the selected chemicals for initial concentrations in the serum bottles refer to table s13 in supplementary information in parallel the same process was performed with the high nh3 control solution all urine serum bottles including the residual mother solution were tested for ph and electrical conductivity at least every 2 days in order to monitor the progress of hydrolysis fig s1 after 15 days the ph and electrical conductivity stabilised indicating that urine hydrolysis was completed which concluded the first part of this experiment for the second short term experiment exposure to hydrolysed urine a new set of triplicate serum bottles was filled with 20 ml of the now hydrolysed urine mother solution and spiked with 0 4 ml of the same chemical stock solution the ph and ec were measured every 5 days to ensure the hydrolysed urine was not undergoing any more physical and chemical transformations 50 μl per sample were taken with a syringe without opening the flasks to avoid volatilisation and measured for ph ec with laquatwin micro probes horiba japan see fig s1 samples for chemical analysis were collected from the serum bottles at the beginning and the end of each experiment and measured as described in section 2 4 supplementary information samples from the control bottles were also taken mid way through the 30 day experiment all bottles were kept in the dark to avoid potential chemical degradation by photolysis andreozzi et al 2003 lastly the serum bottles of both real urine experiments contained precipitates which were filtered through a 0 7 µm glass microfibre filter lbs0gff 047 labserv australia on a vacuum filtering device the precipitates were allowed to dry in a desiccator then dissolved in 7 ml of 1 m hcl the ph of the acid solution was then adjusted to a neutral ph with 6 7 ml of 1 m naoh 2 3 long term storage of urine the hydrolysed urine mother solution sample a and the hydrolysed urine used for the inoculation sample b were stored at room temperature 23 c for almost one year 49 50 weeks an additional unspiked batch of hydrolysed urine from the storage tank of the two waterless urinals sample c was also stored at room temperature 0 50 c depending on the season for more than two years all urines were stored in clear borosilicate bottles hence potential photodegradation was not prevented andreozzi et al 2003 duplicate samples were taken from each bottle and analysed for the investigated target compounds with the exception of diclofenac and norfluoxetine for which standards were unavailable at the time of analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers removal during and after urea hydrolysis 3 1 1 control solution in the high ammonia control changes in concentration following 15 or 30 days of storage were negligible for most studied analytes except for one parent compound erythromycin and two human metabolites 4 hydroxy diclofenac and n desmethyl erythromycin fig 3 exposure to the ammonia solution for 15 and 30 days led to removal of 63 0 8 3 of the total erythromycin of which 17 6 3 4 was as the parent compound and 45 4 6 5 was the metabolite n 6 98 2 0 1 of the metabolite 4 hydroxy diclofenac was removed following 30 days exposure to the ammonia solution corresponding to 96 2 0 1 of the total diclofenac as the concentration of the parent compound did not increase the metabolite likely underwent a different transformation than deconjugation back to diclofenac however the elucidation of transformation products and the mechanisms through which these can be formed were beyond the scope of this study 3 1 2 source separated urine citalopram and its human metabolite desmethyl citalopram were detected in the real urine medium hence their fate was investigated thirteen out of the nineteen compounds 8 parent compounds cyclamate caffeine carbamazepine diclofenac sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim iopromide and citalopram 5 human metabolites paraxanthine 4 hydroxy diclofenac n4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole 3 desmethyl trimethoprim and desmethyl citalopram were neither removed during the hydrolysis of urine nor when exposed to hydrolysed urine for 15 days fig 4 and further details in table s19 in supplementary information amongst them cyclamate and caffeine tend to be removed during wastewater treatment at up to 70 gómez et al 2007 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 kokotou and thomaidis 2013 rosal et al 2010 during wastewater treatment carbamazepine and diclofenac usually experience a negative removal indicating deconjugation mechanisms or are removed up to 20 gómez et al 2007 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 rosal et al 2010 as the investigated compounds all have different physico chemical properties no common factor could explain why the concentrations of these specific compounds were not affected by the hydrolysis of urine only three compounds were affected by both the hydrolysis of real urine and 15 days of exposure to hydrolysed urine ethyl glucuronide erythromycin and its metabolite n desmethyl erythromycin fig 4 ethyl glucuronide was the only compound which was completely removed from the liquid phase at the end of both experiments 100 0 0 0 and 99 9 0 1 possibly ethyl glucuronide was deconjugated as has been previously observed to occur for other glucuronidated metabolites in manure halling sorensen et al 1998 and during conventional wastewater treatment e g estrogens andersen et al 2003 d ascenzo et al 2003 and carbamazepine verlicchi et al 2012 however this is only hypothetical as neither ethanol nor glucuronic acid were measured similarly the concentrations of the active ingredient of erythromycin were 77 6 7 9 and 57 7 7 3 lower at the end of the hydrolysis and exposure experiments respectively the parent compound erythromycin was almost completely removed during hydrolysis 96 8 1 2 erythromycin and its human metabolite n desmethyl erythromycin are large lipophilic compounds which were predominantly in cationic form between ph 7 5 and 9 table s12 hence they could have been absorbed into biomass this would require further confirmation four additional compounds were affected by the exposure to hydrolysed urine paracetamol carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide acesulfame k and fluoxetine urine hydrolysis did not significantly affect the paracetamol concentration but it was removed at 99 0 0 3 after 15 days of exposure since the analyte s concentration decreased drastically in real urine but not in the high ph and high nh3 solution where the ph and ammonia concentration were similar it is likely that the biomass contributed to paracetamol removal as paracetamol is hydrophilic low logd of 0 97 and uncharged at ph 9 it is more likely that paracetamol was removed by bio transformation rather than sorption in onto the biomass jelic et al 2015 verlicchi et al 2012 in turn 13 5 0 5 of the total carbamazepine was removed during exposure to hydrolysed urine fig 4 with 40 7 1 8 of the human metabolite carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide removed from the liquid phase 14 4 0 6 of total carbamazepine moreover acesulfame k was 11 5 1 5 lower after 15 days of exposure to hydrolysed urine a similar range as above moreover the metabolite norfluoxetine was not detected in the samples likely due to an analytical error the fluoxetine active ingredient concentration was calculated by adding the theoretical spiked amount of metabolite to the molar concentration of the measured parent compound the parent compound was removed at 24 6 0 9 which accounted for 1 8 0 1 of the total fluoxetine it is difficult to draw definite conclusions on its fate without the entire set of norfluoxetine measurements but since both the fluoxetine parent compound and human metabolite are lipophilic and in cationic form at ph 9 one of the removal mechanisms could have been sorption in onto the biomass absorption into the biomass or adsorption onto the negatively charged cell surfaces respectively hörsing et al 2011 li and zhang 2010 finally it is worth considering that since these results are different to the control results a biological degradation transformation pathway s cannot be excluded as a cause for these observations however and as previously mentioned the elucidation of any such mechanisms is beyond the scope of the study 3 2 presence of pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers in hydrolysed urine precipitates out of the 20 parent compounds and human metabolites investigated only two were undetected in the urine precipitates ethyl glucuronide and diclofenac table 2 three pharmaceutical compounds were detected only in one out of the six real urine precipitate samples paracetamol 36 0 mg kgdw n desmethyl erythromycin 18 2 µg kgdw n acetyl sulfamethoxazole 210 7 mg kgdw which might have been an anomaly therefore if one were to consider using only the precipitated solids as a purified fertiliser these salts would still have to undergo further treatment such as washing with a saturated struvite solution ronteltap et al 2007 schürmann et al 2012 which might not be feasible at a commercial scale when comparing these precipitate values to available literature for other waste derived fertilisers such as sewage sludge and animal manure table 2 carbamazepine and fluoxetine concentrations were in the same order of magnitude in both urine precipitates and sewage sludge diclofenac and paracetamol were present in sewage sludge but not detected in urine precipitates jensen et al 2012 however the antibiotic concentrations were much higher in urine precipitates followed by manure then sewage sludge ho et al 2013 motoyama et al 2011 therefore the use of urine precipitates formed during urea hydrolysis as fertiliser for crops would potentially not be less harmful than using sewage sludge or manure 3 3 long term storage of source separated human urine out of the 19 analysed compounds only fluoxetine was below detection limit in the three urine samples that were stored under long term uncontrolled storage conditions fig 5 table s21 in the short term experiments fluoxetine removal was minimal 24 6 0 9 after 15 days of exposure to hydrolysed urine hence it is more likely that fluoxetine was not excreted by urine donors rather than a complete removal occurring ethyl glucuronide and iopromide were not found in two of the samples a and b but were present in sample c with concentrations of 12 5 0 9 and 85 4 7 5 µg l 1 respectively carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide and 4 hydroxy diclofenac were found in two of the three samples and were below the limit of detection in the third one this was also the case for the artificial sweetener cyclamate which had a concentration of 73 0 0 6 mg l 1 in sample c the remaining thirteen analysed compounds were present in all three samples of long term stored hydrolysed urine with concentrations as high as 9 4 mg l 1 acesulfame k in sample c as the initial concentration in the samples was not measured it was not possible to conduct mass balances and therefore determine the removal if any that occurred during the long term storage of these samples however these measurements are in accordance with the results from the short term experiments as has been shown for ethyl glucuronide and paracetamol considering the large number of compounds present in the urine it is clear that source separated hydrolysed urine is unlikely to be pharmaceutical free even after years of storage and further treatment would be needed before it can be used as a fertiliser if one wishes to avoid the uncontrolled spread of pharmaceuticals and other active compounds onto the environment and population 3 4 potential impacts of using hydrolysed stored urine as fertiliser the use of source separated hydrolysed urine as is for crops fertilisation necessitates more research in order to determine the soil water dynamics of the different compounds their potential plant uptake and subsequent transfer to the human body the ecotoxicity of selected compounds has been previously studied in conjunction with their sorption and removal in soil however there is only limited published literature to date table s2 research has shown that more lipophilic compounds i e those with an octanol water partition coefficient logkow 3 such as carbamazepine diclofenac or fluoxetine exhibit higher sorption into the soil than more hydrophilic compounds e g paracetamol based on their partitioning coefficient kd jensen et al 2012 picó et al 2019 winker 2009 amongst the seven lipophilic compounds measured in the long term storage experiment six carbamazepine citalopram erythromycin and their metabolites with the exception of the antidepressant fluoxetine which was not detected were present in quantities ranging from 0 6 to 759 µg l 1 citalopram in solution a after 12 months of storage slow degradation of these compounds in soil e g up to 553 days to remove 50 of the initially measured carbamazepine suggests they may accumulate in the soil and plants with every new application of fertiliser containing pharmaceutical residues jensen et al 2012 a low predicted no effect concentration pnec concentration which marks the limit below which no adverse effect in an ecosystem is measured in soil such as 0 41 µg kg 1 for diclofenac suggests higher risk to this particular environment than higher pnec as is the case for fluoxetine 13 µg kg 1 khan and nicell 2010 in comparison soil vertebrates may tolerate 100 µg l 1 diclofenac and only 0 6 µg l 1 fluoxetine according to their pnec khan and nicell 2010 fluoxetine especially has the greatest acute toxicity amongst human pharmaceuticals ec50 unspecified green algae 0 031 mg l 1 puckowski et al 2016 although only limited information is available these studies underline that while partitioning behaviour of these compounds may be derived from their physico chemical properties it does not directly relate to their potential effects on living organisms jensen et al 2012 khan and nicell 2010 winker 2009 numerous studies to date have stated that the potential for drug uptake into vegetables grown in greenhouses is significant although sabourin et al 2012 have argued that this is very low for vegetables grown under normal farming conditions with a one year offset between fertiliser application and harvest more research is definitely warranted to determine what the uptake by different parts of the plant is i e root leaves fruits etc for a wider variety of plants akenga et al 2020 alemayehu et al 2020 de boer et al 2018 jensen et al 2012 and whether consumption of these plants can have harmful consequences on human health so far two studies have investigated the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers in crops irrigated with different streams rainwater and water from the llobregat river in spain margenat et al 2019 and treated wastewater malchi et al 2014 these investigations estimated that a child or an adult would have to eat between 24 and 905 kg of vegetables lettuce tomato cauliflower broad beans sweet potato and carrots in order to reach the threshold of toxicological concern ttc for carbamazepine and caffeine 1 5 μg per kg of body weight per day malchi et al 2014 margenat et al 2019 this is unlikely to occur however a child 25 kg would only need to eat 250 g of contaminated carrots or 300 g of lettuce with carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide to reach the ttc 2 5 ng per kg of body weight per day malchi et al 2014 margenat et al 2019 although more research is needed to assess the toxicological concern of a wider range of pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers originating from urine these findings alone are particularly concerning given that carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide was heavily present in the tested urine in fact and as explained in detail in the supplementary information section 3 5 it can be estimated that for the carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide levels observed in this study a child would reach the ttc when consuming 1 2 kg of contaminated carrots unlikely or 51 g of contaminated lettuce quite possible 3 5 post processing of human urine derived fertilisers using separated hydrolysed urine for fertilisation has the potential to save large amounts of freshwater while reducing agriculture s dependence of fossil fuel derived fertilisers i e haber bosch process and deviating a significant nutrient load from centralised wastewater treatment plants i e expanding capacity and or reducing the need for upgrades freguia et al 2021 therefore the practice is very promising for the water energy nutrients nexus of the future but this will require an expanded framework that also investigates the fate of micropollutants within said nexus in source separating technology e g waterless urinals no mix toilets and other similar nutrient recovery sanitation systems one first removal barrier can be the sealant fluids preventing the passing of gases produced in the collection system thapa and hanigan 2020 further membrane processes such as nanofiltration nghiem et al 2004 pronk et al 2006b siegrist and joss 2012 reverse osmosis siegrist and joss 2012 snyder et al 2007 electrochemical stripping tarpeh and nelson 2018 or electrodialysis arola et al 2019 pronk et al 2006a have been shown to separate pharmaceuticals from a nutrient rich product efficiently although evidently such separations do not lead to the degradation of these compounds another growing approach to urine separation nutrient recovery is stabilisation where targeted chemical dosing of acidic or basic compounds e g citric acid sodium bicarbonate can inhibit hydrolysis and facilitate the recovery of nitrogen in the form of urea courtney and randall 2022 although at this point the fate of pharmaceuticals during the stabilisation process remains to be investigated there are nevertheless some established treatments that have proven efficient in removing pharmaceuticals from urine such as steam stripping evaporation high dosage of uvc light or ozonation gulyas 2007 but these are very energy intensive and considered economically unfavourable for treating large volumes of urine advanced oxidation processes are considered promising technologies as they can destroy pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers from highly concentrated streams such as reverse osmosis concentrates by generating highly reactive hydroxyl radicals abdelmelek et al 2011 lütke eversloh et al 2014 however this type of electrochemical treatment applied to substrate with high chloride concentrations such as urine 1 4 1 8 g l 1 kuntke et al 2012 pronk et al 2006a udert et al 2006 can form active chlorine which might lead to undesired transformation products such as chlorate and or chlorinated disinfection by products deborde and von gunten 2008 jermakka et al 2021 lütke eversloh et al 2014 finally another alternative would be activated carbon onto which pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers can adsorb köpping et al 2020 özel duygan et al 2021 snyder et al 2007 combinations of the aforementioned treatments could maximise pharmaceutical removal and result in the production of clean fertilisers etter et al 2015 özel duygan et al 2021 4 conclusion this study investigated the fate of 20 micropollutants during the hydrolysis of urine and during its short and long term storage these processes had an effect on only seven compounds with different physico chemical properties with only the ethanol metabolite ethyl glucuronide and the analgesic paracetamol effectively removed similar to findings from literature gajurel et al 2007 jaatinen et al 2016 özel duygan et al 2021 schürmann et al 2012 carbamazepine diclofenac sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were not removed by hydrolysis and storage of urine in addition long term storage of hydrolysed urine for up to 2 years did not result in further removal of the studied compounds furthermore this study demonstrated that precipitates resulting from urea hydrolysis also contained a small fraction of all the investigated pharmaceutical compounds 7 with the exception of ethyl glucuronide and diclofenac the fate of carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide highlighted the importance of studying the human metabolites in conjunction with their corresponding parent compounds by combining the parent compound and its metabolite in a single concentration of their bioactivity it was possible to witness that a small fraction of the 40 removed from the liquid phase as the metabolite actually deconjugated back to the parent compound the results of this study are clear hydrolysed stored urine following who guidelines is not free from toxicologically active pharmaceuticals therefore the spreading of such untreated urine on edible crops currently happening at medium scale trials around the world needs some serious re consideration before the practice is implemented at the larger scales proposed by many of its advocates and

15653,human and animal source separated urine stored and allowed to naturally hydrolyse the bio catalysed transformation of urea to ammonia and bicarbonate has been used for millennia as a fertiliser in agriculture in a context of growing water scarcity and climate uncertainty source separation of urine is facing a strong revival thanks to the emergence of cost effective waterless collection systems concomitantly urine source separation can be used as a method for nutrient recovery and subsequent reuse in its simplest form such recovery consists of collection followed by urea hydrolysis and storage as sole treatment numerous guidelines including by the world health organisation consider that this is sufficient to stabilise the nutrients and inactivate any potential pathogens in the urine however it is still unclear whether said urine is effectively free from other compounds of concern such as anthropogenic micropollutants with known toxicological effects moreover it is also currently unknown if the metabolites produced by human consumption of these products behave in similar way during short and long term storage i e whether any changes in chemical structure mean that these could be sorbed and or precipitated in a different way or if they can potentially be degraded by the biomass inherently present in urine collection systems finally there is currently no knowledge of whether the observed concentrations of micropollutants in stored hydrolysed urine could potentially have toxicological effects if when applied to soils and edible crops to fill these research gaps 20 commonly consumed compounds were selected in this study and their concentrations in the liquid and solid phases studied in the short and long term up to 2 years during the initial process of urea hydrolysis 5 days ethyl glucuronide was the sole compound effectively removed by deconjugation while only two other compounds erythromycin and its metabolite saw a reduction in their concentration likely due to biomass sorption subsequently during early storage 15 days only three additional compounds were removed paracetamol 99 acesulfame 11 5 and carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide 40 7 finally long term storage of up to 24 months did not result in any further significant removal for any of the measured compounds indicating that the procedure of hydrolysis storage is not effective for the removal of anthropogenic micropollutants the results of this investigation raise strong concerns about the direct reuse of hydrolysed stored human source separated urine and evidence the need for post processing before implementation as fertiliser into edible crops due to the inherent toxicological risk particularly to infants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords source separation nutrient recovery urea hydrolysis pharmaceuticals human metabolites data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction human urine comprises up to 79 of the nitrogen n 47 of the phosphorus p and 71 of the potassium k contained in domestic wastewater while representing 1 of the total flow beal et al 2007 friedler et al 2013 source separation of urine using diverting technologies would allow for the collection and reuse of these nutrients e g as a fertiliser while significantly reducing the energy demand of centralised wastewater treatment plants freguia et al 2021 however around 60 30 of the pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers consumed by humans are also excreted via urine with approximately half of them present as unchanged parent compounds and the rest as human metabolites lienert et al 2007a which end up in wastewater kümmerer 2013 some human metabolites such as conjugates of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole the anti convulsant carbamazepine and the analgesic ibuprofen have shown to deconjugate back to the parent compound in the sewers jelic et al 2015 verlicchi et al 2012 both groups are of emerging concern as their toxic and persistent properties may have detrimental effects on the environment wildlife and human health janssens et al 1997 joss et al 2006 metabolism by the human body usually makes pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers more hydrophilic hence less likely to accumulate via the food chain lienert et al 2007b however some pharmaceuticals such as the anti convulsant carbamazepine and the anti depressant fluoxetine are known to form metabolites with an increased toxicity potential compared to their parent compounds besse et al 2008 lienert et al 2007b current research in the fields of wastewater treatment and pharmaceutical removal focuses mostly on the removal of parent compounds while excreted metabolites are often overlooked even though they remain structurally similar to the parent compound kümmerer 2013 the use of hydrolysed urine for crop fertilisation is not a new practice but it has recently regained interest in the context of nutrient circularity and several new companies with a focus on urine storage and recycling for fertilisation have emerged in recent years alemayehu et al 2020 deutsche welle 2020 hyslop 2020 lohman et al 2020 waste derived fertilisers such as biosolids animal manure and struvite from waste streams are already used as soil amendments in agriculture in many parts of the world as these substrates originate from human and or animal waste they can contain pathogens heavy metals and human or veterinary pharmaceuticals ho et al 2013 jensen et al 2012 motoyama et al 2011 not only have pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine been shown to be taken up by plants winker 2010 2009 but the effect of the consumption of these plants on human health has been understudied lemonde fewless 2015 winker 2010 and there is a growing concern regarding the potential impacts of these contaminants both on human health and their receiving ecosystems song et al 2010 regulations when and where they exist are legislating the contents of contaminants allowed for these by products to be used as fertilisers in terms of heavy metals pathogens and per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas and acknowledge the inherent presence of pharmaceuticals and other lifestyle biomarkers ang and sparkes 2000 pritchard et al 2010 queensland government 2011 however no limits are currently defined on the basis that it is unlikely they would be harmful yet no extensive research has been conducted to date to demonstrate whether this is truly the case to understand the whole picture it is critical to determine which compounds are present in human urine and whether the use of the latter as soil amendment is safe for the environment and for human health currently the minimum treatment for the reuse of source separated human urine recommended by the world health organization who is storage of urine for 6 months at 20 c who 2006 which has proven sufficient to inactivate several key human pathogens chandran et al 2009 lahr et al 2016 fresh urine is collected through urine diverting technologies pipes and storage tanks where it is colonised by ubiquitous micro organisms these organisms naturally produce the enzyme urease which catalyses the ureolysis of urea to ammonium and carbonates mobley and hausinger 1989 this naturally occurring phenomenon transforms urea to free ammonia and elevates the ph of urine to 9 which leads to precipitation of calcium and magnesium salts e g struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o several studies investigated the removal of carbamazepine diclofenac sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in different human urine storage conditions 6 12 months different ph levels gajurel et al 2007 jaatinen et al 2016 özel duygan et al 2021 schürmann et al 2012 table s1 overall the storage at the ph of hydrolysed urine ph 9 did not achieve a removal of more than 10 for the mentioned pharmaceuticals and it was unclear whether the observed removal was due to chemical or biological pathways schürmann et al 2012 it is also worth noting that in the presence of microbial communities the removal of parent compounds as well as human metabolites may occur via various physico chemical processes such as adsorption onto the surface of the biomass or absorption into the biomass jelic et al 2015 verlicchi et al 2012 in these cases these compounds would be effectively removed from the liquid phase however the possibility remains that adsorbed compounds could naturally desorb over time and be found back in the liquid phase torresi et al 2017 removal can also occur via bio transformations which add or remove functional groups to from the molecule leading to transformation products which may be more or less harmful than the parent compound jaatinen et al 2016 at this point even though the parent compound is not detected its transformation products may still be present and bioactive in the liquid phase these transformations are complex and the elucidation of their structure and metabolic pathways is beyond scope of this study the goal of the present study was to determine through two short term and one long term experiments whether the hydrolysis and storage of urine contributes to the removal of pharmaceutical and lifestyle biomarker parent compounds and their human metabolites the first short term experiment tested the impact of the process of urea hydrolysis on pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers removal in both liquid and solid fractions i e the precipitates that form after hydrolysis the second short term experiment tested the exposure of said compounds to readily hydrolysed urine in the long term experiment the pharmaceutical and lifestyle biomarker concentrations in three different hydrolysed urine volumes were measured to determine whether extended storage times 24 months i e larger than the 6 months recommended by the who for pathogens inactivation who 2006 could result in their complete removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers 2 1 1 active ingredients twelve active ingredients were selected from two different categories lifestyle biomarkers and pharmaceuticals table 1 amongst the lifestyle biomarkers two artificial sweeteners acesulfame k cyclamate one stimulant caffeine and an ethanol metabolite resulting from alcohol consumption ethyl glucuronide were chosen the selected pharmaceuticals consisted of an anti convulsant carbamazepine two analgesics diclofenac and paracetamol an anti depressant fluoxetine three antibiotics sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and erythromycin and an x ray contrast medium iopromide these twelve micropollutants vary in terms of pharmacological activities and were selected according to whether they were previously studied in literature and if they are known to be widespread and or persistent in urine see further details in table s3 2 1 2 determination of dosing concentrations the objective of the method described below was to replicate human urine containing pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers in concentrations representative of the australian population on average data on pharmaceuticals concentrations in wastewater is widely available choi et al 2019 jelic et al 2011 ortiz de garcía et al 2013 verlicchi et al 2012 however little to no data is available for human urine winker et al 2008 and literature describing results from experiments using spiked doses typically overestimate the feed concentrations to accommodate for the detection limits of the instrumentation jaatinen et al 2016 pronk et al 2006a therefore realistic pharmaceutical concentrations were approximated through a number of steps as described in fig 1 in order to spike doses of pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers relevant to a real life scenario see further details in section 2 2 in supplementary information the concentrations in urine ci mg l 1 were determined using two different equations from literature see eqs s1 and s2 in the supplementary information based on data about pharmaceutical consumption table s5 these values were then compared with data based on the modelling of the chemical mass load vs population size in australia from o brien et al 2014 eq s3 values resulting from eqs s1 and s2 were subsequently averaged and rounded up to the next whole number section 2 2 2 in supplementary information the order of magnitude of the resulting concentrations of active ingredients cai was compared with values from literature table s8 after selecting these twelve active ingredients and calculating their concentrations in urine the excreted fractions of parent compounds and their human metabolites in urine were gathered from pharmacological literature table s9 only the most abundant metabolite of each parent compound was studied with the following exceptions 10 11 dihydroxycarbamazepine is the carbamazepine metabolite present in largest quantities 20 but is not pharmaceutically active winker et al 2008 whereas the metabolite carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide is active besse et al 2008 paracetamol acetaminophen metabolites were not included as analytical methods to detect these compounds were not readily available 3 desmethyl trimethoprim and 4 desmethyl trimethoprim are respectively excreted at 7 and 6 sigel 1983 for simplification only 3 desmethyl trimethoprim was selected and the excretion fractions summed as a final control the doses of the parent compounds dpc and their human metabolites dm were compared to a set of measurements from real urine table s10 concentrations were adjusted to the higher concentration in order to represent a worst case scenario the selected target concentrations based on the procedure above can be found in table 1 2 1 3 standards preparation and pharmaceutical analyses a mixed working standard solution containing all target analytes was prepared in lc ms grade methanol and used for spiking of micropollutants into the tested source separated urine for the short term experiments and for use as mixed calibration standard for analysis the mixed standards solution was prepared in a volumetric flask by directly adding weighed dry chemical for compounds with final concentration 2 mg l 1 table 1 and by dosing the corresponding volume of individually prepared stock solutions in meoh for compounds with final concentrations 2 mg l 1 the stock solution used for spiking of urine at 1 50 ratio was stored at 20 c and used within two weeks the characteristics of the analytes and concentrations of individual standards can be found in tables s12 and s13 the chemical analyses are described in section 2 4 in the supplementary information when both parent compound and human metabolite of an active ingredient were present in solution their fate was studied jointly in order to account for conjugation deconjugation phenomena 2 2 urine hydrolysis short term experiments the fate of the selected compounds during and after urine hydrolysis was investigated in batch tests conducted in 20 ml triplicate serum bottles fig 2 fresh urine was collected from 20 anonymous volunteers within 6 h of donation and used as the medium for two short term tests that were conducted in parallel in the first experiment hydrolysis the micropollutants were added at the start to study the impact of the process of urea hydrolysis on micropollutant removal where compounds could precipitate adsorb onto the formed precipitates biomass or undergo some transformations through physico chemical and or microbially induced pathways at the same time as the urea was being hydrolysed in the second experiment exposure to hydrolysed urine micropollutants were added after completion of urea hydrolysis with the aim of determining whether any chemical removal could happen in a solution which was supposedly not undergoing further physical or chemical transformations a bacteria free control experiment was set up for this experiment using a high nh3 and high ph solution see si section 3 3 1 for full composition in order to determine whether the biomass had an effect on the removal of pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers a mother solution was prepared for use in all these batch tests by inoculating 500 ml of the collected fresh urine with 5 ml of hydrolysed urine the hydrolysed urine was collected from a storage tank hydraulic retention time of 1 2 weeks linked to waterless urinals at a dedicated pilot plant installation ledezma et al 2019 the composition of all media can be found in table s16 at the start of the first short term experiment hydrolysis triplicate serum bottles were filled with 20 ml of the inoculated fresh urine and spiked with 0 4 ml of the stock solution to match the target concentrations of the selected chemicals for initial concentrations in the serum bottles refer to table s13 in supplementary information in parallel the same process was performed with the high nh3 control solution all urine serum bottles including the residual mother solution were tested for ph and electrical conductivity at least every 2 days in order to monitor the progress of hydrolysis fig s1 after 15 days the ph and electrical conductivity stabilised indicating that urine hydrolysis was completed which concluded the first part of this experiment for the second short term experiment exposure to hydrolysed urine a new set of triplicate serum bottles was filled with 20 ml of the now hydrolysed urine mother solution and spiked with 0 4 ml of the same chemical stock solution the ph and ec were measured every 5 days to ensure the hydrolysed urine was not undergoing any more physical and chemical transformations 50 μl per sample were taken with a syringe without opening the flasks to avoid volatilisation and measured for ph ec with laquatwin micro probes horiba japan see fig s1 samples for chemical analysis were collected from the serum bottles at the beginning and the end of each experiment and measured as described in section 2 4 supplementary information samples from the control bottles were also taken mid way through the 30 day experiment all bottles were kept in the dark to avoid potential chemical degradation by photolysis andreozzi et al 2003 lastly the serum bottles of both real urine experiments contained precipitates which were filtered through a 0 7 µm glass microfibre filter lbs0gff 047 labserv australia on a vacuum filtering device the precipitates were allowed to dry in a desiccator then dissolved in 7 ml of 1 m hcl the ph of the acid solution was then adjusted to a neutral ph with 6 7 ml of 1 m naoh 2 3 long term storage of urine the hydrolysed urine mother solution sample a and the hydrolysed urine used for the inoculation sample b were stored at room temperature 23 c for almost one year 49 50 weeks an additional unspiked batch of hydrolysed urine from the storage tank of the two waterless urinals sample c was also stored at room temperature 0 50 c depending on the season for more than two years all urines were stored in clear borosilicate bottles hence potential photodegradation was not prevented andreozzi et al 2003 duplicate samples were taken from each bottle and analysed for the investigated target compounds with the exception of diclofenac and norfluoxetine for which standards were unavailable at the time of analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers removal during and after urea hydrolysis 3 1 1 control solution in the high ammonia control changes in concentration following 15 or 30 days of storage were negligible for most studied analytes except for one parent compound erythromycin and two human metabolites 4 hydroxy diclofenac and n desmethyl erythromycin fig 3 exposure to the ammonia solution for 15 and 30 days led to removal of 63 0 8 3 of the total erythromycin of which 17 6 3 4 was as the parent compound and 45 4 6 5 was the metabolite n 6 98 2 0 1 of the metabolite 4 hydroxy diclofenac was removed following 30 days exposure to the ammonia solution corresponding to 96 2 0 1 of the total diclofenac as the concentration of the parent compound did not increase the metabolite likely underwent a different transformation than deconjugation back to diclofenac however the elucidation of transformation products and the mechanisms through which these can be formed were beyond the scope of this study 3 1 2 source separated urine citalopram and its human metabolite desmethyl citalopram were detected in the real urine medium hence their fate was investigated thirteen out of the nineteen compounds 8 parent compounds cyclamate caffeine carbamazepine diclofenac sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim iopromide and citalopram 5 human metabolites paraxanthine 4 hydroxy diclofenac n4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole 3 desmethyl trimethoprim and desmethyl citalopram were neither removed during the hydrolysis of urine nor when exposed to hydrolysed urine for 15 days fig 4 and further details in table s19 in supplementary information amongst them cyclamate and caffeine tend to be removed during wastewater treatment at up to 70 gómez et al 2007 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 kokotou and thomaidis 2013 rosal et al 2010 during wastewater treatment carbamazepine and diclofenac usually experience a negative removal indicating deconjugation mechanisms or are removed up to 20 gómez et al 2007 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 rosal et al 2010 as the investigated compounds all have different physico chemical properties no common factor could explain why the concentrations of these specific compounds were not affected by the hydrolysis of urine only three compounds were affected by both the hydrolysis of real urine and 15 days of exposure to hydrolysed urine ethyl glucuronide erythromycin and its metabolite n desmethyl erythromycin fig 4 ethyl glucuronide was the only compound which was completely removed from the liquid phase at the end of both experiments 100 0 0 0 and 99 9 0 1 possibly ethyl glucuronide was deconjugated as has been previously observed to occur for other glucuronidated metabolites in manure halling sorensen et al 1998 and during conventional wastewater treatment e g estrogens andersen et al 2003 d ascenzo et al 2003 and carbamazepine verlicchi et al 2012 however this is only hypothetical as neither ethanol nor glucuronic acid were measured similarly the concentrations of the active ingredient of erythromycin were 77 6 7 9 and 57 7 7 3 lower at the end of the hydrolysis and exposure experiments respectively the parent compound erythromycin was almost completely removed during hydrolysis 96 8 1 2 erythromycin and its human metabolite n desmethyl erythromycin are large lipophilic compounds which were predominantly in cationic form between ph 7 5 and 9 table s12 hence they could have been absorbed into biomass this would require further confirmation four additional compounds were affected by the exposure to hydrolysed urine paracetamol carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide acesulfame k and fluoxetine urine hydrolysis did not significantly affect the paracetamol concentration but it was removed at 99 0 0 3 after 15 days of exposure since the analyte s concentration decreased drastically in real urine but not in the high ph and high nh3 solution where the ph and ammonia concentration were similar it is likely that the biomass contributed to paracetamol removal as paracetamol is hydrophilic low logd of 0 97 and uncharged at ph 9 it is more likely that paracetamol was removed by bio transformation rather than sorption in onto the biomass jelic et al 2015 verlicchi et al 2012 in turn 13 5 0 5 of the total carbamazepine was removed during exposure to hydrolysed urine fig 4 with 40 7 1 8 of the human metabolite carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide removed from the liquid phase 14 4 0 6 of total carbamazepine moreover acesulfame k was 11 5 1 5 lower after 15 days of exposure to hydrolysed urine a similar range as above moreover the metabolite norfluoxetine was not detected in the samples likely due to an analytical error the fluoxetine active ingredient concentration was calculated by adding the theoretical spiked amount of metabolite to the molar concentration of the measured parent compound the parent compound was removed at 24 6 0 9 which accounted for 1 8 0 1 of the total fluoxetine it is difficult to draw definite conclusions on its fate without the entire set of norfluoxetine measurements but since both the fluoxetine parent compound and human metabolite are lipophilic and in cationic form at ph 9 one of the removal mechanisms could have been sorption in onto the biomass absorption into the biomass or adsorption onto the negatively charged cell surfaces respectively hörsing et al 2011 li and zhang 2010 finally it is worth considering that since these results are different to the control results a biological degradation transformation pathway s cannot be excluded as a cause for these observations however and as previously mentioned the elucidation of any such mechanisms is beyond the scope of the study 3 2 presence of pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers in hydrolysed urine precipitates out of the 20 parent compounds and human metabolites investigated only two were undetected in the urine precipitates ethyl glucuronide and diclofenac table 2 three pharmaceutical compounds were detected only in one out of the six real urine precipitate samples paracetamol 36 0 mg kgdw n desmethyl erythromycin 18 2 µg kgdw n acetyl sulfamethoxazole 210 7 mg kgdw which might have been an anomaly therefore if one were to consider using only the precipitated solids as a purified fertiliser these salts would still have to undergo further treatment such as washing with a saturated struvite solution ronteltap et al 2007 schürmann et al 2012 which might not be feasible at a commercial scale when comparing these precipitate values to available literature for other waste derived fertilisers such as sewage sludge and animal manure table 2 carbamazepine and fluoxetine concentrations were in the same order of magnitude in both urine precipitates and sewage sludge diclofenac and paracetamol were present in sewage sludge but not detected in urine precipitates jensen et al 2012 however the antibiotic concentrations were much higher in urine precipitates followed by manure then sewage sludge ho et al 2013 motoyama et al 2011 therefore the use of urine precipitates formed during urea hydrolysis as fertiliser for crops would potentially not be less harmful than using sewage sludge or manure 3 3 long term storage of source separated human urine out of the 19 analysed compounds only fluoxetine was below detection limit in the three urine samples that were stored under long term uncontrolled storage conditions fig 5 table s21 in the short term experiments fluoxetine removal was minimal 24 6 0 9 after 15 days of exposure to hydrolysed urine hence it is more likely that fluoxetine was not excreted by urine donors rather than a complete removal occurring ethyl glucuronide and iopromide were not found in two of the samples a and b but were present in sample c with concentrations of 12 5 0 9 and 85 4 7 5 µg l 1 respectively carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide and 4 hydroxy diclofenac were found in two of the three samples and were below the limit of detection in the third one this was also the case for the artificial sweetener cyclamate which had a concentration of 73 0 0 6 mg l 1 in sample c the remaining thirteen analysed compounds were present in all three samples of long term stored hydrolysed urine with concentrations as high as 9 4 mg l 1 acesulfame k in sample c as the initial concentration in the samples was not measured it was not possible to conduct mass balances and therefore determine the removal if any that occurred during the long term storage of these samples however these measurements are in accordance with the results from the short term experiments as has been shown for ethyl glucuronide and paracetamol considering the large number of compounds present in the urine it is clear that source separated hydrolysed urine is unlikely to be pharmaceutical free even after years of storage and further treatment would be needed before it can be used as a fertiliser if one wishes to avoid the uncontrolled spread of pharmaceuticals and other active compounds onto the environment and population 3 4 potential impacts of using hydrolysed stored urine as fertiliser the use of source separated hydrolysed urine as is for crops fertilisation necessitates more research in order to determine the soil water dynamics of the different compounds their potential plant uptake and subsequent transfer to the human body the ecotoxicity of selected compounds has been previously studied in conjunction with their sorption and removal in soil however there is only limited published literature to date table s2 research has shown that more lipophilic compounds i e those with an octanol water partition coefficient logkow 3 such as carbamazepine diclofenac or fluoxetine exhibit higher sorption into the soil than more hydrophilic compounds e g paracetamol based on their partitioning coefficient kd jensen et al 2012 picó et al 2019 winker 2009 amongst the seven lipophilic compounds measured in the long term storage experiment six carbamazepine citalopram erythromycin and their metabolites with the exception of the antidepressant fluoxetine which was not detected were present in quantities ranging from 0 6 to 759 µg l 1 citalopram in solution a after 12 months of storage slow degradation of these compounds in soil e g up to 553 days to remove 50 of the initially measured carbamazepine suggests they may accumulate in the soil and plants with every new application of fertiliser containing pharmaceutical residues jensen et al 2012 a low predicted no effect concentration pnec concentration which marks the limit below which no adverse effect in an ecosystem is measured in soil such as 0 41 µg kg 1 for diclofenac suggests higher risk to this particular environment than higher pnec as is the case for fluoxetine 13 µg kg 1 khan and nicell 2010 in comparison soil vertebrates may tolerate 100 µg l 1 diclofenac and only 0 6 µg l 1 fluoxetine according to their pnec khan and nicell 2010 fluoxetine especially has the greatest acute toxicity amongst human pharmaceuticals ec50 unspecified green algae 0 031 mg l 1 puckowski et al 2016 although only limited information is available these studies underline that while partitioning behaviour of these compounds may be derived from their physico chemical properties it does not directly relate to their potential effects on living organisms jensen et al 2012 khan and nicell 2010 winker 2009 numerous studies to date have stated that the potential for drug uptake into vegetables grown in greenhouses is significant although sabourin et al 2012 have argued that this is very low for vegetables grown under normal farming conditions with a one year offset between fertiliser application and harvest more research is definitely warranted to determine what the uptake by different parts of the plant is i e root leaves fruits etc for a wider variety of plants akenga et al 2020 alemayehu et al 2020 de boer et al 2018 jensen et al 2012 and whether consumption of these plants can have harmful consequences on human health so far two studies have investigated the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers in crops irrigated with different streams rainwater and water from the llobregat river in spain margenat et al 2019 and treated wastewater malchi et al 2014 these investigations estimated that a child or an adult would have to eat between 24 and 905 kg of vegetables lettuce tomato cauliflower broad beans sweet potato and carrots in order to reach the threshold of toxicological concern ttc for carbamazepine and caffeine 1 5 μg per kg of body weight per day malchi et al 2014 margenat et al 2019 this is unlikely to occur however a child 25 kg would only need to eat 250 g of contaminated carrots or 300 g of lettuce with carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide to reach the ttc 2 5 ng per kg of body weight per day malchi et al 2014 margenat et al 2019 although more research is needed to assess the toxicological concern of a wider range of pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers originating from urine these findings alone are particularly concerning given that carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide was heavily present in the tested urine in fact and as explained in detail in the supplementary information section 3 5 it can be estimated that for the carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide levels observed in this study a child would reach the ttc when consuming 1 2 kg of contaminated carrots unlikely or 51 g of contaminated lettuce quite possible 3 5 post processing of human urine derived fertilisers using separated hydrolysed urine for fertilisation has the potential to save large amounts of freshwater while reducing agriculture s dependence of fossil fuel derived fertilisers i e haber bosch process and deviating a significant nutrient load from centralised wastewater treatment plants i e expanding capacity and or reducing the need for upgrades freguia et al 2021 therefore the practice is very promising for the water energy nutrients nexus of the future but this will require an expanded framework that also investigates the fate of micropollutants within said nexus in source separating technology e g waterless urinals no mix toilets and other similar nutrient recovery sanitation systems one first removal barrier can be the sealant fluids preventing the passing of gases produced in the collection system thapa and hanigan 2020 further membrane processes such as nanofiltration nghiem et al 2004 pronk et al 2006b siegrist and joss 2012 reverse osmosis siegrist and joss 2012 snyder et al 2007 electrochemical stripping tarpeh and nelson 2018 or electrodialysis arola et al 2019 pronk et al 2006a have been shown to separate pharmaceuticals from a nutrient rich product efficiently although evidently such separations do not lead to the degradation of these compounds another growing approach to urine separation nutrient recovery is stabilisation where targeted chemical dosing of acidic or basic compounds e g citric acid sodium bicarbonate can inhibit hydrolysis and facilitate the recovery of nitrogen in the form of urea courtney and randall 2022 although at this point the fate of pharmaceuticals during the stabilisation process remains to be investigated there are nevertheless some established treatments that have proven efficient in removing pharmaceuticals from urine such as steam stripping evaporation high dosage of uvc light or ozonation gulyas 2007 but these are very energy intensive and considered economically unfavourable for treating large volumes of urine advanced oxidation processes are considered promising technologies as they can destroy pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers from highly concentrated streams such as reverse osmosis concentrates by generating highly reactive hydroxyl radicals abdelmelek et al 2011 lütke eversloh et al 2014 however this type of electrochemical treatment applied to substrate with high chloride concentrations such as urine 1 4 1 8 g l 1 kuntke et al 2012 pronk et al 2006a udert et al 2006 can form active chlorine which might lead to undesired transformation products such as chlorate and or chlorinated disinfection by products deborde and von gunten 2008 jermakka et al 2021 lütke eversloh et al 2014 finally another alternative would be activated carbon onto which pharmaceuticals and lifestyle biomarkers can adsorb köpping et al 2020 özel duygan et al 2021 snyder et al 2007 combinations of the aforementioned treatments could maximise pharmaceutical removal and result in the production of clean fertilisers etter et al 2015 özel duygan et al 2021 4 conclusion this study investigated the fate of 20 micropollutants during the hydrolysis of urine and during its short and long term storage these processes had an effect on only seven compounds with different physico chemical properties with only the ethanol metabolite ethyl glucuronide and the analgesic paracetamol effectively removed similar to findings from literature gajurel et al 2007 jaatinen et al 2016 özel duygan et al 2021 schürmann et al 2012 carbamazepine diclofenac sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were not removed by hydrolysis and storage of urine in addition long term storage of hydrolysed urine for up to 2 years did not result in further removal of the studied compounds furthermore this study demonstrated that precipitates resulting from urea hydrolysis also contained a small fraction of all the investigated pharmaceutical compounds 7 with the exception of ethyl glucuronide and diclofenac the fate of carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide highlighted the importance of studying the human metabolites in conjunction with their corresponding parent compounds by combining the parent compound and its metabolite in a single concentration of their bioactivity it was possible to witness that a small fraction of the 40 removed from the liquid phase as the metabolite actually deconjugated back to the parent compound the results of this study are clear hydrolysed stored urine following who guidelines is not free from toxicologically active pharmaceuticals therefore the spreading of such untreated urine on edible crops currently happening at medium scale trials around the world needs some serious re consideration before the practice is implemented at the larger scales proposed by many of its advocates and

15654,the performance of an integrated process comprising coagulation ozonation and catalytic ceramic membrane filtration cmf followed by treatment with biological active carbon bac was evaluated in a pilot scale 96 m3 d experiment to understand the biostability and quality of the finished water the fate of dissolved organic matter dom at the molecular level was explored using fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms biostable finished water with an assimilable organic carbon aoc concentration of 30 2 45 4 µg l was obtained by the integrated process and the high hydraulic retention time hrt 45 min of the bac filter was necessary to provide biostable finished water the coagulation o3 cmf unit efficiently transformed nitrogen containing polyaromatic hydrocarbons pah with aromaticity and large molecular weight mw 500 1000 da into cho type highly unsaturated phenolic compounds huph with less aromaticity and medium mw 300 500 da which were effectively removed by subsequent bac filtering the main reaction was oxygen addition followed by deamination and dealkylation of the coagulation o3 cmf unit and decarboxylation of the bac filter principal component analysis revealed that n containing and large mw pah are potential aoc precursors and the chemical characteristics of cho type and medium mw huph make them aoc candidates

process in drinking water treatment plants graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water integrated coagulation o3 cmf bac process biostability dissolved organic matter ft icr ms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with rapid societal development the demand for high quality drinking water has increased at present the main limitation of water for direct drinking is the risk of excessive bacteria wan et al 2022 the presence of pathogens e g vibrio cholerae legionella and helicobacter in tap water can cause intestinal diseases in humans fields et al 2002 lechevallier et al 1996 vital et al 2007 although disinfectants can diminish the bacterial activity of finished water residual disinfectants can be consumed due to pipeline corrosion and biofilms produced by insufficient disinfectants which lowers the biostability of drinking water distribution systems assimilable organic carbon aoc refers to the dissolved organic matter dom that is most easily assimilated by heterotrophic bacteria through metabolism gillespie et al 2014 and is widely considered to be the main factor supporting the growth of bacteria in the distribution system generally the biostability of drinking water requests a low level of aoc 50 μg l in the presence of disinfectant kooij 1992 lechevallier et al 1996 the removal efficiency of aoc by conventional drinking water treatment plants dwtps is less than 30 and the aoc concentration of finished water is greatly affected by the raw water quality liu et al 2002 park et al 2016 in a full scale dwtp advanced treatment processes comprising ozonation followed by a biological active carbon bac filter can remove 60 80 of aoc in the finished water chien et al 2007 xing et al 2018 however aoc still cannot stably meet the requirement of less than 50 μg l liao et al 2018 ozonation can transform aoc precursors to aoc at an early stage and these produced aoc can be effectively removed by subsequent bac filter avoiding the undesired formation of aoc caused by chlorination of the finished water li et al 2018 park et al 2016 therefore enhancing the transformation from aoc precursors to aoc during ozonation can greatly reduce the aoc formation potential during disinfection recently the integrated o3 ceramic membrane filtration cmf bac process has been investigated in pilot scale experiments for treating drinking water fan et al 2014 reclaimed water zhang et al 2020 municipal wastewater chen et al 2021 and petroleum wastewater hu et al 2020 ceramic membranes can catalyze ozone to produce free hydroxyl radicals increasing the efficiency of degrading refractory organic pollutants chen et al 2021 and in situ ozonation can significantly alleviate membrane fouling song et al 2017 the synergistic effect between o3 cmf and bac filter has been proved chen et al 2021 currently only 1 3 of the dwtps in china are equipped with advanced treatment processes wang et al 2021 as the large footprint and difficulty in in situ upgrading limit the application of advanced treatment technology the integrated o3 cmf bac process has the potential to increase the biostability of finished water and its practical application in advanced treatment however the concentration and composition of dom in source water can influence the effectiveness of physicochemical treatment processes and are directly associated with finished water quality maqbool et al 2020a understanding the impact of dom changes on aoc in the treatment of integrated o3 cmf bac process can help determine the feasibility of large scale applications dom is ubiquitous in source water and aoc can be derived from dom released by microbes such as phytoplankton cultures chen and wangersky 1996 aoc is a mixture of compounds such as identified biodegradable organic matter for example formaldehyde and formate however approximately half of aoc components are unrecognized compounds hammes et al 2006 such as biodegradable humic like substances terry and summers 2018 conventional dom characterization methods such as molecular weight mw distribution hem and efraimsen 2001 chemical fraction kim et al 2017 and ultraviolet uv fluorescence spectroscopy huang et al 2020 wang et al 2022 can only characterize dom from a certain aspect considering the microbial risks of aoc in drinking water it is important to obtain information at the molecular level to understand the role of different organic components in dom in the biostability of drinking water however this is beyond the scope of conventional analytical approaches for understanding dom transformation at the molecular level during treatment compared with conventional analytical approaches fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is a promising method to elucidate the fate of dom in drinking water huang et al 2020 lavonen et al 2015 secondary effluent maqbool et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a and leachate yuan et al 2017 to date few studies have reported the transformation of dom at the molecular level in an integrated coagulation o3 cmf bac process and its association with drinking water biostability kasuga et al 2020 this study investigated the performance and mechanism of the integrated process consisting of coagulation o3 cmf followed by a bac filter for the advanced treatment of drinking water the continuous effectiveness of the integrated process for 80 days was studied in a pilot scale experiment 96 m3 d the performance of organic pollutants and the removal of fluorescence components were studied the transformation of organics and reaction types in the integrated process were studied at the molecular level using ft icr ms the correlation between aoc and dom composition was comprehensively elucidated at the molecular level using ft icr ms this study provides a better understanding of the molecular transformation of dom during the treatment of the integrated process 2 materials and

filtration as advanced treatments the general quality of the raw water is summarized in table s1 fig 1 shows that the integrated process consisted of a membrane tank with dimensions of 2 34 1 60 2 70 m3 l w h and a bac filtration column with dimensions of 0 65 0 60 2 70 m3 the catalytic ceramic membrane was composed of α al2o3 doped with mn2o3 with a 100 nm nominal pore size two membrane modules

was 2 0 m in size with an average particle size of 1 5 mm and the iodine adsorption value was 700 mg g raw water was first pumped into the storage tank 2 m3 then into the membrane tank and the liquid form of polymeric aluminum chloride pac 10 wt was injected through the pipeline mixer considering the removal efficiencies of aoc and dissolved organic carbon doc by coagulation and the economic cost of pac a dosage of 2 mg l was selected for the pilot study fig s1 ozone was generated by an ozone generator cf g 3 25 g guolin qingdao china and excess ozone was destroyed by an ozone destructor ct 100 guolin ozone was continuously aerated through a titanium oxide aeration rod placed at the bottom of the membrane module hydraulic retention time hrt refers to the retention time of the water in the bac filter calculated as the volume of bac divided by the flow rate of water which is a key parameter for the removal of aoc the membrane unit was automatically backwashed every 60 min for 1 min the backwashing flux was three times the filtration flux and the water in a clean water tank was used for backwashing in total there were three sampling points raw water s1 coagulation o3 cmf effluent s2 and bac effluent s3 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 general water quality parameters water samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm filter whatman uniflo usa before doc and uv254 measurements the concentration of doc was determined using a toc vcph shimadzu japan and uv254 was measured by ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis uv2600 shimadzu japan at a wavelength of 254 nm the concentrations of codmn and color were measured according to the chinese national environment protection agency standard china turbidity was measured using a turbidity analyzer tl2310 hach usa 2 2 2 aoc aoc was measured using the flow cytometer method developed by hammes and egli 2005 the aoc measurement procedures were as follows a 20 ml water sample was filtered through a 0 22 μm sterile filter whatman uniflo usa into 40 ml carbon free vials and was then pasteurized at 70 c for 60 min evian bottled water was used as the inoculum and the initial bacterial concentration was estimated to be approximately 1 104 cells ml the aoc vials were cultured in a bio incubator for 72 h at 30 c after 72 h of incubation 500 μl samples were stained with 5 μl sybr green 1 100 dilution in dmso molecular probes in the dark for 15 min cell counts were performed on a facscalibur bd flow cytometer the aoc concentration was obtained by dividing the cell count by the conversion factor which was 1 107 cells μg as follows hammes et al 2006 1 a o c c e l l s l 1 1 0 7 c e l l s μ g 2 2 3 fluorescence spectroscopy the excitation emission matrix eem was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy f 7000 hitachi japan using a four sided quartz cuvette the excitation ex and emission em wavelengths were 220 450 nm and 240 600 nm with wavelength steps of 5 nm and 1 nm respectively the scan slit and speed for ex and em were 5 nm and 30 000 nm min respectively a blank sample was obtained by measuring the eem of the milli q water the absorption value of uv254 was lower than 0 05 cm 1 for all samples which ensured the accurate detection of eem 2 2 4 parallel factor parafac analysis modeling parafac modeling was performed to identify and quantify the major fluorescence components in pilot scale experiments a total of 240 eem samples including raw water cmf effluent and bac effluent from the pilot experiments were analyzed for modeling parafac modeling was performed according to the tutorial of stedmon and bro 2008 and modeling was performed in matlab r2018b using the domfluor toolbox the maximum fluorescence intensity of each component was determined using fmax and was normalized using the raman integration method for mutual comparison 2 2 5 ft icr ms analysis the ft icr ms bruker solarix germany used for dom composition analysis was equipped with a 15 0 t superconducting magnet and an electrospray ionization esi source in negative mode bruker data analysis software was used to identify possible formulas the molecular formula calculation was based on the elemental combinations of 12c1 60 1h1 120 16o1 50 14n0 5 32s0 3 and peaks with a signal to noise s n ratio 5 were applied for calculation the solid phase extraction procedure and the parameters of ft icr ms are presented in text s1 the elemental formula assignments are presented in text s2 the relative intensities ris of each formula were used to calculate the weighted average value of all molecular level parameters according to the description by zhang et al 2021a the dom components were categorized into five classes based on the modified aromaticity index aimod and h c as follows kellerman et al 2014 ⅰ polyaromatic hydrocarbons pah 0 66 aimod ii polyphenols polyph 0 5 aimod 0 66 ⅲ highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds huph aimod 0 5 and h c 1 5 ⅳ aliphatic compounds aliph aimod 0 5 and 1 5 h c 2 0 and ⅴ carbohydrate compounds carbo 2 0 h c the compounds were divided into three molecular size fractions small mw compounds 300 da medium mw compounds 300 500 da and large mw compounds 500 da zhang et al 2021b in this study the raw water and effluent from each unit were from the same water matrix therefore the ris of non target screening detected compounds were used for semi quantification compounds whose ri decreased by more than 30 were termed precursors compounds whose ri increased by more than 30 were termed products and the remaining compounds with ri changes of less than 30 were termed resistants kasuga et al 2020 inter sample ranking analysis was applied to analyze the common presence of molecules in raw water coagulation o3 cmf effluent and bac effluent following the method described by zhang et al 2019 2 2 6 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was used to determine the significance of the differences in water quality under different conditions p value was obtained through anova and p 0 05 showed significant difference principal component analysis pca and clustering correlation analysis were applied to study the correlation between aoc and dom characteristics all statistical analyses were performed using origin 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the integrated process to explore the impacts of ozone dosage cmf flux and the hrt of bac on the performance of the integrated process four ozone dosages 0 2 3 and 5 mg l four membrane fluxes 60 80 100 and 120 l m2 h lmh and seven hrts 7 5 15 30 45 60 90 and 120 min were applied in the pilot scale experiment fig 2 a shows that the average concentrations of doc and aoc in the raw water were 2 7 0 3 mg l and 269 6 38 6 μg l respectively the removal efficiencies of doc and aoc by the coagulation o3 cmf unit increased from 32 9 3 3 to 40 9 4 3 and decreased from 12 6 2 8 to 42 2 5 8 respectively as the ozone dosage increased from 0 to 5 mg l at cmf flux of 80 lmh coagulation cmf treatment mainly removes doc and aoc precursors and a small amount of aoc can be removed simultaneously through separation following ozone addition the increase in the aoc concentration indicated the transformation of large mw organics into biodegradable organics by ozonation ceramic membranes catalyze the production of free hydroxyl radicals to mineralize aoc in membrane nanopores the synergistic effect of the coagulation o3 cmf unit slightly increased the aoc concentration by 40 which is much lower than the increase 100 300 caused by ozone alone reported in the literature hammes et al 2006 terry and summers 2018 there was no significant difference between 3 mg l and 5 mg l ozone dosages in relation to the removal of doc and aoc p 0 05 anova therefore 3 mg l was selected as the optimal ozone dosage to obtain the best economic benefit at an ozone dosage of 3 mg l as the cmf flux increased from 60 to 120 lmh the transmembrane pressure δtmp increased from 1 54 to 2 66 kpa and the removal of doc and aoc by the coagulation o3 cmf unit decreased from 40 5 4 1 to 27 7 3 3 and 37 3 3 1 to 42 8 4 6 respectively as there was no significant difference between the cmf fluxes of 60 and 80 lmh for the removal of doc and aoc p 0 05 anova membrane fouling could be controlled fig s7 to obtain a higher water production 80 lmh was selected as the optimal cmf flux in contrast fig 2 b shows that with an hrt of 15 min the aoc removal efficiency by the bac filter was 77 6 4 2 and when the hrt further increased to 45 min aoc removal efficiencies increased to 90 4 3 7 with an hrt of 45 min the aoc concentrations of bac effluent ranged from 30 2 to 45 4 μg l which indicated the biostability of the finished water aoc 50 μg l lechevallier et al 1991 van der kooij et al 1982 the highest aoc removal efficiency through the bac filter was achieved in the presence of ozone mainly due to the increased biodegradability of the coagulation o3 cmf effluent by ozonation park et al 2016 increasing the hrt of the bac filter to at least 45 min is necessary for the integrated process to provide finished water with high biostability thus the hrt of the pilot scale experiment was set at 45 min the integrated process also achieved satisfactory average removal for suva254 60 9 2 7 codmn 69 1 4 5 turbidity 98 0 1 0 and color 100 at the optimized condition tables s1 and s2 and figs s2 5 3 2 dynamic of fluorescence components in dom the fluorescence component assignments were determined based on the dom description in the literature maqbool et al 2020b component 1 c1 em ex 414 250 nm represents the fluorescence features of humic like substances with possible sources of terrestrial and microbial humic like substances that commonly exist in natural water bodies as shown in fig 3 components 2 c2 em ex 346 235 nm and 3 c3 em ex 318 295 nm represent protein like substances with specific features of tryptophan and tyrosine like fluorescence components respectively fig 4 shows that in the 80 days of operation the removal efficiencies of fluorescence components by coagulation o3 cmf unit were 70 5 19 1 c1 61 1 27 1 c2 and 58 1 15 3 c3 which were further enhanced to 87 3 7 6 c1 86 1 9 4 c2 and 73 3 7 0 c3 using the bac filter these results indicated that the coagulation o3 cmf unit played a major role 85 in the removal of fluorescence components with a cmf flux of 80 lmh the removal efficiencies of c1 c2 and c3 by coagulation o3 cmf unit increased with the ozone dosage the coagulation o3 cmf unit had a lower removal efficiency for c2 in the absence of ozone as tryptophan like components are mainly hydrophilic organics while the coagulation cmf unit mainly removes large mw and hydrophobic substances oloibiri et al 2017 however tryptophan like components have higher reactivity with ozone due to their high electron density mangalgiri et al 2017 in addition in the presence of ozone c2 was mainly removed by the coagulation o3 cmf unit while in the absence of ozone tryptophan was mainly removed by bac filtration bac can remove hydrophilic and small mw substances through physicochemical adsorption as well as through biodegradation by the growth of biofilm on the surface of carbon pramanik et al 2018 the removal efficiencies of fluorescence components by the integrated coagulation o3 cmf bac process were higher than those of coagulation ozonation or bac alone baghoth et al 2011 sanchez et al 2013 indicating that the integrated process has a synergistic effect the removal efficiencies for c1 92 4 1 6 c2 92 2 1 4 and c3 76 4 5 6 by the integrated process were obtained at an ozone dosage of 3 mg l and cmf flux of 80 lmh in summary the synergistic effect between coagulation o3 cmf unit and subsequent bac filter achieved a relatively stable and satisfactory removal of fluorescence components 3 3 molecular characterization of dom in integrated process 3 3 1 ft icr ms spectra of dom the ft icr ms spectra presented the mw distribution of dom in raw water coagulation o3 cmf effluent and bac filter effluent at an optimal ozone dosage of 3 mg l and a cmf flux of 80 lmh fig 5 the mw distribution of dom in the raw water ranged from 200 to 1000 da and dom peaks with higher ris were mainly located within the mw range of 500 900 da constituting 39 4 of the total ris of dom in the raw water the removal efficiency of the large mw compounds by the coagulation o3 cmf unit was 33 0 which was further enhanced to 70 1 after bac filtration the changes in the large mw compounds by the coagulation o3 cmf unit showed the same pattern as the decline in the fmax of the fluorescence components however the small and medium mw compounds in raw water increased by 16 0 and 24 5 after treatment with the coagulation o3 cmf unit respectively but decreased by 30 5 and 42 8 following bac respectively the changes in the small and medium mw compounds agreed with the aoc results a significant decrease in the average mw of dom was observed after the coagulation o3 cmf unit treatment 506 437 da table 1 one of the reasons for this could be that large mw organics were transformed into small mw organics through cc bond cleavage through ozonation chang et al 2014 another reason could be that large mw organics are more susceptible to coagulation cmf unit treatment than are small mw organics lavonen et al 2015 thus the coagulation o3 cmf unit transformed the large mw dom in the raw water into small mw compounds which finally became a part of the aoc in contrast the bac filter showed a relatively weaker effect on mw changes 437 416 da no compounds with mw 800 da were detected after bac filtration the ft icr ms spectra showed a significant difference between the coagulation o3 cmf unit and bac filter in terms of dom transformation the transformation process is described in detail in the following section 3 3 2 compositional changes in dom fig 6 shows that pah and huph were the two dominant classes constituting 18 3 and 62 3 of the total dom in the raw water respectively after treatment with the coagulation o3 cmf unit the proportion of pah decreased by 13 2 and huph increased by 15 6 however the proportion of huph decreased by 20 4 after the bac filter treatment the results showed that the coagulation o3 cmf unit selectively degraded pah whereas the bac filter was effective in removing huph compared to raw water the o c of the coagulation o3 cmf effluent increased by 9 9 from 0 45 to 0 49 whereas the h c increased by 10 8 from 1 09 to 1 21 the increase in o c may have been caused by the addition of oxygen and hydroxyl radicals with the production of carbonyl carboxyl and aldehyde groups and the addition of hydroxyl radicals caused an increase in h c remucal et al 2020 in contrast because organics with higher o c and lower h c usually contain more acidic functional groups such as carboxyl functional groups coagulation selectively destabilizes such organics based on the charge neutralization precipitation mechanism thereby resulting in lower o c and higher h c organics after coagulation treatment yuan et al 2017 however the net o c value increased after treatment with the coagulation o3 cmf unit indicating that the increase in o c and h c was the combined effect of ozonation and coagulation treatment and that oxygen addition through ozonation was the dominant reaction dbe o c represents the cc content in dom after treatment with the coagulation o3 cmf unit the dbe o c value changed from positive to negative and decreased by 155 1 followed by a slight increase of 15 7 after bac filtration the change in dbe o c was consistent with the suva254 pattern table s2 this indicated the transformation of unsaturated dom to saturated dom during the treatment of coagulation o3 cmf unit however bac was not effective in the degradation of aromatic compounds in contrast aimod decreased by 22 5 and 3 6 after treatment with the coagulation o3 cmf unit and bac filtration respectively suggesting that the aromatic moieties are more likely to be attacked by ozone and or hydroxyl radicals zhang et al 2021a the nosc decreased from 0 12 to 0 18 in coagulation o3 cmf effluent representing the selective removal of oxidized compounds zhang et al 2021b cho compounds 52 3 were dominant in raw water followed by chon compounds 23 3 and chos compounds 16 9 the distribution of cho compounds increased significantly from 52 3 to 71 5 after treatment with the coagulation o3 cmf unit while the proportions of chon chos and chons decreased from 23 3 16 9 and 7 5 to 14 2 13 0 and 1 3 respectively in general the coagulation o3 cmf unit played a major role in the structural and compositional changes in dom and the bac filter removed dom asymmetrically 3 3 3 precursors resistants and products of dom half of the dom 47 in the raw water behaved as precursors in the treatment of coagulation o3 cmf unit and the products had similar amounts of ris to the precursors but the number of product molecules was higher than that of the precursors precursors 2251 vs products 3598 table s3 and fig s9 the precursors in the bac filter treatment constituted half of the dom 48 9 in the coagulation o3 cmf effluent but the ris of the bac filter products were only 8 4 of those of the precursors among the precursors treated with the coagulation o3 cmf unit the distribution of different classes was huph 46 1 pah 33 5 polyph 12 8 the products of the coagulation o3 cmf unit mostly belonged to the huph class 79 2 with the proportion of other classes being less than 10 however the proportion of precursors was noticeably different for the bac filter treatment huph 75 6 aliph 9 3 polyph 8 1 the results indicated the transformation of pah to huph by treatment with the coagulation o3 cmf unit whereas the bac filter was effective for the removal of huph the changes in huph agreed with the aoc results to further understand the molecular characteristics of the precursors and products the five components were classified based on their chemical compositions as shown in tables s4 and s5 during treatment with the coagulation o3 cmf unit large mw pah with higher dbe o c 0 63 and aimod 0 78 participated in the reaction as key precursors and medium mw huph with lower dbe o c 0 13 and aimod 0 20 were the dominant products table s4 fig s10 in addition pah in the precursors had lower o c and h c 0 16 vs 0 51 compared to that of huph in the products 0 57 vs 1 25 ozonation selectively transforms aromatic and unsaturated compounds into saturated alkylated compounds through electrophilic addition wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a among the precursors n containing compounds e g chon and chons compounds accounted for 77 6 and 73 3 of pah and polyph respectively in the products the proportions of n containing compounds in pah and polyph decreased to 21 3 and 6 5 respectively whereas cho compounds accounted for 81 5 and 76 3 of huph and aliph respectively such transformation from heteroatom containing compounds to cho compounds was caused by cn bond breakage by coagulation o3 cmf treatment yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2021a among the bac precursors the dominant huph was mainly composed of medium mw and cho type compounds and dbe o c and aimod were relatively low however the bac filter products were uniformly composed of pah polyph huph and aliph these products were mainly composed of large mw and n containing compounds and the o c of the products were lower than those of the precursors interestingly carbo contained 100 n containing compounds including chon and chons accounting for 68 8 and 31 2 respectively the results indicated that the bac filter effectively adsorbed the oxygen rich huph and the biofilm produced large mw and n containing soluble microbial products smp through metabolic effects such as amino sugars zheng et al 2018 and nitrogenous disinfection by product precursors chu et al 2015 to better visualize the specific and systematic differences in dom quality 808 molecules present in the raw water coagulation o3 cmf effluent and bac effluent fig s14 as well as breaking down to cho chon and chos categories were analyzed via inter sample ranking analysis and the results are shown in figs s15 s17 and table s6 the different and partially common presence of molecules at the three sampling points are presented in figs s18 and s19 respectively as shown in fig s14 approximately 80 of the molecules commonly present in raw water coagulation o3 cmf effluent and bac effluent are cho type and medium mw huph medium mw huph with oxygen deficient and aromatic characteristics ranked first and second in raw water respectively in contrast medium mw huph with oxygen rich and less aromatic characteristics ranked first and second in the coagulation o3 cmf effluent interestingly the distribution of molecules of rank 1 in the bac effluent was relatively uniform including both oxygen deficient and oxygen rich huph these results suggest that the oxygen addition reaction and destruction of unsaturated double bonds resulted in an increase in the oxygen content and decrease in the aromaticity of huph in the coagulation o3 cmf treatment effluent moreover the effective adsorption of oxygen rich huph compounds resulted in a uniform distribution of all huph in the bac effluent as for the inter sample ranking further visualized by breaking down to cho chon and chos compounds the proportion of the three categories was in the order of cho chos chon which indicated that the c s bond was more recalcitrant to the integrated coagulation o3 cmf bac treatment than the cn bond the changes in oxygen content aromaticity and mw of cho chon and chos compounds inter sample ranking analysis showed similar variation tendencies as the 808 common presence molecules in conclusion the coagulation o3 cmf unit transforms aromatic n containing and large mw pah into low aromatic cho type and medium mw huph the bac filter effectively removed the huph and produced a small amount of n containing and large mw compounds 3 3 4 possible reactions during pilot experiment the significant molecular level changes in dom indicated that numerous reactions occurred during the integrated coagulation o3 cmf bac process treatment linkage analysis based on 32 reactions was performed to determine the possible reactions including oxygen addition dealkylation decarboxylation deamination and desulfonation in the treatment of the coagulation o3 cmf unit and bac filter 4414 and 1179 precursor product pairs were found respectively in the coagulation o3 cmf unit 1219 precursors and 1700 products had linkage relationships among which one precursor had a linkage with a maximum of 21 products and one product was linked with a maximum of 18 precursors in the bac filter treatment 921 precursors and 184 products had linkage relationships among which one precursor had a linkage with a maximum of four products and one product was linked with a maximum of 30 precursors fig 7 shows that in the treatment of the coagulation o3 cmf unit oxygen addition was the dominant reaction type accounting for 39 5 of the total reactions which is consistent with the increase in o c in section 3 3 2 the addition of di oxygen 2o 17 8 was the main type of oxygen addition including methylation of carboxylic acid 2o 2h oxygen oxidation 2o and di hydroxylation h2o2 the remaining oxygen addition reactions include the addition of single oxygen o 13 0 and tri oxygen 3o 8 7 deamination was the second most dominant reaction type in the treatment of coagulation o3 cmf unit accounting for 18 3 of the total reactions which was consistent with the decrease in n containing compounds oxidation of tertiary amines 3 7 was the main deamination reaction zimmermann et al 2012 also reported that ozone mainly attacked the tertiary amino groups of tramadol dealkylation was the third most dominant reaction type accounting for 16 9 of all the reactions hübner et al 2015 also reported that dealkylation was the main reaction in the ozonation of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the bac filter treatment decarboxylation was the dominant reaction 25 4 followed by oxygen addition 23 5 and dealkylation 22 1 decarboxylation mainly occurs due to the metabolism of microorganisms and is widely considered to be an essential reaction for biological activities li et al 2012 dealkylation is a common step in dom removal by biological processes in aqueous systems ghosh and philip 2006 kendrick mass defect kmd analysis was applied to further visualize the changes in the characteristics between the precursor and product pairs in the kmd plot the precursors and products involved in the reactions are homologous compounds and are positioned on the same horizontal line to further understand the chemical characteristics of the precursor and product pairs with kmd values the relationship between kmd and dbe o c nosc o c and mass was studied figs s20 s25 three of the main reactions occurring in the coagulation o3 cmf unit which included kmd 3o kmd n 3h and kmd c3h4 and the bac filter which included kmd c2h2o2 kmd o and kmd c2h2 were systematically elucidated in the treatment of the coagulation o3 cmf unit the 3o reaction was responsible for the increase in o c and n 3h for the decrease in nosc the 3o and n 3h reactions form more products with higher saturation and c3h4 reaction forms smaller mw products for the bac filter treatment the c2h2o2 reaction was mainly responsible for the decrease in dbe o c nosc and o c whereas the o reaction was responsible for the increase in mw 3 4 correlation between aoc with different components the quantitative correlations between aoc and fluorescence components dom components mw distribution molecular characteristics elemental composition and fluorescence components were explored using pca fig 8 a and clustering correlation analysis fig 8b fig 8 a shows that pc1 and pc2 explained 65 1 and 34 9 of the total variance respectively the huph medium mw and cho type compounds were the key positive factors for aoc with correlation coefficients above 0 96 of these huph showed the best correlation with aoc correlation coefficient 0 99 p 0 001 tables s4 and s5 also show that huph was mainly composed of low aromatic medium mw and cho type compounds in contrast c1 c2 c3 pah polyph dbe o c aimod and large mw compounds showed a positive correlation with chon compounds but their correlation coefficients with aoc ranged from 0 03 to 0 53 generally the results indicated that the fluorescence components and pah have the characteristics of aromaticity large mw and n containing elements and could be potential aoc precursors while the low aromatic medium mw and cho type huph were found to be aoc candidates 4 conclusions this work is the first to implement an integrated pilot scale system combining the coagulation o3 cmf bac process in a continuous mode to optimize real drinking water treatment processes in this study the fate of dom was determined using various dom analyses such as aoc doc uv and eem parafac model for the first time ft icr ms was applied in an integrated process to provide more insightful information on dom transformation at the molecular level the correlation between aoc and the different classes of compounds was elucidated and the following conclusions were drawn 1 the pilot scale integrated process achieved good removal of doc suva254 codmn turbidity and color with a low ozone dosage 3 mg l and a short treatment train biostable finished water with a final aoc concentration of 30 2 45 4 µg l was obtained when the hrt of the bac filter was 45 min 2 the integrated process achieved satisfactory removal of fluorescence components i e c1 92 4 1 6 c2 92 2 1 4 and c3 76 4 5 6 the coagulation o3 cmf unit contributed 85 of the total removal of the fluorescence components and the bac filter was responsible for the stable removal of the fluorescence components 3 the coagulation o3 cmf unit transformed n containing pah with aromaticity and large mw into cho type huph with low aromaticity and medium mw which were further removed by bac filtration the smp released by the bac filter contained n containing compounds with a large mw the synergistic effect between the coagulation o3 cmf unit and bac filter on the removal of pah and huph was demonstrated at the molecular level 4 oxygen addition was the dominant reaction during the treatment of the coagulation o3 cmf unit followed by deamination and dealkylation decarboxylation was the dominant reaction in the bac filter followed by oxygen addition and dealkylation 5 aoc was found to be related to cho type huph with low aromaticity and medium mw additionally fluorescent components and n containing pah with aromaticity and large mw could be potential precursors of aoc this integrated process shows great potential for upgrading conventional drinking water treatment with technical and economic feasibility for providing biostable finished water however our study was conducted during the autumn and a one year long experiment is recommended to further validate the stability of this integrated

15654,the performance of an integrated process comprising coagulation ozonation and catalytic ceramic membrane filtration cmf followed by treatment with biological active carbon bac was evaluated in a pilot scale 96 m3 d experiment to understand the biostability and quality of the finished water the fate of dissolved organic matter dom at the molecular level was explored using fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms biostable finished water with an assimilable organic carbon aoc concentration of 30 2 45 4 µg l was obtained by the integrated process and the high hydraulic retention time hrt 45 min of the bac filter was necessary to provide biostable finished water the coagulation o3 cmf unit efficiently transformed nitrogen containing polyaromatic hydrocarbons pah with aromaticity and large molecular weight mw 500 1000 da into cho type highly unsaturated phenolic compounds huph with less aromaticity and medium mw 300 500 da which were effectively removed by subsequent bac filtering the main reaction was oxygen addition followed by deamination and dealkylation of the coagulation o3 cmf unit and decarboxylation of the bac filter principal component analysis revealed that n containing and large mw pah are potential aoc precursors and the chemical characteristics of cho type and medium mw huph make them aoc candidates

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with rapid societal development the demand for high quality drinking water has increased at present the main limitation of water for direct drinking is the risk of excessive bacteria wan et al 2022 the presence of pathogens e g vibrio cholerae legionella and helicobacter in tap water can cause intestinal diseases in humans fields et al 2002 lechevallier et al 1996 vital et al 2007 although disinfectants can diminish the bacterial activity of finished water residual disinfectants can be consumed due to pipeline corrosion and biofilms produced by insufficient disinfectants which lowers the biostability of drinking water distribution systems assimilable organic carbon aoc refers to the dissolved organic matter dom that is most easily assimilated by heterotrophic bacteria through metabolism gillespie et al 2014 and is widely considered to be the main factor supporting the growth of bacteria in the distribution system generally the biostability of drinking water requests a low level of aoc 50 μg l in the presence of disinfectant kooij 1992 lechevallier et al 1996 the removal efficiency of aoc by conventional drinking water treatment plants dwtps is less than 30 and the aoc concentration of finished water is greatly affected by the raw water quality liu et al 2002 park et al 2016 in a full scale dwtp advanced treatment processes comprising ozonation followed by a biological active carbon bac filter can remove 60 80 of aoc in the finished water chien et al 2007 xing et al 2018 however aoc still cannot stably meet the requirement of less than 50 μg l liao et al 2018 ozonation can transform aoc precursors to aoc at an early stage and these produced aoc can be effectively removed by subsequent bac filter avoiding the undesired formation of aoc caused by chlorination of the finished water li et al 2018 park et al 2016 therefore enhancing the transformation from aoc precursors to aoc during ozonation can greatly reduce the aoc formation potential during disinfection recently the integrated o3 ceramic membrane filtration cmf bac process has been investigated in pilot scale experiments for treating drinking water fan et al 2014 reclaimed water zhang et al 2020 municipal wastewater chen et al 2021 and petroleum wastewater hu et al 2020 ceramic membranes can catalyze ozone to produce free hydroxyl radicals increasing the efficiency of degrading refractory organic pollutants chen et al 2021 and in situ ozonation can significantly alleviate membrane fouling song et al 2017 the synergistic effect between o3 cmf and bac filter has been proved chen et al 2021 currently only 1 3 of the dwtps in china are equipped with advanced treatment processes wang et al 2021 as the large footprint and difficulty in in situ upgrading limit the application of advanced treatment technology the integrated o3 cmf bac process has the potential to increase the biostability of finished water and its practical application in advanced treatment however the concentration and composition of dom in source water can influence the effectiveness of physicochemical treatment processes and are directly associated with finished water quality maqbool et al 2020a understanding the impact of dom changes on aoc in the treatment of integrated o3 cmf bac process can help determine the feasibility of large scale applications dom is ubiquitous in source water and aoc can be derived from dom released by microbes such as phytoplankton cultures chen and wangersky 1996 aoc is a mixture of compounds such as identified biodegradable organic matter for example formaldehyde and formate however approximately half of aoc components are unrecognized compounds hammes et al 2006 such as biodegradable humic like substances terry and summers 2018 conventional dom characterization methods such as molecular weight mw distribution hem and efraimsen 2001 chemical fraction kim et al 2017 and ultraviolet uv fluorescence spectroscopy huang et al 2020 wang et al 2022 can only characterize dom from a certain aspect considering the microbial risks of aoc in drinking water it is important to obtain information at the molecular level to understand the role of different organic components in dom in the biostability of drinking water however this is beyond the scope of conventional analytical approaches for understanding dom transformation at the molecular level during treatment compared with conventional analytical approaches fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is a promising method to elucidate the fate of dom in drinking water huang et al 2020 lavonen et al 2015 secondary effluent maqbool et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a and leachate yuan et al 2017 to date few studies have reported the transformation of dom at the molecular level in an integrated coagulation o3 cmf bac process and its association with drinking water biostability kasuga et al 2020 this study investigated the performance and mechanism of the integrated process consisting of coagulation o3 cmf followed by a bac filter for the advanced treatment of drinking water the continuous effectiveness of the integrated process for 80 days was studied in a pilot scale experiment 96 m3 d the performance of organic pollutants and the removal of fluorescence components were studied the transformation of organics and reaction types in the integrated process were studied at the molecular level using ft icr ms the correlation between aoc and dom composition was comprehensively elucidated at the molecular level using ft icr ms this study provides a better understanding of the molecular transformation of dom during the treatment of the integrated process 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale experiment setup a pilot scale experiment was performed continuously for 80 d in a full scale dwtp located in dongguan city southern china water from the dongjiang river was used as raw water for the dwtp and pilot scale experiments the local dwtp used pre chlorination coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration as traditional treatments followed by ozonation and bac filtration as advanced treatments the general quality of the raw water is summarized in table s1 fig 1 shows that the integrated process consisted of a membrane tank with dimensions of 2 34 1 60 2 70 m3 l w h and a bac filtration column with dimensions of 0 65 0 60 2 70 m3 the catalytic ceramic membrane was composed of α al2o3 doped with mn2o3 with a 100 nm nominal pore size two membrane modules were installed in the membrane tank each module comprised 50 pieces of flat sheet ceramic membranes the size of each membrane was 1046 6 260 mm3 with a total filtration area of 50 m2 the bac filter was 2 0 m in size with an average particle size of 1 5 mm and the iodine adsorption value was 700 mg g raw water was first pumped into the storage tank 2 m3 then into the membrane tank and the liquid form of polymeric aluminum chloride pac 10 wt was injected through the pipeline mixer considering the removal efficiencies of aoc and dissolved organic carbon doc by coagulation and the economic cost of pac a dosage of 2 mg l was selected for the pilot study fig s1 ozone was generated by an ozone generator cf g 3 25 g guolin qingdao china and excess ozone was destroyed by an ozone destructor ct 100 guolin ozone was continuously aerated through a titanium oxide aeration rod placed at the bottom of the membrane module hydraulic retention time hrt refers to the retention time of the water in the bac filter calculated as the volume of bac divided by the flow rate of water which is a key parameter for the removal of aoc the membrane unit was automatically backwashed every 60 min for 1 min the backwashing flux was three times the filtration flux and the water in a clean water tank was used for backwashing in total there were three sampling points raw water s1 coagulation o3 cmf effluent s2 and bac effluent s3 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 general water quality parameters water samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm filter whatman uniflo usa before doc and uv254 measurements the concentration of doc was determined using a toc vcph shimadzu japan and uv254 was measured by ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis uv2600 shimadzu japan at a wavelength of 254 nm the concentrations of codmn and color were measured according to the chinese national environment protection agency standard china turbidity was measured using a turbidity analyzer tl2310 hach usa 2 2 2 aoc aoc was measured using the flow cytometer method developed by hammes and egli 2005 the aoc measurement procedures were as follows a 20 ml water sample was filtered through a 0 22 μm sterile filter whatman uniflo usa into 40 ml carbon free vials and was then pasteurized at 70 c for 60 min evian bottled water was used as the inoculum and the initial bacterial concentration was estimated to be approximately 1 104 cells ml the aoc vials were cultured in a bio incubator for 72 h at 30 c after 72 h of incubation 500 μl samples were stained with 5 μl sybr green 1 100 dilution in dmso molecular probes in the dark for 15 min cell counts were performed on a facscalibur bd flow cytometer the aoc concentration was obtained by dividing the cell count by the conversion factor which was 1 107 cells μg as follows hammes et al 2006 1 a o c c e l l s l 1 1 0 7 c e l l s μ g 2 2 3 fluorescence spectroscopy the excitation emission matrix eem was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy f 7000 hitachi japan using a four sided quartz cuvette the excitation ex and emission em wavelengths were 220 450 nm and 240 600 nm with wavelength steps of 5 nm and 1 nm respectively the scan slit and speed for ex and em were 5 nm and 30 000 nm min respectively a blank sample was obtained by measuring the eem of the milli q water the absorption value of uv254 was lower than 0 05 cm 1 for all samples which ensured the accurate detection of eem 2 2 4 parallel factor parafac analysis modeling parafac modeling was performed to identify and quantify the major fluorescence components in pilot scale experiments a total of 240 eem samples including raw water cmf effluent and bac effluent from the pilot experiments were analyzed for modeling parafac modeling was performed according to the tutorial of stedmon and bro 2008 and modeling was performed in matlab r2018b using the domfluor toolbox the maximum fluorescence intensity of each component was determined using fmax and was normalized using the raman integration method for mutual comparison 2 2 5 ft icr ms analysis the ft icr ms bruker solarix germany used for dom composition analysis was equipped with a 15 0 t superconducting magnet and an electrospray ionization esi source in negative mode bruker data analysis software was used to identify possible formulas the molecular formula calculation was based on the elemental combinations of 12c1 60 1h1 120 16o1 50 14n0 5 32s0 3 and peaks with a signal to noise s n ratio 5 were applied for calculation the solid phase extraction procedure and the parameters of ft icr ms are presented in text s1 the elemental formula assignments are presented in text s2 the relative intensities ris of each formula were used to calculate the weighted average value of all molecular level parameters according to the description by zhang et al 2021a the dom components were categorized into five classes based on the modified aromaticity index aimod and h c as follows kellerman et al 2014 ⅰ polyaromatic hydrocarbons pah 0 66 aimod ii polyphenols polyph 0 5 aimod 0 66 ⅲ highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds huph aimod 0 5 and h c 1 5 ⅳ aliphatic compounds aliph aimod 0 5 and 1 5 h c 2 0 and ⅴ carbohydrate compounds carbo 2 0 h c the compounds were divided into three molecular size fractions small mw compounds 300 da medium mw compounds 300 500 da and large mw compounds 500 da zhang et al 2021b in this study the raw water and effluent from each unit were from the same water matrix therefore the ris of non target screening detected compounds were used for semi quantification compounds whose ri decreased by more than 30 were termed precursors compounds whose ri increased by more than 30 were termed products and the remaining compounds with ri changes of less than 30 were termed resistants kasuga et al 2020 inter sample ranking analysis was applied to analyze the common presence of molecules in raw water coagulation o3 cmf effluent and bac effluent following the method described by zhang et al 2019 2 2 6 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was used to determine the significance of the differences in water quality under different conditions p value was obtained through anova and p 0 05 showed significant difference principal component analysis pca and clustering correlation analysis were applied to study the correlation between aoc and dom characteristics all statistical analyses were performed using origin 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the integrated process to explore the impacts of ozone dosage cmf flux and the hrt of bac on the performance of the integrated process four ozone dosages 0 2 3 and 5 mg l four membrane fluxes 60 80 100 and 120 l m2 h lmh and seven hrts 7 5 15 30 45 60 90 and 120 min were applied in the pilot scale experiment fig 2 a shows that the average concentrations of doc and aoc in the raw water were 2 7 0 3 mg l and 269 6 38 6 μg l respectively the removal efficiencies of doc and aoc by the coagulation o3 cmf unit increased from 32 9 3 3 to 40 9 4 3 and decreased from 12 6 2 8 to 42 2 5 8 respectively as the ozone dosage increased from 0 to 5 mg l at cmf flux of 80 lmh coagulation cmf treatment mainly removes doc and aoc precursors and a small amount of aoc can be removed simultaneously through separation following ozone addition the increase in the aoc concentration indicated the transformation of large mw organics into biodegradable organics by ozonation ceramic membranes catalyze the production of free hydroxyl radicals to mineralize aoc in membrane nanopores the synergistic effect of the coagulation o3 cmf unit slightly increased the aoc concentration by 40 which is much lower than the increase 100 300 caused by ozone alone reported in the literature hammes et al 2006 terry and summers 2018 there was no significant difference between 3 mg l and 5 mg l ozone dosages in relation to the removal of doc and aoc p 0 05 anova therefore 3 mg l was selected as the optimal ozone dosage to obtain the best economic benefit at an ozone dosage of 3 mg l as the cmf flux increased from 60 to 120 lmh the transmembrane pressure δtmp increased from 1 54 to 2 66 kpa and the removal of doc and aoc by the coagulation o3 cmf unit decreased from 40 5 4 1 to 27 7 3 3 and 37 3 3 1 to 42 8 4 6 respectively as there was no significant difference between the cmf fluxes of 60 and 80 lmh for the removal of doc and aoc p 0 05 anova membrane fouling could be controlled fig s7 to obtain a higher water production 80 lmh was selected as the optimal cmf flux in contrast fig 2 b shows that with an hrt of 15 min the aoc removal efficiency by the bac filter was 77 6 4 2 and when the hrt further increased to 45 min aoc removal efficiencies increased to 90 4 3 7 with an hrt of 45 min the aoc concentrations of bac effluent ranged from 30 2 to 45 4 μg l which indicated the biostability of the finished water aoc 50 μg l lechevallier et al 1991 van der kooij et al 1982 the highest aoc removal efficiency through the bac filter was achieved in the presence of ozone mainly due to the increased biodegradability of the coagulation o3 cmf effluent by ozonation park et al 2016 increasing the hrt of the bac filter to at least 45 min is necessary for the integrated process to provide finished water with high biostability thus the hrt of the pilot scale experiment was set at 45 min the integrated process also achieved satisfactory average removal for suva254 60 9 2 7 codmn 69 1 4 5 turbidity 98 0 1 0 and color 100 at the optimized condition tables s1 and s2 and figs s2 5 3 2 dynamic of fluorescence components in dom the fluorescence component assignments were determined based on the dom description in the literature maqbool et al 2020b component 1 c1 em ex 414 250 nm represents the fluorescence features of humic like substances with possible sources of terrestrial and microbial humic like substances that commonly exist in natural water bodies as shown in fig 3 components 2 c2 em ex 346 235 nm and 3 c3 em ex 318 295 nm represent protein like substances with specific features of tryptophan and tyrosine like fluorescence components respectively fig 4 shows that in the 80 days of operation the removal efficiencies of fluorescence components by coagulation o3 cmf unit were 70 5 19 1 c1 61 1 27 1 c2 and 58 1 15 3 c3 which were further enhanced to 87 3 7 6 c1 86 1 9 4 c2 and 73 3 7 0 c3 using the bac filter these results indicated that the coagulation o3 cmf unit played a major role 85 in the removal of fluorescence components with a cmf flux of 80 lmh the removal efficiencies of c1 c2 and c3 by coagulation o3 cmf unit increased with the ozone dosage the coagulation o3 cmf unit had a lower removal efficiency for c2 in the absence of ozone as tryptophan like components are mainly hydrophilic organics while the coagulation cmf unit mainly removes large mw and hydrophobic substances oloibiri et al 2017 however tryptophan like components have higher reactivity with ozone due to their high electron density mangalgiri et al 2017 in addition in the presence of ozone c2 was mainly removed by the coagulation o3 cmf unit while in the absence of ozone tryptophan was mainly removed by bac filtration bac can remove hydrophilic and small mw substances through physicochemical adsorption as well as through biodegradation by the growth of biofilm on the surface of carbon pramanik et al 2018 the removal efficiencies of fluorescence components by the integrated coagulation o3 cmf bac process were higher than those of coagulation ozonation or bac alone baghoth et al 2011 sanchez et al 2013 indicating that the integrated process has a synergistic effect the removal efficiencies for c1 92 4 1 6 c2 92 2 1 4 and c3 76 4 5 6 by the integrated process were obtained at an ozone dosage of 3 mg l and cmf flux of 80 lmh in summary the synergistic effect between coagulation o3 cmf unit and subsequent bac filter achieved a relatively stable and satisfactory removal of fluorescence components 3 3 molecular characterization of dom in integrated process 3 3 1 ft icr ms spectra of dom the ft icr ms spectra presented the mw distribution of dom in raw water coagulation o3 cmf effluent and bac filter effluent at an optimal ozone dosage of 3 mg l and a cmf flux of 80 lmh fig 5 the mw distribution of dom in the raw water ranged from 200 to 1000 da and dom peaks with higher ris were mainly located within the mw range of 500 900 da constituting 39 4 of the total ris of dom in the raw water the removal efficiency of the large mw compounds by the coagulation o3 cmf unit was 33 0 which was further enhanced to 70 1 after bac filtration the changes in the large mw compounds by the coagulation o3 cmf unit showed the same pattern as the decline in the fmax of the fluorescence components however the small and medium mw compounds in raw water increased by 16 0 and 24 5 after treatment with the coagulation o3 cmf unit respectively but decreased by 30 5 and 42 8 following bac respectively the changes in the small and medium mw compounds agreed with the aoc results a significant decrease in the average mw of dom was observed after the coagulation o3 cmf unit treatment 506 437 da table 1 one of the reasons for this could be that large mw organics were transformed into small mw organics through cc bond cleavage through ozonation chang et al 2014 another reason could be that large mw organics are more susceptible to coagulation cmf unit treatment than are small mw organics lavonen et al 2015 thus the coagulation o3 cmf unit transformed the large mw dom in the raw water into small mw compounds which finally became a part of the aoc in contrast the bac filter showed a relatively weaker effect on mw changes 437 416 da no compounds with mw 800 da were detected after bac filtration the ft icr ms spectra showed a significant difference between the coagulation o3 cmf unit and bac filter in terms of dom transformation the transformation process is described in detail in the following section 3 3 2 compositional changes in dom fig 6 shows that pah and huph were the two dominant classes constituting 18 3 and 62 3 of the total dom in the raw water respectively after treatment with the coagulation o3 cmf unit the proportion of pah decreased by 13 2 and huph increased by 15 6 however the proportion of huph decreased by 20 4 after the bac filter treatment the results showed that the coagulation o3 cmf unit selectively degraded pah whereas the bac filter was effective in removing huph compared to raw water the o c of the coagulation o3 cmf effluent increased by 9 9 from 0 45 to 0 49 whereas the h c increased by 10 8 from 1 09 to 1 21 the increase in o c may have been caused by the addition of oxygen and hydroxyl radicals with the production of carbonyl carboxyl and aldehyde groups and the addition of hydroxyl radicals caused an increase in h c remucal et al 2020 in contrast because organics with higher o c and lower h c usually contain more acidic functional groups such as carboxyl functional groups coagulation selectively destabilizes such organics based on the charge neutralization precipitation mechanism thereby resulting in lower o c and higher h c organics after coagulation treatment yuan et al 2017 however the net o c value increased after treatment with the coagulation o3 cmf unit indicating that the increase in o c and h c was the combined effect of ozonation and coagulation treatment and that oxygen addition through ozonation was the dominant reaction dbe o c represents the cc content in dom after treatment with the coagulation o3 cmf unit the dbe o c value changed from positive to negative and decreased by 155 1 followed by a slight increase of 15 7 after bac filtration the change in dbe o c was consistent with the suva254 pattern table s2 this indicated the transformation of unsaturated dom to saturated dom during the treatment of coagulation o3 cmf unit however bac was not effective in the degradation of aromatic compounds in contrast aimod decreased by 22 5 and 3 6 after treatment with the coagulation o3 cmf unit and bac filtration respectively suggesting that the aromatic moieties are more likely to be attacked by ozone and or hydroxyl radicals zhang et al 2021a the nosc decreased from 0 12 to 0 18 in coagulation o3 cmf effluent representing the selective removal of oxidized compounds zhang et al 2021b cho compounds 52 3 were dominant in raw water followed by chon compounds 23 3 and chos compounds 16 9 the distribution of cho compounds increased significantly from 52 3 to 71 5 after treatment with the coagulation o3 cmf unit while the proportions of chon chos and chons decreased from 23 3 16 9 and 7 5 to 14 2 13 0 and 1 3 respectively in general the coagulation o3 cmf unit played a major role in the structural and compositional changes in dom and the bac filter removed dom asymmetrically 3 3 3 precursors resistants and products of dom half of the dom 47 in the raw water behaved as precursors in the treatment of coagulation o3 cmf unit and the products had similar amounts of ris to the precursors but the number of product molecules was higher than that of the precursors precursors 2251 vs products 3598 table s3 and fig s9 the precursors in the bac filter treatment constituted half of the dom 48 9 in the coagulation o3 cmf effluent but the ris of the bac filter products were only 8 4 of those of the precursors among the precursors treated with the coagulation o3 cmf unit the distribution of different classes was huph 46 1 pah 33 5 polyph 12 8 the products of the coagulation o3 cmf unit mostly belonged to the huph class 79 2 with the proportion of other classes being less than 10 however the proportion of precursors was noticeably different for the bac filter treatment huph 75 6 aliph 9 3 polyph 8 1 the results indicated the transformation of pah to huph by treatment with the coagulation o3 cmf unit whereas the bac filter was effective for the removal of huph the changes in huph agreed with the aoc results to further understand the molecular characteristics of the precursors and products the five components were classified based on their chemical compositions as shown in tables s4 and s5 during treatment with the coagulation o3 cmf unit large mw pah with higher dbe o c 0 63 and aimod 0 78 participated in the reaction as key precursors and medium mw huph with lower dbe o c 0 13 and aimod 0 20 were the dominant products table s4 fig s10 in addition pah in the precursors had lower o c and h c 0 16 vs 0 51 compared to that of huph in the products 0 57 vs 1 25 ozonation selectively transforms aromatic and unsaturated compounds into saturated alkylated compounds through electrophilic addition wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a among the precursors n containing compounds e g chon and chons compounds accounted for 77 6 and 73 3 of pah and polyph respectively in the products the proportions of n containing compounds in pah and polyph decreased to 21 3 and 6 5 respectively whereas cho compounds accounted for 81 5 and 76 3 of huph and aliph respectively such transformation from heteroatom containing compounds to cho compounds was caused by cn bond breakage by coagulation o3 cmf treatment yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2021a among the bac precursors the dominant huph was mainly composed of medium mw and cho type compounds and dbe o c and aimod were relatively low however the bac filter products were uniformly composed of pah polyph huph and aliph these products were mainly composed of large mw and n containing compounds and the o c of the products were lower than those of the precursors interestingly carbo contained 100 n containing compounds including chon and chons accounting for 68 8 and 31 2 respectively the results indicated that the bac filter effectively adsorbed the oxygen rich huph and the biofilm produced large mw and n containing soluble microbial products smp through metabolic effects such as amino sugars zheng et al 2018 and nitrogenous disinfection by product precursors chu et al 2015 to better visualize the specific and systematic differences in dom quality 808 molecules present in the raw water coagulation o3 cmf effluent and bac effluent fig s14 as well as breaking down to cho chon and chos categories were analyzed via inter sample ranking analysis and the results are shown in figs s15 s17 and table s6 the different and partially common presence of molecules at the three sampling points are presented in figs s18 and s19 respectively as shown in fig s14 approximately 80 of the molecules commonly present in raw water coagulation o3 cmf effluent and bac effluent are cho type and medium mw huph medium mw huph with oxygen deficient and aromatic characteristics ranked first and second in raw water respectively in contrast medium mw huph with oxygen rich and less aromatic characteristics ranked first and second in the coagulation o3 cmf effluent interestingly the distribution of molecules of rank 1 in the bac effluent was relatively uniform including both oxygen deficient and oxygen rich huph these results suggest that the oxygen addition reaction and destruction of unsaturated double bonds resulted in an increase in the oxygen content and decrease in the aromaticity of huph in the coagulation o3 cmf treatment effluent moreover the effective adsorption of oxygen rich huph compounds resulted in a uniform distribution of all huph in the bac effluent as for the inter sample ranking further visualized by breaking down to cho chon and chos compounds the proportion of the three categories was in the order of cho chos chon which indicated that the c s bond was more recalcitrant to the integrated coagulation o3 cmf bac treatment than the cn bond the changes in oxygen content aromaticity and mw of cho chon and chos compounds inter sample ranking analysis showed similar variation tendencies as the 808 common presence molecules in conclusion the coagulation o3 cmf unit transforms aromatic n containing and large mw pah into low aromatic cho type and medium mw huph the bac filter effectively removed the huph and produced a small amount of n containing and large mw compounds 3 3 4 possible reactions during pilot experiment the significant molecular level changes in dom indicated that numerous reactions occurred during the integrated coagulation o3 cmf bac process treatment linkage analysis based on 32 reactions was performed to determine the possible reactions including oxygen addition dealkylation decarboxylation deamination and desulfonation in the treatment of the coagulation o3 cmf unit and bac filter 4414 and 1179 precursor product pairs were found respectively in the coagulation o3 cmf unit 1219 precursors and 1700 products had linkage relationships among which one precursor had a linkage with a maximum of 21 products and one product was linked with a maximum of 18 precursors in the bac filter treatment 921 precursors and 184 products had linkage relationships among which one precursor had a linkage with a maximum of four products and one product was linked with a maximum of 30 precursors fig 7 shows that in the treatment of the coagulation o3 cmf unit oxygen addition was the dominant reaction type accounting for 39 5 of the total reactions which is consistent with the increase in o c in section 3 3 2 the addition of di oxygen 2o 17 8 was the main type of oxygen addition including methylation of carboxylic acid 2o 2h oxygen oxidation 2o and di hydroxylation h2o2 the remaining oxygen addition reactions include the addition of single oxygen o 13 0 and tri oxygen 3o 8 7 deamination was the second most dominant reaction type in the treatment of coagulation o3 cmf unit accounting for 18 3 of the total reactions which was consistent with the decrease in n containing compounds oxidation of tertiary amines 3 7 was the main deamination reaction zimmermann et al 2012 also reported that ozone mainly attacked the tertiary amino groups of tramadol dealkylation was the third most dominant reaction type accounting for 16 9 of all the reactions hübner et al 2015 also reported that dealkylation was the main reaction in the ozonation of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the bac filter treatment decarboxylation was the dominant reaction 25 4 followed by oxygen addition 23 5 and dealkylation 22 1 decarboxylation mainly occurs due to the metabolism of microorganisms and is widely considered to be an essential reaction for biological activities li et al 2012 dealkylation is a common step in dom removal by biological processes in aqueous systems ghosh and philip 2006 kendrick mass defect kmd analysis was applied to further visualize the changes in the characteristics between the precursor and product pairs in the kmd plot the precursors and products involved in the reactions are homologous compounds and are positioned on the same horizontal line to further understand the chemical characteristics of the precursor and product pairs with kmd values the relationship between kmd and dbe o c nosc o c and mass was studied figs s20 s25 three of the main reactions occurring in the coagulation o3 cmf unit which included kmd 3o kmd n 3h and kmd c3h4 and the bac filter which included kmd c2h2o2 kmd o and kmd c2h2 were systematically elucidated in the treatment of the coagulation o3 cmf unit the 3o reaction was responsible for the increase in o c and n 3h for the decrease in nosc the 3o and n 3h reactions form more products with higher saturation and c3h4 reaction forms smaller mw products for the bac filter treatment the c2h2o2 reaction was mainly responsible for the decrease in dbe o c nosc and o c whereas the o reaction was responsible for the increase in mw 3 4 correlation between aoc with different components the quantitative correlations between aoc and fluorescence components dom components mw distribution molecular characteristics elemental composition and fluorescence components were explored using pca fig 8 a and clustering correlation analysis fig 8b fig 8 a shows that pc1 and pc2 explained 65 1 and 34 9 of the total variance respectively the huph medium mw and cho type compounds were the key positive factors for aoc with correlation coefficients above 0 96 of these huph showed the best correlation with aoc correlation coefficient 0 99 p 0 001 tables s4 and s5 also show that huph was mainly composed of low aromatic medium mw and cho type compounds in contrast c1 c2 c3 pah polyph dbe o c aimod and large mw compounds showed a positive correlation with chon compounds but their correlation coefficients with aoc ranged from 0 03 to 0 53 generally the results indicated that the fluorescence components and pah have the characteristics of aromaticity large mw and n containing elements and could be potential aoc precursors while the low aromatic medium mw and cho type huph were found to be aoc candidates 4 conclusions this work is the first to implement an integrated pilot scale system combining the coagulation o3 cmf bac process in a continuous mode to optimize real drinking water treatment processes in this study the fate of dom was determined using various dom analyses such as aoc doc uv and eem parafac model for the first time ft icr ms was applied in an integrated process to provide more insightful information on dom transformation at the molecular level the correlation between aoc and the different classes of compounds was elucidated and the following conclusions were drawn 1 the pilot scale integrated process achieved good removal of doc suva254 codmn turbidity and color with a low ozone dosage 3 mg l and a short treatment train biostable finished water with a final aoc concentration of 30 2 45 4 µg l was obtained when the hrt of the bac filter was 45 min 2 the integrated process achieved satisfactory removal of fluorescence components i e c1 92 4 1 6 c2 92 2 1 4 and c3 76 4 5 6 the coagulation o3 cmf unit contributed 85 of the total removal of the fluorescence components and the bac filter was responsible for the stable removal of the fluorescence components 3 the coagulation o3 cmf unit transformed n containing pah with aromaticity and large mw into cho type huph with low aromaticity and medium mw which were further removed by bac filtration the smp released by the bac filter contained n containing compounds with a large mw the synergistic effect between the coagulation o3 cmf unit and bac filter on the removal of pah and huph was demonstrated at the molecular level 4 oxygen addition was the dominant reaction during the treatment of the coagulation o3 cmf unit followed by deamination and dealkylation decarboxylation was the dominant reaction in the bac filter followed by oxygen addition and dealkylation 5 aoc was found to be related to cho type huph with low aromaticity and medium mw additionally fluorescent components and n containing pah with aromaticity and large mw could be potential precursors of aoc this integrated process shows great potential for upgrading conventional drinking water treatment with technical and economic feasibility for providing biostable finished water however our study was conducted during the autumn and a one year long experiment is recommended to further validate the stability of this integrated
