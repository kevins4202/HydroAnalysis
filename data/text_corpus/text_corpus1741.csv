8705,managing natural resource allocation and environmental externalities is a challenge institutional designs are central when improving water quality for downstream users for instance and when reallocating water quantities including for climate adaptation views differ on which institutions are best states markets or informal institutions for transfers of ecosystem services we compare informal trust based institutions to enforced contracts both being institutional types we observe commonly in the field the trust based institutions lack binding promises thus ecosystem services suppliers are unsure about the compensation they will receive for transferring services to users we employ decision experiments given the shortcomings of the alternative methods for empirical study of institutions as well as the limits on theoretical prediction about behaviors under trust in our bargaining game that decouples equity and efficiency we find that enforced contracts increased efficiency as well as all measures of equity this informs the design of institutions to manage transfers of ecosystem services as equity in surplus sharing is important in of itself and in permitting efficient allocation keywords bargaining trust contracts field experiment water natural resources jel classifiation c78 c93 q2 q25 1 introduction institutions to manage natural resources and environmental externalities greatly influence welfare institutions to manage water for instance are important within economic development climate adaptation and environmental quality not surprisingly then they are oft discussed 2 2 carbon emissions markets given regulations of global climate externalities may become the biggest in the world for natural resources impacts can be enormous from e g commercialization of energy stocks and minerals 28 or the securing of transferable land rights see e g 29 and 30 or 31 32 and 33 and varied forms of compensation have been heavily studied including pricing in efficient markets 3 3 34 review water pricing 35 residential water demand and 36 37 water quality and quantity such work is longstanding e g 38 consider alternative institutions for colorado river water 39 water values for pricing 40 compare pricing with urban infrastructure 41 assessed pricing and demand side management for agencies in california reallocation through compensated transfers has generated concerns about equity though based upon an apparent lack of trust in markets including their organizers 1 sometimes such concerns are expressed in proposals not to allow trading in allocation processes for water e g 2 document a global tendency to prevent trading of water rights while 3 emphasize path dependent constraints upon water institutions and 4 stress difficulties faced by institutions in evolving towards trading sticking with water as the example in the american economic review s very first issue 5 notes ups and downs for each approach to water reallocations in the western u s including speculation and collapses resulting from market interactions around irrigation systems a century later 6 notes that neither have state interventions easily resolved all of the incentives issues within water allocation and reallocations per coman and others ostrom states that sometimes what works best is collective action for which the building up of trust is critical 7 highlights quite general gains from trust including efficiency with limited contracts we compare trust based institutions 4 4 per 42 willingness to take some risk on the expectation that the other will reciprocate to enforced contracts this has relevance for water quantity climate adaption and forest conservation for both water quality and climate mitigation given concerns about fairness we consider not only efficiency consequences but also equity we employ decision experiments due to the shortcomings of the alternative methods for empirically studying institutions 8 9 for all the institutional dimensions of interest the number of institutions that we can use to sort out their influences is relatively small thus comparisons among the limited number of observed institutions rarely are clean enough to estimate impacts on equity and efficiency for institutional changes such as enforcing contracts experiments offer institutional control even randomization plus payoffs to mimic incentives our novel experimental design decouples equity and efficiency unlike ultimatum games with unequal productivities in which high efficiency necessarily yields low equity 5 5 ultimatum proposers offers to split a fixed pot responders accept or reject the latter yielding zero for both 43 44 ref 45 reports mean offers of 30 40 with modal and median offers of 40 50 under 20 often is rejected 46 with unequal productivity high payoff proposers offer 50 and can encounter low acceptance if unequal productivity yields conflict about what is fair 47 trust games also fully decouple equity and efficiency 10 11 6 6 there the first mover decides whether to give up sure payoffs for a chance to gain more with a risk of gaining less the first mover must trust the more productive actor similar to the choice that our second movers make they could refuse the initial proposal to get a certain default or instead trust in later sharing in the original trust game design first movers send 50 65 of their initial endowment second movers reciprocate by sending between 30 and 40 of earnings depending on the conditions reviews in refs 10 48 and 42 in that game however the lower productivity actors initiate the interaction through the initial decision on how much to trust in reality higher productivity actors often initiate transfers of ecosystem services by offering to buy for instance in existing ecopayments programs downstream and state users with higher payoffs from nature s services have made offers to pay upstream suppliers to transfer ecoservices both parties can benefit as agreed prices will be above upstream opportunity costs yet equity tensions limit such efficient transfers aggregate efficiency involves moving resources from lower to higher productivity but whether that occurs depends on the surpluses for explicit transfers contracts how the contracts share surpluses is critical to their acceptance without contracts at least one of the parties involved is uncertain about gaining from exchange uncertainty about surplus sharing then limits efficient and even equitable transactions it can exist at either end of a canal watershed or other axis of trading in group assurance it exists for both groups ecopayments in mexico in ref 12 while other analyses 13 14 focus on whether downstream users trust upstream suppliers to take costly actions to raise water services downstream being unable by design to compel any behaviors downstream users cannot compel costly upstream supply in our bargaining game either yet they do request offer to pay for and verify transfers of ecosystem services they promise to more than compensate the upstream cost of supply in order to generate surplus upstream as well our core question is whether upstream trusts those promises of compensation from downstream as an example if water is transferred to downstream users upstream suppliers without contracts worry that surpluses will not be shared another example is when national actors receive carbon based financial transfers from global climate services users while local conservation of forest is not always compensated broadly when states plus downstream cities push land uses upstream a supplier s net returns can be uncertain 15 17 we believe there are many settings in which ecosystem service transfers between parties involve the issues we highlight above for example upstream deforestation in mexico muñoz piña et al 2008 61 affects primary forest with high biodiversity carbon storage and perceived impacts downstream disadvantaged rural populations imply tensions between agriculture and conservation thus ecopayments may balance environmental and social goals better than protected areas in 2003 conafor the forest agency started a national ecopayments program to improve water quality and increase water flows via conservation and reduce upstream poverty 18 in sites deemed to be important for ecoservices it offers payments conditional upon actions believed to raise flows of services e g fencing preventing illegal logging collecting garbage firebreaks water infiltration ditches retention walls to prevent soil erosion a sub program was started in 2008 to facilitate local agreements between downstream users and upstream land owners such local programs have advantages see ref 19 yet the ends of the watershed need to trust each other see ref 12 for downstream users to invest in an institution and pay they need to be confident that upstream suppliers will provide services for upstream suppliers to build that institution and supply they need to be confident of payments we reflect these issues our novel design also is relevant for natural resource reallocations driven by shifts in the climate societal demand or infrastructure in the jaguaribe metropolitan hydrosystem in ceará 7 7 this is the location of our experiments as we intentionally selected locations at both ends of the large new canal our experiments probably are best described as a form of artefactual experiments selecting from among the four options within 49 typology mainly students plus generic framing lab field populations with generic framing artefactual or for us lab in field noting that most participants at our two sites are students field populations with realistic framing framed and actual intervention in relevant field populations natural in northeast brazil a canal from the agricultural jaguaribe valley runs to the capital fortaleza where water earns more in industry and tourism than it would in agriculture we have observed that no explicit process determines water transfers via or compensation while local institutional history suggests participatory bargaining 20 no explicit public commitments exist to provide water although in 2001 some farmers were compensated for agreeing not to farm during the dry season quite explicit in contrast is the propaganda stating that everybody in this region would benefit from water transfers to the city via the new canal the resulting rise in total output and tax revenue might lead to more investment by the state in rural development yet without a contract those who cede water via the canal have to trust that propaganda enforced contracts for water transfers do not exist in ceará still as they are an obvious policy option inequities due to water markets contracts are stressed by the catholic church 21 22 given equity tensions contracts that explicitly share surplus could reduce concerns about transfers and thereby raise transfers and efficiency aggregate earnings contracts also could raise equity as explicit statements about sharing can be evaluated ex ante and enforced ex post contracts actual impacts relative to trust however depend greatly on the behaviors under trust our experiments add a step to a bargaining game in order to permit sharing of surpluses surplus is generated by transfers of ecosystem services since the actors differ in their resource productivities for example water is transferred from rural agriculture to more profitable urban industry or cleaner land use upstream has a cost but that is below urban water quality benefits within a bargaining setting each side likely expects to get surplus as transfers must be agreed nobody dictates resource allocations in reality due to legal restrictions or capacities to protest we test three institutions two require trust but one does not both types being common in the set of observed institutions in trust a downstream proposer s sharing intentions are not made explicit thus upstream responders accept based solely on downstream resource requests in message a written message also states the surplus to be shared later if a responder accepts that promise is not enforced in our contract institution the additional message is enforced proposers make requests requiring trust while responders do trust both aiding efficiency breaking new ground we find contracts raise efficiency for two reasons first they require a promise we find that in some conditions any promise raises transfers of services second the promises are binding responders can believe them raising their impacts on transfers even if greater inequality in payoffs stokes equity concerns we also find that contracts increase equity metrics relative to trust based institutions earnings for responders i e lower payoff upstream suppliers rise with enforced contracts as does their lower share of earnings the frequency of relatively equal earnings rises too while the fraction of relatively exploited responders falls below section 2 describes our experimental sample as well as our experimental design section 3 defines efficiency and equity outcomes and then offers hypotheses for the impacts of our treatments next section 4 presents our results while section 5 discusses their implications 2 sample design 2 1 experimental sample experiments were conducted in fortaleza fza which is the capital city of ceará state as well as in the jaguaribe valley in the city of limoeiro do norte ldn with 570 participants in total 302 fza 268 ldn most 94 of the participants were students though the pool did feature one dimension of diversity in that the students were from rural farming families in ldn but in contrast from a very urban setting in fza the pool also featured a few university staff some officers from public institutions and in ldn also a few farmers table 1 summarizes the participants characteristics overall and by location all the experiments were conducted in rooms provided by local universities while all the recruitment was done entirely by local contacts who widely advertised the experiments within these two areas most sessions had between 20 and 30 participants with a few under 20 the same researchers facilitated all sessions in both locations 2 2 experimental design our design builds upon the ultimatum game with different earnings per unit of resource yet our novel design adds a final surplus sharing step in order to decouple equity from efficiency in ultimatum one actor offers a split of resources the other accepts it implementing that split or rejects yielding default payoffs in our design after acceptance the more productive actor who proposed the split has the choice to send back some of the surplus that has been created two randomly paired participants with randomly assigned roles allocate resources a bag of 10 chips given randomly assigned relative productivity p no matter p a responder s chips are worth 1 proposers though earn 2 per chip in the 2 1 p 2 sessions or 4 in the 4 1 p 4 our design has three steps 1 downstream proposers i e users who earn more per unit set the agenda by requesting an amount from the total resources 2 responders i e upstream suppliers of natural resource or environmental services either accept that split or reject it with the latter yielding r5 for each and 3 if an upstream responders accepts the proposer decides whether to send back some earnings 0 given that surplus has been generated via acceptance efficiency requires that proposers get all the resources in 1 and 2 before the sharing in 3 we study three behaviors first is the request r to split the resources r units go to the proposer with 10 r for the responder second is the responder s acceptance of a request a 1 or rejection a 0 finally if a 1 we observe the proposer s decision on surplus to share s the responder earns 1 a 5 a 10 r s while the proposer will earn 1 a 5 a r p s we compare the behaviors and consequent outcomes across three institutions that were randomly assigned across sessions in trust the downstream proposers sharing intentions are not explicit upstream responders accept or not based on the users resource requests within 1 in message a written message also states the surplus to be shared in 3 if a responder accepts that promise is not enforced in our contract institution that additional message is enforced each treatment was carried out in each site fza ldn and for each of the values of p 2 4 in each session after instructions we checked understanding with a quiz and clarified all identified confusions responders then went to a separate room each subject participated in two one shot games we report on those played first as the others explored designs not linked to this paper proposers learned the responder decisions at the end of the second game identities were hidden throughout at the end of each session participants did a risky choice exercise 8 8 our risk aversion measure is from a risky choice task like the one designed by ref 50 at the end of the experiment each participant chose between a which yielded r 10 for sure and b a lottery with a 10 chance of r 0 a 20 chance of r 5 a 40 chance of r 10 a 20 chance of r 15 and a 10 chance of r 20 note that b s expected value equals a s we randomly selected one person and paid out according to her decisions as well as a survey to provide socioeconomic information one game was chosen at random to determine payments that we made in accordance with those decisions average earnings were r 10 5 with a maximum of r 40 plus a show up fee of r 10 to cover costs of transportation to the sessions our experiments were framed neutrally which was a conscious choice given tensions concerning water allocation in many regions we wanted to focus on incentives and trust issues also given many types of resources for which contracts are relevant we wanted general results finally we note that while framing could make a big difference within our pilot tests it did not 3 core outcomes hypotheses 3 1 defining efficiency equity we define efficiency e and fairness f ratios as functions of the behaviors r request a acceptance and s sharing given p the productivity ratio we ask what e and f differences are expected across treatments leading us to predict how the behaviors vary across institutions 3 1 1 efficiency ratio we define efficiency based on realized total earnings t 1 a 10 a r p 10 r to compare across productivity ratios we divide by maximum possible earnings 10p to get our efficiency ratio e t 10p this metric reflects the outcomes of both acceptances and rejections maximum efficiency e 1 requires accepting r 10 i e all chips to the more productive actor that does not constrain sharing s which does not affect efficiency yet a critical tension arises immediately because higher requests r raise efficiency but make acceptances less likely at least if sharing is uncertain rejection yields 5 earned each or 10 total far less efficient than 10 p efficiency e determinants r a and p are the same as in asymmetric productivity ug there though efficiency implies maximum inequity in our game in contrast sharing s allows both actors to embrace efficient outcomes thus there is reason to expect efficiency in our game 3 1 2 fairness ratio we show results for many equity metrics including fraction of cases with equal earnings and the count of exploited responders some earn zero for our main equity metric we employ a fairness ratio f of responder s earnings 1 a 5 a 10 r s divided by proposer s earnings 1 a 5 a r p s f equals zero if a responder earns zero i e proposer requests all the chips then after acceptance shares zero efficiency would still be perfect e 1 f rarely exceeds one rejections yield equal earnings i e perfect fairness f 1 that clearly can motivate rejections not surprisingly the determinants of equity are the two transfers one in each direction the 1st is the concession of resources r to the more productive actor by an accepting responder and the 2nd is the sharing of surplus s from the more productive actor if any surplus is shared 3 2 institutional hypotheses we do not believe there are theoretical predictions for efficiency or equity for any pair of participants or even for the averages we expect significant preference heterogeneities among the individuals in their aversion to risk aversion to inequity and generally other regarding views we can though predict average differences in outcomes across randomly assigned institutions starting by predicting average differences in the key behaviors of interest across our treatments the key difference between our institutions is information responders have on proposers our three institutions offer proposers the same information about responders but not vice versa in our trust based institutions responders must form expectations about sharing s by proposers expectations surely will respond to requests r which can affect beliefs about proposers types surely they also might respond to sharing promises or messages m however that might not be the case in message where the promises are not binding i e messages could be lies in the sense that actual sharing could be less than was promised i e s m unlike in an enforced contract within our contract institution if a responder accepts she can be certain about sharing s m 3 2 1 acceptances our first hypothesis h1 is that in trust i e without any messages at all on sharing s acceptance should fall as the request r rises it is possible that a responder will read a high r as signaling higher sharing after acceptance however explicit sharing messages seem more likely to shape expectations of sharing in particular for contract where that message is binding thus our second hypothesis h2 is that for any request r acceptance should rise with message m because a message may be perceived as informative even when there is a chance that it is a lie 9 9 concerning written communication 51 report written promises raise cooperation to 12 30 in social dilemmas ref 52 find that free form promises raise trustworthy behavior ref 53 find that communications raise trust and in turn trustworthiness yet 54 in comparing enforced contracts with an unenforced bonus find lying for the latter enforcement helps ref 55 find agents are unhappy when not trusted yet respond to trust by not choosing high effort levels and our third h3 is that acceptance will rise with message m more in contract than message beyond one s expected earnings a different motivation for acceptance is a concern about fairness or equity for any given request r and sharing s equity is very likely to be lower for 4 1 than for 2 1 because the asymmetry in the earnings per unit of resources is even greater that can be addressed by a sharing message m in particular within an enforced contract thus our fourth hypothesis h4 is that for given request r and message m 4 1 will lower acceptance and our fifth hypothesis h5 is that relative to trust contract fares better in 4 1 than message 3 2 2 requests when considering whether to raise their requests and thereby their own earnings if a request is accepted proposers must keep in mind the effects of higher requests on acceptances thus we can generate hypotheses for the requests based upon our hypotheses about acceptances our sixth hypothesis h6 is that since messages are perceived as informative requests will rise with the message this is not a causal prediction but instead describes a proposer s strategy e g belief that if she sends a higher message m then her request r is more likely to be accepted further following the above our seventh hypothesis h7 is that requests are higher in contract 3 2 3 sharing the third behavior for which we have predictions is the sharing s after any acceptance again we do not have any basis for predicting the average level of sharing in any one institution however we can ask if sharing might be higher in message in which there is a sharing message although it is not binding and from prior studies we know that such messages could be lies thus while it could be that sharing e g as a fraction of requests will be higher in message we do not believe there is a clear hypothesis in contrast in our contract institution the sharing message not only is required up front i e is evaluated by the responder but also is binding thereby our eighth hypothesis h8 is that contract raises the amount of sharing s for any given request r relative to our trust institution which has no sharing message to be evaluated by the responders 3 2 4 efficiency acceptances raise efficiency in that they allow some growth relative to default payoffs which sum to the number of chips thus as per above the sharing messages m could help in efficiency relative to trust and confidence in the sharing message in contract could help more yet proposers may exploit the lower perceived uncertainty due to a message by asking for more i e higher r in message and contract that raises efficiency unless it lowers acceptance rates in particular in 4 1 if there are significant equity concerns which apply especially for message thus our ninth hypothesis h9 is that contract raises efficiency at least relative to trust and our tenth hypothesis h10 is that 4 1 will reduce efficiency less for contract than for message 3 2 5 equity greater sharing s for a given request r raises equity rejections raise equity too as in the default proposers and responders get the same earnings which otherwise is rarely achieved that equality of defaults has a particular equity implication in our game the very success of the contracts predicted above for raising efficiency via acceptance could push downward on equity countering the effect upon equity of another predicted success from contracts in raising sharing reasoning similarly albeit in reverse our message institution may lower equity if the existence of a promise raises acceptance but that is followed by actual sharing which is considerably lower than promised on the other hand if the risk of that outcome leads to rejections it raises equity in sum as noted above impacts of contracts versus trust depend on behaviors under trust should responders trust in message that would raise efficiency yet it could well reduce equity at some intermediate level of trust it could be that contracts would raise efficiency and equity 4 results table 2 presents descriptive statistics for all treatments and some particular subsets of the observations e g when all of the chips are requested which if accepted maximizes efficiency for a 2 1 productivity ratio we had 44 pairs in the trust treatment 42 in message treatment and 52 in contract treatment for a 4 1 ratio we had 44 49 and 54 pairs for those same treatments table 2 provides data for all observations in five columns to the left and for only all the accepted observations in six columns to the right columns present behavioral metrics relevant for efficiency equity or both below concerning all of the hypotheses h1 h10 laid out above we report table 2 s descriptive statistics and regression analyses from tables 3 5 table 3 reports logit and ols models for responder acceptances 1a 1b and proposer requests 2a 2b table 4 reports ols models for a sharing request ratio 1a 1b and responder earnings 2a 2b table 5 reports ols models for an efficiency indicator i e total over possible earnings 1 and an equity indicator i e responder over proposer earnings 2a 2c in all we have dummies for institutional and 4 1 productivity treatments plus controls for the participants characteristics 10 10 we also test for effects of site and non student participant we find no significant effects or shifts in other results 4 1 behaviors acceptances requests sharing 4 1 1 acceptances for h1 in trust acceptance will fall as requests rise averages by treatment in table 2 cannot say much table 3 model 1a though offers support in this model the omitted treatment is trust thereby the request coefficient provides the desired test it is negative and significant for h2 acceptance will rise with any message we can look at table 2 s column 1 at the differences in acceptance across the rows and in particular the upper rows since we consider 4 1 separately below for 2 1 it is clear that on average treatments with messages have higher rates of acceptance what table 2 cannot tell us is the role of the sizes of individuals requests that can be learned in table 3 in its model 1a we cannot control for the message s size as there are no messages in trust we can see that the interaction effects between the requests and the treatments that include messages are positive though and significantly so for contract moving to model 1b which also uses acceptances as dependent variable but considers solely the message and contract institutions with the former omitted the message called promise here to distinguish it from a message treatment has a positive and significant effect on acceptances that supports h2 further h3 acceptances will rise with the message more in contract than in message is clearly supported by a positive interaction of promise with the contract treatment for h4 given request and message 4 1 will lower acceptance we start with statistics from table 2 they are ambiguous as some treatments rise and some fall in acceptances for 4 1 table 3 is not ambiguous however lacking a message in trust responders clearly expect more sharing in 4 1 thus acceptances rise for a given request if there exists any sharing message m then effectively the offer we call it o equaling 10 r m has been offered to the responder once r and m are fixed and thus so is the offer o 4 1 lowers acceptance in model 1b where 4 1 is negative on average for treatments with messages versus the positive in 1a for trust within table 3 model 1a we can also see support for h5 contract fares better in 4 1 than does message in that the 4 1 interaction with contract is over twice as large and also is significant 4 1 2 requests for h6 proposers will raise the requests and messages together comparing table 2 s columns 2 and 3 supports this hypothesis based on average differences by treatment and subset further table 3 model 2b which uses requests as the dependent variable provides a direct test for the treatments that involve messages the coefficient on the promise is both significant and positive supporting h6 table 3 model 2b also supports h7 contract requests will be higher and thus the importance of binding promises that the proposers know the responders can believe table 3 s model 2a essentially blends h6 with h7 since the trust treatment is included so that the promise variable is dropped and thus its effects are included in the effects of the institutions 11 11 based on all our controls simply listed in table 3 the only significance is that risk averse proposers ask for less that is intuitive as is an additional small result that the contract treatment eliminates the effect of this characteristic from field experiments in peru 56 suggests trust in investment games measures propensity to gamble ref 57 report a positive correlation of risk attitudes with trust if a social value orientations measure 58 is neither strongly pro social nor strongly pro self ref 59 say participants are much more willing to take risk when the outcome is due to chance than when it depends on whether another player proves trustworthy ref 50 explore trust and risk and find that no risk measure correlates with trust subjects do not think of trust decisions and financial gambles as similar p 464 ref 60 find no link between individual risk aversion and the trust that is expressed by responders 4 1 3 sharing for h8 contract raises sharing relative to trust and message if messages are lies again we can start with the descriptive statistics within table 2 actual sharing is in column 8 for the accepted observations for 2 1 the sharing in message is just above the sharing in trust 2 84 versus 2 45 while sharing in contract 5 94 is about twice as high the promises in the written messages were not as different across institutions though as seen in column 7 which implies that written promises in message includes lies as seen in comparing columns 7 and 8 further this story holds for 4 1 sessions as seen in the same comparisons but for the lower rows we also find support for h8 in our regressions consider table 4 model 1a for 2 1 12 12 table 4 is for accepted offers only since responders accept then proposers share and pairs are randomly assigned accepted cases when sharing is observed do not imply bias for any given level of request proposers assigned to the types of responders willing to accept such a request should not differ from those proposers who were rejected with sharing per request as dependent variable model 1b is 4 1 insignificance in the top row shows no effect of message relative to trust while the second row conveys significantly higher sharing in contract these coefficients are increases in sharing to request ratios and are significant gains finally heading into equity table 4 s models 2a and 2b show that the sharing behaviors imply higher earnings in the contract treatment for the responders i e those who generally earn less 4 1 4 behaviors suggesting confusion in message and contract responders receive a sharing promise m and know what they are being offered 10 r m yet table 2 shows offers lower than the default that a responder earns by rejecting those low offers do not seem like rational behaviors on the part of proposers instead of arbitrarily dropping observations our tables feature results using all the observations but we check that the effects of dropping the few irrationally low offers were inconsequential 4 2 efficiency recall that our h9 was that contract will raise efficiency at least relative to trust while our last hypothesis h10 is that 4 1 p 4 will reduce efficiency less for contract than message both of these hypotheses are supported by the evidence within our statistics and our regressions 4 2 1 statistics with respect to efficiency particularly striking in table 2 and fully rational in contract are acceptances of requests for all 10 chips that is maximally efficient and occurs for contract more than for our trust based institutions as to why such requests can be acceptable table 2 s column 3 shows that promises for contract are higher also of course they are more credible table 2 s column 4 presents averages for our efficiency ratio e i e the total earnings divided by the maximum potential earning i e total earnings when a request for ten is accepted contract and message are similar in 2 1 p 0 22 13 13 if it is not noted otherwise all p values reported in this results section are from t tests of the equality of means some conclusions are consistent with such tests then supported by regressions while others require regressions with each of them being above trust p 0 00 noting that these tests are for the rows that make use of all of the observations in 4 1 message s efficiency is no longer above trust p 0 41 while contract is above them both p 0 04 in trust p 0 01 in message fig 1 shows full distributions for e for each institution blending 2 1 and 4 1 with some clear difference in the frequencies of the low efficiencies for instance contract has fewer observations than trust with e 0 5 16 versus 27 which is significant p 0 07 however it is the frequencies of the higher efficiency ratios that most separate these institutions for e above 0 66 or 0 75 or 0 90 contract s fraction of observations is significantly higher than both trust based institutions p 0 00 for five of the six comparisons p 0 02 for the other test 4 2 2 regressions table 5 s model 1 summarizes our main results for the impacts of institutional treatments on our efficiency ratio total over maximum possible earnings which is the dependent variable we note that sociodemographic characteristics of proposers and responders are not significant significant coefficients show impacts of message and contract relative to the trust institution the coefficient for message is positive and is significant consistent with table 2 thus even though the sharing promises in message are non binding still they may induce efficiency since responders may interpret them as informative and thereby increase efficient acceptance yet also consistent with table 2 the interaction of message with 4 1 is negative and significant thus there is an efficiency gain from message relative to trust for 2 1 yet no such gain for 4 1 this lower efficiency gain from non binding promises in 4 1 is consistent with equity concerns driving the lowered acceptance for any given request in table 3 which drives down efficiency the coefficient for contract also is positive and significant while its magnitude is below the effect for the message institution statistically they are not different at a 10 level p 0 77 the big difference between those institutions is in their interactions with a 4 1 productivity ratio for contract that is not significant thus binding promises in contracts always raise efficiency put another way that sharing is enforced in contracts appears to lower the concern about equity 4 3 equity recall that we did not have equity hypotheses we hypothesized and found that contract raises sharing per unit request that raises equity we also hypothesized and found that contract raises acceptance that increases efficiency but it reduces equity as rejections payoffs are equal putting these together we can still hypothesize that contract raises equity in the accepted cases 4 3 1 statistics table 2 s columns 5 and 9 shows a fairness ratio f with values in the 0 5 0 9 range for all observations in 5 and accepted observations in 9 noting that rejections raise fairness interpreting this fairness ratio f is easier given some benchmarks a 60 40 split of earnings as is typical of ug implies f 0 66 and splitting resources equally as is typical in asymmetric productivity ug yields fairness values inverse to productivity f 0 5 for 2 1 and 0 25 for 4 1 contracts raise the fairness f indicator overall and for accepted observations especially versus message in message some promises are lies m s which cannot happen in contracts comparing table 2 s top 2 1 and bottom 4 1 halves suggests that a 4 1 productivity lowers f the surplus sharing in the final step appears to rise less than proportionately with total earnings 4 3 1 1 equal and relatively equitable earnings another equity metric is how often the earnings are equal in table 2 within column 11 in all cases contract s fractions are clearly above e g the average of the trust based institutions for 2 1 or 4 1 contract s fraction of cases of equality is on the order of double the trust average table 2 also shows this equity result is robust within the set of cases of requests for all 10 chips thus equity is not explained by timidity of proposers efficiency and equity both can be maximal comparing trust with message on this metric for 2 1 messages yield only half as many cases of equality as in trust however in 4 1 trust s cases of equality fall to message s level p 0 78 less extreme metrics albeit still indicating the high end for equity also support contract as suggested visually in fig 2 contract has 56 of cases with f above two thirds and 45 above three quarters well above the trust based average of 44 having f above two thirds with 30 above three quarters two sample proportions tests find p 0 04 and p 0 01 respectively 4 3 1 2 zero and relatively inequitable earnings we also consider worst off responders for the trust and message institutions table 2 s column 10 reveals that some responders earned zero they let a proposer have all the resources then got zero funds back trust can be exploited in contract responder earnings are never lower than the default earned from rejection exploitation of trust is more than responders getting zero though for all cases 2 1 and 4 1 contract has 26 with f under one half and only 6 with f under one third well below the others average of 45 under one half and 21 under one third two sample proportions tests yield p 0 01 for under one half and p 0 00 for under one third exploitation of trust also is implied by lies in message a weakness of implicit contracts in more than forty percent of the observations in the message institution the sharing message is greater than the actual funds sharing and that holds for both the 2 1 and 4 1 productivity ratios further that is not just for larger requests lying occurs for almost every level of initial request 4 3 2 regressions table 5 s models 2a 2c summarize our results for the equity impacts of these institutions again controlling for proposers and responders characteristics that in general are not significant models 2a and 2b employ the same specification for accepted cases then for all observations contracts raise equity versus trust while messages might lower it the latter is not significant table 5 s model 2c is helpful to further consider message s effects upon equity in that it includes the treatments interacted with the productivity ratio that matters for message results 14 14 we suspect that with more data our contract institution would still have significant effects with the interactions and what the 2c coefficients suggest makes sense i e that binding promises can do better with more resources with limited observations estimating the interaction term raises standard errors with consequences for significance interactions for only accepted cases less data yield the same for messages and higher standard errors for contracts for 2 1 message does considerably worse for equity than does the trust institution non binding sharing promises which may well be lies apparently can lure responders into unrequited trust however an interaction term shows the difference for those treatments vanishes for the 4 1 case as to why 4 1 gets message s equity back in line with trust we find responder earnings rise in 4 1 in all treatments but less in trust further rejection for equity in 4 1 bolsters equity in message while lowering efficiency we emphasize higher equity in contract overall or for accepted cases contract message p 0 00 this indicates that uncertainty about sharing in trust based institutions leads responders to accept proposals they would reject if fully spelled out 5 discussion given significant debate on institutions for natural resource allocation and management of the environment and limits on the evidence from comparisons of observed institutions we examined efficiency and equity consequences of enforcing compensation promises in contracts for voluntary transfers of ecosystem services relative to the lack of binding promises under trust we used decision experiments in northeast brazil with populations at the ends of a large canal while trust outperforms neoclassical predictions for efficiency total earnings as expected we show efficiency is limited by concern about equity while enforced contracts improve them both contracts with binding compensation promises significantly raised all measures of equity that is because the participants trusted they took risks by making transfers that were efficient but created vulnerabilities under trust transfers to higher payoffs were not rewarded with much surplus thus contracts offered protection to upstream suppliers by enforcing promised sharing this adds to literature about natural resources and development 23 24 while providing a new game that extends ultimatum and trust games beyond specific contexts our results inform possible institutional adjustments for many transfers of ecosystem services which could support aggregate development yet are limited by equity concerns contracts as we model them describe regional or individual resource rights or instead slots in a resource queue 25 as 26 suggests local parties can contract creatively to reflect relevant all local knowledge that point can be applied globally for instance among a growing suite of ecopayments programs many involve quality and quantity dimensions of hydroservices that can be transferred downstream or not our results are relevant for water reallocations with varied motivations including adaptation to shifts in climate the basic logic of these contracts formal or informal very much fits what we have studied here upstream actors incur costs for various types of activities that improve on contracted dimensions generating benefit downstream that is greater than costs incurred to provide ecosystem services often it is high payoff actors downstream who initiate exchanges by requesting improvements e g suggesting transfers sometimes such suggestions are couched within power relationships economic political or violent that lower upstream returns or raise uncertainties about returns while not every setting is focused on upstream welfare results suggest that when contracting can make upstream surplus explicit and enforced more upstream actors will join in such programs broadening across topics voluntary exchanges involving upstream forest management can assist within climate mitigation this could be on top of local transfers e g in stacking if upstream land uses raise local water quality while lowering global emissions upstream suppliers can sell water and carbon to different markets receiving higher payment based on two sources 12 note that this can raise efficiency and environmental quality for ecopayments such links to the broader downstream exist for mexico 27 as federal actors have facilitated local actors interactions with carbon demand outside of mexico when upstream ecoservices suppliers interact with a powerful downstream user demand however it is not always clear that the interventions of federal actors help to raise local returns or lower their uncertainty within the brazilian amazon for instance smallholder uses of land in forests affect local water quality and global carbon storage the amazon fund with significant norwegian funding has offered a form of carbon transfer seemingly conditioned on forests yet national politics currently may not prioritize upstream gains from costly conservation actions yet past significant federal actions rewarded standing forest e g with credit availability while state programs such as bolsa floresta have engaged forest smallholders to maintain forest our results suggest that more clarity about local returns can raise equity plus efficient carbon storage our design could be extended bargaining often is characterized by repeated interactions which affect efficiency and equity due to punishment of prior unfair behavior although whether that leads to efficient cooperation remains an empirical matter our contracts also were costless and perfectly enforced the importance of institutions to manage resources and externalities and the significance of the challenges for establishing contracts in many relevant contexts including developing frontiers motivate both applications and various relevant extensions of these results funding this work received financial support from the center for research on environmental decisions cred a

appendix sample of instructions general we want to thank you all for accepting our invitation to participate in these research exercises before we begin i will give to each of you 10r to cover your transportation costs give now with that taken care of i d like to make some comments about what we will be doing today 15 15 these are instructions for the message treatment a 2 1 productivity ratio note that for the trust treatment the responders had to accept without any promise at all while in contract the responder knew promises were binding these exercises are part of a scientific research project conducted by brazilian and international researchers with international research funding and the support of both local and international universities we have three researchers helping with the exercises xxx our objective is to understand how people make decisions we will learn from what you decide please note that all of the decisions you make during these exercises and any other information you communicate to us will remain confidential the only people who will see that information are the project researchers and we will not divulge your individual information to anybody you could earn money how much depends on your decisions and also the decisions of others we do not know how much you will earn but it will be between r 5 and r 40 we pay you to make these exercises more like real situations in which your decisions earn or cost you money any money you win in these exercises is yours to keep nobody will know what you earned these exercises may be different from other exercises in which members of your community might have participated in the past therefore any comment that you might have heard about the exercises may well not be relevant to the exercises in which you will participate today we want to emphasize that your participation is voluntary you are free to leave at any time however to get paid you will need to stay until the end of the exercises today s exercises may take two to 3 h if you think you will not able to stay that long please let us know now again at any point you can choose to leave these exercises involve no risk to you they are likely to provide benefits specifically the earnings you can keep are you willing to participate if end up with an odd number of people randomly choose one to leave we will now explain you how to participate please pay a lot of attention to the instructions we will explain how your decisions affect what you earn if you understand the instructions you will be able to make better decisions during the exercises please remain seated and do not speak with other participants if you have a question raise your hand we will answer questions in private if anybody talks about the exercise with others in the group we won t be able to continue today please everybody be sure to follow this rule since is possible for one person to spoil the game moderator pause here and ask if that is clear you will each participate in 2 different exercises at the end of both exercises we will select one exercise and pay everybody what they earned based on their decisions in that exercise the exercise will be selected at the end by blindly choosing one of these envelopes in front of all the participants show two envelopes if number 1 is selected then exercise number 1 will determine your payments if number 2 is selected then exercise number 2 will determine your payments in each exercise you are matched with somebody to make a pair in each exercise we will randomly determine the pair your earnings will be affected only by you and other person in your pair you will not know who it is your pair the researchers do know but they will never tell anyone today we have xx pairs participating at the same time each pair is made up of a participant a and a participant b you will be the same type a or b in each exercise your type a or b will be determined by the letter you select from this envelope together with your type you will receive an identification number do type letter id number on the paper they select explain the papers now let me explain the first exercise the first exercise has 2 steps and the general idea is the following in the first step each pair has a bag of 10 chips participant a decides how many chips to ask for and offers what is left in the bag to participant b then participant b rejects or accepts this offer that completes the decisions in the first step if participant b rejected the offer then both participants get 5 reais each and the exercise is over in this case there won t be a second step at all if participant b accepted the offer then participant a gets the chips he asked for and participant b gets the rest of the chips in the bag in this case a second step takes place with another decision only by participant a if participant b accepted the offer a second step occurs and chips are converted to reais then participant a has to choose how many reais he wants to send to participant b from the reais that he earned from the division of the chips this could be some all or none of the reais earned from the chips received in the first step after participant a has made this decision the exercise is over participant b doesn t have to make a decision in the second step as i said before chips are converted to reais if the second step occurs importantly any chip will earn more for participant a than for participant b for participant a each chip is equivalent to 2 reais for participant b each chip is equivalent 1 real any questions now let me explain in detail the exercise i will start with the first step in the first step we will not use real chips but imagine a bag with chips like this one show bag w stuff the bag has 10 chips in the first step in each pair participant a must decide how many chips to ask for and offer what is left in the bag to participant b since the most possible chips in the bag are 10 participant a must ask for any whole number no lower than 0 and no higher than 10 a the same time with the offer participant a must send a message to participant b stating how many reais he is planning to send to participant b in the second step participant a could state that he will send some all or none of the reais earnings from the chips he received in the first step recall that any chip will earn more for participant a than for participant b for participant a each chip is equivalent to 2 reais for participant b each chip is equivalent 1 real however the transfer stated in the message won t be enforced that is participant a could change his mind in the second step without consequences to communicate his offer participant a will fill a format similar to this poster show poster and will make a circle around the offer for participant b in a sheet similar to this poster he will also fill a message format like this one image 1 remember that the message won t be enforced that is participant a could change his mind in the second step without consequences for example if participant a writes 2r in the message format participant a could choose in the second step to send the exact 2r more or less the final transfer will be subtracted from participant a earnings after participant a has made his decisions about what to ask for and what message to send about a future transfer participant b then accepts or rejects the bag minus what participant a asks for that is participant b must write an x in accept or reject to respond to for participant a s offer in a sheet similar to this poster sheets will be given to all participants b for example example 1 if participant a offers the bag minus 8 chips and send a message about a future transfer participant b decides if he wants to accept or reject this offer if accepts writes x in accept and if rejects writes an x in rejects if participant a offers the bag minus 3 chips and send a message about a future transfer participant b decides if he wants to accept or reject this offer if accepts writes x in accept and if rejects writes an x in rejects show table poster after all participant bs have made their decision for the first step we will check if the offer made by participant a was accepted or rejected by participant b if participant b rejected the offer made by participant a both participants get 5 reais each and the game is over if participant b accepted the offer then participant a will get the chips that he asked for and participant b will get the chips that remain in the bag in this case a second step takes place i will explain the second step in a moment but for now let me give you some examples for the first step given that the bag has 10 chips read poster and give copies of this participant a asks for 8 offering bag minus 8 to participant b participant b accepts the offer participant a gets 8 chips participant b gets 2 chips participant a asks for 8 offering bag minus 8 to participant b participant b rejects the offer thus both participants get 5 reais and the game is over participant a asks for 3 offering bag minus 3 to participant b participant b accepts the offer thus participant a gets 3 chips while participant b gets 7 participant a asks for 3 offering bag minus 3 to participant b participant b rejects the offer thus both participants get 5 reais and the game is over moderator give one table to each participant and explain how to read it recall together with the offer participant a will send a message to participant b stating how many reais he is planning to send in the second step participant a could state that he will send some all or none of the reais earnings from the chips he received in the first step however this message is not enforceable that is participant a could change his mind in the second step without consequences so in sum if participant b rejects both participants get 5 reais if participant b accepts this table shows the chips each participant will receive in the first step offer total chips 10 participant a participant b bag minus 10 10 chips 0 chips bag minus 9 9 chips 1 chips bag minus 8 8 chips 2 chips bag minus 7 7 chips 3 chips bag minus 6 6 chips 4 chips bag minus 5 5 chips 5 chips bag minus 4 4 chips 6 chips bag minus 3 3 chips 7 chips bag minus 2 2 chips 8 chips bag minus 1 1 chips 9 chips bag minus 0 0 chips 10 chips any questions recall a chip earns a different amount for participant a than for participant b for participant a each chip is equivalent to 2 reais for participant b each chip is equivalent to 1 real the tables that you are receiving now summarize the earnings for each participant before the second step moderator gives one earning table to each player participant a chips 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 reais 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 participant b chips 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 reais 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 now i will explain the second step where participant a has to make a final decision after the initial distribution of chips if participant b accepts the offer the second step starts after converting the chips into reais then participant a has the option to send to participant b some all or none of the reais earned from the chips received in the first step this decision will determine the final earnings if this exercise is selected to determine your payments this is money for you to keep and nobody else will know your earnings note that the message sent in the first step does not limit participant a s choice in the second step whatever the message was participant a could send that less or more to communicate his final decision participant a will fill a format similar to this poster show poster image 2 example 1 in the first step participant a asks for 8 offering bag minus 8 to participant b and sends a message that the transfer will be 4r participant b accepts the offer thus participant a gets 8 chips while participant b gets 2 in reais participant a earns r16 8 2 and participant b earns r2 2 1 then in the second step participant a has the option to send to participant b some all or none of the r16 earnings if participant a sent 4r to participant b then participant a finals earnings are 12 16 4 and participant b final earnings are 6 2 4 if participant a sent 0r to participant b then participant a finals earnings are 16 16 0 and participant b finals earnings are 2 2 0 if participant a sent 10r to participant b then participant a finals earnings are 6 16 10 and participant b finals earnings are 12 2 10 example 2 in the first step participant a asks for 8 offering bag minus 8 to participant b and sends a message that the transfer will be 3r participant b rejects the offer participant a and participant b get 5 reais and the exercise is over example 3 in the first step participant a asks for 3 offering bag minus 3 to participant b and sends a message that the transfer will be 3r participant b accepts the offer thus participant a gets 3 chips while participant b gets 7 in reais participant a earns r6 3 r2 participant b earns r7 7 r1 then in the second step participant a has the option to send to participant b some all or none of the r6 earnings if participant a sent 3r to participant b then participant a finals earnings are 3 6 3 and participant b finals earnings are 10 7 3 if participant a sent 0r to participant b then participant a finals earnings are 3 3 0 and participant b finals earnings are 7 7 0 note that the more chips participant a gets in the first step the bigger are the total earnings for the two participants summed together since the chips earn more reais for participant a however the final distribution of reais between participants a and b depends not only in the first step division of chips but also in the final transfer by participant a which could be some all or none of the reais that participant a received for his chips yet participant b accepts or rejects participant a s proposal to divide the chips knowing that the message sent in the first step does not limit participant a s choice in the second step whatever the message was participant a could send that less or more before we start we will like to make some questions to make sure everybody understood the exercise quiz moderator gives one to each participant in the first step participant a asks for 7 offering bag minus 7 to participant b and sends a message that the future transfer will be 2r participant b accepts that offer thus participant a gets chips while participant b gets in reais participant a earns r and participant b earns r in the second step participant a faces the decision about whether to send reais to participant b if participant a sent r2 to participant b then participant a finals earnings are r and participant b finals earnings are r in the first step participant a asks for 4 offering bag minus 4 to participant b and sends a message that the future transfer will be 1r participant b rejects that offer thus participants a and b both earn and now we are ready to start participant as will make the decision first so i will ask all the participant bs to go with xxx to the room next door please do no talk with other participants about the exercise participant a all of you are participant as each of you will be paired with a participant b who is in the room next door the pairs will be randomly selected you don t know who is your pair recall the bag has 10 chips and that each chip earns different amounts of reais for participant a and participant b for participant a each chip is equivalent to 2 reais for participant b each chip is equivalent to 1 real recall if participant b rejects the offer with the message you make in the first step both participants get 5 reais and the exercise is over if participant b accepts your offer then you will get the chips you asked for and participant b will get the chips that remain in the bag also if participant b accepts you offer you will have the option to send or not any positive amount in reais from your earnings to participant b in the second step whatever was the message that you sent to participant b in the first step you could send that less or more note that your decisions are final once you write them down no matter the participant b s decisions in the small form please write give form your identification number and also how many chips you are asking for in the big form please make a circle around the offer for participant b finally please fill the message format now we will ask for the participant bs decisions each participant b will blindly select one of these envelopes to determine the pair and will answer accordingly to your offer participant b all of you are participant bs each of you will be paired with a participant a who is in the room next door each participant a s offer is written on these envelopes there is one envelope here for each of you your pair will be determined by the envelope you will blindly select please choose one of these envelopes but do not open it yet recall the bag has 10 chips and that each chip earns different amounts of reais for participant a and participant b for participant a each chip is equivalent to 2 reais for participant b each chip is equivalent to 1 real recall if you reject the offer with the message made by participant a in the first step both participants get 5 reais if you accept the offer then participant a will get what he asked for and you will get the chips that remain in the bag after participant a learns your decisions if you accept the offer participant a has the option to send or not any positive amount in reais from his earnings to you in the second step whatever was the message that you sent to participant b in the first step you could send that less or more note that your decisions are final now please open the envelope in the big form write your identification number and an x in accept or reject for the participant a s offer participant a s offer has a circle around it then in the small form please write down your reais earnings and participant a s reais earnings for the first step after everybody finish now we will inform participant a of your decision please wait while participant a makes the decision for the second step go to the room with participant a after collecting third form and start second exercise participant a participant b made a decision by accepting or rejecting your offer please open your envelope and if participant b accepted the offer please decide if you want to send or not any positive amount in reais to participant b if participant b rejected the offer you don t have to make any decision 
8705,managing natural resource allocation and environmental externalities is a challenge institutional designs are central when improving water quality for downstream users for instance and when reallocating water quantities including for climate adaptation views differ on which institutions are best states markets or informal institutions for transfers of ecosystem services we compare informal trust based institutions to enforced contracts both being institutional types we observe commonly in the field the trust based institutions lack binding promises thus ecosystem services suppliers are unsure about the compensation they will receive for transferring services to users we employ decision experiments given the shortcomings of the alternative methods for empirical study of institutions as well as the limits on theoretical prediction about behaviors under trust in our bargaining game that decouples equity and efficiency we find that enforced contracts increased efficiency as well as all measures of equity this informs the design of institutions to manage transfers of ecosystem services as equity in surplus sharing is important in of itself and in permitting efficient allocation keywords bargaining trust contracts field experiment water natural resources jel classifiation c78 c93 q2 q25 1 introduction institutions to manage natural resources and environmental externalities greatly influence welfare institutions to manage water for instance are important within economic development climate adaptation and environmental quality not surprisingly then they are oft discussed 2 2 carbon emissions markets given regulations of global climate externalities may become the biggest in the world for natural resources impacts can be enormous from e g commercialization of energy stocks and minerals 28 or the securing of transferable land rights see e g 29 and 30 or 31 32 and 33 and varied forms of compensation have been heavily studied including

colorado river water 39 water values for pricing 40 compare pricing with urban infrastructure 41 assessed pricing and demand side management for agencies in california reallocation through compensated transfers has generated concerns about equity though based upon an apparent lack of trust in markets including their organizers 1 sometimes such concerns are expressed in proposals not to allow trading in allocation processes for water e g 2 document a global tendency to prevent trading of water rights while 3 emphasize path dependent constraints upon water institutions and 4 stress difficulties faced by institutions in evolving towards trading sticking with water as the example in the american economic review s very first issue 5 notes ups and downs for each approach to water reallocations in the western u s including speculation and collapses resulting from market interactions around irrigation systems a century later 6 notes that neither have state interventions easily resolved all of the incentives issues within water allocation and reallocations per coman and others ostrom states that sometimes what works best is collective action for which the building up of trust is critical 7 highlights quite general gains from trust including efficiency with limited contracts we compare trust based institutions 4 4 per 42 willingness to take some risk on the expectation that the other will reciprocate to enforced contracts this has relevance for water quantity climate adaption and forest conservation for both water quality and climate mitigation given concerns about fairness we consider not only efficiency consequences but also equity we employ decision experiments due to the shortcomings of the alternative methods for empirically studying institutions 8 9 for all the institutional dimensions of interest the number of institutions that we can use to sort out their influences is relatively small thus comparisons among the limited number of observed institutions rarely are clean enough to estimate impacts on equity and efficiency for institutional changes such as enforcing contracts experiments offer institutional control even randomization plus payoffs to mimic incentives our novel experimental design decouples equity and efficiency unlike ultimatum games with unequal productivities in which high efficiency necessarily yields low equity 5 5 ultimatum proposers offers to split a fixed pot responders accept or reject the latter yielding zero for both 43 44 ref 45 reports mean offers of 30 40 with modal and median offers of 40 50 under 20 often is rejected 46 with unequal productivity high payoff proposers offer 50 and can encounter low acceptance if unequal productivity yields conflict about what is fair 47 trust games also fully decouple equity and efficiency 10 11 6 6 there the first mover decides whether to give up sure payoffs for a chance to gain more with a risk of gaining less the first mover must trust the more productive actor similar to the choice that our second movers make they could refuse the initial proposal to get a certain default or instead trust in later sharing in the original trust game design first movers send 50 65 of their initial endowment second movers reciprocate by sending between 30 and 40 of earnings depending on the conditions reviews in refs 10 48 and 42 in that game however the lower productivity actors initiate the interaction through the initial decision on how much to trust in reality higher productivity actors often initiate transfers of ecosystem services by offering to buy for instance in existing ecopayments programs downstream and state users with higher payoffs from nature s services have made offers to pay upstream suppliers to transfer ecoservices both parties can benefit as agreed prices will be above upstream opportunity costs yet equity tensions limit such efficient transfers aggregate efficiency involves moving resources from lower to higher productivity but whether that occurs depends on the surpluses for explicit transfers contracts how the contracts share surpluses is critical to their acceptance without contracts at least one of the parties involved is uncertain about gaining from exchange uncertainty about surplus sharing then limits efficient and even equitable transactions it can exist at either end of a canal watershed or other axis of trading in group assurance it exists for both groups ecopayments in mexico in ref 12 while other analyses 13 14 focus on whether downstream users trust upstream suppliers to take costly actions to raise water services downstream being unable by design to compel any behaviors downstream users cannot compel costly upstream supply in our bargaining game either yet they do request offer to pay for and verify transfers of ecosystem services they promise to more than compensate the upstream cost of supply in order to generate surplus upstream as well our core question is whether upstream trusts those promises of compensation from downstream as an example if water is transferred to downstream users upstream suppliers without contracts worry that surpluses will not be shared another example is when national actors receive carbon based financial transfers from global climate services users while local conservation of forest is not always compensated broadly when states plus downstream cities push land uses upstream a supplier s net returns can be uncertain 15 17 we believe there are many settings in which ecosystem service transfers between parties involve the issues we highlight above for example upstream deforestation in mexico muñoz piña et al 2008 61 affects primary forest with high biodiversity carbon storage and perceived impacts downstream disadvantaged rural populations imply tensions between agriculture and conservation thus ecopayments may balance environmental and social goals better than protected areas in 2003 conafor the forest agency started a national ecopayments program to improve water quality and increase water flows via conservation and reduce upstream poverty 18 in sites deemed to be important for ecoservices it offers payments conditional upon actions believed to raise flows of services e g fencing preventing illegal logging collecting garbage firebreaks water infiltration ditches retention walls to prevent soil erosion a sub program was started in 2008 to facilitate local agreements between downstream users and upstream land owners such local programs have advantages see ref 19 yet the ends of the watershed need to trust each other see ref 12 for downstream users to invest in an institution and pay they need to be confident that upstream suppliers will provide services for upstream suppliers to build that institution and supply they need to be confident of payments we reflect these issues our novel design also is relevant for natural resource reallocations driven by shifts in the climate societal demand or infrastructure in the jaguaribe metropolitan hydrosystem in ceará 7 7 this is the location of our experiments as we intentionally selected locations at both ends of the large new canal our experiments probably are best described as a form of artefactual experiments selecting from among the four options within 49 typology mainly students plus generic framing lab field populations with generic framing artefactual or for us lab in field noting that most participants at our two sites are students field populations with realistic framing framed and actual intervention in relevant field populations natural in northeast brazil a canal from the agricultural jaguaribe valley runs to the capital fortaleza where water earns more in industry and tourism than it would in agriculture we have observed that no explicit process determines water transfers via or compensation while local institutional history suggests participatory bargaining 20 no explicit public commitments exist to provide water although in 2001 some farmers were compensated for agreeing not to farm during the dry season quite explicit in contrast is the propaganda stating that everybody in this region would benefit from water transfers to the city via the new canal the resulting rise in total output and tax revenue might lead to more investment by the state in rural development yet without a contract those who cede water via the canal have to trust that propaganda enforced contracts for water transfers do not exist in ceará still as they are an obvious policy option inequities due to water markets contracts are stressed by the catholic church 21 22 given equity tensions contracts that explicitly share surplus could reduce concerns about transfers and thereby raise transfers and efficiency aggregate earnings contracts also could raise equity as explicit statements about sharing can be evaluated ex ante and enforced ex post contracts actual impacts relative to trust however depend greatly on the behaviors under trust our experiments add a step to a bargaining game in order to permit sharing of surpluses surplus is generated by transfers of ecosystem services since the actors differ in their resource productivities for example water is transferred from rural agriculture to more profitable urban industry or cleaner land use upstream has a cost but that is below urban water quality benefits within a bargaining setting each side likely expects to get surplus as transfers must be agreed nobody dictates resource allocations in reality due to legal restrictions or capacities to protest we test three institutions two require trust but one does not both types being common in the set of observed institutions in trust a downstream proposer s sharing intentions are not made explicit thus upstream responders accept based solely on downstream resource requests in message a written message also states the surplus to be shared later if a responder accepts that promise is not enforced in our contract institution the additional message is enforced proposers make requests requiring trust while responders do trust both aiding efficiency breaking new ground we find contracts raise efficiency for two reasons first they require a promise we find that in some conditions any promise raises transfers of services second the promises are binding responders can believe them raising their impacts on transfers even if greater inequality in payoffs stokes equity concerns we also find that contracts increase equity metrics relative to trust based institutions earnings for responders i e lower payoff upstream suppliers rise with enforced contracts as does their lower share of earnings the frequency of relatively equal earnings rises too while the fraction of relatively exploited responders falls below section 2 describes our experimental sample as well as our experimental design section 3 defines efficiency and equity outcomes and then offers hypotheses for the impacts of our treatments next section 4 presents our results while section 5 discusses their implications 2 sample design 2 1 experimental sample experiments were conducted in fortaleza fza which is the capital city of ceará state as well as in the jaguaribe valley in the city of limoeiro do norte ldn with 570 participants in total 302 fza 268 ldn most 94 of the participants were students though the pool did feature one dimension of diversity in that the students were from rural farming families in ldn but in contrast from a very urban setting in fza the pool also featured a few university staff some officers from public institutions and in ldn also a few farmers table 1 summarizes the participants characteristics overall and by location all the experiments were conducted in rooms provided by local universities while all the recruitment was done entirely by local contacts who widely advertised the experiments within these two areas most sessions had between 20 and 30 participants with a few under 20 the same researchers facilitated all sessions in both locations 2 2 experimental design our design builds upon the ultimatum game with different earnings per unit of resource yet our novel design adds a final surplus sharing step in order to decouple equity from efficiency in ultimatum one actor offers a split of resources the other accepts it implementing that split or rejects yielding default payoffs in our design after acceptance the more productive actor who proposed the split has the choice to send back some of the surplus that has been created two randomly paired participants with randomly assigned roles allocate resources a bag of 10 chips given randomly assigned relative productivity p no matter p a responder s chips are worth 1 proposers though earn 2 per chip in the 2 1 p 2 sessions or 4 in the 4 1 p 4 our design has three steps 1 downstream proposers i e users who earn more per unit set the agenda by requesting an amount from the total resources 2 responders i e upstream suppliers of natural resource or environmental services either accept that split or reject it with the latter yielding r5 for each and 3 if an upstream responders accepts the proposer decides whether to send back some earnings 0 given that surplus has been generated via acceptance efficiency requires that proposers get all the resources in 1 and 2 before the sharing in 3 we study three behaviors first is the request r to split the resources r units go to the proposer with 10 r for the responder second is the responder s acceptance of a request a 1 or rejection a 0 finally if a 1 we observe the proposer s decision on surplus to share s the responder earns 1 a 5 a 10 r s while the proposer will earn 1 a 5 a r p s we compare the behaviors and consequent outcomes across three institutions that were randomly assigned across sessions in trust the downstream proposers sharing intentions are not explicit upstream responders accept or not based on the users resource requests within 1 in message a written message also states the surplus to be shared in 3 if a responder accepts that promise is not enforced in our contract institution that additional message is enforced each treatment was carried out in each site fza ldn and for each of the values of p 2 4 in each session after instructions we checked understanding with a quiz and clarified all identified confusions responders then went to a separate room each subject participated in two one shot games we report on those played first as the others explored designs not linked to this paper proposers learned the responder decisions at the end of the second game identities were hidden throughout at the end of each session participants did a risky choice exercise 8 8 our risk aversion measure is from a risky choice task like the one designed by ref 50 at the end of the experiment each participant chose between a which yielded r 10 for sure and b a lottery with a 10 chance of r 0 a 20 chance of r 5 a 40 chance of r 10 a 20 chance of r 15 and a 10 chance of r 20 note that b s expected value equals a s we randomly selected one person and paid out according to her decisions as well as a survey to provide socioeconomic information one game was chosen at random to determine payments that we made in accordance with those decisions average earnings were r 10 5 with a maximum of r 40 plus a show up fee of r 10 to cover costs of transportation to the sessions our experiments were framed neutrally which was a conscious choice given tensions concerning water allocation in many regions we wanted to focus on incentives and trust issues also given many types of resources for which contracts are relevant we wanted general results finally we note that while framing could make a big difference within our pilot tests it did not 3 core outcomes hypotheses 3 1 defining efficiency equity we define efficiency e and fairness f ratios as functions of the behaviors r request a acceptance and s sharing given p the productivity ratio we ask what e and f differences are expected across treatments leading us to predict how the behaviors vary across institutions 3 1 1 efficiency ratio we define efficiency based on realized total earnings t 1 a 10 a r p 10 r to compare across productivity ratios we divide by maximum possible earnings 10p to get our efficiency ratio e t 10p this metric reflects the outcomes of both acceptances and rejections maximum efficiency e 1 requires accepting r 10 i e all chips to the more productive actor that does not constrain sharing s which does not affect efficiency yet a critical tension arises immediately because higher requests r raise efficiency but make acceptances less likely at least if sharing is uncertain rejection yields 5 earned each or 10 total far less efficient than 10 p efficiency e determinants r a and p are the same as in asymmetric productivity ug there though efficiency implies maximum inequity in our game in contrast sharing s allows both actors to embrace efficient outcomes thus there is reason to expect efficiency in our game 3 1 2 fairness ratio we show results for many equity metrics including fraction of cases with equal earnings and the count of exploited responders some earn zero for our main equity metric we employ a fairness ratio f of responder s earnings 1 a 5 a 10 r s divided by proposer s earnings 1 a 5 a r p s f equals zero if a responder earns zero i e proposer requests all the chips then after acceptance shares zero efficiency would still be perfect e 1 f rarely exceeds one rejections yield equal earnings i e perfect fairness f 1 that clearly can motivate rejections not surprisingly the determinants of equity are the two transfers one in each direction the 1st is the concession of resources r to the more productive actor by an accepting responder and the 2nd is the sharing of surplus s from the more productive actor if any surplus is shared 3 2 institutional hypotheses we do not believe there are theoretical predictions for efficiency or equity for any pair of participants or even for the averages we expect significant preference heterogeneities among the individuals in their aversion to risk aversion to inequity and generally other regarding views we can though predict average differences in outcomes across randomly assigned institutions starting by predicting average differences in the key behaviors of interest across our treatments the key difference between our institutions is information responders have on proposers our three institutions offer proposers the same information about responders but not vice versa in our trust based institutions responders must form expectations about sharing s by proposers expectations surely will respond to requests r which can affect beliefs about proposers types surely they also might respond to sharing promises or messages m however that might not be the case in message where the promises are not binding i e messages could be lies in the sense that actual sharing could be less than was promised i e s m unlike in an enforced contract within our contract institution if a responder accepts she can be certain about sharing s m 3 2 1 acceptances our first hypothesis h1 is that in trust i e without any messages at all on sharing s acceptance should fall as the request r rises it is possible that a responder will read a high r as signaling higher sharing after acceptance however explicit sharing messages seem more likely to shape expectations of sharing in particular for contract where that message is binding thus our second hypothesis h2 is that for any request r acceptance should rise with message m because a message may be perceived as informative even when there is a chance that it is a lie 9 9 concerning written communication 51 report written promises raise cooperation to 12 30 in social dilemmas ref 52 find that free form promises raise trustworthy behavior ref 53 find that communications raise trust and in turn trustworthiness yet 54 in comparing enforced contracts with an unenforced bonus find lying for the latter enforcement helps ref 55 find agents are unhappy when not trusted yet respond to trust by not choosing high effort levels and our third h3 is that acceptance will rise with message m more in contract than message beyond one s expected earnings a different motivation for acceptance is a concern about fairness or equity for any given request r and sharing s equity is very likely to be lower for 4 1 than for 2 1 because the asymmetry in the earnings per unit of resources is even greater that can be addressed by a sharing message m in particular within an enforced contract thus our fourth hypothesis h4 is that for given request r and message m 4 1 will lower acceptance and our fifth hypothesis h5 is that relative to trust contract fares better in 4 1 than message 3 2 2 requests when considering whether to raise their requests and thereby their own earnings if a request is accepted proposers must keep in mind the effects of higher requests on acceptances thus we can generate hypotheses for the requests based upon our hypotheses about acceptances our sixth hypothesis h6 is that since messages are perceived as informative requests will rise with the message this is not a causal prediction but instead describes a proposer s strategy e g belief that if she sends a higher message m then her request r is more likely to be accepted further following the above our seventh hypothesis h7 is that requests are higher in contract 3 2 3 sharing the third behavior for which we have predictions is the sharing s after any acceptance again we do not have any basis for predicting the average level of sharing in any one institution however we can ask if sharing might be higher in message in which there is a sharing message although it is not binding and from prior studies we know that such messages could be lies thus while it could be that sharing e g as a fraction of requests will be higher in message we do not believe there is a clear hypothesis in contrast in our contract institution the sharing message not only is required up front i e is evaluated by the responder but also is binding thereby our eighth hypothesis h8 is that contract raises the amount of sharing s for any given request r relative to our trust institution which has no sharing message to be evaluated by the responders 3 2 4 efficiency acceptances raise efficiency in that they allow some growth relative to default payoffs which sum to the number of chips thus as per above the sharing messages m could help in efficiency relative to trust and confidence in the sharing message in contract could help more yet proposers may exploit the lower perceived uncertainty due to a message by asking for more i e higher r in message and contract that raises efficiency unless it lowers acceptance rates in particular in 4 1 if there are significant equity concerns which apply especially for message thus our ninth hypothesis h9 is that contract raises efficiency at least relative to trust and our tenth hypothesis h10 is that 4 1 will reduce efficiency less for contract than for message 3 2 5 equity greater sharing s for a given request r raises equity rejections raise equity too as in the default proposers and responders get the same earnings which otherwise is rarely achieved that equality of defaults has a particular equity implication in our game the very success of the contracts predicted above for raising efficiency via acceptance could push downward on equity countering the effect upon equity of another predicted success from contracts in raising sharing reasoning similarly albeit in reverse our message institution may lower equity if the existence of a promise raises acceptance but that is followed by actual sharing which is considerably lower than promised on the other hand if the risk of that outcome leads to rejections it raises equity in sum as noted above impacts of contracts versus trust depend on behaviors under trust should responders trust in message that would raise efficiency yet it could well reduce equity at some intermediate level of trust it could be that contracts would raise efficiency and equity 4 results table 2 presents descriptive statistics for all treatments and some particular subsets of the observations e g when all of the chips are requested which if accepted maximizes efficiency for a 2 1 productivity ratio we had 44 pairs in the trust treatment 42 in message treatment and 52 in contract treatment for a 4 1 ratio we had 44 49 and 54 pairs for those same treatments table 2 provides data for all observations in five columns to the left and for only all the accepted observations in six columns to the right columns present behavioral metrics relevant for efficiency equity or both below concerning all of the hypotheses h1 h10 laid out above we report table 2 s descriptive statistics and regression analyses from tables 3 5 table 3 reports logit and ols models for responder acceptances 1a 1b and proposer requests 2a 2b table 4 reports ols models for a sharing request ratio 1a 1b and responder earnings 2a 2b table 5 reports ols models for an efficiency indicator i e total over possible earnings 1 and an equity indicator i e responder over proposer earnings 2a 2c in all we have dummies for institutional and 4 1 productivity treatments plus controls for the participants characteristics 10 10 we also test for effects of site and non student participant we find no significant effects or shifts in other results 4 1 behaviors acceptances requests sharing 4 1 1 acceptances for h1 in trust acceptance will fall as requests rise averages by treatment in table 2 cannot say much table 3 model 1a though offers support in this model the omitted treatment is trust thereby the request coefficient provides the desired test it is negative and significant for h2 acceptance will rise with any message we can look at table 2 s column 1 at the differences in acceptance across the rows and in particular the upper rows since we consider 4 1 separately below for 2 1 it is clear that on average treatments with messages have higher rates of acceptance what table 2 cannot tell us is the role of the sizes of individuals requests that can be learned in table 3 in its model 1a we cannot control for the message s size as there are no messages in trust we can see that the interaction effects between the requests and the treatments that include messages are positive though and significantly so for contract moving to model 1b which also uses acceptances as dependent variable but considers solely the message and contract institutions with the former omitted the message called promise here to distinguish it from a message treatment has a positive and significant effect on acceptances that supports h2 further h3 acceptances will rise with the message more in contract than in message is clearly supported by a positive interaction of promise with the contract treatment for h4 given request and message 4 1 will lower acceptance we start with statistics from table 2 they are ambiguous as some treatments rise and some fall in acceptances for 4 1 table 3 is not ambiguous however lacking a message in trust responders clearly expect more sharing in 4 1 thus acceptances rise for a given request if there exists any sharing message m then effectively the offer we call it o equaling 10 r m has been offered to the responder once r and m are fixed and thus so is the offer o 4 1 lowers acceptance in model 1b where 4 1 is negative on average for treatments with messages versus the positive in 1a for trust within table 3 model 1a we can also see support for h5 contract fares better in 4 1 than does message in that the 4 1 interaction with contract is over twice as large and also is significant 4 1 2 requests for h6 proposers will raise the requests and messages together comparing table 2 s columns 2 and 3 supports this hypothesis based on average differences by treatment and subset further table 3 model 2b which uses requests as the dependent variable provides a direct test for the treatments that involve messages the coefficient on the promise is both significant and positive supporting h6 table 3 model 2b also supports h7 contract requests will be higher and thus the importance of binding promises that the proposers know the responders can believe table 3 s model 2a essentially blends h6 with h7 since the trust treatment is included so that the promise variable is dropped and thus its effects are included in the effects of the institutions 11 11 based on all our controls simply listed in table 3 the only significance is that risk averse proposers ask for less that is intuitive as is an additional small result that the contract treatment eliminates the effect of this characteristic from field experiments in peru 56 suggests trust in investment games measures propensity to gamble ref 57 report a positive correlation of risk attitudes with trust if a social value orientations measure 58 is neither strongly pro social nor strongly pro self ref 59 say participants are much more willing to take risk when the outcome is due to chance than when it depends on whether another player proves trustworthy ref 50 explore trust and risk and find that no risk measure correlates with trust subjects do not think of trust decisions and financial gambles as similar p 464 ref 60 find no link between individual risk aversion and the trust that is expressed by responders 4 1 3 sharing for h8 contract raises sharing relative to trust and message if messages are lies again we can start with the descriptive statistics within table 2 actual sharing is in column 8 for the accepted observations for 2 1 the sharing in message is just above the sharing in trust 2 84 versus 2 45 while sharing in contract 5 94 is about twice as high the promises in the written messages were not as different across institutions though as seen in column 7 which implies that written promises in message includes lies as seen in comparing columns 7 and 8 further this story holds for 4 1 sessions as seen in the same comparisons but for the lower rows we also find support for h8 in our regressions consider table 4 model 1a for 2 1 12 12 table 4 is for accepted offers only since responders accept then proposers share and pairs are randomly assigned accepted cases when sharing is observed do not imply bias for any given level of request proposers assigned to the types of responders willing to accept such a request should not differ from those proposers who were rejected with sharing per request as dependent variable model 1b is 4 1 insignificance in the top row shows no effect of message relative to trust while the second row conveys significantly higher sharing in contract these coefficients are increases in sharing to request ratios and are significant gains finally heading into equity table 4 s models 2a and 2b show that the sharing behaviors imply higher earnings in the contract treatment for the responders i e those who generally earn less 4 1 4 behaviors suggesting confusion in message and contract responders receive a sharing promise m and know what they are being offered 10 r m yet table 2 shows offers lower than the default that a responder earns by rejecting those low offers do not seem like rational behaviors on the part of proposers instead of arbitrarily dropping observations our tables feature results using all the observations but we check that the effects of dropping the few irrationally low offers were inconsequential 4 2 efficiency recall that our h9 was that contract will raise efficiency at least relative to trust while our last hypothesis h10 is that 4 1 p 4 will reduce efficiency less for contract than message both of these hypotheses are supported by the evidence within our statistics and our regressions 4 2 1 statistics with respect to efficiency particularly striking in table 2 and fully rational in contract are acceptances of requests for all 10 chips that is maximally efficient and occurs for contract more than for our trust based institutions as to why such requests can be acceptable table 2 s column 3 shows that promises for contract are higher also of course they are more credible table 2 s column 4 presents averages for our efficiency ratio e i e the total earnings divided by the maximum potential earning i e total earnings when a request for ten is accepted contract and message are similar in 2 1 p 0 22 13 13 if it is not noted otherwise all p values reported in this results section are from t tests of the equality of means some conclusions are consistent with such tests then supported by regressions while others require regressions with each of them being above trust p 0 00 noting that these tests are for the rows that make use of all of the observations in 4 1 message s efficiency is no longer above trust p 0 41 while contract is above them both p 0 04 in trust p 0 01 in message fig 1 shows full distributions for e for each institution blending 2 1 and 4 1 with some clear difference in the frequencies of the low efficiencies for instance contract has fewer observations than trust with e 0 5 16 versus 27 which is significant p 0 07 however it is the frequencies of the higher efficiency ratios that most separate these institutions for e above 0 66 or 0 75 or 0 90 contract s fraction of observations is significantly higher than both trust based institutions p 0 00 for five of the six comparisons p 0 02 for the other test 4 2 2 regressions table 5 s model 1 summarizes our main results for the impacts of institutional treatments on our efficiency ratio total over maximum possible earnings which is the dependent variable we note that sociodemographic characteristics of proposers and responders are not significant significant coefficients show impacts of message and contract relative to the trust institution the coefficient for message is positive and is significant consistent with table 2 thus even though the sharing promises in message are non binding still they may induce efficiency since responders may interpret them as informative and thereby increase efficient acceptance yet also consistent with table 2 the interaction of message with 4 1 is negative and significant thus there is an efficiency gain from message relative to trust for 2 1 yet no such gain for 4 1 this lower efficiency gain from non binding promises in 4 1 is consistent with equity concerns driving the lowered acceptance for any given request in table 3 which drives down efficiency the coefficient for contract also is positive and significant while its magnitude is below the effect for the message institution statistically they are not different at a 10 level p 0 77 the big difference between those institutions is in their interactions with a 4 1 productivity ratio for contract that is not significant thus binding promises in contracts always raise efficiency put another way that sharing is enforced in contracts appears to lower the concern about equity 4 3 equity recall that we did not have equity hypotheses we hypothesized and found that contract raises sharing per unit request that raises equity we also hypothesized and found that contract raises acceptance that increases efficiency but it reduces equity as rejections payoffs are equal putting these together we can still hypothesize that contract raises equity in the accepted cases 4 3 1 statistics table 2 s columns 5 and 9 shows a fairness ratio f with values in the 0 5 0 9 range for all observations in 5 and accepted observations in 9 noting that rejections raise fairness interpreting this fairness ratio f is easier given some benchmarks a 60 40 split of earnings as is typical of ug implies f 0 66 and splitting resources equally as is typical in asymmetric productivity ug yields fairness values inverse to productivity f 0 5 for 2 1 and 0 25 for 4 1 contracts raise the fairness f indicator overall and for accepted observations especially versus message in message some promises are lies m s which cannot happen in contracts comparing table 2 s top 2 1 and bottom 4 1 halves suggests that a 4 1 productivity lowers f the surplus sharing in the final step appears to rise less than proportionately with total earnings 4 3 1 1 equal and relatively equitable earnings another equity metric is how often the earnings are equal in table 2 within column 11 in all cases contract s fractions are clearly above e g the average of the trust based institutions for 2 1 or 4 1 contract s fraction of cases of equality is on the order of double the trust average table 2 also shows this equity result is robust within the set of cases of requests for all 10 chips thus equity is not explained by timidity of proposers efficiency and equity both can be maximal comparing trust with message on this metric for 2 1 messages yield only half as many cases of equality as in trust however in 4 1 trust s cases of equality fall to message s level p 0 78 less extreme metrics albeit still indicating the high end for equity also support contract as suggested visually in fig 2 contract has 56 of cases with f above two thirds and 45 above three quarters well above the trust based average of 44 having f above two thirds with 30 above three quarters two sample proportions tests find p 0 04 and p 0 01 respectively 4 3 1 2 zero and relatively inequitable earnings we also consider worst off responders for the trust and message institutions table 2 s column 10 reveals that some responders earned zero they let a proposer have all the resources then got zero funds back trust can be exploited in contract responder earnings are never lower than the default earned from rejection exploitation of trust is more than responders getting zero though for all cases 2 1 and 4 1 contract has 26 with f under one half and only 6 with f under one third well below the others average of 45 under one half and 21 under one third two sample proportions tests yield p 0 01 for under one half and p 0 00 for under one third exploitation of trust also is implied by lies in message a weakness of implicit contracts in more than forty percent of the observations in the message institution the sharing message is greater than the actual funds sharing and that holds for both the 2 1 and 4 1 productivity ratios further that is not just for larger requests lying occurs for almost every level of initial request 4 3 2 regressions table 5 s models 2a 2c summarize our results for the equity impacts of these institutions again controlling for proposers and responders characteristics that in general are not significant models 2a and 2b employ the same specification for accepted cases then for all observations contracts raise equity versus trust while messages might lower it the latter is not significant table 5 s model 2c is helpful to further consider message s effects upon equity in that it includes the treatments interacted with the productivity ratio that matters for message results 14 14 we suspect that with more data our contract institution would still have significant effects with the interactions and what the 2c coefficients suggest makes sense i e that binding promises can do better with more resources with limited observations estimating the interaction term raises standard errors with consequences for significance interactions for only accepted cases less data yield the same for messages and higher standard errors for contracts for 2 1 message does considerably worse for equity than does the trust institution non binding sharing promises which may well be lies apparently can lure responders into unrequited trust however an interaction term shows the difference for those treatments vanishes for the 4 1 case as to why 4 1 gets message s equity back in line with trust we find responder earnings rise in 4 1 in all treatments but less in trust further rejection for equity in 4 1 bolsters equity in message while lowering efficiency we emphasize higher equity in contract overall or for accepted cases contract message p 0 00 this indicates that uncertainty about sharing in trust based institutions leads responders to accept proposals they would reject if fully spelled out 5 discussion given significant debate on institutions for natural resource allocation and management of the environment and limits on the evidence from comparisons of observed institutions we examined efficiency and equity consequences of enforcing compensation promises in contracts for voluntary transfers of ecosystem services relative to the lack of binding promises under trust we used decision experiments in northeast brazil with populations at the ends of a large canal while trust outperforms neoclassical predictions for efficiency total earnings as expected we show efficiency is limited by concern about equity while enforced contracts improve them both contracts with binding compensation promises significantly raised all measures of equity that is because the participants trusted they took risks by making transfers that were efficient but created vulnerabilities under trust transfers to higher payoffs were not rewarded with much surplus thus contracts offered protection to upstream suppliers by enforcing promised sharing this adds to literature about natural resources and development 23 24 while providing a new game that extends ultimatum and trust games beyond specific contexts our results inform possible institutional adjustments for many transfers of ecosystem services which could support aggregate development yet are limited by equity concerns contracts as we model them describe regional or individual resource rights or instead slots in a resource queue 25 as 26 suggests local parties can contract creatively to reflect relevant all local knowledge that point can be applied globally for instance among a growing suite of ecopayments programs many involve quality and quantity dimensions of hydroservices that can be transferred downstream or not our results are relevant for water reallocations with varied motivations including adaptation to shifts in climate the basic logic of these contracts formal or informal very much fits what we have studied here upstream actors incur costs for various types of activities that improve on contracted dimensions generating benefit downstream that is greater than costs incurred to provide ecosystem services often it is high payoff actors downstream who initiate exchanges by requesting improvements e g suggesting transfers sometimes such suggestions are couched within power relationships economic political or violent that lower upstream returns or raise uncertainties about returns while not every setting is focused on upstream welfare results suggest that when contracting can make upstream surplus explicit and enforced more upstream actors will join in such programs broadening across topics voluntary exchanges involving upstream forest management can assist within climate mitigation this could be on top of local transfers e g in stacking if upstream land uses raise local water quality while lowering global emissions upstream suppliers can sell water and carbon to different markets receiving higher payment based on two sources 12 note that this can raise efficiency and environmental quality for ecopayments such links to the broader downstream exist for mexico 27 as federal actors have facilitated local actors interactions with carbon demand outside of mexico when upstream ecoservices suppliers interact with a powerful downstream user demand however it is not always clear that the interventions of federal actors help to raise local returns or lower their uncertainty within the brazilian amazon for instance smallholder uses of land in forests affect local water quality and global carbon storage the amazon fund with significant norwegian funding has offered a form of carbon transfer seemingly conditioned on forests yet national politics currently may not prioritize upstream gains from costly conservation actions yet past significant federal actions rewarded standing forest e g with credit availability while state programs such as bolsa floresta have engaged forest smallholders to maintain forest our results suggest that more clarity about local returns can raise equity plus efficient carbon storage our design could be extended bargaining often is characterized by repeated interactions which affect efficiency and equity due to punishment of prior unfair behavior although whether that leads to efficient cooperation remains an empirical matter our contracts also were costless and perfectly enforced the importance of institutions to manage resources and externalities and the significance of the challenges for establishing contracts in many relevant contexts including developing frontiers motivate both applications and various relevant extensions of these results funding this work received financial support from the center for research on environmental decisions cred a

related to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia component 1 appendix a supplementary data supplementary data related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j wre 2018 04 001 appendix sample of instructions general we want to thank you all for accepting our invitation to participate in these research exercises before we begin i will give to each of you 10r to cover your transportation costs give now with that taken care of i d like to make some comments about what we will be doing today 15 15 these are instructions for the message treatment a 2 1 productivity ratio note that for the trust treatment the responders had to accept without any promise at all while in contract the responder knew promises were binding these exercises are part of a scientific research project conducted by brazilian and international researchers with international research funding and the support of both local and international universities we have three researchers helping with the exercises xxx our objective is to understand how people make decisions we will learn from what you decide please note that all of the decisions you make during these exercises and any other information you communicate to us will remain confidential the only people who will see that information are the project researchers and we will not divulge your individual information to anybody you could earn money how much depends on your decisions and also the decisions of others we do not know how much you will earn but it will be between r 5 and r 40 we pay you to make these exercises more like real situations in which your decisions earn or cost you money any money you win in these exercises is yours to keep nobody will know what you earned these exercises may be different from other exercises in which members of your community might have participated in the past therefore any comment that you might have heard about the exercises may well not be relevant to the exercises in which you will participate today we want to emphasize that your participation is voluntary you are free to leave at any time however to get paid you will need to stay until the end of the exercises today s exercises may take two to 3 h if you think you will not able to stay that long please let us know now again at any point you can choose to leave these exercises involve no risk to you they are likely to provide benefits specifically the earnings you can keep are you willing to participate if end up with an odd number of people randomly choose one to leave we will now explain you how to participate please pay a lot of attention to the instructions we will explain how your decisions affect what you earn if you understand the instructions you will be able to make better decisions during the exercises please remain seated and do not speak with other participants if you have a question raise your hand we will answer questions in private if anybody talks about the exercise with others in the group we won t be able to continue today please everybody be sure to follow this rule since is possible for one person to spoil the game moderator pause here and ask if that is clear you will each participate in 2 different exercises at the end of both exercises we will select one exercise and pay everybody what they earned based on their decisions in that exercise the exercise will be selected at the end by blindly choosing one of these envelopes in front of all the participants show two envelopes if number 1 is selected then exercise number 1 will determine your payments if number 2 is selected then exercise number 2 will determine your payments in each exercise you are matched with somebody to make a pair in each exercise we will randomly determine the pair your earnings will be affected only by you and other person in your pair you will not know who it is your pair the researchers do know but they will never tell anyone today we have xx pairs participating at the same time each pair is made up of a participant a and a participant b you will be the same type a or b in each exercise your type a or b will be determined by the letter you select from this envelope together with your type you will receive an identification number do type letter id number on the paper they select explain the papers now let me explain the first exercise the first exercise has 2 steps and the general idea is the following in the first step each pair has a bag of 10 chips participant a decides how many chips to ask for and offers what is left in the bag to participant b then participant b rejects or accepts this offer that completes the decisions in the first step if participant b rejected the offer then both participants get 5 reais each and the exercise is over in this case there won t be a second step at all if participant b accepted the offer then participant a gets the chips he asked for and participant b gets the rest of the chips in the bag in this case a second step takes place with another decision only by participant a if participant b accepted the offer a second step occurs and chips are converted to reais then participant a has to choose how many reais he wants to send to participant b from the reais that he earned from the division of the chips this could be some all or none of the reais earned from the chips received in the first step after participant a has made this decision the exercise is over participant b doesn t have to make a decision in the second step as i said before chips are converted to reais if the second step occurs importantly any chip will earn more for participant a than for participant b for participant a each chip is equivalent to 2 reais for participant b each chip is equivalent 1 real any questions now let me explain in detail the exercise i will start with the first step in the first step we will not use real chips but imagine a bag with chips like this one show bag w stuff the bag has 10 chips in the first step in each pair participant a must decide how many chips to ask for and offer what is left in the bag to participant b since the most possible chips in the bag are 10 participant a must ask for any whole number no lower than 0 and no higher than 10 a the same time with the offer participant a must send a message to participant b stating how many reais he is planning to send to participant b in the second step participant a could state that he will send some all or none of the reais earnings from the chips he received in the first step recall that any chip will earn more for participant a than for participant b for participant a each chip is equivalent to 2 reais for participant b each chip is equivalent 1 real however the transfer stated in the message won t be enforced that is participant a could change his mind in the second step without consequences to communicate his offer participant a will fill a format similar to this poster show poster and will make a circle around the offer for participant b in a sheet similar to this poster he will also fill a message format like this one image 1 remember that the message won t be enforced that is participant a could change his mind in the second step without consequences for example if participant a writes 2r in the message format participant a could choose in the second step to send the exact 2r more or less the final transfer will be subtracted from participant a earnings after participant a has made his decisions about what to ask for and what message to send about a future transfer participant b then accepts or rejects the bag minus what participant a asks for that is participant b must write an x in accept or reject to respond to for participant a s offer in a sheet similar to this poster sheets will be given to all participants b for example example 1 if participant a offers the bag minus 8 chips and send a message about a future transfer participant b decides if he wants to accept or reject this offer if accepts writes x in accept and if rejects writes an x in rejects if participant a offers the bag minus 3 chips and send a message about a future transfer participant b decides if he wants to accept or reject this offer if accepts writes x in accept and if rejects writes an x in rejects show table poster after all participant bs have made their decision for the first step we will check if the offer made by participant a was accepted or rejected by participant b if participant b rejected the offer made by participant a both participants get 5 reais each and the game is over if participant b accepted the offer then participant a will get the chips that he asked for and participant b will get the chips that remain in the bag in this case a second step takes place i will explain the second step in a moment but for now let me give you some examples for the first step given that the bag has 10 chips read poster and give copies of this participant a asks for 8 offering bag minus 8 to participant b participant b accepts the offer participant a gets 8 chips participant b gets 2 chips participant a asks for 8 offering bag minus 8 to participant b participant b rejects the offer thus both participants get 5 reais and the game is over participant a asks for 3 offering bag minus 3 to participant b participant b accepts the offer thus participant a gets 3 chips while participant b gets 7 participant a asks for 3 offering bag minus 3 to participant b participant b rejects the offer thus both participants get 5 reais and the game is over moderator give one table to each participant and explain how to read it recall together with the offer participant a will send a message to participant b stating how many reais he is planning to send in the second step participant a could state that he will send some all or none of the reais earnings from the chips he received in the first step however this message is not enforceable that is participant a could change his mind in the second step without consequences so in sum if participant b rejects both participants get 5 reais if participant b accepts this table shows the chips each participant will receive in the first step offer total chips 10 participant a participant b bag minus 10 10 chips 0 chips bag minus 9 9 chips 1 chips bag minus 8 8 chips 2 chips bag minus 7 7 chips 3 chips bag minus 6 6 chips 4 chips bag minus 5 5 chips 5 chips bag minus 4 4 chips 6 chips bag minus 3 3 chips 7 chips bag minus 2 2 chips 8 chips bag minus 1 1 chips 9 chips bag minus 0 0 chips 10 chips any questions recall a chip earns a different amount for participant a than for participant b for participant a each chip is equivalent to 2 reais for participant b each chip is equivalent to 1 real the tables that you are receiving now summarize the earnings for each participant before the second step moderator gives one earning table to each player participant a chips 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 reais 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 participant b chips 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 reais 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 now i will explain the second step where participant a has to make a final decision after the initial distribution of chips if participant b accepts the offer the second step starts after converting the chips into reais then participant a has the option to send to participant b some all or none of the reais earned from the chips received in the first step this decision will determine the final earnings if this exercise is selected to determine your payments this is money for you to keep and nobody else will know your earnings note that the message sent in the first step does not limit participant a s choice in the second step whatever the message was participant a could send that less or more to communicate his final decision participant a will fill a format similar to this poster show poster image 2 example 1 in the first step participant a asks for 8 offering bag minus 8 to participant b and sends a message that the transfer will be 4r participant b accepts the offer thus participant a gets 8 chips while participant b gets 2 in reais participant a earns r16 8 2 and participant b earns r2 2 1 then in the second step participant a has the option to send to participant b some all or none of the r16 earnings if participant a sent 4r to participant b then participant a finals earnings are 12 16 4 and participant b final earnings are 6 2 4 if participant a sent 0r to participant b then participant a finals earnings are 16 16 0 and participant b finals earnings are 2 2 0 if participant a sent 10r to participant b then participant a finals earnings are 6 16 10 and participant b finals earnings are 12 2 10 example 2 in the first step participant a asks for 8 offering bag minus 8 to participant b and sends a message that the transfer will be 3r participant b rejects the offer participant a and participant b get 5 reais and the exercise is over example 3 in the first step participant a asks for 3 offering bag minus 3 to participant b and sends a message that the transfer will be 3r participant b accepts the offer thus participant a gets 3 chips while participant b gets 7 in reais participant a earns r6 3 r2 participant b earns r7 7 r1 then in the second step participant a has the option to send to participant b some all or none of the r6 earnings if participant a sent 3r to participant b then participant a finals earnings are 3 6 3 and participant b finals earnings are 10 7 3 if participant a sent 0r to participant b then participant a finals earnings are 3 3 0 and participant b finals earnings are 7 7 0 note that the more chips participant a gets in the first step the bigger are the total earnings for the two participants summed together since the chips earn more reais for participant a however the final distribution of reais between participants a and b depends not only in the first step division of chips but also in the final transfer by participant a which could be some all or none of the reais that participant a received for his chips yet participant b accepts or rejects participant a s proposal to divide the chips knowing that the message sent in the first step does not limit participant a s choice in the second step whatever the message was participant a could send that less or more before we start we will like to make some questions to make sure everybody understood the exercise quiz moderator gives one to each participant in the first step participant a asks for 7 offering bag minus 7 to participant b and sends a message that the future transfer will be 2r participant b accepts that offer thus participant a gets chips while participant b gets in reais participant a earns r and participant b earns r in the second step participant a faces the decision about whether to send reais to participant b if participant a sent r2 to participant b then participant a finals earnings are r and participant b finals earnings are r in the first step participant a asks for 4 offering bag minus 4 to participant b and sends a message that the future transfer will be 1r participant b rejects that offer thus participants a and b both earn and now we are ready to start participant as will make the decision first so i will ask all the participant bs to go with xxx to the room next door please do no talk with other participants about the exercise participant a all of you are participant as each of you will be paired with a participant b who is in the room next door the pairs will be randomly selected you don t know who is your pair recall the bag has 10 chips and that each chip earns different amounts of reais for participant a and participant b for participant a each chip is equivalent to 2 reais for participant b each chip is equivalent to 1 real recall if participant b rejects the offer with the message you make in the first step both participants get 5 reais and the exercise is over if participant b accepts your offer then you will get the chips you asked for and participant b will get the chips that remain in the bag also if participant b accepts you offer you will have the option to send or not any positive amount in reais from your earnings to participant b in the second step whatever was the message that you sent to participant b in the first step you could send that less or more note that your decisions are final once you write them down no matter the participant b s decisions in the small form please write give form your identification number and also how many chips you are asking for in the big form please make a circle around the offer for participant b finally please fill the message format now we will ask for the participant bs decisions each participant b will blindly select one of these envelopes to determine the pair and will answer accordingly to your offer participant b all of you are participant bs each of you will be paired with a participant a who is in the room next door each participant a s offer is written on these envelopes there is one envelope here for each of you your pair will be determined by the envelope you will blindly select please choose one of these envelopes but do not open it yet recall the bag has 10 chips and that each chip earns different amounts of reais for participant a and participant b for participant a each chip is equivalent to 2 reais for participant b each chip is equivalent to 1 real recall if you reject the offer with the message made by participant a in the first step both participants get 5 reais if you accept the offer then participant a will get what he asked for and you will get the chips that remain in the bag after participant a learns your decisions if you accept the offer participant a has the option to send or not any positive amount in reais from his earnings to you in the second step whatever was the message that you sent to participant b in the first step you could send that less or more note that your decisions are final now please open the envelope in the big form write your identification number and an x in accept or reject for the participant a s offer participant a s offer has a circle around it then in the small form please write down your reais earnings and participant a s reais earnings for the first step after everybody finish now we will inform participant a of your decision please wait while participant a makes the decision for the second step go to the room with participant a after collecting third form and start second exercise participant a participant b made a decision by accepting or rejecting your offer please open your envelope and if participant b accepted the offer please decide if you want to send or not any positive amount in reais to participant b if participant b rejected the offer you don t have to make any decision 
8706,the consumption of water by thermal power plants for cooling purposes has presented several policy and resource allocation challenges in the recent past there is need for improved economic understanding of thermal power plant water consumption to better address these challenges in this paper we examine the economic efficiency of water consumption substitutes for existing thermal power plants in the long run a power plant could reduce water consumption by investing in efficiency improvements in the short run a power plant could reduce water consumption by curtailing power output the analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that these substitutes are not economically efficient water prices in excess of 1 00 m3 would be required for power plants to make efficiency investments or curtail output thermal power plants are therefore not attractive targets for water consumption reduction initiatives based on pricing alone furthermore in the long run efficiency improvements only show significant water reduction potential for the most inefficient plants however the findings of the short run analysis indicate that since thermal power plants are willing to pay water prices in excess of 1 00 m3 before curtailing output these power plants do not require free reallocation of water from senior water rights holders during periods of scarcity as has been the practice in several regions instead a more efficient water policy focus would be creation of enabling environments for water market transactions such water market transactions could help balance competing water demands during periods of scarcity while maintaining reliable electricity supply keywords electricity water nexus thermal power plants water markets demand analysis 1 introduction thermal power plant cooling water demands have contributed to water policy and water allocation challenges in many regions in the recent past water reallocations in texas in 2011 from agricultural users with more senior water diversion rights to thermal power plants with junior water rights without compensation led to successful lawsuits against the water authority 1 low reservoir levels in wyoming in 2008 forced water authorities to allow power plants to obtain water from sources typically dedicated to irrigation districts 2 the regional government in the indian state of maharashtra has faced pressure over prioritization of coal power plant water needs during droughts 3 extended drought and water rationing in australia forced the curtailment of three large coal power plants in 2007 pushing up national wholesale electricity prices 4 these tensions between electricity supply and water resources are expressions of the electricity water nexus which has received increasing attention in recent years in the academic literature 5 19 and in policy circles 2 20 23 application of economics frameworks to water resource management can support optimal allocation of scarce water between competing sectors for maximum social benefit for an individual water user economic analysis can enable clarification of tradeoffs between water consumption and appropriate substitutes the increasing frequency of water resource management problems involving thermal power plants suggests a need for improved understanding of cooling water demand from an economics perspective discussions of consumptive cooling water use for a given electricity generation technology have largely conceptualized water demand as follows 1 w k e where w m3 is the water demand e mwh is the electricity generated and k m3 mwh is the unit water consumption factor which is dependent on the cooling technology employed and the power plant fuel type estimated ranges of unit water consumption factors for different fuel types and cooling technologies 24 25 are summarized in table 1 these estimates have been used as inputs to further analyses including estimation of the water consumption footprint of electricity generation 17 26 projections of water consumption under different electricity generation portfolios 11 17 27 28 and incorporation of water constraints into electricity system planning 29 the limitation of the conceptualization of cooling water demand as in equation 1 is that it does not elucidate the potential for water saving substitutions for a particular power plant except through cooling system technology retrofits that change the parameter k two types of water saving retrofits are feasible 1 dry cooling in which all the power plant waste heat is dissipated to air rather than water and 2 hybrid cooling in which the power plant waste heat load is split between dry and water consuming cooling systems these retrofits are however prohibitively expensive loew et al 30 estimated marginal costs of water savings through dry cooling retrofits as 1 80 m3 and 4 70 m3 for coal and natural gas combined cycle plants respectively kablouti 31 estimated the average costs of water avoidance through dry cooling as 1 20 m3 for a coal power plant for comparison chini et al 32 found that residential drinking water prices in the united states average 1 14 m3 thermal power plants being self suppliers of water would likely be exposed to water prices far below this residential average the high costs of cooling system technology changes therefore restrict their applicability as substitutes to new power plants in locations where physical water scarcity implies an unreasonably high water acquisition cost the conceptualization of demand as in equation 1 does not provide any insight into the cost effectiveness of water consumption alternatives available to existing power plants such insight is necessary as electricity infrastructure is slow changing due to significant capital investment therefore policy that pertains to existing power plants is required the gap we address in this paper is consideration of substitution alternatives for existing thermal power plants and thus determination of whether water pricing is a potential lever for reducing water demand from these power plants we make a distinction between substitutes available to the power plant in the long run and in the short run in the long run thermal power plants can make investments in efficiency to reduce waste heat thereby reducing water consumption for a fixed energy output efficiency investments are primarily driven by potential fuel cost savings not by water scarcity pressures to isolate the substitution between water consumption and efficiency our analysis focuses only on efficiency investments that are not economically justified by fuel savings alone in the short run a power plant s efficiency is fixed and the only alternative available to the power plant when water is scarce is to reduce power output to an economically optimal level that balances the costs of water acquisition with the value of electricity generation minus variable generation costs the driver of the power plant s selection between water consumption and water saving substitutes will be relative prices since thermal power plants are typically self suppliers of cooling water the relevant water prices might represent market prices for water rights leases costs of extracting treating and transporting water or water consumption rates imposed by a water administration authority multiple approaches for studying producers demand for water have been presented in the water economics literature griffin 33 and young 34 present taxonomies of methods for determining water demand and economic value production function approaches 35 relate consumption of water and other factors of production to producer output demand functions can then be derived by maximizing a producer utility function mathematical programming methods 36 37 determine demand functions by optimizing between a set of alternatives under different exogenous water prices direct statistical regression 38 41 can be applied to determine demand functions when data on water prices or costs and corresponding consumption are available residual imputation methods 33 34 42 assign a value to unpriced water inputs by subtracting the values of all priced inputs from the value of the product price and corresponding demand data are not readily available for thermal power plants and therefore a direct statistical regression is not possible residual imputation is limited by the fact that it only yields a single value not a demand function additionally it has been noted that residual imputation is prone to overvaluing water as it often neglects valuation of other unpriced inputs like entrepreneurship and management 34 our analysis therefore makes use of the production function and mathematical programming methods the analyses in sections 2 3 and 4 focus on consumptive water use at thermal power plants an equally important facet of water use by thermal power plants is water withdrawals water withdrawals by thermal power plants that utilize once through cooling are typically more than two orders of magnitude larger than corresponding water consumption levels 24 25 these power plants consequently represent the largest withdrawals of water in the united states 43 and discharge significant quantities of heat into river systems around the world 44 45 however since most of the withdrawn water is returned to its original source the relevant economic analysis for thermal power plant water withdrawals would focus not on water scarcity but on water quality impacts of thermal power plant heat discharges we reserve this analysis for future work the present analysis is restricted to thermal power plant water consumption in relation to water scarcity 2 long run demand analysis in the long run a power plant could choose to make investments in efficiency in response to changes in water supply prices conservation of energy dictates that fuel energy input to the power plant must equal the sum of electrical energy output and waste heat which is predominantly dissipated to cooling water and exhaust gases i e fuel energy electricity output waste heat by improving efficiency a power plant reduces the amount of fuel energy required to produce a fixed electricity output and therefore reduces waste heat reduction in waste heat reduces the amount of cooling water required to dissipate this heat we adopt two methods from the water economics literature in studying thermal power plants long run demand for cooling water in this section 1 use of a production function determined through regression analysis and 2 use of mathematical programming based on a heat balance model of the thermal power plant these two methods are discussed in the following subsections 2 1 production function a production function relates the output from a production process to the quantities of inputs and other factors of production such as invested capital and labor in the present situation the interest is in inputs or factors of production pertaining to cooling therefore complimentary factors such as fuel and labor are not included we propose the following production function 2 e c w α h r β where e is the electrical energy generated by the power plant in gwh per year c is a constant dependent on power plant fuel type w is the cooling water consumption in million cubic meters mm 3 per year h r is the power plant heat rate in gj gwh and α and β are regression coefficients to be determined the heat rate is related to the power plant efficiency η by the relationship h r 3600 η that is a lower heat rate corresponds to a higher efficiency in contrast to the relationship in equation 1 the production function in equation 2 captures the potential for substitution of water consumption with increased efficiency while maintaining the same level of output the heat rate is not technically a factor of production but rather is a product of the investment of capital in efficiency initiatives the heat rate is included in the production function in equation 2 as a proxy for these investments in efficiency we determined the parameters α β c of the production function of equation 2 by regression using the energy information administration s eia form 923 dataset for 2016 46 which provides records of power plant electricity generation fuel consumption and water consumption the heat rate was calculated by dividing the fuel consumption by the electricity generation we restricted the dataset to power plants with cooling towers as power plants with once through cooling systems or cooling ponds are typically located in areas where the primary concern associated with thermal power plant cooling is water quality not water scarcity power plants with dry and hybrid cooling were excluded because the former do not consume any water for cooling and there were only four cases of the latter across all fuel types in the eia form 923 dataset we further restricted the dataset to nuclear nuc natural gas combined cycle ngcc coal coal and natural gas steam turbine ngst power plants power plants that use both natural gas and coal were excluded from the analysis as the eia form 923 dataset does not apportion water consumption between the coal and natural gas parts of the power plant the data in eia form 923 are self reported and consequently several records have incomplete data the 259 power plants with complete records that were used for the regression are summarized in table 2 and fig 1 the average power plant heat rates and water consumption intensities w e were found to be close to typical literature values 24 25 47 the regression was performed by taking the natural logarithm of equation 2 and performing an ordinary least squares regression the results of the regression are summarized in table 3 the goodness of fit r2 of 0 92 indicates that the model has significant explanatory power the power plant fuel type is handled as a categorical variable with parameter c b a s e corresponding to coal power plants while the parameters c n g c c c n g s t and c n u c are modifiers of c b a s e for the corresponding power plant types these modifiers are however either not significant at the 5 level or not based on a large number of samples and are not considered reliable the primary variation between the water consumption of different power plant fuel types is driven by differences in heat rates the exponents α and β show the expected directional effects with reduced heat rates increased efficiency compensating for reduced water consumption the value of α is close to 1 0 9457 p 2e 16 indicating that the linear relationships used in the literature equation 1 are reasonable approximations however the fact that β is significant p 7e 9 indicates that useful additional information is captured in the heat rate and should be disaggregated from the unit water consumption factor k of equation 1 the form of equation 2 enables quantitative assessment of the tradeoffs between heat rate and water consumption the marginal rate of technical substitution is a measure of the amount by which one input must be changed to compensate for a unit change in the other input while holding output constant it is of interest to determine the marginal rate of technical substitution of heat rate improvements for water consumption denoted m r t s w h r the effect of changes in heat rate δ h r and water consumption δ w on energy output is given by 3 δ e e w δ w e h r δ h r by definition the m r t s corresponds to δ e 0 which when substituted in equation 3 yields 4 m r t s w h r δ h r δ w δ e 0 e w e h r substitution of equation 2 and the results of table 3 into equation 4 yields an expression for m r t s w h r 5 m r t s w h r α c w α 1 h r β β c w α h r β 1 α β h r w 0 72 h r w the implication of this result is that a unit reduction in cooling water consumption 1 mm3 year can be realized without reducing power plant energy output by reducing the heat rate by 0 72 h r w if the power plant had an initial water consumption of 20 mm3 year and heat rate of 11070 gj gwh 32 5 efficiency which is typical for a coal power plant 47 the required heat rate reduction to compensate for a unit water consumption reduction 1 mm3 year would be 399 gj gwh i e improve efficiency to 33 7 the power plant would only make the heat rate investments if the marginal cost of water is greater than or equal to the net costs associated with this heat rate reduction the net cost in this case refers to costs after fuel savings have been subtracted heat rate reductions are realized through a range of initiatives implemented in different sections of a power plant these initiatives vary widely in cost and heat rate reduction potential as well as across different power plants a sample of possible heat rate reduction activities for a typical 500 mw coal power plant is presented in detail in section 2 2 the annualized net costs of these initiatives range from 2000 to 13 000 for a reduction of 1 gj gwh table 5 while these costs are specific to a 500 mw coal power plant they provide an indication of orders of magnitude and were applied to all the coal power plants in the dataset as a first order analysis using this cost range and the mrts in equation 5 the range of marginal water prices at which the power plant would be indifferent towards acquiring additional water and making heat rate reduction investments can be estimated these estimates are shown in table 4 in which the maximum mrts value used is the 90th percentile of the values computed from the dataset as the distribution of computed mrts values displays a long tail of extreme values fig 2 the median indifference marginal water price imwp is calculated using an average heat rate reduction cost of 7500 per gj gwh the results demonstrate that very high water costs 420 000 mm3 would be necessary for power plants to choose heat rate reduction over water acquisition for comparison brewer et al 48 found that the average transaction price for one year leases in water markets in the western united states was approximately 100 000 mm3 which is less than one fourth of the minimum price in table 4 the combination of high values of the mrts and the high cost of heat rate reduction initiatives makes heat rate reductions an unattractive substitute for water consumption an alternative view of the tradeoff between the heat rate and water consumption is provided by the isoquant or indifference curve shown in fig 3 for coal power plants of different energy outputs expressed in terawatt hours twh the heat rates have been substituted with corresponding efficiencies in fig 3 using equation 2 and the results of table 3 the relationship between cooling water consumption and efficiency for a coal power plant producing electrical energy output e twh can be derived as w 0 9457 0 38 e η 1 3220 included for reference in fig 3 is an average coal power plant efficiency of 33 9 47 steep reductions in water consumption through efficiency improvement can be realized for highly inefficient plants but typical power plants are unlikely to realize large water consumption reductions through efficiency improvements water conservation initiatives based on incentivization of efficiency improvements would likely only be cost effective if targeted at highly inefficient plants however such power plants are more likely to be incentivized by fuel savings than by water savings even if water were priced 2 2 mathematical programming a different perspective on the tradeoffs between cooling water consumption and heat rate improvement initiatives is provided by a mathematical programming analysis the model we adopt for the analysis in this section is of a power plant with a base heat rate h r b a s e that generates an electricity output e the power plant can implement a number of initiatives to reduce its heat rate for each heat rate reduction initiative i we define the following a heat rate reduction h i in gj gwh an annual cost of the initiative y i which consists of an annualized capital cost and any associated operations or maintenance costs an implementation indicator u i which equals 1 if the initiative is implemented and 0 if it is not the final power plant heat rate is then given by 6 h r h r b a s e i u i h i the initiatives i will not only reduce water consumption but will also reduce fuel consumption we define a net initiative cost y i as follows 7 y i y i f e h i where f is the fuel cost the energy information administration has conducted a study of potential heat rate improvements at a 500 mw coal power plant estimating associated costs and heat rate reductions 49 from this study we selected initiatives that fulfill two criteria 1 initiatives for which the net cost is positive and thus are not justified by fuel savings alone and 2 initiatives that are applicable to typical power plants i e power plants with heat rates that are between the 25th and 75th percentiles for coal power plants in the united states the initiatives that satisfy these criteria are shown in table 5 the net costs in table 5 were calculated assuming a fuel cost of 1 89 gj 50 a discount rate of 5 and lifetime of 20 years for capital investments and annual electricity generation of 3000 gwh approximately equivalent to a 500 mw power plant with a 70 capacity factor the resultant heat rate can be related to the power plant water consumption using a heat balance power plant model we employ the system level generic model s gem 51 depicted in fig 4 of the power plant heat rate input 3600 gj gwh is released as electrical energy output and a portion k o s is released through additional heat sinks predominantly exhaust gases the remaining waste heat load to the cooling system is given by 8 q c o o l h r 3600 k o s e the water consumption required to dissipate this waste heat is given by ref 51 9 w q c o o l λ v ρ 1 1 n c c 1 where λ v is the latent heat of vaporization ρ is the density of water and n c c the number of concentration cycles is the ratio of make up water to blowdown water which is governed by intake water quality considerations in this work n c c is fixed equal to 6 typical values in the united states range from 2 to 10 51 introducing a cooling water price c w the total cooling cost is given by 10 total cooling cost c w w i u i y i the total cooling cost can be minimized for different values of c w by selecting the initiatives to implement i e u i yielding a demand function the results of this analysis are shown in fig 5 additionally for each efficiency initiative a trigger water price at which the initiative becomes financially viable was calculated and included in table 5 a measure of demand elasticity can be estimated at each step of fig 5 as the percentage change in demand divided by the percentage change in price between adjacent steps the calculated elasticities are displayed in fig 5 the demand is found to be inelastic with elasticities approximately equal to zero over the entire price range due to the high cost of heat rate reduction initiatives this inelasticity persists when sensitivity analysis is conducted with heat rate reductions and net costs of table 5 increased and decreased by 50 respectively reflecting a lower cost of substitutes the magnitude of the elasticities is still less than 0 03 therefore water price is unlikely to be a useful lever in reducing power plant consumptive water use additionally the water demand reductions realizable through heat rate improvements are fairly modest over the entire price range of fig 5 the water demand reductions are less than 1 6 of consumption at a total net annual cost of 400 000 table 5 3 short run demand analysis in the short run the design of the power plant is fixed and efficiency investments cannot readily be made the choice faced by the power plant in response to changes in water price is the degree of power output curtailment the heat rate of a thermal power plant is not fixed but varies with power output according to the power plant heat rate curve as depicted for example in fig 6 the heat rates used in the long run demand analysis are average heat rates corresponding to typical power outputs in the short run in response to a water price the power plant could vary its output to operate at a point on the heat rate curve that achieves an economic optimum our analysis of short term water demand presented in this section begins with a typical quadratic generation cost function 52 11 generator cost a b p c p 2 hr where p is the average energy output from the power plant in 1 h mwh note that since 1 mwh is the energy generated by a power plant operating at an output of 1 mw for 1 h p is numerically equivalent to the power output rating in fig 6 this generation cost is the power plant fuel cost gj multiplied by the fuel consumption gj hr the relationship between the fuel consumption and power output is often referred to as the generator input output i o characteristic which can be written as 12 generator i o a b p c p 2 gj hr where a b c are the coefficients a b c of the cost function divided by the fuel cost the heat rate can be derived from the i o function by dividing by the power output 13 h r a p b c p gj mwh given an electricity price c e and water price c w we define the hourly optimization problem faced by the power plant as follows max p c e p a b p c p 2 v o m p c w w s t w h r 3 6 k o s λ ρ 1 2 p h r a p b c p 14 p m i n p p m a x where the water consumption w is adapted from equations 8 and 9 of the s gem model previously discussed with n c c 6 as in section 2 2 and unit conversions from gj gwh to gj mwh v o m represents the non fuel related variable operations and maintenance costs p m a x is the power plant capacity and p m i n is the minimum stable output below which the power plant would shut down the solution to this optimization problem is dependent on the values of the cost function parameters a b c and the fuel cost using an electricity price c e 30 mwh typical coal parameters 52 a 1000 b 19 c 0 001 a fuel cost of 1 89 gj 50 vom 5 mwh 50 p m i n 500 mw and p m a x 1000 mw the solution to the problem for different water prices is shown in fig 7 in fig 7 we have multiplied the hourly water demand results by 24 h to obtain daily water demand above a water price of 1 22 m3 denoted as c w the power plant begins to curtail output despite the increases in heat rate and therefore in water consumption per unit of electricity generated m3 mwh significant sensitivity of demand to price is observed above c w with elasticities as high as 4 however the determined value of c w is much higher than would likely be observed in practice for a self supplying water consumer the solution to the optimization problem and therefore the value of c w is dependent on the power plant input output characteristic parameters a b c the fuel cost and the electricity price c e it is of interest to investigate whether any reasonable combinations of these parameters yield values of c w that a power plant could be exposed to in practice to conduct this analysis we estimated generator input output characteristics of thermal power plants in the united states by fitting quadratic functions to power plant monthly fuel consumption and electricity generations for 2015 and 2016 reported in eia form 923 a large number of the quadratic regressions yielded values of r2 0 99 suggesting that the power plants likely compute the fuel consumptions reported in the database using manufacturer specified input output characteristics and that the determined regression coefficients correspond to the parameters of these characteristics the analysis was restricted to the power plants with r2 0 99 the ranges of the power plant capacities and the estimated input output characteristic parameters are summarized in table 6 we computed power plant cost function parameters a b c from the input output characteristic parameters using the fuel costs reported in eia form 923 for power plants that did not report fuel costs typical values for different fuel types were used 50 typical values were also used for the heat dissipated through other heat sinks k o s 51 and c e was initially fixed at 30 mwh since power plants do not report variable operations and maintenance costs to the eia typical values of 5 3 and 2 per mwh 50 were used for coal natural gas combined cycle and nuclear power plants respectively we obtained the values of c w for each power plant in table 6 by solving the optimization problem outlined in equation 14 for a range of water prices c w and finding the price at which curtailment begins these values are summarized in fig 8 a wide range of values of c w is determined for the natural gas combined cycle and coal power plants despite the variation observed all but two power plants would be insensitive to water prices below 0 20 m3 and none of the power plants is sensitive to the average water market price of approximately 0 10 m3 for the coal power plants it was found that the power plants with low values of c w are characterized by higher than average fuel costs as shown in fig 9 for the natural gas combined cycle plants it was found that the power plants with lowest values of c w had higher than average values of the parameters b and c indicating that these are less efficient power plants minimal variation is observed in the values of c w for nuclear power plants and the prices observed are all in excess of 6 55 m3 the minimal variation is driven by the small range observed in the value of b table 6 and the use of a common fuel price of 0 50 gj for nuclear fuel 50 as no nuclear power plant fuel costs were reported in the eia form 923 database the high values of c w for nuclear power plants are driven by the low fuel and variable operations and maintenance costs under a low electricity price c e 25 mwh most of the coal power plants and nearly half of the natural gas combined cycle power plants in the dataset become uneconomical even without water prices this finding is not unexpected as the average variable costs for coal and a natural gas combined cycle plants are 25 mwh and 23 mwh respectively 50 the values of c w for the remaining power plants are shown in fig 10 the most robust comparison with the previous case is provided by the nuclear power plants for which the median value of c w has declined from 6 92 to 5 39 two natural gas combined cycle plants in the dataset are sensitive to water prices of approximately 0 10 m3 but all the other power plants are only sensitive to prices in excess of 0 40 m3 therefore even at low electricity prices the majority of power plants are unlikely to be sensitive to any reasonable water prices and their demand can be considered inelastic the triggering water prices for both the typical and low electricity price scenarios are summarized in table 7 4 policy implications the results of section 2 demonstrate that incremental efficiency improvements are not attractive substitutes for water consumption at thermal power plants this finding is driven by three factors i potential water savings through heat rate reductions are relatively small because the marginal rate of technical substitution between water consumption and heat rate improvement is large ii power plants with typical operating efficiencies are unlikely to realize large water reductions through efficiency improvements as demonstrated by the indifference curve of fig 3 iii heat rate reductions that are not justified by fuel cost savings alone remain expensive and not justifiable at any reasonable water price water pricing is therefore not an effective lever for water consumption reduction at existing thermal power plants the absence of cost effective substitutes and consequent demand inelasticity means that existing thermal power plants are in fact unattractive targets for water consumption reduction literature estimates of long run elasticities for irrigation while highly variable average 0 48 at water prices averaging 0 03 m3 42 in contrast to the range 0 01 to 0 03 estimated in section 2 2 at prices in excess of 1 80 m3 industrial water demand elasticities have been shown to range from 0 15 to 0 59 in the beverage textile paper minerals and petroleum industries 40 consequently these sectors would be more attractive water saving targets than the thermal power plant sector in the short run thermal power plant demand is inelastic at all reasonable water price levels this inelasticity is driven by the power plant operating margins a coal power plant with a typical operating cost of 25 mwh 50 that consumes a typical 2 6 m3 mwh 24 and receives an electricity price of 30 mwh would only curtail output if water prices exceeded 1 92 m3 this result indicates that with the exception of rare cases of high inefficiency or high fuel costs thermal power plants will have a high willingness to pay for water during periods of scarcity therefore reallocation policies to protect thermal power plant water demands during periods of scarcity such as those implemented in texas 1 do not maximize social welfare power plant water demands have largely been justified alongside municipal water demands as being essential for the protection of human health and safety due to concerns about reliability of the electricity grid however the high willingness to pay suggests that limited risk would be posed to electricity reliability if power plants were required to pay for scarce water resources in the short term instead of reallocation policies leases from lower value or more elastic users could be facilitated during periods of scarcity in the long run frequent exposure to excessively high water prices would compromise the ability of power plants to cover fixed costs however water market prices are low relative to power plant operating margins and the periods of scarcity during which power plants would have to pay these market prices would likely be infrequent 5 conclusion the electricity water nexus has been the subject of increased attention due to increased frequency of concurrent droughts and heat waves 53 which have highlighted the tensions between water resources and thermal power plants these tensions motivate an analysis of thermal power plant cooling water demand from an economics perspective a critical element of the economic analysis of water is clarification of the cost effectiveness of alternatives to water consumption for a particular water user this clarification is necessary for an understanding of how the behavior of the water user would change in response to changes in water prices discussions of the economic efficiency of alternatives to water consumption for thermal power plants have focused on options that are only practical for new power plants the gap addressed in this paper is consideration of the economic efficiency of water consumption substitutes for existing power plants and thus determination of whether water pricing is a potential lever for reducing water demand from these thermal power plants to address this question we assessed economic tradeoffs between water consumption by an existing power plant and two alternatives efficiency improvement in the long run and power output curtailment in the short run the results of the analysis suggest that similar to investments in dry or hybrid cooling technology for new power plants water consumption substitutes available to existing power plants in both the short and long runs are not cost effective under reasonable water prices therefore pricing is not an effective lever for reducing thermal power plant water consumption and water management authorities could benefit from focusing efforts on sectors with more elastic demand however the inelasticity of thermal power plant water demand suggests that these power plants do not require free reallocation of water from senior water rights holders during periods of scarcity and the creation of enabling environments for water lease transactions might

8706,the consumption of water by thermal power plants for cooling purposes has presented several policy and resource allocation challenges in the recent past there is need for improved economic understanding of thermal power plant water consumption to better address these challenges in this paper we examine the economic efficiency of water consumption substitutes for existing thermal power plants in the long run a power plant could reduce water consumption by investing in efficiency improvements in the short run a power plant could reduce water consumption by curtailing power output the analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that these substitutes are not economically efficient water prices in excess of 1 00 m3 would be required for power plants to make efficiency investments or curtail output thermal power plants are therefore not attractive targets for water consumption reduction initiatives based on pricing alone furthermore in the long run efficiency improvements only show significant water reduction potential for the most inefficient plants however the findings of the short run analysis indicate that since thermal power plants are willing to pay water prices in excess of 1 00 m3 before curtailing output these power plants do not require free reallocation of water from senior water rights holders during periods of scarcity as has been the practice in several regions instead a more efficient water policy focus would be creation of enabling environments for water market transactions such water market transactions could help balance competing water demands during periods of scarcity while maintaining reliable electricity supply keywords electricity water nexus thermal power plants water markets demand analysis 1 introduction thermal power plant cooling water demands have contributed to water policy and water allocation challenges in many regions in the recent past water reallocations in texas in 2011 from agricultural users with more senior water diversion rights to thermal power plants with junior water rights without compensation led to successful lawsuits against the water authority 1 low reservoir levels in wyoming in 2008 forced water authorities to allow power plants to obtain water from sources typically dedicated to irrigation districts 2 the regional government in the indian state of maharashtra has faced pressure over prioritization of coal power plant water needs during droughts 3 extended drought and water rationing in australia forced the curtailment of three large coal power plants in 2007 pushing up national wholesale electricity prices 4 these tensions between electricity supply and water resources are expressions of the electricity water nexus which has received increasing attention in recent years in the academic literature 5 19 and in policy circles 2 20 23 application of economics frameworks to water resource management can support optimal allocation of scarce water between competing sectors for maximum social benefit for an individual water user economic analysis can enable clarification of tradeoffs between water consumption and appropriate substitutes the increasing frequency of water resource management problems involving thermal power plants suggests a need for improved understanding of cooling water demand from an economics perspective discussions of consumptive cooling water use for a given electricity generation technology have largely conceptualized water demand as follows 1 w k e where w m3 is the water demand e mwh is the electricity generated and k m3 mwh is the unit water consumption factor which is dependent on the cooling technology employed and the power plant fuel type estimated ranges of unit water consumption factors for different fuel types and cooling technologies 24 25 are summarized in table 1 these estimates have been used as inputs to further analyses including estimation of the water consumption footprint of electricity generation 17 26 projections of water consumption under different electricity generation portfolios 11 17 27 28 and incorporation of water constraints into electricity system planning 29 the limitation of the conceptualization of cooling water demand as in equation 1 is that it does not elucidate the potential for water saving substitutions for a particular power plant except through cooling system technology retrofits that change the parameter k two types of water saving retrofits are feasible 1 dry cooling in which all the power plant waste heat is dissipated to air rather than water and 2 hybrid cooling in which the power plant waste heat load is split between dry and water consuming cooling systems these retrofits are however prohibitively expensive loew et al 30 estimated marginal costs of water savings through dry cooling retrofits as 1 80 m3 and 4 70 m3 for coal and natural gas combined cycle plants respectively kablouti 31 estimated the average costs of water avoidance through dry cooling as 1 20 m3 for a coal power plant for comparison chini et al 32 found that residential drinking water prices in the united states average 1 14 m3 thermal power plants being self suppliers of water would likely be exposed to water prices far below this residential average the high costs of cooling system technology changes therefore restrict their applicability as substitutes to new power plants in locations where physical water scarcity implies an unreasonably high water acquisition cost the conceptualization of demand as in equation 1 does not provide any insight into the cost effectiveness of water consumption alternatives available to existing power plants such insight is necessary as electricity infrastructure is slow changing due to significant capital investment therefore policy that pertains to existing power plants is required the gap we address in this paper is consideration of substitution alternatives for existing thermal power plants and thus determination of whether water pricing is a potential lever for reducing water demand from these power plants we make a distinction between substitutes available to the power plant in the long run and in the short run in the long run thermal power plants can make investments in efficiency to reduce waste heat thereby reducing water consumption for a fixed energy output efficiency investments are primarily driven by potential fuel cost savings not by water scarcity pressures to isolate the substitution between water consumption and efficiency our analysis focuses only on efficiency investments that are not economically justified by fuel savings alone in the short run a power plant s efficiency is fixed and the only alternative available to the power plant when water is scarce is to reduce power output to an economically optimal level that balances the costs of water acquisition with the value of electricity generation minus variable generation costs the driver of the power plant s selection between water consumption and water saving substitutes will be relative prices since thermal power plants are typically self suppliers of cooling water the relevant water prices might represent market prices for water rights leases costs of extracting treating and transporting water or water consumption rates imposed by a water administration authority multiple approaches for studying producers demand for water have been presented in the water economics literature griffin 33 and young 34 present taxonomies of methods for determining water demand and economic value production function approaches 35 relate consumption of water and other factors of production to producer output demand functions can then be derived by maximizing a producer utility function mathematical programming methods 36 37 determine demand functions by optimizing between a set of alternatives under different exogenous water prices direct statistical regression 38 41 can be applied to determine demand functions when data on water prices or costs and corresponding consumption are available residual imputation methods 33 34 42 assign a value to unpriced water inputs by subtracting the values of all priced inputs from the value of the product price and corresponding demand data are not readily available for thermal power plants and therefore a direct statistical regression is not possible residual imputation is limited by the fact that it only yields a single value not a demand function additionally it has been noted that residual imputation is prone to overvaluing water as it often neglects valuation of other unpriced inputs like entrepreneurship and management 34 our analysis therefore makes use of the production function and mathematical programming methods the analyses in sections 2 3 and 4 focus on consumptive water use at thermal power plants an equally important facet of water use by thermal power plants is water withdrawals water withdrawals by thermal power plants that utilize once through cooling are typically more than two orders of magnitude larger than corresponding water consumption levels 24 25 these power plants consequently represent the largest withdrawals of water in the united states 43 and discharge significant quantities of heat into river systems around the world 44 45 however since most of the withdrawn water is returned to its original source the relevant economic analysis for thermal power plant water withdrawals would focus not on water scarcity but on water quality impacts of thermal power plant heat discharges we reserve this analysis for future work the present analysis is restricted to thermal power plant water consumption in relation to water scarcity 2 long run demand analysis in the long run a power plant could choose to make investments in efficiency in response to changes in water supply prices conservation of energy dictates that fuel energy input to the power plant must equal the sum of electrical energy output and waste heat which is predominantly dissipated to cooling water and exhaust gases i e fuel energy electricity output waste heat by improving efficiency a power plant reduces the amount of fuel energy required to produce a fixed electricity output and therefore reduces waste heat reduction in waste heat reduces the amount of cooling water required to dissipate this heat we adopt two methods from the water economics literature in studying thermal power plants long run demand for cooling water in this section 1 use of a production function determined through regression analysis and 2 use of mathematical programming based on a heat balance model of the thermal power plant these two methods are discussed in the following subsections 2 1 production function a production function relates the output from a production process to the quantities of inputs and other factors of production such as invested capital and labor in the present situation the interest is in inputs or factors of production pertaining to cooling therefore complimentary factors such as fuel and labor are not included we propose the following production function 2 e c w α h r β where e is the electrical energy generated by the power plant in gwh per year c is a constant dependent on power plant fuel type w is the cooling water consumption in million cubic meters mm 3 per year h r is the power plant heat rate in gj gwh and α and β are regression coefficients to be determined the heat rate is related to the power plant efficiency η by the relationship h r 3600 η that is a lower heat rate corresponds to a higher efficiency in contrast to the relationship in equation 1 the production function in equation 2 captures the potential for substitution of water consumption with increased efficiency while maintaining the same level of output the heat rate is not technically a factor of production but rather is a product of the investment of capital in efficiency initiatives the heat rate is included in the production function in equation 2 as a proxy for these investments in efficiency we determined the parameters α β c of the production function of equation 2 by regression using the energy information administration s eia form 923 dataset for 2016 46 which provides records of power plant electricity generation fuel consumption and water consumption the heat rate was calculated by dividing the fuel consumption by the electricity generation we restricted the dataset to power plants with cooling towers as power plants with once through cooling systems or cooling ponds are typically located in areas where the primary concern associated with thermal power plant cooling is water quality not water scarcity power plants with dry and hybrid cooling were excluded because the former do not consume any water for cooling and there were only four cases of the latter across all fuel types in the eia form 923 dataset we further restricted the dataset to nuclear nuc natural gas combined cycle ngcc coal coal and natural gas steam turbine ngst power plants power plants that use both natural gas and coal were excluded from the analysis as the eia form 923 dataset does not apportion water consumption between the coal and natural gas parts of the power plant the data in eia form 923 are self reported and consequently several records have incomplete data the 259 power plants with complete records that were used for the regression are summarized in table 2 and fig 1 the average power plant heat rates and water consumption intensities w e were found to be close to typical literature values 24 25 47 the regression was performed by taking the natural logarithm of equation 2 and performing an ordinary least squares regression the results of the regression are summarized in table 3 the goodness of fit r2 of 0 92 indicates that the model has significant explanatory power the power plant fuel type is handled as a categorical variable with parameter c b a s e corresponding to coal power plants while the parameters c n g c c c n g s t and c n u c are modifiers of c b a s e for the corresponding power plant types these modifiers are however either not significant at the 5 level or not based on a large number of samples and are not considered reliable the primary variation between the water consumption of different power plant fuel types is driven by differences in heat rates the exponents α and β show the expected directional effects with reduced heat rates increased efficiency compensating for reduced water consumption the value of α is close to 1 0 9457 p 2e 16 indicating that the linear relationships used in the literature equation 1 are reasonable approximations however the fact that β is significant p 7e 9 indicates that useful additional information is captured in the heat rate and should be disaggregated from the unit water consumption factor k of equation 1 the form of equation 2 enables quantitative assessment of the tradeoffs between heat rate and water consumption the marginal rate of technical substitution is a measure of the amount by which one input must be changed to compensate for a unit change in the other input while holding output constant it is of interest to determine the marginal rate of technical substitution of heat rate improvements for water consumption denoted m r t s w h r the effect of changes in heat rate δ h r and water consumption δ w on energy output is given by 3 δ e e w δ w e h r δ h r by definition the m r t s corresponds to δ e 0 which when substituted in equation 3 yields 4 m r t s w h r δ h r δ w δ e 0 e w e h r substitution of equation 2 and the results of table 3 into equation 4 yields an expression for m r t s w h r 5 m r t s w h r α c w α 1 h r β β c w α h r β 1 α β h r w 0 72 h r w the implication of this result is that a unit reduction in cooling water consumption 1 mm3 year can be realized without reducing power plant energy output by reducing the heat rate by 0 72 h r w if the power plant had an initial water consumption of 20 mm3 year and heat rate of 11070 gj gwh 32 5 efficiency which is typical for a coal power plant 47 the required heat rate reduction to compensate for a unit water consumption reduction 1 mm3 year would be 399 gj gwh i e improve efficiency to 33 7 the power plant would only make the heat rate investments if the marginal cost of water is greater than or equal to the net costs associated with this heat rate reduction the net cost in this case refers to costs after fuel savings have been subtracted heat rate reductions are realized through a range of initiatives implemented in different sections of a power plant these initiatives vary widely in cost and heat rate reduction potential as well as across different power plants a sample of possible heat rate reduction activities for a typical 500 mw coal power plant is presented in detail in section 2 2 the annualized net costs of these initiatives range from 2000 to 13 000 for a reduction of 1 gj gwh table 5 while these costs are specific to a 500 mw coal power plant they provide an indication of orders of magnitude and were applied to all the coal power plants in the dataset as a first order analysis using this cost range and the mrts in equation 5 the range of marginal water prices at which the power plant would be indifferent towards acquiring additional water and making heat rate reduction investments can be estimated these estimates are shown in table 4 in which the maximum mrts value used is the 90th percentile of the values computed from the dataset as the distribution of computed mrts values displays a long tail of extreme values fig 2 the median indifference marginal water price imwp is calculated using an average heat rate reduction cost of 7500 per gj gwh the results demonstrate that very high water costs 420 000 mm3 would be necessary for power plants to choose heat rate reduction over water acquisition for comparison brewer et al 48 found that the average transaction price for one year leases in water markets in the western united states was approximately 100 000 mm3 which is less than one fourth of the minimum price in table 4 the combination of high values of the mrts and the high cost of heat rate reduction initiatives makes heat rate reductions an unattractive substitute for water consumption an alternative view of the tradeoff between the heat rate and water consumption is provided by the isoquant or indifference curve shown in fig 3 for coal power plants of different energy outputs expressed in terawatt hours twh the heat rates have been substituted with corresponding efficiencies in fig 3 using equation 2 and the results of table 3 the relationship between cooling water consumption and efficiency for a coal power plant producing electrical energy output e twh can be derived as w 0 9457 0 38 e η 1 3220 included for reference in fig 3 is an average coal power plant efficiency of 33 9 47 steep reductions in water consumption through efficiency improvement can be realized for highly inefficient plants but typical power plants are unlikely to realize large water consumption reductions through efficiency improvements water conservation initiatives based on incentivization of efficiency improvements would likely only be cost effective if targeted at highly inefficient plants however such power plants are more likely to be incentivized by fuel savings than by water savings even if water were priced 2 2 mathematical programming a different perspective on the tradeoffs between cooling water consumption and heat rate improvement initiatives is provided by a mathematical programming analysis the model we adopt for the analysis in this section is of a power plant with a base heat rate h r b a s e that generates an electricity output e the power plant can implement a number of initiatives to reduce its heat rate for each heat rate reduction initiative i we define the following a heat rate reduction h i in gj gwh an annual cost of the initiative y i which consists of an annualized capital cost and any associated operations or maintenance costs an implementation indicator u i which equals 1 if the initiative is implemented and 0 if it is not the final power plant heat rate is then given by 6 h r h r b a s e i u i h i the initiatives i will not only reduce water consumption but will also reduce fuel consumption we define a net initiative cost y i as follows 7 y i y i f e h i where f is the fuel cost the energy information administration has conducted a study of potential heat rate improvements at a 500 mw coal power plant estimating associated costs and heat rate reductions 49 from this study we selected initiatives that fulfill two criteria 1 initiatives for which the net cost is positive and thus are not justified by fuel savings alone and 2 initiatives that are applicable to typical power plants i e power plants with heat rates that are between the 25th and 75th percentiles for coal power plants in the united states the initiatives that satisfy these criteria are shown in table 5 the net costs in table 5 were calculated assuming a fuel cost of 1 89 gj 50 a discount rate of 5 and lifetime of 20 years for capital investments and annual electricity generation of 3000 gwh approximately equivalent to a 500 mw power plant with a 70 capacity factor the resultant heat rate can be related to the power plant water consumption using a heat balance power plant model we employ the system level generic model s gem 51 depicted in fig 4 of the power plant heat rate input 3600 gj gwh is released as electrical energy output and a portion k o s is released through additional heat sinks predominantly exhaust gases the remaining waste heat load to the cooling system is given by 8 q c o o l h r 3600 k o s e the water consumption required to dissipate this waste heat is given by ref 51 9 w q c o o l λ v ρ 1 1 n c c 1 where λ v is the latent heat of vaporization ρ is the density of water and n c c the number of concentration cycles is the ratio of make up water to blowdown water which is governed by intake water quality considerations in this work n c c is fixed equal to 6 typical values in the united states range from 2 to 10 51 introducing a cooling water price c w the total cooling cost is given by 10 total cooling cost c w w i u i y i the total cooling cost can be minimized for different values of c w by selecting the initiatives to implement i e u i yielding a demand function the results of this analysis are shown in fig 5 additionally for each efficiency initiative a trigger water price at which the initiative becomes financially viable was calculated and included in table 5 a measure of demand elasticity can be estimated at each step of fig 5 as the percentage change in demand divided by the percentage change in price between adjacent steps the calculated elasticities are displayed in fig 5 the demand is found to be inelastic with elasticities approximately equal to zero over the entire price range due to the high cost of heat rate reduction initiatives this inelasticity persists when sensitivity analysis is conducted with heat rate reductions and net costs of table 5 increased and decreased by 50 respectively reflecting a lower cost of substitutes the magnitude of the elasticities is still less than 0 03 therefore water price is unlikely to be a useful lever in reducing power plant consumptive water use additionally the water demand reductions realizable through heat rate improvements are fairly modest over the entire price range of fig 5 the water demand reductions are less than 1 6 of consumption at a total net annual cost of 400 000 table 5 3 short run demand analysis in the short run the design of the power plant is fixed and efficiency investments cannot readily be made the choice faced by the power plant in response to changes in water price is the degree of power output curtailment the heat rate of a thermal power plant is not fixed but varies with power output according to the power plant heat rate curve as depicted for example in fig 6 the heat rates used in the long run demand analysis are average heat rates corresponding to typical power outputs in the short run in response to a water price the power plant could vary its output to operate at a point on the heat rate curve that achieves an economic optimum our analysis of short term water demand presented in this section begins with a typical quadratic generation cost function 52 11 generator cost a b p c p 2 hr where p is the average energy output from the power plant in 1 h mwh note that since 1 mwh is the energy generated by a power plant operating at an output of 1 mw for 1 h p is numerically equivalent to the power output rating in fig 6 this generation cost is the power plant fuel cost gj multiplied by the fuel consumption gj hr the relationship between the fuel consumption and power output is often referred to as the generator input output i o characteristic which can be written as 12 generator i o a b p c p 2 gj hr where a b c are the coefficients a b c of the cost function divided by the fuel cost the heat rate can be derived from the i o function by dividing by the power output 13 h r a p b c p gj mwh given an electricity price c e and water price c w we define the hourly optimization problem faced by the power plant as follows max p c e p a b p c p 2 v o m p c w w s t w h r 3 6 k o s λ ρ 1 2 p h r a p b c p 14 p m i n p p m a x where the water consumption w is adapted from equations 8 and 9 of the s gem model previously discussed with n c c 6 as in section 2 2 and unit conversions from gj gwh to gj mwh v o m represents the non fuel related variable operations and maintenance costs p m a x is the power plant capacity and p m i n is the minimum stable output below which the power plant would shut down the solution to this optimization problem is dependent on the values of the cost function parameters a b c and the fuel cost using an electricity price c e 30 mwh typical coal parameters 52 a 1000 b 19 c 0 001 a fuel cost of 1 89 gj 50 vom 5 mwh 50 p m i n 500 mw and p m a x 1000 mw the solution to the problem for different water prices is shown in fig 7 in fig 7 we have multiplied the hourly water demand results by 24 h to obtain daily water demand above a water price of 1 22 m3 denoted as c w the power plant begins to curtail output despite the increases in heat rate and therefore in water consumption per unit of electricity generated m3 mwh significant sensitivity of demand to price is observed above c w with elasticities as high as 4 however the determined value of c w is much higher than would likely be observed in practice for a self supplying water consumer the solution to the optimization problem and therefore the value of c w is dependent on the power plant input output characteristic parameters a b c the fuel cost and the electricity price c e it is of interest to investigate whether any reasonable combinations of these parameters yield values of c w that a power plant could be exposed to in practice to conduct this analysis we estimated generator input output characteristics of thermal power plants in the united states by fitting quadratic functions to power plant monthly fuel consumption and electricity generations for 2015 and 2016 reported in eia form 923 a large number of the quadratic regressions yielded values of r2 0 99 suggesting that the power plants likely compute the fuel consumptions reported in the database using manufacturer specified input output characteristics and that the determined regression coefficients correspond to the parameters of these characteristics the analysis was restricted to the power plants with r2 0 99 the ranges of the power plant capacities and the estimated input output characteristic parameters are summarized in table 6 we computed power plant cost function parameters a b c from the input output characteristic parameters using the fuel costs reported in eia form 923 for power plants that did not report fuel costs typical values for different fuel types were used 50 typical values were also used for the heat dissipated through other heat sinks k o s 51 and c e was initially fixed at 30 mwh since power plants do not report variable operations and maintenance costs to the eia typical values of 5 3 and 2 per mwh 50 were used for coal natural gas combined cycle and nuclear power plants respectively we obtained the values of c w for each power plant in table 6 by solving the optimization problem outlined in equation 14 for a range of water prices c w and finding the price at which curtailment begins these values are summarized in fig 8 a wide range of values of c w is determined for the natural gas combined cycle and coal power plants despite the variation observed all but two power plants would be insensitive to water prices below 0 20 m3 and none of the power plants is sensitive to the average water market price of approximately 0 10 m3 for the coal power plants it was found that the power plants with low values of c w are characterized by higher than average fuel costs as shown in fig 9 for the natural gas combined cycle plants it was found that the power plants with lowest values of c w had higher than average values of the parameters b and c indicating that these are less efficient power plants minimal variation is observed in the values of c w for nuclear power plants and the prices observed are all in excess of 6 55 m3 the minimal variation is driven by the small range observed in the value of b table 6 and the use of a common fuel price of 0 50 gj for nuclear fuel 50 as no nuclear power plant fuel costs were reported in the eia form 923 database the high values of c w for nuclear power plants are driven by the low fuel and variable operations and maintenance costs under a low electricity price c e 25 mwh most of the coal power plants and nearly half of the natural gas combined cycle power plants in the dataset become uneconomical even without water prices this finding is not unexpected as the average variable costs for coal and a natural gas combined cycle plants are 25 mwh and 23 mwh respectively 50 the values of c w for the remaining power plants are shown in fig 10 the most robust comparison with the previous case is provided by the nuclear power plants for which the median value of c w has declined from 6 92 to 5 39 two natural gas combined cycle plants in the dataset are sensitive to water prices of approximately 0 10 m3 but all the other power plants are only sensitive to prices in excess of 0 40 m3 therefore even at low electricity prices the majority of power plants are unlikely to be sensitive to any reasonable water prices and their demand can be considered inelastic the triggering water prices for both the typical and low electricity price scenarios are summarized in table 7 4 policy implications the results of section 2 demonstrate that incremental efficiency improvements are not attractive substitutes for water consumption at thermal power plants this finding is driven by three factors i potential water savings through heat rate reductions are relatively small because the marginal rate of technical substitution between water consumption and heat rate improvement is large ii power plants with typical operating efficiencies are unlikely to realize large water reductions through efficiency improvements as demonstrated by the indifference curve of fig 3 iii heat rate reductions that are not justified by fuel cost savings alone remain expensive and not justifiable at any reasonable water price water pricing is therefore not an effective lever for water consumption reduction at existing thermal power plants the absence of cost effective substitutes and consequent demand inelasticity means that existing thermal power plants are in fact unattractive targets for water consumption reduction literature estimates of long run elasticities for irrigation while highly variable average 0 48 at water prices averaging 0 03 m3 42 in contrast to the range 0 01 to 0 03 estimated in section 2 2 at prices in excess of 1 80 m3 industrial water demand elasticities have been shown to range from 0 15 to 0 59 in the beverage textile paper minerals and petroleum industries 40 consequently these sectors would be more attractive water saving targets than the thermal power plant sector in the short run thermal power plant demand is inelastic at all reasonable water price levels this inelasticity is driven by the power plant operating margins a coal power plant with a typical operating cost of 25 mwh 50 that consumes a typical 2 6 m3 mwh 24 and receives an electricity price of 30 mwh would only curtail output if water prices exceeded 1 92 m3 this result indicates that with the exception of rare cases of high inefficiency or high fuel costs thermal power plants will have a high willingness to pay for water during periods of scarcity therefore reallocation policies to protect thermal power plant water demands during periods of scarcity such as those implemented in texas 1 do not maximize social welfare power plant water demands have largely been justified alongside municipal water demands as being essential for the protection of human health and safety due to concerns about reliability of the electricity grid however the high willingness to pay suggests that limited risk would be posed to electricity reliability if power plants were required to pay for scarce water resources in the short term instead of reallocation policies leases from lower value or more elastic users could be facilitated during periods of scarcity in the long run frequent exposure to excessively high water prices would compromise the ability of power plants to cover fixed costs however water market prices are low relative to power plant operating margins and the periods of scarcity during which power plants would have to pay these market prices would likely be infrequent 5 conclusion the electricity water nexus has been the subject of increased attention due to increased frequency of concurrent droughts and heat waves 53 which have highlighted the tensions between water resources and thermal power plants these tensions motivate an analysis of thermal power plant cooling water demand from an economics perspective a critical element of the economic analysis of water is clarification of the cost effectiveness of alternatives to water consumption for a particular water user this clarification is necessary for an understanding of how the behavior of the water user would change in response to changes in water prices discussions of the economic efficiency of alternatives to water consumption for thermal power plants have focused on options that are only practical for new power plants the gap addressed in this paper is consideration of the economic efficiency of water consumption substitutes for existing power plants and thus determination of whether water pricing is a potential lever for reducing water demand from these thermal power plants to address this question we assessed economic tradeoffs between water consumption by an existing power plant and two alternatives efficiency improvement in the long run and power output curtailment in the short run the results of the analysis suggest that similar to investments in dry or hybrid cooling technology for new power plants water consumption substitutes available to existing power plants in both the short and long runs are not cost effective under reasonable water prices therefore pricing is not an effective lever for reducing thermal power plant water consumption and water management authorities could benefit from focusing efforts on sectors with more elastic demand however the inelasticity of thermal power plant water demand suggests that these power plants do not require free reallocation of water from senior water rights holders during periods of scarcity and the creation of enabling environments for water lease transactions might unlock greater economic efficiency author contributions w n l and a s s formulated the study w n l created the models completed the analysis and wrote the manuscript a s s supervised the study

8707,we combine soil science and economics to provide an integrated framework of valley bottom wetland vbw selection criteria for surface water quality preservation at the headwater watershed scale when there is no reliable method for quantifying water quality benefits we focus on a french agricultural landscape and more particularly on wet meadows we implement a method of vbw identification based on topographic indices which use threshold values that are calibrated using field measurements this identification criterion allows us to accurately identify both downstream and upstream vbws we then look for criteria with which to prioritize the vbws identified for conservation purposes we concentrate on budget constrained cases and provide a procedure for estimating the cost of conservation for the vbws we finally show that it is very important i to simultaneously consider hydrogeomorphic and cost criteria for the selection in a budget constrained context and ii to go beyond the mean per hectare cost of conservation keywords wetland conservation nutrient retention function prioritizing criteria 1 introduction wetlands provide several ecosystem services 1 despite this degradation of wetlands is widespread and restoration is needed 2 the main source of wetland degradation is linked to the divergence between private interests and public benefits ando and getzner 3 show that there is a marked bias against conserving wetlands that are privately owned applied to agricultural interests van vuuren and roy 4 estimate private and social benefits from generic wetland conservation versus conversion to agriculture to show the need for wetland conservation policies in canada heimlich et al 5 develop the same kind of argument for the u s de laporte 6 furthermore points out the effect of crop prices on wetland conversion in canada whereas van kooten 7 studies the effects of government agricultural support programs one of the well studied services provided by wetlands is the improvement of water quality for instance moshiri 8 gives over an entire book to the impact of constructed wetlands on water quality verhoeven et al 9 concentrate on the functional role of small wetlands in watersheds where the main source of pollution is agriculture they explain that river catchments where the landscape is mainly agricultural often have lower order stream located upstream in the hydrologic network subcatchments i e headwater watersheds that are strongly influenced by runoff from agricultural land use mérot et al 10 furthermore explain that valley bottom wetlands vbws in agricultural landscapes wet meadows are omitted from international ramsar national and regional wetland inventories because they are small and scattered across the rural landscape however they explain that vbws considerably influence hydrology and water quality throughout the watershed area because they are located in the bottomlands of the headwater watershed we will concentrate on these vbws in agricultural landscapes that are mainly intermittent wet meadows turner et al 11 recommend conducting integrated ecological economic analysis for the question of wetland management and policy improvement we focus on an agricultural landscape and address this question at a headwater watershed scale within a framework of integrated research by economists and soil scientists alike the first step is to locate vbws following mérot et al 12 we assume that the primary control on vbws is geomorphological it determines the hydraulic gradient and the presence of high soil water content in valley bottoms intermittent stagnant water thus induced between storm events transforms soil into hydric soil and enables the growth of vegetation that may be specific either to classical wetlands hydrophilic species or to agricultural land use wet meadows the consequence is that the identification of the latter cannot be based on classical remote sensing data that only help in identifying hydrophilic species 13 14 in other words in works based on remote sensing data the vegetation criterion is more important than the soil hydromorphy criterion which is not the case for vbws more particularly the first step in vbw identification is to locate what mérot et al 12 call potential vbws since they represent the maximal theoretical extension of vbws potential vbws are identified on a geomorphological basis topography and parent material here soil science methods are helpful we locate vbws at the headwater watershed scale based on seminal topographic wetness indices that were developed by beven and kirkby 15 such indices are used for predicting vbws in europe 12 and in france 16 taking into account climatic conditions at the headwater watershed scale within an administrative region climate variability is not sufficient and as such we ignore it contrary to berthier et al 16 who determine national threshold values of topographic indices based on the stratification of hydroecoregions we calibrate local threshold values based on field measurements more generally local threshold values are particularly adapted to headwater watersheds characterized by heterogeneous soil surface permeability where the climato topographic index is proved to fail to predict wetland location 12 16 this local calibration enables us to take permeability into account when computing indices much as was done in the seminal proposition by beven and kirkby 15 once potential vbws have been located the second step is to evaluate their capacity to improve or secure a certain water quality yang and weersink 17 use a hydrologic model the annualized agricultural nonpoint source pollution model to examine land retirement targeting for establishing buffers connected to the river the advantage of such a hydrological model is that it enables a precise measurement of water quality taking into account several factors such as the size of the buffer the inflow of pollutants surface flows etc the disadvantage is that it needs a lot of precise data that are not always available agricultural practices or water bodies for instance and that it differs from reality since it remains a model yang and weersink s 17 study was applied to a watershed in canada as stressed by mérot et al 10 in europe the interest in wetlands is new compared with north america the consequence is that such hydrological models are not well developed and that water agencies are far from being able to use them at least in france as a consequence we argue that it is very much worth developing easily implementable methods to help them select wetlands in an effective way when there is no reliable method of quantifying water quality benefits following mérot et al 12 we will approximate the capacity of vbws to improve or secure a certain water quality based on a qualitative classification that can be derived from the literature and that we will sum up in the method section according to lavoux et al 18 water agencies in france spent 58 million on purchasing 13 426 ha of wetlands from 2009 to 2012 1 1 http www zones humides org agir plans et programmes acquisition de 20 000 ha a further 2 5 million went into the purchase and management of land for the purpose of water quality preservation between 2002 and 2011 within the framework of a sensitive natural spaces policy 19 the small amount of financial capital involved raises questions regarding the prioritization of the wetlands to be selected first for conservation purposes literature on biodiversity conservation shows that in a world of limited budgets consideration of the costs of preservation in the prioritizing procedure enables an increase in conserved biodiversity 20 21 we propose to test this idea in the case of wetland conservation for water quality preservation once potential vbws have been located and their capacity to improve or secure water quality evaluated the third step is to estimate the cost of their conservation to the best of our knowledge the literature on wetland prioritization focuses mainly on restoration rather than on conservation see for instance 22 one exception is the work by de laporte et al 23 who propose a cost effective prioritization procedure based on integrated economic and hydrologic modeling however contrary to our focus on vbws they concentrate on generic wetlands located without consideration of their soil characteristics a small number of wetlands were investigated based on an inventory from a water agency furthermore they compute returns to alternative land uses in order to estimate the cost of conservation it is an opportunity cost for data availability reasons we concentrate instead on the purchase costs of vbws i e market prices of agricultural land to do so we follow newburn et al 24 in implementing a hedonic price method to sum up our main contribution to the literature is to provide an integrated framework of vbw conservation strategy involving both economists and soil scientists that could be easily implemented by a local agency in charge of water quality management of a headwater watershed on the one hand our contribution with respect to the water resource economics literature is to provide an analysis regarding the trade offs between decreased costs and increased effectiveness of different strategies of vbw prioritization when there is no reliable method to quantify water quality benefits on the other hand our contribution to the soil science literature is to provide a method of vbw identification based on soil hydromorphy for headwater watersheds characterized by heterogeneous soil surface permeability where it is proved that the climato topographic index fails to predict wetland location the next section describes the data and methods used in this study then we present the results from the estimation of the cost of agricultural lands followed by the results from the classification of vbws with respect to their potential in terms of water quality preservation afterwards we analyze the trade offs between decreased costs and increased effectiveness of different strategies of vbw prioritization the final section sets out the conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 headwater watershed selection and characterization we perform the analysis on two french agricultural headwater watersheds the brenne and the armançon which are located in the administrative division of côte d or equivalent of nuts 2 2 the nomenclature of territorial units nuts for statistics classification is a hierarchical system for dividing up the economic or administrative territory of the european union 3 subdivision 8800 km2 and 533 000 inhabitants northeast france see fig 1 3 3 both headwater watersheds are hydrologically connected downstream north of the map in fig 1 despite what appears in fig 1 because we delimited both watersheds with respect to water monitoring stations upstream from their confluence this area has a continental climate both watersheds have natural and semi natural land cover urbanization cover is approximately 2 5 this land cover is mainly agricultural and is composed of meadows and cereals forest cover is 14 in the armançon and 25 in the brenne watersheds 4 4 source the french national institute of geographic and forest information french topographic database agency for services and payment france and integrated administration and control system european union land parcel identification system 2006 2009 more particularly the brenne watershed covers 781 km2 30 8 of which is meadowland and 22 2 cereal crops there are 20 883 agricultural plots the mean concentration of nitrate observed at the outlet is 19 7 mg l the mean flow is 9 2 m3 s and the mean flux of nitrate is 20 8 kg km2 day 5 5 source seine normandy water agency french surface water quality database 1994 2010 and ministry for the ecological and inclusive transition french hydrometric database the armançon watershed measures 333 km2 45 6 of which is given over to meadows and 17 6 to cereals there are 11 892 agricultural plots the mean concentration of nitrate observed at the outlet is 16 4 mg l the mean flow is 2 5 m3 s and the mean flux of nitrate is 10 1 kg km2 day we specifically chose these headwater watersheds for data availability reasons and because they are characterized by different parent material permeability values which may mean that these vbws differ in terms of their hydrological functioning the parent material of the brenne watershed is mainly 50 permeable limestone 6 6 source the french geological survey french geological database whereas for the armançon it is mainly 50 composed of impermeable marls in both watersheds the most common texture of soils is clay and clay mixed with silt 7 7 source the french soils scientific interest group french soil database hydrologically the brenne is a rounded watershed that is characterized by 780 km of rivers among which 87 have a strahler order 8 8 the strahler order is a standard stream classification proposed by strahler 52 lower than 4 i e they are located upstream in the watershed and 13 are 4th order or higher i e are located downstream see fig 2 9 9 source the french national institute of geographic and forest information french topographic database the armançon is a relatively elongate watershed that is characterized by 376 km of rivers among which 90 have a strahler order lower than 4 and 10 are higher than or equal to 4 the main river does not exceed 5th order in the area under study 2 2 vbw location soil science materials and methods to prioritize vbws for conservation purposes the first step is to locate them to do so either of two main criteria can be used vegetation or soil hydromorphy for instance the french water statute of 1992 defines vbws mainly with respect to vegetation and it is a statutory decree of 2007 that adds soil hydromorphy to the definition here we propose to concentrate on the soil hydromorphy criterion which seems more challenging especially with respect to french legislation and to vbws french standard soil surveys provide an approximation of soil hydromorphy however an accurate description of the spatial distribution of soil hydromorphy requires supplementary mapping techniques because of the methodological and economic constraints of standard soil survey procedures 25 26 the method used for identifying vbws consists of two steps the first step is to compute topographic indices and the second to find local threshold values of these indices i e values for which we can predict the presence of a vbw first to compute topographic indices we begin with the seminal proposal of beven and kirkby 15 by computing a topographic wetness index denoted ibk based on the concept of contributing area to do so we use a data elevation model with 25 m resolution provided by the french national institute of geographic and forest information ign furthermore we follow the methods of mourier et al 27 who recommend computing different topographic indices according to stream order to do so we compute different indices according to the strahler order for streams with strahler orders lower than 4 located upstream in the watershed denoted with the subscript ls for low strahler we compute the index proposed by mérot et al 28 i b k l s l n a t a n α where a denotes the drainage area per unit contour length and tan α the local slope angle for streams with strahler orders greater than or equal to 4 located downstream in the watershed denoted with the subscript hs for high strahler we compute the index proposed by crave and gascuel odoux 29 i b k h s l n a t a n β where tan β denotes the downslope gradient this hydraulic gradient is equal to the ratio of the vertical over the horizontal distances between the sample point and the channel network second we determine threshold value of these indices to establish these thresholds we make field measurements based on transects the transects are located where the bk index decreases as gradually as possible from the stream to the slope furthermore transects are representative of the regional geology and the strahler order the permeability of the parent material is crucial in identifying vbws beven and kirkby 15 recommended considering transmissivity the brenne and armançon watersheds correspond to two different geological settings the former permeable and the latter impermeable we locate transects based on low and high strahler orders ultimately we test 20 transects with different combinations of parent material and strahler order in the field soil hydromorphic features and the measurement of iron manganese concretions 30 are identified on the boundary between well drained and poorly drained places to determine the value of the threshold from which a vbw can be predicted 2 3 vbw qualitative classification for water quality preservation some useful results from the environmental science literature once located the second step in vbw prioritization is to select the vbws that best preserve water quality the nutrient retention function of wetlands is now well known 1 and as such we focus on this function however it remains difficult to precisely quantify nutrient retention for each potential vbw to accommodate such difficulties mérot et al 31 proposed a theoretical qualitative analysis of potential existing and effective wetlands peew that is summed up in fig 3 topographic wetness indices indicate potential vbws they correspond either to agricultural or forest land use since agriculture poses a greater threat of degradation than forestry 5 we focus on vbw conservation of agricultural lands drainage then helps to distinguish between potential and existing vbws this information is not easy to obtain at the plot scale mérot et al 31 approximate drainage by considering that cultivated lands are drained whereas meadows are not we will make the same assumption in the classification proposed by mérot et al 31 potential vbws minus existing vbws designates degraded vbws when focusing on the effectiveness with respect to a specific function some vbws have the potential to become effective again if restored here we concentrate on existing vbws because degraded vbws require a valuation of their restoration costs in addition to their purchase cost hydrogeomorphic criteria are helpful 1 in identifying different types of vbws with respect to the effectiveness of their nutrient retention function see fig 4 first riparian vbws i e those connected to the river are crucial for nutrient retention because of their roles as buffers 32 33 as such connected vbws are more effective than unconnected vbws second parent material plays a crucial role vbws on permeable parent material are more effective than those on impermeable parent material because they induce more exchanges of water between the stream and the riparian zone 34 third montreuil and mérot 35 and montreuil et al 36 37 show that vbws located upstream low strahler orders are crucial for nutrient retention in the brenne and armançon watersheds upstream vbws are located next to agricultural runoffs whereas downstream high strahler orders agricultural plots are fewer and mainly located at the bottom of the valley because the slopes are steeper and more difficult to cultivate as soon as one moves away from the river furthermore it is a well established result that effectiveness is higher upstream than downstream for periods of low discharge 38 this can be explained by the increase in residence time 39 which favors oxygen consumption and denitrification as well by the fact that the hydrographic network is denser upstream than downstream which increases the area of contact between streams and wetlands 40 based on the previous elements we propose to adopt the following hierarchy for the different types of vbws with respect to their effectiveness in the brenne and armançon watersheds connected upstream permeable connected upstream impermeable connected downstream unconnected 2 4 estimating the purchase cost of vbws economic materials and methods the method for estimating the purchase cost of potential vbws follows hilal et al 41 and consists of two steps the first step is related to the estimation of a price function for agricultural land sold in the market based on the observation of real estate transactions we define agricultural land as either a field or a meadow excluding vineyards orchards and forests because we assume that additional information is needed in order to estimate the latter land uses the second step involves predicting the price of agricultural land in 2008 for this purpose we use a land use layer for that year created in hilal et al 41 the land under consideration at this step is not necessarily sold in the market which may be the case for potential vbws the predictions are based on the estimation results obtained in the first step because the land market is more widespread than a watershed we concentrate only on the côte d or administrative division which is the scale at which companies for agricultural real estate management operate first we begin by estimating a hedonic price function of agricultural lands l n p i α β l i γ t i δ s i μ c i ε i where p i denotes the price of the plot i l i the location characteristics of the plot t i its topographic characteristics s i its soil properties c i denotes control variables and ε i is the error term table app 1 summarizes the variables included in the regression qualitative properties were put into quantitative form through dummy variables quantitative variables that exhibit non linear relations with respect to the price were cut according to thresholds that were found by iteration beginning with the aggregations that have the smallest impact on the adjusted r2 this model is an adaptation of the one proposed by hilal et al 41 we use the same data but a different model that we consider to be more appropriate for our headwater watershed analysis the seminal model is adapted in three ways first we simplify soil properties and location characteristics to reduce the number of explanatory variables second we introduce the percentage of the plots under the jurisdiction of a river management scheme because it is linked to the wetland selection problem for water quality preservation third we introduce a new control the percentage of the plot in either one or the other watershed to test whether this model is appropriate for the watershed under study finally location characteristics are measured by the euclidian distance to the town hall travel distance to the intermediate level municipality that provides shops facilities and public and private services a dummy variable that indicates if the municipality is also the regional capital dijon and percentage of the plot covered by a river management scheme topographic characteristics are measured by area altitude and slope soil properties are measured by determining textures very fine fine medium and coarse control variables include the percentage of the plot in either the brenne or armançon watershed the year of the transaction and whether the farmer is the purchaser or not land cover is classified as meadow or arable land to estimate this function we use data that were constructed and described in hilal et al 41 more specifically we focus on 6477 transactions between 1992 and 2008 in côte d or see table app 2 in appendix 1 for the descriptive statistics of this sample the estimation procedure is an ordinary least squares ols procedure where we produce standard errors that are robust to heteroscedasticity and to intra municipal spatial autocorrelation 10 10 we run a white s test 53 leading us to reject the homoscedasticity assumption of the residuals and a moran s i test 54 considering intra municipal proximity to deduce the presence of spatial autocorrelation to do so we compute cluster robust standard errors 42 using a cluster for each municipality 667 in our case second we use the estimated coefficient of the first steps to predict the price of the 42 189 undeveloped agricultural plots of the watersheds under study see table app 3 in appendix 1 for the descriptive statistics of this sample the presence of heteroscedasticity induces some specificity in the prediction procedure for more details see hilal et al 41 more specifically we confirm that the meulenberg 43 proposal is the most appropriate predictor that was proposed in hilal et al 41 according to the computation of a correlation coefficient with the real price and standard mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse indicators 11 11 mae is the average of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation rmse is the square root of the average of squared differences between prediction and actual observation mae and rmse are among the most common indices of predictive accuracy 55 finally we introduce a corrective term such that the predicted price has the following form p i exp α ˆ β ˆ l i γ ˆ t i δ ˆ s i μ ˆ c i 0 5 1 ϑ i σ ˆ ² where ϑ i x i x x 1 x i with x the matrix of explanatory variables and x i the i th row of x and σ denotes the variance of the error term 3 purchasing cost of agricultural land in the armançon and brenne watersheds the results of the hedonic price function estimation are reported in appendix 2 table app 4 provides the estimations with our model and table app 5 the estimations from hilal et al 41 the adjusted r2 increased with respect to the estimations of hilal et al 41 from 71 15 to 71 87 hence the model used for predicting the purchase cost of vbws explains 71 87 of the variance in the log of the price the absence of statistical significance in the estimated coefficients associated with the location of the plots in the brenne or armançon watersheds shows that our estimated model of the land market of côte d or is suitable for those watersheds the estimated coefficients associated with the presence of a river management scheme are of great interest indeed some coefficients are positive and others negative more specifically the fact that an agricultural plot is located in the jurisdiction of the armançon or arroux management schemes lowers its price in contrast we find that the location of an agricultural plot in the jurisdiction of the tille or vouge management schemes increases its price this result is linked to the fact that the armançon and arroux management schemes are restrictive for agricultural activities because their main goal is water quality management the tille and vouge management schemes are concerned with water quantity management because of urbanization they can also be restrictive for agricultural activities in the short term but in the long term as noted by cavailhès and wavresky 44 expected urbanization fully determines agricultural land prices in the long term the expected increase in water resource availability makes urbanization possible and therefore raises agricultural land prices because of conversion possibilities fig 5 illustrates this point indeed red areas representing the highest prices correspond to agricultural plots located within towns or hamlets orange areas correspond to farmland near roads in the valleys yellow areas indicate plots on the outskirts of the towns or hamlets and blue areas are areas with very low population density 4 vbw location and hydrogeomorphic prioritization at the headwater watershed scale the threshold values of topographic wetness indices obtained from field measurements described in more details in the second step of the soil science materials and method section are reported in appendix 3 table app 6 they differ by strahler order and the type of parent material they allow us to predict potential vbw locations more specifically we predict 33 37 of potential vbws in the armançon watershed over the 333 km2 area of the watershed and 10 71 in the brenne watershed over 781 km2 when comparing the location of potential vbws provided by topographic indices with the locations provided by hydromorphy from soil mapping units fig 6 a and b it is apparent that topographic indices locate small vbws in the brenne watershed whereas soil mapping units do not furthermore topographic indices increase the precision of vbw locations whereas soil mapping units provide broad predictions only especially in the armançon watershed another interesting comparison is between the locations of potential vbws predicted at a local scale and the locations predicted at national scale as discussed in berthier et al 16 fig 6a and c local predictions provide more precise locations than national predictions more specifically local predictions can either reduce brenne or increase armançon the extension of vbws obtained from national predictions medde gis sol 45 statistically tested the validity of the predictions proposed in berthier et al 16 they stress that the quality of their vbw predictions is very low for parent material such as those that characterize the brenne and armançon watersheds this emphasizes the relevance of our method for predictions at a local scale let us now move to the prioritizing procedure of these potential vbws for conservation purposes first we focus on agricultural land use in the armançon watershed 66 4 of potential vbws 101 km2 12 12 the difference between potential vbws resulting from the data elevation model and potential vbws considered at the broader scale of the plot is linked to the change of scale of the analysis are located on agricultural land this is the case for 55 of vbws 66 km2 in the brenne watershed second following the functional analysis proposed by mérot et al 31 we remove cultivated lands to obtain existing vbws approximately one quarter of potential agricultural vbws are removed from each watershed this results in 5088 ha of remaining existing vbws in agricultural use in the armançon watershed and 2770 ha in the brenne watershed third we differentiate the remaining existing vbws according to the hydrogeomorphic criteria summed up in fig 4 this includes whether they are connected or unconnected to a river connected upstream or downstream and connected upstream with high or low permeability table 1 and fig 7 summarize the variation obtained within each watershed the two watersheds have very different profiles with respect to their vbws the ratio of unconnected vbws to connected vbws is higher in the armançon watershed than in the brenne watershed among the connected vbws the armançon has more upstream vbws than downstream vbws and the reverse is true in the brenne watershed among upstream connected vbws both watersheds have more vbws with low permeability parent material 5 trade offs between decreased cost and increased effectiveness of vbw conservation fig 5 was generated from the predicted prices of all agricultural plots of the armançon and brenne watersheds we now focus on the prices of existing vbws that are used for agriculture table 2 summarizes the price both in total and on a per hectare basis in each watershed an agency willing to purchase agricultural vbws in both the armançon and brenne watersheds would have to pay 24 5 million which represents nearly one third of the budget for vbw purchases by french water agencies between 2009 and 2012 approximately 60 of this budget would be dedicated to the armançon watershed the global amount of 24 5 million corresponds to a mean unit cost of 3109 ha 2881 ha for the armançon watershed and 3527 ha for the brenne watershed vbws in the armançon watershed are cheaper than those in the brenne watershed but there are more of them the amounts of money involved are so high that it is unavoidable to prioritize the vbws that must be purchased first let us first consider an agency that uses an economic criterion alone for selection this agency selects the least cost vbw first table 3 summarizes the type of vbw selected by such a procedure when the budget earmarked for conservation stands at 100 000 vbws connected upstream with high permeability are not conserved whichever watershed the budget is allocated to the armançon the brenne or both when the 100 000 are spent exclusively on the brenne or on both watersheds vbws connected downstream are not conserved tables app 7 to app 10 yield the same results as table 3 for different budgets we see that all types of vbw are selected in both watersheds and in the armançon only for a budget of 500 000 and that this is the case in the brenne only for a budget of 5 million let us then consider an agency that operates in a cost effective way i e it selects vbws based on the prioritization scale defined by the qualitative classification presented before i e from the bottom of table 2 to the top by least cost the results of such a selection are presented in table 4 the main difference with respect to the previous prioritization process is that vbws connected upstream with high permeability are the only type of vbws to be selected when the budget of 100 000 is either spent on the armançon watershed exclusively or on both watersheds when such a budget is spent exclusively on the brenne watershed some vbws connected upstream with low permeability are also selected while the area is lower the number of discrete wetland units preserved is higher than in table 3 which may have additional water quality benefits since bigger wetlands are not always better in water quality 23 table app 11 to app 14 provides the same results as table 4 for different budgets we see that even for a budget of 10 million not all types of vbws are selected when spent on both watersheds since no unconnected vbws are selected in this specific case this means that the cost effective prioritization process favors more effective but expensive vbws than the least cost prioritization process to sum up implementing a least cost prioritization process reduces water quality preservation even if the conservation area is greater 65 versus 35 ha for a 100 000 budget since the vbws selected are less effective based on a mean per hectare cost table 2 confirms this result since unconnected vbws are the cheapest whereas they are the least effective for water quality preservation 13 13 the criteria are in competition for the entire distribution of the per hectare costs and not only the mean indeed figure app 1 shows that the lorenz curve for unconnected vbws is invariably above the curve for connected vbws consequently focusing on a mean price is a good approximation for connected and unconnected vbws in the brenne and armançon watersheds furthermore a cost effective prioritization process based on mean per hectare costs would lead to vbws connected upstream being selected ahead of vbws connected downstream because 3173 ha is less than 3512 ha and vbws connected upstream are more effective than those connected downstream in the qualitative classification presented before however a surprising a priori result is that the mean per hectare costs are ranked in opposing ways for both the armançon and brenne watersheds when considered separately to understand this counterintuitive result table 1 is helpful on the one hand table 1 shows that the 3512 ha mean is mainly driven by the vbws connected downstream in the brenne watershed which are more widespread and expensive on a mean per hectare basis than in the armançon watershed on the other hand table 1 shows that the 3173 ha mean is mainly driven by the vbws connected upstream in the armançon watershed which are more widespread and less expensive on a mean per hectare basis than in the brenne watershed a policy implication is that the mean per hectare cost should be considered with caution because it can hide local disparities this implication is particularly relevant for agencies operating over widespread jurisdictions the need for caution surrounding the mean per hectare cost criteria is also true within watersheds where the distribution of per hectare costs can differ from the mean see figure app 2 to app 3 that confirm this difference for vbws connected upstream versus downstream and with high versus low permeability this result confirms that the prioritization procedure must be conducted as in tables 3 and 4 ranking vbws from the cheapest to the most expensive by effective types and beginning with the most effective type 6 conclusion and extensions to the best of our knowledge our work is the first to provide an integrated framework of valley bottom wetland conservation for surface water quality preservation in agricultural landscapes this integrated framework consists of combining perspectives from both soil science and economics for the selection of vbws to be conserved first for water quality preservation purposes when there is no reliable method for quantifying water quality benefits our analysis stresses the importance of the simultaneous consideration of hydrogeomorphic and cost criteria when prioritizing vbws for conservation indeed concentrating on either one or the other can reduce the impact on water quality preservation within the framework of a constrained budget a good candidate for conservation is a vbw that has the best possible retention function from a hydrogeomorphic perspective as well as the lowest cost from an economic perspective we identify situations in which these criteria are compatible when the lowest cost vbws are the ones with the best retention function and other situations in which they are competitive when the lowest cost vbws are the ones with the poorest retention function for instance the policy implications are direct in a case in which the criteria are compatible the qualitative method of vbw classification for water quality preservation is adapted to prioritize vbws whereas in a case in which the criteria are competing the prioritization must also consider the cost of conservation an integrated cost effective criterion must then be implemented furthermore our local prediction of vbws allows us to consider upstream vbws in the analysis national predictions are usually not accurate enough to precisely identify upstream vbws and tend to focus on downstream vbws our analysis highlights that upstream vbws can be of great importance for water quality preservation this contribution is particularly relevant in a context of climate change indeed since rainfall variability will increase in the future see for instance 46 downstream vbws will flood more often which will reduce their retention function this work could be extended in several ways first we adopt a lower bound estimation of the costs since we ignore any post purchase costs such as those linked to the maintenance of the land after it is put out of production an extension could consist of collecting and integrating such costs it would then be interesting to work on degraded vbws potential minus existing one from the peew approach however this is beyond the scope of the present paper the conservation method that we consider in this work can be viewed as an extreme method because it includes purchasing land for conservation purposes a more flexible method could focus on restricting land use such restrictions could control the agricultural use of land banning drainage for instance such restrictions also have a cost and can either decrease or increase the nutrient retention function investigating the cost and the impact on the retention function of each restriction of land use could be a second extension of this work it would then be useful to determine the best combination of purchases and agricultural land use restrictions for conserving the nutrient retention function of vbws yang et al 47 propose a hydrologic modeling approach to quantify the efficiency of riparian wetlands in terms of nutrient retention a third extension of our work would be to apply our integrated analysis to hydrology in order to quantify the nutrient retention capacity of vbws once this retention capacity has been quantified it would then be possible to perform a complete cost efficiency analysis by computing the economic value of nutrient retention as byström 48 or grossman 49 do for other types of wetlands however such an exercise would need to be conducted with caution because of the imprecision of methods for estimating the existence value of natural goods such as water 50 51 acknowledgements this work was funded by the french

8707,we combine soil science and economics to provide an integrated framework of valley bottom wetland vbw selection criteria for surface water quality preservation at the headwater watershed scale when there is no reliable method for quantifying water quality benefits we focus on a french agricultural landscape and more particularly on wet meadows we implement a method of vbw identification based on topographic indices which use threshold values that are calibrated using field measurements this identification criterion allows us to accurately identify both downstream and upstream vbws we then look for criteria with which to prioritize the vbws identified for conservation purposes we concentrate on budget constrained cases and provide a procedure for estimating the cost of conservation for the vbws we finally show that it is very important i to simultaneously consider hydrogeomorphic and cost criteria for the selection in a budget constrained context and ii to go beyond the mean per hectare cost of conservation keywords wetland conservation nutrient retention function prioritizing criteria 1 introduction wetlands provide several ecosystem services 1 despite this degradation of wetlands is widespread and restoration is needed 2 the main source of wetland degradation is linked to the divergence between private interests and public benefits ando and getzner 3 show that there is a marked bias against conserving wetlands that are privately owned applied to agricultural interests van vuuren and roy 4 estimate private and social benefits from generic wetland conservation versus conversion to agriculture to show the need for wetland conservation policies in canada heimlich et al 5 develop the same kind of argument for the u s de laporte 6 furthermore points out the effect of crop prices on wetland conversion in canada whereas van kooten 7 studies the effects of government agricultural support programs one of the well studied services provided by wetlands is the improvement of water quality for instance moshiri 8 gives over an entire book to the impact of constructed wetlands on water quality verhoeven et al 9 concentrate on the functional role of small wetlands in watersheds where the main source of pollution is agriculture they explain that river catchments where the landscape is mainly agricultural often have lower order stream located upstream in the hydrologic network subcatchments i e headwater watersheds that are strongly influenced by runoff from agricultural land use mérot et al 10 furthermore explain that valley bottom wetlands vbws in agricultural landscapes wet meadows are omitted from international ramsar national and regional wetland inventories because they are small and scattered across the rural landscape however they explain that vbws considerably influence hydrology and water quality throughout the watershed area because they are located in the bottomlands of the headwater watershed we will concentrate on these vbws in agricultural landscapes that are mainly intermittent wet meadows turner et al 11 recommend conducting integrated ecological economic analysis for the question of wetland management and policy improvement we focus on an agricultural landscape and address this question at a headwater watershed scale within a framework of integrated research by economists and soil scientists alike the first step is to locate vbws following mérot et al 12 we assume that the primary control on vbws is geomorphological it determines the hydraulic gradient and the presence of high soil water content in valley bottoms intermittent stagnant water thus induced between storm events transforms soil into hydric soil and enables the growth of vegetation that may be specific either to classical wetlands hydrophilic species or to agricultural land use wet meadows the consequence is that the identification of the latter cannot be based on classical remote sensing data that only help in identifying hydrophilic species 13 14 in other words in works based on remote sensing data the vegetation criterion is more important than the soil hydromorphy criterion which is not the case for vbws more particularly the first step in vbw identification is to locate what mérot et al 12 call potential vbws since they represent the maximal theoretical extension of vbws potential vbws are identified on a geomorphological basis topography and parent material here soil science methods are helpful we locate vbws at the headwater watershed scale based on seminal topographic wetness indices that were developed by beven and kirkby 15 such indices are used for predicting vbws in europe 12 and in france 16 taking into account climatic conditions at the headwater watershed scale within an administrative region climate variability is not sufficient and as such we ignore it contrary to berthier et al 16 who determine national threshold values of topographic indices based on the stratification of hydroecoregions we calibrate local threshold values based on field measurements more generally local threshold values are particularly adapted to headwater watersheds characterized by heterogeneous soil surface permeability where the climato topographic index is proved to fail to predict wetland location 12 16 this local calibration enables us to take permeability into account when computing indices much as was done in the seminal proposition by beven and kirkby 15 once potential vbws have been located the second step is to evaluate their capacity to improve or secure a certain water quality yang and weersink 17 use a hydrologic model the annualized agricultural nonpoint source pollution model to examine land retirement targeting for establishing buffers connected to the river the advantage of such a hydrological model is that it enables a precise measurement of water quality taking into account several factors such as the size of the buffer the inflow of pollutants surface flows etc the disadvantage is that it needs a lot of precise data that are not always available agricultural practices or water bodies for instance and that it differs from reality since it remains a model yang and weersink s 17 study was applied to a watershed in canada as stressed by mérot et al 10 in europe the interest in wetlands is new compared with north america the consequence is that such hydrological models are not well developed and that water agencies are far from being able to use them at least in france as a consequence we argue that it is very much worth developing easily implementable methods to help them select wetlands in an effective way when there is no reliable method of quantifying water quality benefits following mérot et al 12 we will approximate the capacity of vbws to improve or secure a certain water quality based on a qualitative classification that can be derived from the literature and that we will sum up in the method section according to lavoux et al 18 water agencies in france spent 58 million on purchasing 13 426 ha of wetlands from 2009 to 2012 1 1 http www zones humides org agir plans et programmes acquisition de 20 000 ha a further 2 5 million went into the purchase and management of land for the purpose of water quality preservation between 2002 and 2011 within the framework of a sensitive natural spaces policy 19 the small amount of financial capital involved raises questions regarding the prioritization of the wetlands to be selected first for conservation purposes literature on biodiversity conservation shows that in a world of limited budgets consideration of the costs of preservation in the prioritizing procedure enables an increase in conserved biodiversity 20 21 we propose to test this idea in the case of wetland conservation for water quality preservation once potential vbws have been located and their capacity to improve or secure water quality evaluated the third step is to estimate the cost of their conservation to the best of our knowledge the literature on wetland prioritization focuses mainly on restoration rather than on conservation see for instance 22 one exception is the work by de laporte et al 23 who propose a cost effective prioritization procedure based on integrated economic and hydrologic modeling however contrary to our focus on vbws they concentrate on generic wetlands located without consideration of their soil characteristics a small number of wetlands were investigated based on an inventory from a water agency furthermore they compute returns to alternative land uses in order to estimate the cost of conservation it is an opportunity cost for data availability reasons we concentrate instead on the purchase costs of vbws i e market prices of agricultural land to do so we follow newburn et al 24 in implementing a hedonic price method to sum up our main contribution to the literature is to provide an integrated framework of vbw conservation strategy involving both economists and soil scientists that could be easily implemented by a local agency in charge of water quality management of a headwater watershed on the one hand our contribution with respect to the water resource economics literature is to provide an analysis regarding the trade offs between decreased costs and increased effectiveness of different strategies of vbw prioritization when there is no reliable method to quantify water quality benefits on the other hand our contribution to the soil science literature is to provide a method of vbw identification based on soil hydromorphy for headwater watersheds characterized by heterogeneous soil surface permeability where it is proved that the climato topographic index fails to predict wetland location the next section describes the data and methods used in this study then we present the results from the estimation of the cost of agricultural lands followed by the results from the classification of vbws with respect to their potential in terms of water quality preservation afterwards we analyze the trade offs between decreased costs and increased effectiveness of different strategies of vbw prioritization the final section sets out the conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 headwater watershed selection and characterization we perform the analysis on two french agricultural headwater watersheds the brenne and the armançon which are located in the administrative division of côte d or equivalent of nuts 2 2 the nomenclature of territorial units nuts for statistics classification is a hierarchical system for dividing up the economic or administrative territory of the european union 3 subdivision 8800 km2 and 533 000 inhabitants northeast france see fig 1 3 3 both headwater watersheds are hydrologically connected downstream north of the map in fig 1 despite what appears in fig 1 because we delimited both watersheds with respect to water monitoring stations upstream from their confluence this area has a continental climate both watersheds have natural and semi natural land cover urbanization cover is approximately 2 5 this land cover is mainly agricultural and is composed of meadows and cereals forest cover is 14 in the armançon and 25 in the brenne watersheds 4 4 source the french national institute of geographic and forest information french topographic database agency for services and payment france and integrated administration and control system european union land parcel identification system 2006 2009 more particularly the brenne watershed covers 781 km2 30 8 of which is meadowland and 22 2 cereal crops there are 20 883 agricultural plots the mean concentration of nitrate observed at the outlet is 19 7 mg l the mean flow is 9 2 m3 s and the mean flux of nitrate is 20 8 kg km2 day 5 5 source seine normandy water agency french surface water quality database 1994 2010 and ministry for the ecological and inclusive transition french hydrometric database the armançon watershed measures 333 km2 45 6 of which is given over to meadows and 17 6 to cereals there are 11 892 agricultural plots the mean concentration of nitrate observed at the outlet is 16 4 mg l the mean flow is 2 5 m3 s and the mean flux of nitrate is 10 1 kg km2 day we specifically chose these headwater watersheds for data availability reasons and because they are characterized by different parent material permeability values which may mean that these vbws differ in terms of their hydrological functioning the parent material of the brenne watershed is mainly 50 permeable limestone 6 6 source the french geological survey french geological database whereas for the armançon it is mainly 50 composed of impermeable marls in both watersheds the most common texture of soils is clay and clay mixed with silt 7 7 source the french soils scientific interest group french soil database hydrologically the brenne is a rounded watershed that is characterized by 780 km of rivers among which 87 have a strahler order 8 8 the strahler order is a standard stream classification proposed by strahler 52 lower than 4 i e they are located upstream in the watershed and 13 are 4th order or higher i e are located downstream see fig 2 9 9 source the french national institute of geographic and forest information french topographic database the armançon is a relatively elongate watershed that is characterized by 376 km of rivers among which 90 have a strahler order lower than 4 and 10 are higher than or equal to 4 the main river does not exceed 5th order in the area under study 2 2 vbw location soil science materials and methods to prioritize vbws for conservation purposes the first step is to locate them to do so either of two main criteria can be used vegetation or soil hydromorphy for instance the french water statute of 1992 defines vbws mainly with respect to vegetation and it is a statutory decree of 2007 that adds soil hydromorphy to the definition here we propose to concentrate on the soil hydromorphy criterion which seems more challenging especially with respect to french legislation and to vbws french standard soil surveys provide an approximation of soil hydromorphy however an accurate description of the spatial distribution of soil hydromorphy requires supplementary mapping techniques because of the methodological and economic constraints of standard soil survey procedures 25 26 the method used for identifying vbws consists of two steps the first step is to compute topographic indices and the second to find local threshold values of these indices i e values for which we can predict the presence of a vbw first to compute topographic indices we begin with the seminal proposal of beven and kirkby 15 by computing a topographic wetness index denoted ibk based on the concept of contributing area to do so we use a data elevation model with 25 m resolution provided by the french national institute of geographic and forest information ign furthermore we follow the methods of mourier et al 27 who recommend computing different topographic indices according to stream order to do so we compute different indices according to the strahler order for streams with strahler orders lower than 4 located upstream in the watershed denoted with the subscript ls for low strahler we compute the index proposed by mérot et al 28 i b k l s l n a t a n α where a denotes the drainage area per unit contour length and tan α the local slope angle for streams with strahler orders greater than or equal to 4 located downstream in the watershed denoted with the subscript hs for high strahler we compute the index proposed by crave and gascuel odoux 29 i b k h s l n a t a n β where tan β denotes the downslope gradient this hydraulic gradient is equal to the ratio of the vertical over the horizontal distances between the sample point and the channel network second we determine threshold value of these indices to establish these thresholds we make field measurements based on transects the transects are located where the bk index decreases as gradually as possible from the stream to the slope furthermore transects are representative of the regional geology and the strahler order the permeability of the parent material is crucial in identifying vbws beven and kirkby 15 recommended considering transmissivity the brenne and armançon watersheds correspond to two different geological settings the former permeable and the latter impermeable we locate transects based on low and high strahler orders ultimately we test 20 transects with different combinations of parent material and strahler order in the field soil hydromorphic features and the measurement of iron manganese concretions 30 are identified on the boundary between well drained and poorly drained places to determine the value of the threshold from which a vbw can be predicted 2 3 vbw qualitative classification for water quality preservation some useful results from the environmental science literature once located the second step in vbw prioritization is to select the vbws that best preserve water quality the nutrient retention function of wetlands is now well known 1 and as such we focus on this function however it remains difficult to precisely quantify nutrient retention for each potential vbw to accommodate such difficulties mérot et al 31 proposed a theoretical qualitative analysis of potential existing and effective wetlands peew that is summed up in fig 3 topographic wetness indices indicate potential vbws they correspond either to agricultural or forest land use since agriculture poses a greater threat of degradation than forestry 5 we focus on vbw conservation of agricultural lands drainage then helps to distinguish between potential and existing vbws this information is not easy to obtain at the plot scale mérot et al 31 approximate drainage by considering that cultivated lands are drained whereas meadows are not we will make the same assumption in the classification proposed by mérot et al 31 potential vbws minus existing vbws designates degraded vbws when focusing on the effectiveness with respect to a specific function some vbws have the potential to become effective again if restored here we concentrate on existing vbws because degraded vbws require a valuation of their restoration costs in addition to their purchase cost hydrogeomorphic criteria are helpful 1 in identifying different types of vbws with respect to the effectiveness of their nutrient retention function see fig 4 first riparian vbws i e those connected to the river are crucial for nutrient retention because of their roles as buffers 32 33 as such connected vbws are more effective than unconnected vbws second parent material plays a crucial role vbws on permeable parent material are more effective than those on impermeable parent material because they induce more exchanges of water between the stream and the riparian zone 34 third montreuil and mérot 35 and montreuil et al 36 37 show that vbws located upstream low strahler orders are crucial for nutrient retention in the brenne and armançon watersheds upstream vbws are located next to agricultural runoffs whereas downstream high strahler orders agricultural plots are fewer and mainly located at the bottom of the valley because the slopes are steeper and more difficult to cultivate as soon as one moves away from the river furthermore it is a well established result that effectiveness is higher upstream than downstream for periods of low discharge 38 this can be explained by the increase in residence time 39 which favors oxygen consumption and denitrification as well by the fact that the hydrographic network is denser upstream than downstream which increases the area of contact between streams and wetlands 40 based on the previous elements we propose to adopt the following hierarchy for the different types of vbws with respect to their effectiveness in the brenne and armançon watersheds connected upstream permeable connected upstream impermeable connected downstream unconnected 2 4 estimating the purchase cost of vbws economic materials and methods the method for estimating the purchase cost of potential vbws follows hilal et al 41 and consists of two steps the first step is related to the estimation of a price function for agricultural land sold in the market based on the observation of real estate transactions we define agricultural land as either a field or a meadow excluding vineyards orchards and forests because we assume that additional information is needed in order to estimate the latter land uses the second step involves predicting the price of agricultural land in 2008 for this purpose we use a land use layer for that year created in hilal et al 41 the land under consideration at this step is not necessarily sold in the market which may be the case for potential vbws the predictions are based on the estimation results obtained in the first step because the land market is more widespread than a watershed we concentrate only on the côte d or administrative division which is the scale at which companies for agricultural real estate management operate first we begin by estimating a hedonic price function of agricultural lands l n p i α β l i γ t i δ s i μ c i ε i where p i denotes the price of the plot i l i the location characteristics of the plot t i its topographic characteristics s i its soil properties c i denotes control variables and ε i is the error term table app 1 summarizes the variables included in the regression qualitative properties were put into quantitative form through dummy variables quantitative variables that exhibit non linear relations with respect to the price were cut according to thresholds that were found by iteration beginning with the aggregations that have the smallest impact on the adjusted r2 this model is an adaptation of the one proposed by hilal et al 41 we use the same data but a different model that we consider to be more appropriate for our headwater watershed analysis the seminal model is adapted in three ways first we simplify soil properties and location characteristics to reduce the number of explanatory variables second we introduce the percentage of the plots under the jurisdiction of a river management scheme because it is linked to the wetland selection problem for water quality preservation third we introduce a new control the percentage of the plot in either one or the other watershed to test whether this model is appropriate for the watershed under study finally location characteristics are measured by the euclidian distance to the town hall travel distance to the intermediate level municipality that provides shops facilities and public and private services a dummy variable that indicates if the municipality is also the regional capital dijon and percentage of the plot covered by a river management scheme topographic characteristics are measured by area altitude and slope soil properties are measured by determining textures very fine fine medium and coarse control variables include the percentage of the plot in either the brenne or armançon watershed the year of the transaction and whether the farmer is the purchaser or not land cover is classified as meadow or arable land to estimate this function we use data that were constructed and described in hilal et al 41 more specifically we focus on 6477 transactions between 1992 and 2008 in côte d or see table app 2 in appendix 1 for the descriptive statistics of this sample the estimation procedure is an ordinary least squares ols procedure where we produce standard errors that are robust to heteroscedasticity and to intra municipal spatial autocorrelation 10 10 we run a white s test 53 leading us to reject the homoscedasticity assumption of the residuals and a moran s i test 54 considering intra municipal proximity to deduce the presence of spatial autocorrelation to do so we compute cluster robust standard errors 42 using a cluster for each municipality 667 in our case second we use the estimated coefficient of the first steps to predict the price of the 42 189 undeveloped agricultural plots of the watersheds under study see table app 3 in appendix 1 for the descriptive statistics of this sample the presence of heteroscedasticity induces some specificity in the prediction procedure for more details see hilal et al 41 more specifically we confirm that the meulenberg 43 proposal is the most appropriate predictor that was proposed in hilal et al 41 according to the computation of a correlation coefficient with the real price and standard mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse indicators 11 11 mae is the average of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation rmse is the square root of the average of squared differences between prediction and actual observation mae and rmse are among the most common indices of predictive accuracy 55 finally we introduce a corrective term such that the predicted price has the following form p i exp α ˆ β ˆ l i γ ˆ t i δ ˆ s i μ ˆ c i 0 5 1 ϑ i σ ˆ ² where ϑ i x i x x 1 x i with x the matrix of explanatory variables and x i the i th row of x and σ denotes the variance of the error term 3 purchasing cost of agricultural land in the armançon and brenne watersheds the results of the hedonic price function estimation are reported in appendix 2 table app 4 provides the estimations with our model and table app 5 the estimations from hilal et al 41 the adjusted r2 increased with respect to the estimations of hilal et al 41 from 71 15 to 71 87 hence the model used for predicting the purchase cost of vbws explains 71 87 of the variance in the log of the price the absence of statistical significance in the estimated coefficients associated with the location of the plots in the brenne or armançon watersheds shows that our estimated model of the land market of côte d or is suitable for those watersheds the estimated coefficients associated with the presence of a river management scheme are of great interest indeed some coefficients are positive and others negative more specifically the fact that an agricultural plot is located in the jurisdiction of the armançon or arroux management schemes lowers its price in contrast we find that the location of an agricultural plot in the jurisdiction of the tille or vouge management schemes increases its price this result is linked to the fact that the armançon and arroux management schemes are restrictive for agricultural activities because their main goal is water quality management the tille and vouge management schemes are concerned with water quantity management because of urbanization they can also be restrictive for agricultural activities in the short term but in the long term as noted by cavailhès and wavresky 44 expected urbanization fully determines agricultural land prices in the long term the expected increase in water resource availability makes urbanization possible and therefore raises agricultural land prices because of conversion possibilities fig 5 illustrates this point indeed red areas representing the highest prices correspond to agricultural plots located within towns or hamlets orange areas correspond to farmland near roads in the valleys yellow areas indicate plots on the outskirts of the towns or hamlets and blue areas are areas with very low population density 4 vbw location and hydrogeomorphic prioritization at the headwater watershed scale the threshold values of topographic wetness indices obtained from field measurements described in more details in the second step of the soil science materials and method section are reported in appendix 3 table app 6 they differ by strahler order and the type of parent material they allow us to predict potential vbw locations more specifically we predict 33 37 of potential vbws in the armançon watershed over the 333 km2 area of the watershed and 10 71 in the brenne watershed over 781 km2 when comparing the location of potential vbws provided by topographic indices with the locations provided by hydromorphy from soil mapping units fig 6 a and b it is apparent that topographic indices locate small vbws in the brenne watershed whereas soil mapping units do not furthermore topographic indices increase the precision of vbw locations whereas soil mapping units provide broad predictions only especially in the armançon watershed another interesting comparison is between the locations of potential vbws predicted at a local scale and the locations predicted at national scale as discussed in berthier et al 16 fig 6a and c local predictions provide more precise locations than national predictions more specifically local predictions can either reduce brenne or increase armançon the extension of vbws obtained from national predictions medde gis sol 45 statistically tested the validity of the predictions proposed in berthier et al 16 they stress that the quality of their vbw predictions is very low for parent material such as those that characterize the brenne and armançon watersheds this emphasizes the relevance of our method for predictions at a local scale let us now move to the prioritizing procedure of these potential vbws for conservation purposes first we focus on agricultural land use in the armançon watershed 66 4 of potential vbws 101 km2 12 12 the difference between potential vbws resulting from the data elevation model and potential vbws considered at the broader scale of the plot is linked to the change of scale of the analysis are located on agricultural land this is the case for 55 of vbws 66 km2 in the brenne watershed second following the functional analysis proposed by mérot et al 31 we remove cultivated lands to obtain existing vbws approximately one quarter of potential agricultural vbws are removed from each watershed this results in 5088 ha of remaining existing vbws in agricultural use in the armançon watershed and 2770 ha in the brenne watershed third we differentiate the remaining existing vbws according to the hydrogeomorphic criteria summed up in fig 4 this includes whether they are connected or unconnected to a river connected upstream or downstream and connected upstream with high or low permeability table 1 and fig 7 summarize the variation obtained within each watershed the two watersheds have very different profiles with respect to their vbws the ratio of unconnected vbws to connected vbws is higher in the armançon watershed than in the brenne watershed among the connected vbws the armançon has more upstream vbws than downstream vbws and the reverse is true in the brenne watershed among upstream connected vbws both watersheds have more vbws with low permeability parent material 5 trade offs between decreased cost and increased effectiveness of vbw conservation fig 5 was generated from the predicted prices of all agricultural plots of the armançon and brenne watersheds we now focus on the prices of existing vbws that are used for agriculture table 2 summarizes the price both in total and on a per hectare basis in each watershed an agency willing to purchase agricultural vbws in both the armançon and brenne watersheds would have to pay 24 5 million which represents nearly one third of the budget for vbw purchases by french water agencies between 2009 and 2012 approximately 60 of this budget would be dedicated to the armançon watershed the global amount of 24 5 million corresponds to a mean unit cost of 3109 ha 2881 ha for the armançon watershed and 3527 ha for the brenne watershed vbws in the armançon watershed are cheaper than those in the brenne watershed but there are more of them the amounts of money involved are so high that it is unavoidable to prioritize the vbws that must be purchased first let us first consider an agency that uses an economic criterion alone for selection this agency selects the least cost vbw first table 3 summarizes the type of vbw selected by such a procedure when the budget earmarked for conservation stands at 100 000 vbws connected upstream with high permeability are not conserved whichever watershed the budget is allocated to the armançon the brenne or both when the 100 000 are spent exclusively on the brenne or on both watersheds vbws connected downstream are not conserved tables app 7 to app 10 yield the same results as table 3 for different budgets we see that all types of vbw are selected in both watersheds and in the armançon only for a budget of 500 000 and that this is the case in the brenne only for a budget of 5 million let us then consider an agency that operates in a cost effective way i e it selects vbws based on the prioritization scale defined by the qualitative classification presented before i e from the bottom of table 2 to the top by least cost the results of such a selection are presented in table 4 the main difference with respect to the previous prioritization process is that vbws connected upstream with high permeability are the only type of vbws to be selected when the budget of 100 000 is either spent on the armançon watershed exclusively or on both watersheds when such a budget is spent exclusively on the brenne watershed some vbws connected upstream with low permeability are also selected while the area is lower the number of discrete wetland units preserved is higher than in table 3 which may have additional water quality benefits since bigger wetlands are not always better in water quality 23 table app 11 to app 14 provides the same results as table 4 for different budgets we see that even for a budget of 10 million not all types of vbws are selected when spent on both watersheds since no unconnected vbws are selected in this specific case this means that the cost effective prioritization process favors more effective but expensive vbws than the least cost prioritization process to sum up implementing a least cost prioritization process reduces water quality preservation even if the conservation area is greater 65 versus 35 ha for a 100 000 budget since the vbws selected are less effective based on a mean per hectare cost table 2 confirms this result since unconnected vbws are the cheapest whereas they are the least effective for water quality preservation 13 13 the criteria are in competition for the entire distribution of the per hectare costs and not only the mean indeed figure app 1 shows that the lorenz curve for unconnected vbws is invariably above the curve for connected vbws consequently focusing on a mean price is a good approximation for connected and unconnected vbws in the brenne and armançon watersheds furthermore a cost effective prioritization process based on mean per hectare costs would lead to vbws connected upstream being selected ahead of vbws connected downstream because 3173 ha is less than 3512 ha and vbws connected upstream are more effective than those connected downstream in the qualitative classification presented before however a surprising a priori result is that the mean per hectare costs are ranked in opposing ways for both the armançon and brenne watersheds when considered separately to understand this counterintuitive result table 1 is helpful on the one hand table 1 shows that the 3512 ha mean is mainly driven by the vbws connected downstream in the brenne watershed which are more widespread and expensive on a mean per hectare basis than in the armançon watershed on the other hand table 1 shows that the 3173 ha mean is mainly driven by the vbws connected upstream in the armançon watershed which are more widespread and less expensive on a mean per hectare basis than in the brenne watershed a policy implication is that the mean per hectare cost should be considered with caution because it can hide local disparities this implication is particularly relevant for agencies operating over widespread jurisdictions the need for caution surrounding the mean per hectare cost criteria is also true within watersheds where the distribution of per hectare costs can differ from the mean see figure app 2 to app 3 that confirm this difference for vbws connected upstream versus downstream and with high versus low permeability this result confirms that the prioritization procedure must be conducted as in tables 3 and 4 ranking vbws from the cheapest to the most expensive by effective types and beginning with the most effective type 6 conclusion and extensions to the best of our knowledge our work is the first to provide an integrated framework of valley bottom wetland conservation for surface water quality preservation in agricultural landscapes this integrated framework consists of combining perspectives from both soil science and economics for the selection of vbws to be conserved first for water quality preservation purposes when there is no reliable method for quantifying water quality benefits our analysis stresses the importance of the simultaneous consideration of hydrogeomorphic and cost criteria when prioritizing vbws for conservation indeed concentrating on either one or the other can reduce the impact on water quality preservation within the framework of a constrained budget a good candidate for conservation is a vbw that has the best possible retention function from a hydrogeomorphic perspective as well as the lowest cost from an economic perspective we identify situations in which these criteria are compatible when the lowest cost vbws are the ones with the best retention function and other situations in which they are competitive when the lowest cost vbws are the ones with the poorest retention function for instance the policy implications are direct in a case in which the criteria are compatible the qualitative method of vbw classification for water quality preservation is adapted to prioritize vbws whereas in a case in which the criteria are competing the prioritization must also consider the cost of conservation an integrated cost effective criterion must then be implemented furthermore our local prediction of vbws allows us to consider upstream vbws in the analysis national predictions are usually not accurate enough to precisely identify upstream vbws and tend to focus on downstream vbws our analysis highlights that upstream vbws can be of great importance for water quality preservation this contribution is particularly relevant in a context of climate change indeed since rainfall variability will increase in the future see for instance 46 downstream vbws will flood more often which will reduce their retention function this work could be extended in several ways first we adopt a lower bound estimation of the costs since we ignore any post purchase costs such as those linked to the maintenance of the land after it is put out of production an extension could consist of collecting and integrating such costs it would then be interesting to work on degraded vbws potential minus existing one from the peew approach however this is beyond the scope of the present paper the conservation method that we consider in this work can be viewed as an extreme method because it includes purchasing land for conservation purposes a more flexible method could focus on restricting land use such restrictions could control the agricultural use of land banning drainage for instance such restrictions also have a cost and can either decrease or increase the nutrient retention function investigating the cost and the impact on the retention function of each restriction of land use could be a second extension of this work it would then be useful to determine the best combination of purchases and agricultural land use restrictions for conserving the nutrient retention function of vbws yang et al 47 propose a hydrologic modeling approach to quantify the efficiency of riparian wetlands in terms of nutrient retention a third extension of our work would be to apply our integrated analysis to hydrology in order to quantify the nutrient retention capacity of vbws once this retention capacity has been quantified it would then be possible to perform a complete cost efficiency analysis by computing the economic value of nutrient retention as byström 48 or grossman 49 do for other types of wetlands however such an exercise would need to be conducted with caution because of the imprecision of methods for estimating the existence value of natural goods such as water 50 51 acknowledgements this work was funded by the french

8708,information systems can yield economic value by providing data and analyses that are useful for improving water operations and planning working from a simple typology of water management domains that acknowledges the coupling of supply and demand we characterize the nature of peer reviewed and practitioner research that considers or makes reference to the costs and benefits of water related information the coverage of the reviewed studies is heterogeneous across domains sectors analytical methods type of information considered and geographic regions studies that discuss costs and benefits of additional information relative to a counterfactual represent a minority 39 of those reviewed most of these counterfactual studies use a model prediction 60 and or extrapolate from previous studies 34 far fewer rely on empirical evidence 24 furthermore measurement of and justification for the proposed benefits and costs whether monetized or only quantified remains limited we also comment on several of the more prominent methodologies for analyzing the costs and benefits of investments in improved water information this leads to reflections on a research agenda that would enrich what is known about the economic value of water resources information and thereby perhaps improve decision makers ability to make fruitful investments in information systems in the absence of more rigorous evidence on the contribution that specific systems make to societal well being decision makers will likely remain tentative about further information investments keywords economic analysis value of information water supply water demand valuation 1 introduction water related information systems help planners and managers track data and forecast trends in water quantity and quality as well as a myriad of other changes political economic social and demographic that affect water management decisions 1 1 we define water information systems as any organizing scheme that includes one or more of the following components provided in support of water management or water dependent decisions data collection data analysis and or forecasting and dissemination and use of results from data analyses see table 1 for additional details these data are analyzed and disseminated to decision makers operating in a wide range of sectors of the economy for example water information systems hereafter referred to as wis inform operations and planning decisions for power generation agriculture industry municipalities and other sectors and allow decision makers to weigh high level development and sectoral tradeoffs 1 yet new information systems only yield economic benefits if the data generated by them are actually used to improve water management or end user decisions unfortunately and perhaps surprisingly evidence documenting such improvements remains scarce this lack of evidence undermines the ability of decision makers to justify decisions to invest in new wis compared to projects with more easily observed or measured benefits this systematic review aims to characterize and provide a critical perspective on research in both the peer reviewed and practitioner literature that pertains to the socio economic impacts of wis while investments in information systems abound in water resources and environmental applications 2 there has been little synthesis of the literature on the benefits they generate most prior reviews only consider specific elements of wis for example reviews by hallegatte 3 and rogers and tsirkunov 5 focus specifically on how hydro meteorological data may produce more effective early warning systems and thereby reduce disaster losses a few more broad spanning reviews have analyzed the socio economic benefits of climate forecasts 6 global meteorological and hydrological services 7 and weather and climate services 8 to organize our description of the existing research on wis we first develop a general typology of water related domains that acknowledges the systems coupling of supply and demand and then describe coverage of prior work in terms of domains water using sectors the type of information considered and geographic regions our search approach for articles is not limited to the economics literature we hypothesized that there would be a great deal of relevant and useful literature on the qualitative or quantitative though not necessarily monetized value of information systems in disciplines other than economics in this broad perspective of our review we find that the coverage of studies related to wis is heterogeneous along the dimensions described above studies that discuss costs and benefits of additional information relative to a counterfactual based on existing partial limited or defective information represent a surprisingly small fraction 2 2 counterfactual studies are those that compare situations with a new and enhanced information system to situations without these new systems in an effort to establish their impacts the counterfactual represents the non intervention status quo as such it should represent the situation that would exist without the new wis investment whether that status quo represents none or only inadequate information furthermore among studies that include counterfactual comparisons measurement of the proposed benefits and costs remains limited and monetization of these is especially rare following our characterization of work in the prior literature we discuss some of the more well developed methodologies that provide input to ex ante economic analysis of the value of wis investments these procedures draw on work by meteorologists and economists 9 researchers developing the theory and methods of nonmarket valuation 10 and on value of information theory 11 12 unsurprisingly given its interest in promoting the use of weather related information and data systems the world meteorological organization wmo has the most extensive guidance on appropriate methods 13 still our reading of that guidance is that important challenges remain relating to i behavioral assumptions implicit in predicted responses to information ii prediction of the counterfactual trajectory that would occur in the absence of information investments and iii analysis of the economic consequences of such an alternative trajectory we believe that these gaps related to understanding of real world behavioral responses no information counterfactuals and the real economic implications of improved information highlight the need for more careful empirically based evaluation work to quantify and monetize the effects of wis investments in the absence of such evidence on the contribution of information systems to societal well being decision makers may be skeptical about the value of such investments relative to projects that lead to more tangible and measurable outcomes of course this claim is somewhat speculative still we note that demand for economic assessments of meteorological and climate related investments did help spawn a large literature focused on the value of those particular systems from the 1970s through the early 2000s clements et al 14 and wmo 13 provide thorough reviews of that literature the world bank has attempted to apply similar methods specifically related to water management but we believe that the research supporting such methods is considerably more fragmented than it is for hydrometeorological hydromet systems for reasons that we discuss in our review in making this argument we also acknowledge that support for work to discern the impacts of wis projects must be commensurate to the scope of these investments especially in light of the methodological challenges inherent in doing wis evaluation and valuation work these challenges imply that it will not always be justifiable to spend significant resources on ex post evaluations this clearly has important implications for a research agenda that could generate more useful evidence on the value of information systems investments though decision makers may find some aspects of our review to be interesting and useful the primary audience for our paper is the community of water researchers and especially economists who have the potential to contribute to gaps in knowledge related to the impacts of wis water resources researchers often bemoan the inadequacy of existing data indeed this is one of the most common information problems noted in the articles we reviewed without perhaps fully considering whether more or improved data would be likely to affect their studies conclusions and whether improved analyses would translate into better decision making following a brief explanation of wis and their costs and benefits in section 2 we describe the article selection and coding process in section 3 we summarize the coverage of studies related to water information and the measurement of costs and benefits of wis in section 4 in section 5 we comment on the most important existing methodologies we discuss the implications of the systematic review and propose focal areas for continuing research in section 6 section 7 concludes 2 background on wis wis inform and support short and long term water planning by facilitating the collection analysis and dissemination of data that is important for both water management and end uses this section explains our general typology of water related domains the process of water information collection analysis dissemination and use the costs and benefits of wis and the historical origins of analyses of the economic benefits of resource related information systems 2 1 typology of water data domains we first develop a typology of water related domains that acknowledges the systems coupling of supply and demand for water fig 1 in the water resource management context data can be collected across these four major domains 1 drivers and characteristics of supply or water availability 2 drivers and characteristics of water demand 3 water allocation processes that allow supply to be used to meet demand and 4 return flow pollution from users back into natural systems and the environment 3 3 some may find inclusion of allocation and return flow domains to be somewhat arbitrary that is it will generally be difficult to distinguish these from demand and supply yet we believe that their explicit inclusion is useful because there are many instances where supply and demand may be well matched but allocation or pollution is problematic for example under economic water scarcity conditions where the cost of supplying water to end users is prohibitive we also believe that it is useful for emphasizing the role that information and data can play in tracking the coupling of the natural system that generates water resources and the human system that relies on those resources data on supply drivers focus on the processes that generate water quantity and affect source water quality while data on demand drivers focus on demographic patterns and consumption behaviors as well as sectoral development trends data from the allocation domain then correspond to monitoring or measurement of the processes that aim to match supply with demand including metering pumping and other infrastructure operations data finally data related to return flows measure quantities not consumed by users e g seepage and discharge amounts and any changes in their quality e g pollution monitoring in addition many wis include institutional data describing various actors involvement in the various functions of water management this review is generally organized around this domain typology but we also track how wis studies span various water using sectors we prefer to use the domain typology as the organizing framework for the review because it flexibly accommodates a wide variety of sectors relying on water resources which may have more or less importance in specific contexts in addition the domain typology is useful because information systems investments may have negative distributional impacts on some sectors especially when guiding reallocation of water to higher value sectors and uses as such determining that benefits within a particular domain are net positive does not imply that outcomes for each economic sector will similarly be favorable this realization runs counter to what many studies appear to assume i e that more information is good for everyone and can help to explain why key water resource systems stakeholders who perhaps benefit from information asymmetries sometimes resist information investments 2 2 process of water data collection analysis dissemination and use wis can include four functions data collection analysis including modeling and forecasting dissemination and use that allow stakeholders to access and understand data pertaining to these four domains and incorporate it into decision making table 1 all four functions may not be fully successful in all wis which also need not cover all domains advocates for investments in wis emphasize the importance of open and transparent data sharing processes which are key to achieving broad coverage and multi sectoral use of the information they provide 2 3 costs and benefits of wis governments institutions private businesses and the general public use water information in a wide variety of decision making processes collecting analyzing disseminating and using data is costly however on the benefit side wis investments may help improve water planning and operations by enhancing understanding of supply demand and actual resource use if users in the private sector create their own information and data systems we can assume that they are privately benefiting for public use systems funded by the government or donors which are the primary object of our review costs that are necessary to create successful wis must be weighed carefully against the benefits they generate for the range of parties who use them tables 2 and 3 present typologies of these costs and benefits of wis systems 4 4 appendix a provides this list of benefits by sector for those who prefer a sectoral perspective costs are further grouped into the four functions specified above collection analysis dissemination and use costs other than for data collection are not differentiated by domain because analysis dissemination and use costs are qualitatively similar across domains data collection costs require investments in user surveys for demand assessment or installation and operation and maintenance of monitoring equipment and sensors for supply monitoring or for tracking allocation and return flows as well as construction of databases for storage of data for all domains analysis requires training and paying salaries for those working with data investment in computers and software and maintenance of servers on which to store raw and processed data communications specialists are needed for dissemination of information derived from these data which also requires investment in distribution of results through print online in person and general media outlets finally use often requires specialized training and education to allow beneficiaries to understand the value of the information provided meanwhile the benefits of wis can be grouped into those that pertain to short term management and those related to enhanced long term planning in the supply and demand domains data collected and analyzed using information systems may directly enable managers to enhance production and manage beneficiaries needs information systems may also directly improve monitoring activities and adaptive capacity for instance during a drought governments may enforce more stringent water permitting requirements and invest in programs to incentivize efficient irrigation technologies information can also ensure long term supply sustainability by facilitating sectoral re allocation and informing investment strategies at the regional or national scale to address water supply constraints in the allocation domain wis can be critical in identifying operational and distributional inefficiencies leading to pinpointing of losses of various types although often undervalued information systems can help with managing return flows the last domain in water scarce regions where water quantity and quality are critical to ecosystem health and downstream users enhanced efficiency and water management may ultimately reduce water consumers costs 2 4 historical origins of analyses of the economic benefits of information systems the origins of analyses of the economic benefits of information systems can be traced back to several intellectual traditions chief among these are the theory of public investment and cost benefit analysis and the subfield of economics focused on the value of information 15 the public goods dimensions of investments in climate data collection infrastructure were first recognized in the context of better anticipating wind patterns and their effects on navigation and trade 16 the first economic studies aiming to value meteorological information systems did not appear until the middle of the 20th century however around the time that cost benefit analysis and nonmarket valuation methodologies were maturing 9 13 17 5 5 these studies are sometimes referred to using the term meteorological economics which represents the climate and weather monitoring aspects of the investments that were being made at the time these studies coincided with a significant investment push in weather and climate monitoring and prediction services by national governments and multilateral institutions across the globe for these publicly managed services in the pre satellite era costs were typically low and the investments were widely viewed as deserving public support much has changed since the establishment of these early low cost information systems however over the past 40 years technological progress has led to the proliferation of different hydromet products and capabilities for analyzing data these more sophisticated techniques tend to be more costly than the early systems meanwhile national level budgets for such services have tightened 18 as information systems and predictive capabilities have improved valuation studies to inform decisions about the net benefits of specific investments in data collection evaluation and predictive modeling have arguably become more essential 19 20 indeed efforts to conduct ex ante economic analysis of actual information system investments largely originated while planning a large world bank modernization investment in the russian hydrometeorological service in the early 2000s 5 21 the basic idea in the world bank s analyses of this and similar investments was to determine how the production of information contributes to a value chain of social environmental and financial services analysts rightfully emphasized the importance of the specific decision context to which information contributes 13 6 6 the guiding wmo document focuses particularly on hydro meteorological services and includes an exhaustive list of services sourced from ref 85 which may be particularly valuable for those who are unsure whether they have identified all possible impacts the world bank subsequently developed perhaps the most extensive guidance on ex ante economic analysis which nonetheless mostly applies to hydro meteorological applications i e the supply domain in its handbook on valuing weather and climate the wmo advises that analysts semi quantitatively or qualitatively describe and analyze benefits that cannot be feasibly monetized a practice that is generally consistent with standard practice in cost benefit analysis 13 and also suggests that valuation challenges are often significant given the growing importance of investments in wis other than hydrometeorological monitoring there is a need to more comprehensively review the use and nature of existing literature on the subject there are at least two reasons for this need first it is not clear how extensive the literature on the effect and economics of information systems really is and taking stock of the coverage of this literature is an important first step towards understanding current theory and practice related to this issue second there may be important deficiencies in the methods that are being used discussion of these challenges may lead to improvements and extensions of current approaches 3 methodology for the review 3 1 selection of articles with these objectives in mind a team of researchers followed a systematic literature search and compilation procedure to select and review articles included in this study the procedure used consisted of the following six steps 1 four small teams of researchers searched for english language articles from a pre specified set of interdisciplinary research databases academic search complete jstor lexisnexis web of science proquest worldcat and econlit using a consistent set of key words and search parameters 7 7 the key words were terms or boolean combinations of terms that included words such as water resources data supply demand allocation return flows benefits and costs for example searching web of science for water resources data information supply yielded 3 relevant articles 86 88 the full set of combinations of key words are detailed in appendix b non economics articles were included because we anticipated that other disciplines and traditions might provide useful insights on the value of information investments each team focused on one domain according to the typology described in section 2 different researchers within each team independently searched different databases 2 articles from the independent searches were combined by one of the researchers from each team into one list 3 articles from the combined searches were then screened by one researcher from each team for further review based on title and abstract information relevant to the cost and benefits of water related information systems duplicates appearing in multiple lists were removed 4 two researchers then worked independently to review the full text of all selected articles they extracted and coded information according to consistent criteria described in section 3 2 if the articles were relevant though inter coder discrepancies were not assessed and may have reduced data quality the two reviewers met periodically to discuss and achieve a common understanding whenever needed 5 these same researchers examined reference lists for the articles reviewed in step 4 if other articles not previously selected were deemed relevant the full text of these newly identified articles was also reviewed 6 three researchers combined search results from each domain and removed duplicates one researcher from the team also searched for grey literature posted in the public domain by completing a general google search and by searching online databases of reports articles and economic analyses from the world bank and other major regional development banks e g asian development bank african development bank as shown in fig 2 the initial key word search yielded 3320 combined results we selected 764 articles to review based on title and abstract screening in step 2 and duplicate removal in step 3 though we adopted a fairly broad definition of benefits related to information systems e g studies did not need to quantify or monetize these we next excluded 501 articles from the further review because the full text did not address the topic of the systemic review or because the articles were inaccessible 8 8 for example a case study by the world meteorological organization about flow routing was deemed irrelevant other irrelevant articles were discarded in similar fashion thus we initially reviewed 261 articles in step 4 in step 5 we added 140 new articles that were identified from references in the other previously reviewed papers and that could be located in step 6 we removed 20 duplicates when combining across domains in total the review thus included 381 distinct studies published between 1973 and 2016 9 9 the online supplement includes the full database for the articles and additional details of the coding scheme for the articles 3 2 description of the review criteria data extraction we coded the thematic and methodological content of the studies according to a set of criteria described more fully in appendix c in brief we coded the scope of studies according to domain corresponding to the typology described in section 2 the benefited sector s power generation agriculture irrigation municipal industrial and ecosystem or other non consumptive uses like recreation the type s of information or data considered in the studies hydrological climatic water use socio economic and institutional political geographic scope region and or country mention of information problems references to the costs of data collection problems with model realism lack of sufficient data data sharing challenges and political or strategic behavior around information and other methodological content either quantitative qualitative or both methodologies or tools used economic physical hydrologic and other analytical models other types of social science methodologies and review papers here we note that we apply these as mutually exclusive categories based on our assessment of the principal approach that is used as defined in table 4 10 10 thus a hydrological modeling analysis that nonetheless includes a side calculation related to economic benefits would be classified as a physical hydrologic study and not an economic one inclusion and type of counter factual comparisons appendix d shows a decision tree that was used by the research assistants to identify the type of counter factual analysis if any used in the study counter factual analyses were classified as expert extrapolation model or empirically based empirically based counterfactuals were further classified as before after cross sectional difference in difference natural experiments or randomized control trials and whether costs and benefits were quantified and monetized given that these along with identification of impacts are two of the three key steps in all economic appraisals 22 3 3 summary of studies retained three quarters of the articles and reports included in this systematic review were peer reviewed articles from over 100 distinct peer reviewed journals the leading journals represented in these articles were meteorological applications 11 water resources research 10 agricultural systems 10 water resources management 9 the journal of hydrology 9 the journal of the american water resources association 9 and physics and chemistry of the earth 9 the remaining 25 of documents were from the grey literature including 42 project or investment reports and 35 world bank sources 4 results 4 1 coverage of studies related to wis by domain and sector this section describes the coverage of studies related to wis across domains sectors information types information problems and geographies a description of the coverage of this literature is useful for understanding potential gaps or blindspots although it may also reflect a lack of importance vis à vis underrepresented aspects we begin by considering the distribution of the four major domains in the reviewed studies 1 supply 2 demand 3 water allocation to users and 4 return flows from users back into natural systems and the environment fig 3 a in line with the need for a holistic approach to water management most studies spanned multiple domains only 31 of studies reviewed considered a single domain for example draper et al 23 address supply demand and allocation domains in their development of an optimization model for managing california s water resources reflecting the particular depth of the literature on hydromet systems the water supply domain has received the most coverage in the literature 86 of reviewed studies compared to the demand 67 allocation 47 of reviewed studies or return flow domains 32 of reviewed studies the most studied sector is agriculture 81 municipal and industrial and ecosystem and other non consumptive uses e g recreation fisheries sediment control are considered in about 60 of studies power generation e g hydropower thermal cooling receives less attention 38 of all studies see fig 3b agriculture is particularly sensitive to weather variations and many studies of the value of hydromet systems focus on this sector similarly to the domains analysis most studies 62 covered more than one sector indicating that researchers do typically recognize water related interdependencies for example callahan et al 24 analyzed the policy implications of climate change forecasts for each of our categories of economic sectors in the columbia river basin in the northwestern u s turning to the types of data commonly used in wis we note consistency with the domain focus on supply in that these include climatic and hydrologic information more often than water use socio economic and institutional or political information fig 3c this difference is perhaps also consistent with the supply side and infrastructure paradigm that has traditionally dominated the field of water resources planning and management relative to demand management 25 unsurprisingly studies in the allocation and return flows domains more commonly include water use or socio economic information only about 19 of the studies used just one of these information types e g taylor et al 26 only focus on hydrology in describing the development of an open standard for time series data on water flows more than half of the studies mentioned information problems fig 3d and some e g wwap 27 included extensive discussion of these insufficient data was the most widely cited information problem but the literature lacks nuance in discussing this issue specifically many studies suggest that additional data is desirable because it aids water management and planning but meanwhile fail to consider the cost of that additional information relative to the value it would add additionally problems with data sharing and strategic information behavior are more prevalent in sectors that tend to induce larger tradeoffs either due to significant water abstraction e g for irrigation or alteration of river flows in the case of power generation 28 30 consistent with general trends in scholarship in multiple fields 32 33 there are more studies from industrialized than from lower and middle income countries fig 4 across all domains the sectoral focus of studies about wis may reflect different water resource development priorities studies from africa tend to focus on agriculture those from the middle east north africa on the municipal industrial sector and those from south asia on power generation finally it is important to note that 65 of the reviewed studies were global in scale while 294 were primarily country specific leaving only 22 studies that had a different e g regional or basin geographic scope 4 2 conceptualization of economic benefits and costs in reviewed studies there is substantial variation in how studies of wis attempt to specify and measure economic costs and benefits just over half 55 of studies take a purely quantitative approach in their analysis 22 use mixed methods and 23 are exclusively qualitative this pattern holds across domains and sectors here we describe the types of methodologies used discuss whether and how counterfactual analyses are used to establish impacts and provide additional detail on the quantification and monetization of economic benefits examples illustrating the variation along these different dimensions across studies are provided in table 5 these illustrate the diversity of applications in the wis literature within and across general and discipline specific methodologies as well as in the metrics or indicators used to assess the value of information 4 2 1 coverage of specific methodologies as noted above in section 3 we classified the methods of studies assessing the benefits and costs of wis into five distinct categories economic approaches non economic decision analytical tools physical hydrologic models non economic social science approaches and reviews or other methods table 4 several observations emerge from this examination of methods first perhaps unsurprisingly studies with economic methodologies are much more likely than other types to include counterfactual analysis and to discuss quantified and monetized costs and benefits or cost effectiveness measures in non economic studies counterfactual comparisons are rather uncommon only about 20 of such studies included any counterfactual analysis studies using non economic social science methods are least likely to quantify benefits but physical or hydrologic studies are the least likely to monetize them indeed water managers often think in terms of satisficing physical targets rather than maximizing economic value 40 still evaluation of how wis can improve such satisficing should still entail counterfactual comparisons we next turn to the mapping of methodologies to domains fig 5 a sectors fig 5b and data sources fig 5c physical hydrologic and review methodologies are least common across all domains reflecting our focus on economic implications economic studies are most common across all domains followed by other decision and analytical tools and then non economic social science methodologies the latter represent a somewhat greater proportion among studies in the allocation domain however while economic methods reach their greatest proportion in studies that encompass the supply domain with respect to sectors economic analyses and models tend to include analysis of multiple sectors this partly reflects the widespread use of hydro economic analyses which is often used to evaluate multiple interconnections between water resources and socio economic systems for example rosegrant et al 36 develop a hydro economic model for determining water allocation in chile s maipo river basin and address the two most relevant sectors to water consumption in the basin agriculture and municipal industrial meanwhile physical hydrologic studies are most common in the agriculture and non consumptive use sectors this could be because agriculture and ecosystems are usually lower value or nonmarket uses of water that may be harder to evaluate using economic methods 41 turning to data sources we observe that disciplinary focus generally tends to align well with data types non economic social analyses are more likely than other methodologies to include institutional data and are comparable to economic methods in their inclusion of socio economic data only a few physical hydrologic models incorporate socio economic and institutional information for example gikonyo et al 39 studied the effectiveness of water user associations wuas in kenya in the context of reduced regional streamflow interestingly economic methodologies are highly represented among studies that use climate and water supply data suggesting that economists are perhaps effective in integrating such information into their analyses a point to which we return later below fig 5c 4 2 2 types of counterfactual analyses counterfactual studies as described in footnote 2 compare situations with a new and enhanced information system to situations without these new systems in an effort to establish wis impacts across all studies included in this review only 39 included any type of counterfactual comparison as noted above we categorized these counterfactual comparisons into different types among these model based approaches to counterfactual comparisons were most prevalent of the studies that include counterfactual comparisons multiple approaches were possible in each study 34 conducted simple extrapolations from other prior studies 11 11 this means that the change relative to the counterfactual was not predicted for the system at hand based on a model or other approach that accounted for its specific characteristics but was rather approximated based on results from some other study or studies which corresponds to a very basic type of benefits transfer 60 compared results to modeled predictions 23 were based on expert opinions and 24 tried to measure differences with and without information systems using empirical observations to restate the latter statistic alternatively 76 of studies that measured wis impacts with a counterfactual comparison did not actually observe impacts most of the empirically based estimates or 6 of studies overall conducted outcomes comparisons without a control group using a before after design a smaller proportion compared outcomes using natural experiments survey based willingness to pay measures or cross site comparisons not surprisingly given the logistical challenge such methods would pose no studies were found that used high quality quasi experimental or experimental methods of program evaluation studies including the supply domain and or using climatic information had the greatest number of counterfactual studies as a fraction of all studies considering each domain perhaps reflecting the historical focus on evaluation for hydrometeorological investments counterfactual comparisons were relatively evenly distributed across sectors with only slightly more such studies considering the power and agricultural sectors somewhat surprisingly to us counterfactual analysis was more common in the grey literature than in the academic literature this may be an artifact of the approach we used to sample the grey literature specifically we concentrated on world bank and other similar agency documents and on wmo reports many of which drove the efforts to operationalize the methods for economic assessment in an attempt to evaluate the economic impacts of their investments in recipient countries weather and disaster prediction systems there is potential for a conflict of interest in this literature because these studies are often used to justify new investments world bank estimations of benefit cost ratios of wis investments in various countries differ by several orders of magnitude from 1 4 1 and 70 1 the ranges for estimates of both costs and benefits in these and other studies e g from avoided damages and increased productivity are correspondingly large 42 44 12 12 for example a sampling of world bank project studies included in our review had costs ranging from 8 3 million to 110 million with costs depending on the size of the country and its level of existing technological sophistication 45 43 49 the world bank recently estimated a need of about 1 billion of investment to support hydromet projects in the developing world 3 cited annual costs to operate and maintain existing technically sophisticated hydromet systems and services in europe range from 8 million euros 9 84 million to 82 3 million pounds sterling 115 42 million 59 89 by comparison the usgs spends approximately 114 million per year just to operate its system of stream gauges in the us 90 interestingly the national hydrologic warning council in the us did not feel the need to contrast the costs of nws s river and flood forecasts when speaking to the program s benefits 91 we discuss the benchmarking methods used by the world bank in greater detail in section 5 noting here that their application is uncommon in the academic literature it is possible that academics realize the challenges inherent in doing counterfactual analysis of wis and hence prefer to avoid such comparisons in their studies 4 2 3 quantification and monetization of costs and benefits in non economic studies this sub section focuses on quantification and monetization in non economic studies more detailed discussion of quantification in economic studies follows in section 5 fewer than half 40 of non economic studies present quantitative measures of costs and benefits roughly half of these 20 overall then monetize these there is considerable variation in quantification and monetization across methods table 4 for example while many physical hydrologic studies quantify benefits only a single hydrologic study monetized them 46 looking across domains we find that studies encompassing supply and demand drivers are more likely to quantify and monetize wis costs and benefits studies including the return flow domain which focus on the consequences of human water use and their impacts often on water quality are by far the least likely to quantify or monetize costs or benefits these relative differences likely reflect the challenges associated with measuring and valuing return flows relative to more standard economic measures of supply and demand the development of a model of the impact of nonpoint source pollution on rice production in the u s in manley et al 37 is an exception these authors quantify the contribution of such contamination to reducing agricultural output the rates of quantification and monetization were similar across most sectors 23 29 of non economic studies quantified costs and benefits and 10 13 monetized them for all but the power sector for the latter only 13 of non economic studies quantified costs and benefits and a mere 7 mostly in the grey literature monetized them indeed among academic studies that addressed power generation most were institutional analyses or demonstrated decision analytical tools applying to several sectors for example the assessment by aron et al 47 of programs addressing nonpoint source pollution in the u s considers the effects of power generation on watershed function additionally the discussion by sorg et al 30 of institutional solutions to water allocation in the syr darya river basin in central asia addresses hydropower in the broader context of cross sectoral collaboration and a regional strategy to address climate change 5 review of economic methodologies pertaining to wis as discussed above there is extensive literature suggesting that wis investments provide diverse and substantial benefits this section focuses on the minority of studies included in our review that then apply economic methods to quantify and monetize these benefits we discuss if and how these studies construct their counterfactuals before discussing in more detail the main challenges we see in application of these methods 5 1 quantification and monetization of costs and benefits in economic studies unsurprisingly among economic studies the rates of quantification of impacts 82 of studies in this category and of their monetization 73 are higher than for the other methodologies table 4 a majority 61 or 101 studies of these include a clearly described counterfactual analysis the remainder are unclear about how the wis changes outcomes and or what change is actually being valued the breakdown of approaches to construct counterfactuals recall that several methods may apply in a single study is as follows 26 rely on expert judgment 41 extrapolate from other studies 59 make predictions using a model pertaining to the system of interest and 21 rely on empirical evidence among the latter most 13 of 21 are before after comparisons with no control group given the temporal variability inherent in water resource systems such before after comparisons are likely inadequate for establishing impacts following the before after comparisons studies relying on empirical counterfactuals most commonly used valuation methods 10 studies among these economic studies the domain breakdown is shown in table 6 as with the non economic studies the rates of quantification and monetization coverage are highest in the supply domain as is done in clements et al 14 studies covering return flows are less likely to quantify and monetize benefits relevant examples include world bank project evaluations 48 47 and assessment by lamei et al 35 of desalination in egypt the rates of quantification and monetization were similar across sectors 81 88 of economic studies quantified costs and benefits in papers covering a particular sector and 69 75 monetized them 5 2 conceptual and measurement challenges in this literature we expected economic studies of wis to include careful counterfactual analysis because the three key steps in any economic appraisal are 1 identification 2 quantification and 3 monetization of impacts all relative to a no intervention status quo or baseline 22 reviewing the literature though it quickly became apparent that each of these steps presents significant conceptual and measurement challenges measuring changes relative to an unobserved state of the world i e a baseline that persists after the investment in which the new information systems investments being considered would not have been present is challenging for several reasons first these intervention attributable changes in water systems planning and management occur in a stochastic environment and often play out over a very long period of time accounting for such slow and stochastic dynamics in evaluations would require researchers to design or observe a long term dynamic counterfactual 50 second linkages between information and economic impacts may not be obvious without use of advanced analytical tools e g hydrological or hydro economic models which speaks to the need for economists working on such problems to better understand such tools in places where information systems are lacking however such tools are also often lacking it also follows that this complexity and the stochastic nature of climate variability may preclude users ability to take useful welfare improving actions in response to information 51 third and relatedly the connection between a wis investment and changes in the behavior of water managers or end users should never be assumed even if models or experts believe that information derived from wis should induce such changes in order to improve social well being there is ample applied micro economics literature suggesting a range of behavioral failures in processing information 52 53 such literature should motivate additional work on behavioral responses to wis investments of which there are only a few examples which indicate less than universal adoption 54 57 fourth user costs which are necessary for modeling interpretation and decision making and particularly transactions costs are often not considered perhaps because they are also difficult to estimate and predict these costs and their distributional consequences which are often borne by the public sector are important in that they can create obstacles to full uptake and realization of the benefits of wis investments one particular category of distributional consequences that figures prominently in the literature as impeding river basin cooperation is the loss of strategic advantage that comes with having access to information that others do not have 14 57 58 for example an upstream country may be able to exploit information asymmetries to mask its increasing water use by claiming that water flows have declined there are also important measurement challenges related to quantification and monetization of costs and benefits of wis one particularly notable feature of the economic and general literature on information systems is its overwhelming focus on climate information and a relative lack of attention to demand side information or to data on allocations and return flows the latter blind spots neglect the coupling we sought to consider in our initial conceptual model for considering the value of wis and almost certainly inhibit more effective water resources management our review also revealed that convenient indicators based on available data sources almost surely selected for pragmatic reasons in the interest of reducing the evaluation burden are often preferred over economically relevant ones one particularly prominent example of use of convenient measures is the so called benchmarking methodology when applying this approach the analyst first estimates baseline losses from resource related risks in a particular context as a fraction of gdp he or she then specifies preventable losses under status quo and modernization scenarios based on expert assessments that consider country specific estimates of weather and climate conditions structure of the economy and other factors 13 a related approach aims to estimate the impacts of wis in weather dependent sectors relying on a broader set of experts from specific economic domains 59 60 sometimes complemented with stakeholder interviews 61 unfortunately the assumptions underlying the benchmarking approach and this alternative are usually not based on a realistic or evidence based understanding of how wis information is actually used several studies rely on decision making models combined with resource models to sidestep the subjectivity inherent in relying on expert judgment to construct counterfactuals the advantage of such methods building on comments included above is their ability to better represent the complex dynamics inherent in socio environmental systems such as water resources 62 63 apparently counterintuitive results may be observed when the full context of resource use is not clear for example river flow has declined in central kenya even as rainfall has increased due to greater upstream water abstraction land use change and new infrastructure 39 applied to evaluation of wis investments such agent based or similar models assume that users optimize behaviors in response to new information according to a benefits maximization function a variant on this approach is to maximize a non monetary outcome e g crop yield or minimum risk of a damaging flood level such models have been used to consider changes in farming in rain fed systems 64 irrigation schedules in arid regions 65 water allocation from different sources to a range of stakeholders 23 and operating rules for hydropower infrastructures 66 67 these approaches are appealing in their mechanistic representation of systems and the role that information can play in reducing uncertainty their weakness however is assuming that systems are optimally managed with and without information which may not be the case because of wrm personnel attitudes cognitive limitations limiting comprehension of complex information or institutional behaviors as noted previously assumptions that information will be used effectively should be tested finally many wis improvements have consequences that are not strictly financial necessitating the use of nonmarket valuation techniques to recover shadow values of costs and benefits to avoid this thorny issue some analysts focus only on market values e g avoided financial costs from damaging natural hazards or increased revenues from improved production efficiency 13 such studies only offer partial assessments of economic value however in the wis context researchers have used cost effectiveness analysis when monetization was deemed infeasible or too costly 3 but some have used nonmarket valuation two examples related to mortality reductions from early warning systems come from econometric studies exploiting variation in exposure to such alerts 68 69 one study estimated household willingness to pay for current and improved weather information using a discrete choice experiment and the contingent valuation method 70 others have used benefit transfer methods to estimate avoided asset mortality and added value losses 3 13 13 a particularly interesting example of large scale benefit transfer in the information systems domain estimates the value of early warning systems for climate hazards 3 there are obviously a range of difficulties related to nonmarket valuation and benefit transfer in the context of wis investments and the number of studies using such techniques is relatively small more specifically though stated preference methods have appeal in providing more complete valuation measures and require very few assumptions about how respondents would use information they may be prone to hypothetical or other well known survey biases 71 revealed preference measures meanwhile are uncommon in this literature and pertain to specific circumstances that are not particularly relevant to the intervention of interest and benefits transfer estimates may induce site specific biases 72 6 discussion in this section we discuss the implications of our review and lay out a research agenda on the role of information systems investments in improving water resource management outcomes 6 1 implications several general observations emerge from our systematic review analysis first we believe that there is a need for more and better research on the economic value of wis though we acknowledge that such research will not always be appropriate and needs to be tailored to the scale of investment decisions being made full costing of wis is rather infrequent as user transaction and training or institutional costs and constraints are frequently ignored meanwhile methods for measuring the benefits of wis are inconsistent current predictions of impacts are too reliant on expert opinions or on decision models the latter in particular are useful for understanding physical systems behavior but too often rely on untested assumptions about behavioral responses to information given gaps in knowledge about the contribution of information systems to societal well being it seems likely that decision makers will remain skeptical about the value of such investments relative to projects that lead to more tangible and measurable improvements similar points have been made in the overlapping extensive literature related to climate services information and responses to it 14 building on this point our second observation is that it will generally be hard to know ex ante how consumers of newly accessible data will actually use it in practice this is an important obstacle to sound economic analysis of the value of wis for planning purposes at best it suggests that estimates in the literature represent an upper bound on these systems value planning documents acknowledge this issue and suggest that in many cases it will be necessary to make assumptions about users responses which often requires expertise or understanding with respect to specific users including the rate of adoption of specific services 13 yet a substantial body of research suggests that individuals do not always respond to information in expected ways as noted previously this may be due to lack of understanding 73 or the inability of information to adequately resolve uncertainty 74 75 for example due to the stochastic nature of environmental systems 76 deficiencies in the quality of information may not be the greatest impediment to its use rather what is needed is better and more salient delivery of its messages 77 while experts often have insight on likely responses theory based empirical evaluation and testing in this domain could inform development of a new generation of more realistic models of the effects of wis investments third political dynamics may influence how users see investments in and evaluations of wis decision makers may not be interested in the purported benefits of investments in wis if they think the current situation provides them informational advantages if distributional aspects are not addressed explicitly cost benefit analyses that predict a potential pareto improvement or a gain for society on aggregate regardless of its distributional consequences may be ignored since those benefiting from information asymmetries may oppose these investments indeed strategic problems with information sharing have been discussed in the literature 58 78 79 fourth our analysis of coverage by domain sector and information type indicate some important gaps the relatively lesser focus on allocation and return flows which concern the management of water resources rather than simply describing supply and demand perhaps reflects an untested assumption that information will actually be used to enhance management the least studied economic sector was power generation possibly reflecting the private nature of this enterprise and proprietary aspects of its information but also suggesting that the implications of better information for understanding water energy interactions have been underexplored 14 14 indeed many sectors rely heavily on energy e g urban water management where energy is an important cost factor in water and wastewater infrastructures operations 92 some have suggested that institutional constraints from operational mandates that impede managerial flexibility affect the use of information for decision making in this context 80 6 2 research agenda this discussion of implications leads us to identify six gaps that we believe would benefit from additional research largely around the need to develop test and apply better methods to evaluation of wis investments 1 counterfactual comparisons perhaps most importantly we feel that research on the value of wis should focus on improved use and construction of counterfactual comparisons including empirical and convergent validity tests of different approaches research on different types of investments and in different contexts could consider whether expert and model based predictions of changes are consistent and when practical whether such predictions conform to observed changes based on simple before after cross site comparisons or more sophisticated differences in differences natural experiments empirical tests to be most useful such comparisons would inform development of a theory explaining how and when different types of predictions may be problematic such that the most appropriate analytic methods are used for planning investments in wis 2 theory development and small scale testing on behavioral responses to information provision in the context of water management and use research on the value of wis should draw on established models of behavior existing in several disciplines e g economics political science psychological sociological etc to develop theory based evaluations of the effectiveness of different forms of information provision such research will improve our understanding of which users respond to newly accessible data and how further it will clarify how continuing uncertainty can affect management and social welfare outcomes though such theory based testing is likely to be infeasible in the real world we believe that experimental games and survey based simulation experiments with decision makers could be structured to test hypotheses about the value and likely uses of information 3 greater use of stated preference sp valuation methods there is also considerable scope for improving estimates of the value of wis using nonmarket valuation survey methods such as the contingent valuation cv method and discrete choice experiments 81 survey methods have been applied relatively infrequently for valuing information systems several interesting applications consider the value of better weather forecasts and warnings to households farmers and commercial stakeholders 34 60 70 82 84 though careful design must be used to minimize bias as discussed in section 5 sp approaches do have the advantage of yielding complete estimates of beneficiaries true feelings and expectations about what information has to offer in contrast to expert or model based estimates or revealed preference measures survey methods are also far cheaper than design and testing through policy or even simulation based experiments stated responses can also be assessed against revealed behaviors e g purchases of supplies following announcement of hazards 4 scale and scope issues as noted in our comments on the geographic coverage of studies pertaining to wis there is a common mismatch between the scale of investment being considered and the likely impacts of wis scale is often assessed as national for country investment programs or support or global for some world bank investments reflecting investment cost perspectives but non monetized use or transactions costs and the benefits of wis may more accurately apply at a watershed level this mismatch can lead to incomplete understanding of the economics of these investments a similar issue may apply to scope our review focused on information from a water management and use perspective but information systems investments may also help other sectors for example much has been written in the literature about the value of hydromet systems in transportation and energy sector applications unrelated to water ways of better assessing such overlap could be considered in future work 5 political advantages and dynamics the extant literature does not fully consider the political advantages and dynamics that affect investments in and evaluations of wis in some cases decision makers may over or underestimate strategic advantages from information asymmetries meanwhile valuations may be depressed by agents desire to free ride on the public goods aspects of wis investments research in this domain could draw on mixed methods using surveys and interviews with key stakeholders to understand perceptions of these aspects model based analysis to assess the likely accuracy of those perceptions and incentive compatible preference revelation mechanisms such as group voting games 6 specific costs and benefits of using wis finally research on costs should do more to measure user transaction and training costs more explicitly more studies on the effects of information systems on allocation and return flows management are needed to fill gaps in the existing literature which focused most heavily on the drivers of supply and demand 7 conclusion investing in improved wis only yields economic benefits if the data generated by these new systems actually improves water management decisions we conducted a systematic review to better understand the coverage of studies related to the economics of these investments we found great variation in the coverage of such studies across water management domains water dependent sectors information types and geographies domains related to water supply and demand drivers receive considerably more coverage than allocation and return flows consistent with an underrepresentation of behavioral responses to information in the literature among sectors agriculture municipal and non consumptive use sectors receive more attention than power generation wis studies tend to include much more hydrologic and water use information relative to socio economic institutional or political data and data insufficiency is a widely cited problem in this literature just over half of all reviewed papers in the economic literature pertaining to wis investments included counterfactual comparisons that allow assessment of their value added our review of the principal methods for measuring and monetizing the benefits and costs in such studies revealed a number of conceptual and measurement challenges related to the complex system dynamics and stochastic nature of water resources the prevalence of untested behavioral assumptions about responses to information the role of strategic behavior and understanding of the nonmarket impacts of wis projects in fact in the absence of improvements in measurement related to these challenges we believe that decision makers will likely remain skeptical about the value of such investments relative to projects that lead to more tangible and measurable improvements we thus close by emphasizing the need for research on the effects and value of wis investments acknowledging that such research will not be feasible in all circumstances we believe that this future research should be oriented towards improving predictions of how resource management systems involving people and water respond to improved information especially those requiring significant investment acknowledgments we are grateful to the world bank for providing support for the research

8708,information systems can yield economic value by providing data and analyses that are useful for improving water operations and planning working from a simple typology of water management domains that acknowledges the coupling of supply and demand we characterize the nature of peer reviewed and practitioner research that considers or makes reference to the costs and benefits of water related information the coverage of the reviewed studies is heterogeneous across domains sectors analytical methods type of information considered and geographic regions studies that discuss costs and benefits of additional information relative to a counterfactual represent a minority 39 of those reviewed most of these counterfactual studies use a model prediction 60 and or extrapolate from previous studies 34 far fewer rely on empirical evidence 24 furthermore measurement of and justification for the proposed benefits and costs whether monetized or only quantified remains limited we also comment on several of the more prominent methodologies for analyzing the costs and benefits of investments in improved water information this leads to reflections on a research agenda that would enrich what is known about the economic value of water resources information and thereby perhaps improve decision makers ability to make fruitful investments in information systems in the absence of more rigorous evidence on the contribution that specific systems make to societal well being decision makers will likely remain tentative about further information investments keywords economic analysis value of information water supply water demand valuation 1 introduction water related information systems help planners and managers track data and forecast trends in water quantity and quality as well as a myriad of other changes political economic social and demographic that affect water management decisions 1 1 we define water information systems as any organizing scheme that includes one or more of the following components provided in support of water management or water dependent decisions data collection data analysis and or forecasting and dissemination and use of results from data analyses see table 1 for additional details these data are analyzed and disseminated to decision makers operating in a wide range of sectors of the economy for example water information systems hereafter referred to as wis inform operations and planning decisions for power generation agriculture industry municipalities and other sectors and allow decision makers to weigh high level development and sectoral tradeoffs 1 yet new information systems only yield economic benefits if the data generated by them are actually used to improve water management or end user decisions unfortunately and perhaps surprisingly evidence documenting such improvements remains scarce this lack of evidence undermines the ability of decision makers to justify decisions to invest in new wis compared to projects with more easily observed or measured benefits this systematic review aims to characterize and provide a critical perspective on research in both the peer reviewed and practitioner literature that pertains to the socio economic impacts of wis while investments in information systems abound in water resources and environmental applications 2 there has been little synthesis of the literature on the benefits they generate most prior reviews only consider specific elements of wis for example reviews by hallegatte 3 and rogers and tsirkunov 5 focus specifically on how hydro meteorological data may produce more effective early warning systems and thereby reduce disaster losses a few more broad spanning reviews have analyzed the socio economic benefits of climate forecasts 6 global meteorological and hydrological services 7 and weather and climate services 8 to organize our description of the existing research on wis we first develop a general typology of water related domains that acknowledges the systems coupling of supply and demand and then describe coverage of prior work in terms of domains water using sectors the type of information considered and geographic regions our search approach for articles is not limited to the economics literature we hypothesized that there would be a great deal of relevant and useful literature on the qualitative or quantitative though not necessarily monetized value of information systems in disciplines other than economics in this broad perspective of our review we find that the coverage of studies related to wis is heterogeneous along the dimensions described above studies that discuss costs and benefits of additional information relative to a counterfactual based on existing partial limited or defective information represent a surprisingly small fraction 2 2 counterfactual studies are those that compare situations with a new and enhanced information system to situations without these new systems in an effort to establish their impacts the counterfactual represents the non intervention status quo as such it should represent the situation that would exist without the new wis investment whether that status quo represents none or only inadequate information furthermore among studies that include counterfactual comparisons measurement of the proposed benefits and costs remains limited and monetization of these is especially rare following our characterization of work in the prior literature we discuss some of the more well developed methodologies that provide input to ex ante economic analysis of the value of wis investments these procedures draw on work by meteorologists and economists 9 researchers developing the theory and methods of nonmarket valuation 10 and on value of information theory 11 12 unsurprisingly given its interest in promoting the use of weather related information and data systems the world meteorological organization wmo has the most extensive guidance on appropriate methods 13 still our reading of that guidance is that important challenges remain relating to i behavioral assumptions implicit in predicted responses to information ii prediction of the counterfactual trajectory that would occur in the absence of information investments and iii analysis of the economic consequences of such an alternative trajectory we believe that these gaps related to understanding of real world behavioral responses no information counterfactuals and the real economic implications of improved information highlight the need for more careful empirically based evaluation work to quantify and monetize the effects of wis investments in the absence of such evidence on the contribution of information systems to societal well being decision makers may be skeptical about the value of such investments relative to projects that lead to more tangible and measurable outcomes of course this claim is somewhat speculative still we note that demand for economic assessments of meteorological and climate related investments did help spawn a large literature focused on the value of those particular systems from the 1970s through the early 2000s clements et al 14 and wmo 13 provide thorough reviews of that literature the world bank has attempted to apply similar methods specifically related to water management but we believe that the research supporting such methods is considerably more fragmented than it is for hydrometeorological hydromet systems for reasons that we discuss in our review in making this argument we also acknowledge that support for work to discern the impacts of wis projects must be commensurate to the scope of these investments especially in light of the methodological challenges inherent in doing wis evaluation and valuation work these challenges imply that it will not always be justifiable to spend significant resources on ex post evaluations this clearly has important implications for a research agenda that could generate more useful evidence on the value of information systems investments though decision makers may find some aspects of our review to be interesting and useful the primary audience for our paper is the community of water researchers and especially economists who have the potential to contribute to gaps in knowledge related to the impacts of wis water resources researchers often bemoan the inadequacy of existing data indeed this is one of the most common information problems noted in the articles we reviewed without perhaps fully considering whether more or improved data would be likely to affect their studies conclusions and whether improved analyses would translate into better decision making following a brief explanation of wis and their costs and benefits in section 2 we describe the article selection and coding process in section 3 we summarize the coverage of studies related to water information and the measurement of costs and benefits of wis in section 4 in section 5 we comment on the most important existing methodologies we discuss the implications of the systematic review and propose focal areas for continuing research in section 6 section 7 concludes 2 background on wis wis inform and support short and long term water planning by facilitating the collection analysis and dissemination of data that is important for both water management and end uses this section explains our general typology of water related domains the process of water information collection analysis dissemination and use the costs and benefits of wis and the historical origins of analyses of the economic benefits of resource related information systems 2 1 typology of water data domains we first develop a typology of water related domains that acknowledges the systems coupling of supply and demand for water fig 1 in the water resource management context data can be collected across these four major domains 1 drivers and characteristics of supply or water availability 2 drivers and characteristics of water demand 3 water allocation processes that allow supply to be used to meet demand and 4 return flow pollution from users back into natural systems and the environment 3 3 some may find inclusion of allocation and return flow domains to be somewhat arbitrary that is it will generally be difficult to distinguish these from demand and supply yet we believe that their explicit inclusion is useful because there are many instances where supply and demand may be well matched but allocation or pollution is problematic for example under economic water scarcity conditions where the cost of supplying water to end users is prohibitive we also believe that it is useful for emphasizing the role that information and data can play in tracking the coupling of the natural system that generates water resources and the human system that relies on those resources data on supply drivers focus on the processes that generate water quantity and affect source water quality while data on demand drivers focus on demographic patterns and consumption behaviors as well as sectoral development trends data from the allocation domain then correspond to monitoring or measurement of the processes that aim to match supply with demand including metering pumping and other infrastructure operations data finally data related to return flows measure quantities not consumed by users e g seepage and discharge amounts and any changes in their quality e g pollution monitoring in addition many wis include institutional data describing various actors involvement in the various functions of water management this review is generally organized around this domain typology but we also track how wis studies span various water using sectors we prefer to use the domain typology as the organizing framework for the review because it flexibly accommodates a wide variety of sectors relying on water resources which may have more or less importance in specific contexts in addition the domain typology is useful because information systems investments may have negative distributional impacts on some sectors especially when guiding reallocation of water to higher value sectors and uses as such determining that benefits within a particular domain are net positive does not imply that outcomes for each economic sector will similarly be favorable this realization runs counter to what many studies appear to assume i e that more information is good for everyone and can help to explain why key water resource systems stakeholders who perhaps benefit from information asymmetries sometimes resist information investments 2 2 process of water data collection analysis dissemination and use wis can include four functions data collection analysis including modeling and forecasting dissemination and use that allow stakeholders to access and understand data pertaining to these four domains and incorporate it into decision making table 1 all four functions may not be fully successful in all wis which also need not cover all domains advocates for investments in wis emphasize the importance of open and transparent data sharing processes which are key to achieving broad coverage and multi sectoral use of the information they provide 2 3 costs and benefits of wis governments institutions private businesses and the general public use water information in a wide variety of decision making processes collecting analyzing disseminating and using data is costly however on the benefit side wis investments may help improve water planning and operations by enhancing understanding of supply demand and actual resource use if users in the private sector create their own information and data systems we can assume that they are privately benefiting for public use systems funded by the government or donors which are the primary object of our review costs that are necessary to create successful wis must be weighed carefully against the benefits they generate for the range of parties who use them tables 2 and 3 present typologies of these costs and benefits of wis systems 4 4 appendix a provides this list of benefits by sector for those who prefer a sectoral perspective costs are further grouped into the four functions specified above collection analysis dissemination and use costs other than for data collection are not differentiated by domain because analysis dissemination and use costs are qualitatively similar across domains data collection costs require investments in user surveys for demand assessment or installation and operation and maintenance of monitoring equipment and sensors for supply monitoring or for tracking allocation and return flows as well as construction of databases for storage of data for all domains analysis requires training and paying salaries for those working with data investment in computers and software and maintenance of servers on which to store raw and processed data communications specialists are needed for dissemination of information derived from these data which also requires investment in distribution of results through print online in person and general media outlets finally use often requires specialized training and education to allow beneficiaries to understand the value of the information provided meanwhile the benefits of wis can be grouped into those that pertain to short term management and those related to enhanced long term planning in the supply and demand domains data collected and analyzed using information systems may directly enable managers to enhance production and manage beneficiaries needs information systems may also directly improve monitoring activities and adaptive capacity for instance during a drought governments may enforce more stringent water permitting requirements and invest in programs to incentivize efficient irrigation technologies information can also ensure long term supply sustainability by facilitating sectoral re allocation and informing investment strategies at the regional or national scale to address water supply constraints in the allocation domain wis can be critical in identifying operational and distributional inefficiencies leading to pinpointing of losses of various types although often undervalued information systems can help with managing return flows the last domain in water scarce regions where water quantity and quality are critical to ecosystem health and downstream users enhanced efficiency and water management may ultimately reduce water consumers costs 2 4 historical origins of analyses of the economic benefits of information systems the origins of analyses of the economic benefits of information systems can be traced back to several intellectual traditions chief among these are the theory of public investment and cost benefit analysis and the subfield of economics focused on the value of information 15 the public goods dimensions of investments in climate data collection infrastructure were first recognized in the context of better anticipating wind patterns and their effects on navigation and trade 16 the first economic studies aiming to value meteorological information systems did not appear until the middle of the 20th century however around the time that cost benefit analysis and nonmarket valuation methodologies were maturing 9 13 17 5 5 these studies are sometimes referred to using the term meteorological economics which represents the climate and weather monitoring aspects of the investments that were being made at the time these studies coincided with a significant investment push in weather and climate monitoring and prediction services by national governments and multilateral institutions across the globe for these publicly managed services in the pre satellite era costs were typically low and the investments were widely viewed as deserving public support much has changed since the establishment of these early low cost information systems however over the past 40 years technological progress has led to the proliferation of different hydromet products and capabilities for analyzing data these more sophisticated techniques tend to be more costly than the early systems meanwhile national level budgets for such services have tightened 18 as information systems and predictive capabilities have improved valuation studies to inform decisions about the net benefits of specific investments in data collection evaluation and predictive modeling have arguably become more essential 19 20 indeed efforts to conduct ex ante economic analysis of actual information system investments largely originated while planning a large world bank modernization investment in the russian hydrometeorological service in the early 2000s 5 21 the basic idea in the world bank s analyses of this and similar investments was to determine how the production of information contributes to a value chain of social environmental and financial services analysts rightfully emphasized the importance of the specific decision context to which information contributes 13 6 6 the guiding wmo document focuses particularly on hydro meteorological services and includes an exhaustive list of services sourced from ref 85 which may be particularly valuable for those who are unsure whether they have identified all possible impacts the world bank subsequently developed perhaps the most extensive guidance on ex ante economic analysis which nonetheless mostly applies to hydro meteorological applications i e the supply domain in its handbook on valuing weather and climate the wmo advises that analysts semi quantitatively or qualitatively describe and analyze benefits that cannot be feasibly monetized a practice that is generally consistent with standard practice in cost benefit analysis 13 and also suggests that valuation challenges are often significant given the growing importance of investments in wis other than hydrometeorological monitoring there is a need to more comprehensively review the use and nature of existing literature on the subject there are at least two reasons for this need first it is not clear how extensive the literature on the effect and economics of information systems really is and taking stock of the coverage of this literature is an important first step towards understanding current theory and practice related to this issue second there may be important deficiencies in the methods that are being used discussion of these challenges may lead to improvements and extensions of current approaches 3 methodology for the review 3 1 selection of articles with these objectives in mind a team of researchers followed a systematic literature search and compilation procedure to select and review articles included in this study the procedure used consisted of the following six steps 1 four small teams of researchers searched for english language articles from a pre specified set of interdisciplinary research databases academic search complete jstor lexisnexis web of science proquest worldcat and econlit using a consistent set of key words and search parameters 7 7 the key words were terms or boolean combinations of terms that included words such as water resources data supply demand allocation return flows benefits and costs for example searching web of science for water resources data information supply yielded 3 relevant articles 86 88 the full set of combinations of key words are detailed in appendix b non economics articles were included because we anticipated that other disciplines and traditions might provide useful insights on the value of information investments each team focused on one domain according to the typology described in section 2 different researchers within each team independently searched different databases 2 articles from the independent searches were combined by one of the researchers from each team into one list 3 articles from the combined searches were then screened by one researcher from each team for further review based on title and abstract information relevant to the cost and benefits of water related information systems duplicates appearing in multiple lists were removed 4 two researchers then worked independently to review the full text of all selected articles they extracted and coded information according to consistent criteria described in section 3 2 if the articles were relevant though inter coder discrepancies were not assessed and may have reduced data quality the two reviewers met periodically to discuss and achieve a common understanding whenever needed 5 these same researchers examined reference lists for the articles reviewed in step 4 if other articles not previously selected were deemed relevant the full text of these newly identified articles was also reviewed 6 three researchers combined search results from each domain and removed duplicates one researcher from the team also searched for grey literature posted in the public domain by completing a general google search and by searching online databases of reports articles and economic analyses from the world bank and other major regional development banks e g asian development bank african development bank as shown in fig 2 the initial key word search yielded 3320 combined results we selected 764 articles to review based on title and abstract screening in step 2 and duplicate removal in step 3 though we adopted a fairly broad definition of benefits related to information systems e g studies did not need to quantify or monetize these we next excluded 501 articles from the further review because the full text did not address the topic of the systemic review or because the articles were inaccessible 8 8 for example a case study by the world meteorological organization about flow routing was deemed irrelevant other irrelevant articles were discarded in similar fashion thus we initially reviewed 261 articles in step 4 in step 5 we added 140 new articles that were identified from references in the other previously reviewed papers and that could be located in step 6 we removed 20 duplicates when combining across domains in total the review thus included 381 distinct studies published between 1973 and 2016 9 9 the online supplement includes the full database for the articles and additional details of the coding scheme for the articles 3 2 description of the review criteria data extraction we coded the thematic and methodological content of the studies according to a set of criteria described more fully in appendix c in brief we coded the scope of studies according to domain corresponding to the typology described in section 2 the benefited sector s power generation agriculture irrigation municipal industrial and ecosystem or other non consumptive uses like recreation the type s of information or data considered in the studies hydrological climatic water use socio economic and institutional political geographic scope region and or country mention of information problems references to the costs of data collection problems with model realism lack of sufficient data data sharing challenges and political or strategic behavior around information and other methodological content either quantitative qualitative or both methodologies or tools used economic physical hydrologic and other analytical models other types of social science methodologies and review papers here we note that we apply these as mutually exclusive categories based on our assessment of the principal approach that is used as defined in table 4 10 10 thus a hydrological modeling analysis that nonetheless includes a side calculation related to economic benefits would be classified as a physical hydrologic study and not an economic one inclusion and type of counter factual comparisons appendix d shows a decision tree that was used by the research assistants to identify the type of counter factual analysis if any used in the study counter factual analyses were classified as expert extrapolation model or empirically based empirically based counterfactuals were further classified as before after cross sectional difference in difference natural experiments or randomized control trials and whether costs and benefits were quantified and monetized given that these along with identification of impacts are two of the three key steps in all economic appraisals 22 3 3 summary of studies retained three quarters of the articles and reports included in this systematic review were peer reviewed articles from over 100 distinct peer reviewed journals the leading journals represented in these articles were meteorological applications 11 water resources research 10 agricultural systems 10 water resources management 9 the journal of hydrology 9 the journal of the american water resources association 9 and physics and chemistry of the earth 9 the remaining 25 of documents were from the grey literature including 42 project or investment reports and 35 world bank sources 4 results 4 1 coverage of studies related to wis by domain and sector this section describes the coverage of studies related to wis across domains sectors information types information problems and geographies a description of the coverage of this literature is useful for understanding potential gaps or blindspots although it may also reflect a lack of importance vis à vis underrepresented aspects we begin by considering the distribution of the four major domains in the reviewed studies 1 supply 2 demand 3 water allocation to users and 4 return flows from users back into natural systems and the environment fig 3 a in line with the need for a holistic approach to water management most studies spanned multiple domains only 31 of studies reviewed considered a single domain for example draper et al 23 address supply demand and allocation domains in their development of an optimization model for managing california s water resources reflecting the particular depth of the literature on hydromet systems the water supply domain has received the most coverage in the literature 86 of reviewed studies compared to the demand 67 allocation 47 of reviewed studies or return flow domains 32 of reviewed studies the most studied sector is agriculture 81 municipal and industrial and ecosystem and other non consumptive uses e g recreation fisheries sediment control are considered in about 60 of studies power generation e g hydropower thermal cooling receives less attention 38 of all studies see fig 3b agriculture is particularly sensitive to weather variations and many studies of the value of hydromet systems focus on this sector similarly to the domains analysis most studies 62 covered more than one sector indicating that researchers do typically recognize water related interdependencies for example callahan et al 24 analyzed the policy implications of climate change forecasts for each of our categories of economic sectors in the columbia river basin in the northwestern u s turning to the types of data commonly used in wis we note consistency with the domain focus on supply in that these include climatic and hydrologic information more often than water use socio economic and institutional or political information fig 3c this difference is perhaps also consistent with the supply side and infrastructure paradigm that has traditionally dominated the field of water resources planning and management relative to demand management 25 unsurprisingly studies in the allocation and return flows domains more commonly include water use or socio economic information only about 19 of the studies used just one of these information types e g taylor et al 26 only focus on hydrology in describing the development of an open standard for time series data on water flows more than half of the studies mentioned information problems fig 3d and some e g wwap 27 included extensive discussion of these insufficient data was the most widely cited information problem but the literature lacks nuance in discussing this issue specifically many studies suggest that additional data is desirable because it aids water management and planning but meanwhile fail to consider the cost of that additional information relative to the value it would add additionally problems with data sharing and strategic information behavior are more prevalent in sectors that tend to induce larger tradeoffs either due to significant water abstraction e g for irrigation or alteration of river flows in the case of power generation 28 30 consistent with general trends in scholarship in multiple fields 32 33 there are more studies from industrialized than from lower and middle income countries fig 4 across all domains the sectoral focus of studies about wis may reflect different water resource development priorities studies from africa tend to focus on agriculture those from the middle east north africa on the municipal industrial sector and those from south asia on power generation finally it is important to note that 65 of the reviewed studies were global in scale while 294 were primarily country specific leaving only 22 studies that had a different e g regional or basin geographic scope 4 2 conceptualization of economic benefits and costs in reviewed studies there is substantial variation in how studies of wis attempt to specify and measure economic costs and benefits just over half 55 of studies take a purely quantitative approach in their analysis 22 use mixed methods and 23 are exclusively qualitative this pattern holds across domains and sectors here we describe the types of methodologies used discuss whether and how counterfactual analyses are used to establish impacts and provide additional detail on the quantification and monetization of economic benefits examples illustrating the variation along these different dimensions across studies are provided in table 5 these illustrate the diversity of applications in the wis literature within and across general and discipline specific methodologies as well as in the metrics or indicators used to assess the value of information 4 2 1 coverage of specific methodologies as noted above in section 3 we classified the methods of studies assessing the benefits and costs of wis into five distinct categories economic approaches non economic decision analytical tools physical hydrologic models non economic social science approaches and reviews or other methods table 4 several observations emerge from this examination of methods first perhaps unsurprisingly studies with economic methodologies are much more likely than other types to include counterfactual analysis and to discuss quantified and monetized costs and benefits or cost effectiveness measures in non economic studies counterfactual comparisons are rather uncommon only about 20 of such studies included any counterfactual analysis studies using non economic social science methods are least likely to quantify benefits but physical or hydrologic studies are the least likely to monetize them indeed water managers often think in terms of satisficing physical targets rather than maximizing economic value 40 still evaluation of how wis can improve such satisficing should still entail counterfactual comparisons we next turn to the mapping of methodologies to domains fig 5 a sectors fig 5b and data sources fig 5c physical hydrologic and review methodologies are least common across all domains reflecting our focus on economic implications economic studies are most common across all domains followed by other decision and analytical tools and then non economic social science methodologies the latter represent a somewhat greater proportion among studies in the allocation domain however while economic methods reach their greatest proportion in studies that encompass the supply domain with respect to sectors economic analyses and models tend to include analysis of multiple sectors this partly reflects the widespread use of hydro economic analyses which is often used to evaluate multiple interconnections between water resources and socio economic systems for example rosegrant et al 36 develop a hydro economic model for determining water allocation in chile s maipo river basin and address the two most relevant sectors to water consumption in the basin agriculture and municipal industrial meanwhile physical hydrologic studies are most common in the agriculture and non consumptive use sectors this could be because agriculture and ecosystems are usually lower value or nonmarket uses of water that may be harder to evaluate using economic methods 41 turning to data sources we observe that disciplinary focus generally tends to align well with data types non economic social analyses are more likely than other methodologies to include institutional data and are comparable to economic methods in their inclusion of socio economic data only a few physical hydrologic models incorporate socio economic and institutional information for example gikonyo et al 39 studied the effectiveness of water user associations wuas in kenya in the context of reduced regional streamflow interestingly economic methodologies are highly represented among studies that use climate and water supply data suggesting that economists are perhaps effective in integrating such information into their analyses a point to which we return later below fig 5c 4 2 2 types of counterfactual analyses counterfactual studies as described in footnote 2 compare situations with a new and enhanced information system to situations without these new systems in an effort to establish wis impacts across all studies included in this review only 39 included any type of counterfactual comparison as noted above we categorized these counterfactual comparisons into different types among these model based approaches to counterfactual comparisons were most prevalent of the studies that include counterfactual comparisons multiple approaches were possible in each study 34 conducted simple extrapolations from other prior studies 11 11 this means that the change relative to the counterfactual was not predicted for the system at hand based on a model or other approach that accounted for its specific characteristics but was rather approximated based on results from some other study or studies which corresponds to a very basic type of benefits transfer 60 compared results to modeled predictions 23 were based on expert opinions and 24 tried to measure differences with and without information systems using empirical observations to restate the latter statistic alternatively 76 of studies that measured wis impacts with a counterfactual comparison did not actually observe impacts most of the empirically based estimates or 6 of studies overall conducted outcomes comparisons without a control group using a before after design a smaller proportion compared outcomes using natural experiments survey based willingness to pay measures or cross site comparisons not surprisingly given the logistical challenge such methods would pose no studies were found that used high quality quasi experimental or experimental methods of program evaluation studies including the supply domain and or using climatic information had the greatest number of counterfactual studies as a fraction of all studies considering each domain perhaps reflecting the historical focus on evaluation for hydrometeorological investments counterfactual comparisons were relatively evenly distributed across sectors with only slightly more such studies considering the power and agricultural sectors somewhat surprisingly to us counterfactual analysis was more common in the grey literature than in the academic literature this may be an artifact of the approach we used to sample the grey literature specifically we concentrated on world bank and other similar agency documents and on wmo reports many of which drove the efforts to operationalize the methods for economic assessment in an attempt to evaluate the economic impacts of their investments in recipient countries weather and disaster prediction systems there is potential for a conflict of interest in this literature because these studies are often used to justify new investments world bank estimations of benefit cost ratios of wis investments in various countries differ by several orders of magnitude from 1 4 1 and 70 1 the ranges for estimates of both costs and benefits in these and other studies e g from avoided damages and increased productivity are correspondingly large 42 44 12 12 for example a sampling of world bank project studies included in our review had costs ranging from 8 3 million to 110 million with costs depending on the size of the country and its level of existing technological sophistication 45 43 49 the world bank recently estimated a need of about 1 billion of investment to support hydromet projects in the developing world 3 cited annual costs to operate and maintain existing technically sophisticated hydromet systems and services in europe range from 8 million euros 9 84 million to 82 3 million pounds sterling 115 42 million 59 89 by comparison the usgs spends approximately 114 million per year just to operate its system of stream gauges in the us 90 interestingly the national hydrologic warning council in the us did not feel the need to contrast the costs of nws s river and flood forecasts when speaking to the program s benefits 91 we discuss the benchmarking methods used by the world bank in greater detail in section 5 noting here that their application is uncommon in the academic literature it is possible that academics realize the challenges inherent in doing counterfactual analysis of wis and hence prefer to avoid such comparisons in their studies 4 2 3 quantification and monetization of costs and benefits in non economic studies this sub section focuses on quantification and monetization in non economic studies more detailed discussion of quantification in economic studies follows in section 5 fewer than half 40 of non economic studies present quantitative measures of costs and benefits roughly half of these 20 overall then monetize these there is considerable variation in quantification and monetization across methods table 4 for example while many physical hydrologic studies quantify benefits only a single hydrologic study monetized them 46 looking across domains we find that studies encompassing supply and demand drivers are more likely to quantify and monetize wis costs and benefits studies including the return flow domain which focus on the consequences of human water use and their impacts often on water quality are by far the least likely to quantify or monetize costs or benefits these relative differences likely reflect the challenges associated with measuring and valuing return flows relative to more standard economic measures of supply and demand the development of a model of the impact of nonpoint source pollution on rice production in the u s in manley et al 37 is an exception these authors quantify the contribution of such contamination to reducing agricultural output the rates of quantification and monetization were similar across most sectors 23 29 of non economic studies quantified costs and benefits and 10 13 monetized them for all but the power sector for the latter only 13 of non economic studies quantified costs and benefits and a mere 7 mostly in the grey literature monetized them indeed among academic studies that addressed power generation most were institutional analyses or demonstrated decision analytical tools applying to several sectors for example the assessment by aron et al 47 of programs addressing nonpoint source pollution in the u s considers the effects of power generation on watershed function additionally the discussion by sorg et al 30 of institutional solutions to water allocation in the syr darya river basin in central asia addresses hydropower in the broader context of cross sectoral collaboration and a regional strategy to address climate change 5 review of economic methodologies pertaining to wis as discussed above there is extensive literature suggesting that wis investments provide diverse and substantial benefits this section focuses on the minority of studies included in our review that then apply economic methods to quantify and monetize these benefits we discuss if and how these studies construct their counterfactuals before discussing in more detail the main challenges we see in application of these methods 5 1 quantification and monetization of costs and benefits in economic studies unsurprisingly among economic studies the rates of quantification of impacts 82 of studies in this category and of their monetization 73 are higher than for the other methodologies table 4 a majority 61 or 101 studies of these include a clearly described counterfactual analysis the remainder are unclear about how the wis changes outcomes and or what change is actually being valued the breakdown of approaches to construct counterfactuals recall that several methods may apply in a single study is as follows 26 rely on expert judgment 41 extrapolate from other studies 59 make predictions using a model pertaining to the system of interest and 21 rely on empirical evidence among the latter most 13 of 21 are before after comparisons with no control group given the temporal variability inherent in water resource systems such before after comparisons are likely inadequate for establishing impacts following the before after comparisons studies relying on empirical counterfactuals most commonly used valuation methods 10 studies among these economic studies the domain breakdown is shown in table 6 as with the non economic studies the rates of quantification and monetization coverage are highest in the supply domain as is done in clements et al 14 studies covering return flows are less likely to quantify and monetize benefits relevant examples include world bank project evaluations 48 47 and assessment by lamei et al 35 of desalination in egypt the rates of quantification and monetization were similar across sectors 81 88 of economic studies quantified costs and benefits in papers covering a particular sector and 69 75 monetized them 5 2 conceptual and measurement challenges in this literature we expected economic studies of wis to include careful counterfactual analysis because the three key steps in any economic appraisal are 1 identification 2 quantification and 3 monetization of impacts all relative to a no intervention status quo or baseline 22 reviewing the literature though it quickly became apparent that each of these steps presents significant conceptual and measurement challenges measuring changes relative to an unobserved state of the world i e a baseline that persists after the investment in which the new information systems investments being considered would not have been present is challenging for several reasons first these intervention attributable changes in water systems planning and management occur in a stochastic environment and often play out over a very long period of time accounting for such slow and stochastic dynamics in evaluations would require researchers to design or observe a long term dynamic counterfactual 50 second linkages between information and economic impacts may not be obvious without use of advanced analytical tools e g hydrological or hydro economic models which speaks to the need for economists working on such problems to better understand such tools in places where information systems are lacking however such tools are also often lacking it also follows that this complexity and the stochastic nature of climate variability may preclude users ability to take useful welfare improving actions in response to information 51 third and relatedly the connection between a wis investment and changes in the behavior of water managers or end users should never be assumed even if models or experts believe that information derived from wis should induce such changes in order to improve social well being there is ample applied micro economics literature suggesting a range of behavioral failures in processing information 52 53 such literature should motivate additional work on behavioral responses to wis investments of which there are only a few examples which indicate less than universal adoption 54 57 fourth user costs which are necessary for modeling interpretation and decision making and particularly transactions costs are often not considered perhaps because they are also difficult to estimate and predict these costs and their distributional consequences which are often borne by the public sector are important in that they can create obstacles to full uptake and realization of the benefits of wis investments one particular category of distributional consequences that figures prominently in the literature as impeding river basin cooperation is the loss of strategic advantage that comes with having access to information that others do not have 14 57 58 for example an upstream country may be able to exploit information asymmetries to mask its increasing water use by claiming that water flows have declined there are also important measurement challenges related to quantification and monetization of costs and benefits of wis one particularly notable feature of the economic and general literature on information systems is its overwhelming focus on climate information and a relative lack of attention to demand side information or to data on allocations and return flows the latter blind spots neglect the coupling we sought to consider in our initial conceptual model for considering the value of wis and almost certainly inhibit more effective water resources management our review also revealed that convenient indicators based on available data sources almost surely selected for pragmatic reasons in the interest of reducing the evaluation burden are often preferred over economically relevant ones one particularly prominent example of use of convenient measures is the so called benchmarking methodology when applying this approach the analyst first estimates baseline losses from resource related risks in a particular context as a fraction of gdp he or she then specifies preventable losses under status quo and modernization scenarios based on expert assessments that consider country specific estimates of weather and climate conditions structure of the economy and other factors 13 a related approach aims to estimate the impacts of wis in weather dependent sectors relying on a broader set of experts from specific economic domains 59 60 sometimes complemented with stakeholder interviews 61 unfortunately the assumptions underlying the benchmarking approach and this alternative are usually not based on a realistic or evidence based understanding of how wis information is actually used several studies rely on decision making models combined with resource models to sidestep the subjectivity inherent in relying on expert judgment to construct counterfactuals the advantage of such methods building on comments included above is their ability to better represent the complex dynamics inherent in socio environmental systems such as water resources 62 63 apparently counterintuitive results may be observed when the full context of resource use is not clear for example river flow has declined in central kenya even as rainfall has increased due to greater upstream water abstraction land use change and new infrastructure 39 applied to evaluation of wis investments such agent based or similar models assume that users optimize behaviors in response to new information according to a benefits maximization function a variant on this approach is to maximize a non monetary outcome e g crop yield or minimum risk of a damaging flood level such models have been used to consider changes in farming in rain fed systems 64 irrigation schedules in arid regions 65 water allocation from different sources to a range of stakeholders 23 and operating rules for hydropower infrastructures 66 67 these approaches are appealing in their mechanistic representation of systems and the role that information can play in reducing uncertainty their weakness however is assuming that systems are optimally managed with and without information which may not be the case because of wrm personnel attitudes cognitive limitations limiting comprehension of complex information or institutional behaviors as noted previously assumptions that information will be used effectively should be tested finally many wis improvements have consequences that are not strictly financial necessitating the use of nonmarket valuation techniques to recover shadow values of costs and benefits to avoid this thorny issue some analysts focus only on market values e g avoided financial costs from damaging natural hazards or increased revenues from improved production efficiency 13 such studies only offer partial assessments of economic value however in the wis context researchers have used cost effectiveness analysis when monetization was deemed infeasible or too costly 3 but some have used nonmarket valuation two examples related to mortality reductions from early warning systems come from econometric studies exploiting variation in exposure to such alerts 68 69 one study estimated household willingness to pay for current and improved weather information using a discrete choice experiment and the contingent valuation method 70 others have used benefit transfer methods to estimate avoided asset mortality and added value losses 3 13 13 a particularly interesting example of large scale benefit transfer in the information systems domain estimates the value of early warning systems for climate hazards 3 there are obviously a range of difficulties related to nonmarket valuation and benefit transfer in the context of wis investments and the number of studies using such techniques is relatively small more specifically though stated preference methods have appeal in providing more complete valuation measures and require very few assumptions about how respondents would use information they may be prone to hypothetical or other well known survey biases 71 revealed preference measures meanwhile are uncommon in this literature and pertain to specific circumstances that are not particularly relevant to the intervention of interest and benefits transfer estimates may induce site specific biases 72 6 discussion in this section we discuss the implications of our review and lay out a research agenda on the role of information systems investments in improving water resource management outcomes 6 1 implications several general observations emerge from our systematic review analysis first we believe that there is a need for more and better research on the economic value of wis though we acknowledge that such research will not always be appropriate and needs to be tailored to the scale of investment decisions being made full costing of wis is rather infrequent as user transaction and training or institutional costs and constraints are frequently ignored meanwhile methods for measuring the benefits of wis are inconsistent current predictions of impacts are too reliant on expert opinions or on decision models the latter in particular are useful for understanding physical systems behavior but too often rely on untested assumptions about behavioral responses to information given gaps in knowledge about the contribution of information systems to societal well being it seems likely that decision makers will remain skeptical about the value of such investments relative to projects that lead to more tangible and measurable improvements similar points have been made in the overlapping extensive literature related to climate services information and responses to it 14 building on this point our second observation is that it will generally be hard to know ex ante how consumers of newly accessible data will actually use it in practice this is an important obstacle to sound economic analysis of the value of wis for planning purposes at best it suggests that estimates in the literature represent an upper bound on these systems value planning documents acknowledge this issue and suggest that in many cases it will be necessary to make assumptions about users responses which often requires expertise or understanding with respect to specific users including the rate of adoption of specific services 13 yet a substantial body of research suggests that individuals do not always respond to information in expected ways as noted previously this may be due to lack of understanding 73 or the inability of information to adequately resolve uncertainty 74 75 for example due to the stochastic nature of environmental systems 76 deficiencies in the quality of information may not be the greatest impediment to its use rather what is needed is better and more salient delivery of its messages 77 while experts often have insight on likely responses theory based empirical evaluation and testing in this domain could inform development of a new generation of more realistic models of the effects of wis investments third political dynamics may influence how users see investments in and evaluations of wis decision makers may not be interested in the purported benefits of investments in wis if they think the current situation provides them informational advantages if distributional aspects are not addressed explicitly cost benefit analyses that predict a potential pareto improvement or a gain for society on aggregate regardless of its distributional consequences may be ignored since those benefiting from information asymmetries may oppose these investments indeed strategic problems with information sharing have been discussed in the literature 58 78 79 fourth our analysis of coverage by domain sector and information type indicate some important gaps the relatively lesser focus on allocation and return flows which concern the management of water resources rather than simply describing supply and demand perhaps reflects an untested assumption that information will actually be used to enhance management the least studied economic sector was power generation possibly reflecting the private nature of this enterprise and proprietary aspects of its information but also suggesting that the implications of better information for understanding water energy interactions have been underexplored 14 14 indeed many sectors rely heavily on energy e g urban water management where energy is an important cost factor in water and wastewater infrastructures operations 92 some have suggested that institutional constraints from operational mandates that impede managerial flexibility affect the use of information for decision making in this context 80 6 2 research agenda this discussion of implications leads us to identify six gaps that we believe would benefit from additional research largely around the need to develop test and apply better methods to evaluation of wis investments 1 counterfactual comparisons perhaps most importantly we feel that research on the value of wis should focus on improved use and construction of counterfactual comparisons including empirical and convergent validity tests of different approaches research on different types of investments and in different contexts could consider whether expert and model based predictions of changes are consistent and when practical whether such predictions conform to observed changes based on simple before after cross site comparisons or more sophisticated differences in differences natural experiments empirical tests to be most useful such comparisons would inform development of a theory explaining how and when different types of predictions may be problematic such that the most appropriate analytic methods are used for planning investments in wis 2 theory development and small scale testing on behavioral responses to information provision in the context of water management and use research on the value of wis should draw on established models of behavior existing in several disciplines e g economics political science psychological sociological etc to develop theory based evaluations of the effectiveness of different forms of information provision such research will improve our understanding of which users respond to newly accessible data and how further it will clarify how continuing uncertainty can affect management and social welfare outcomes though such theory based testing is likely to be infeasible in the real world we believe that experimental games and survey based simulation experiments with decision makers could be structured to test hypotheses about the value and likely uses of information 3 greater use of stated preference sp valuation methods there is also considerable scope for improving estimates of the value of wis using nonmarket valuation survey methods such as the contingent valuation cv method and discrete choice experiments 81 survey methods have been applied relatively infrequently for valuing information systems several interesting applications consider the value of better weather forecasts and warnings to households farmers and commercial stakeholders 34 60 70 82 84 though careful design must be used to minimize bias as discussed in section 5 sp approaches do have the advantage of yielding complete estimates of beneficiaries true feelings and expectations about what information has to offer in contrast to expert or model based estimates or revealed preference measures survey methods are also far cheaper than design and testing through policy or even simulation based experiments stated responses can also be assessed against revealed behaviors e g purchases of supplies following announcement of hazards 4 scale and scope issues as noted in our comments on the geographic coverage of studies pertaining to wis there is a common mismatch between the scale of investment being considered and the likely impacts of wis scale is often assessed as national for country investment programs or support or global for some world bank investments reflecting investment cost perspectives but non monetized use or transactions costs and the benefits of wis may more accurately apply at a watershed level this mismatch can lead to incomplete understanding of the economics of these investments a similar issue may apply to scope our review focused on information from a water management and use perspective but information systems investments may also help other sectors for example much has been written in the literature about the value of hydromet systems in transportation and energy sector applications unrelated to water ways of better assessing such overlap could be considered in future work 5 political advantages and dynamics the extant literature does not fully consider the political advantages and dynamics that affect investments in and evaluations of wis in some cases decision makers may over or underestimate strategic advantages from information asymmetries meanwhile valuations may be depressed by agents desire to free ride on the public goods aspects of wis investments research in this domain could draw on mixed methods using surveys and interviews with key stakeholders to understand perceptions of these aspects model based analysis to assess the likely accuracy of those perceptions and incentive compatible preference revelation mechanisms such as group voting games 6 specific costs and benefits of using wis finally research on costs should do more to measure user transaction and training costs more explicitly more studies on the effects of information systems on allocation and return flows management are needed to fill gaps in the existing literature which focused most heavily on the drivers of supply and demand 7 conclusion investing in improved wis only yields economic benefits if the data generated by these new systems actually improves water management decisions we conducted a systematic review to better understand the coverage of studies related to the economics of these investments we found great variation in the coverage of such studies across water management domains water dependent sectors information types and geographies domains related to water supply and demand drivers receive considerably more coverage than allocation and return flows consistent with an underrepresentation of behavioral responses to information in the literature among sectors agriculture municipal and non consumptive use sectors receive more attention than power generation wis studies tend to include much more hydrologic and water use information relative to socio economic institutional or political data and data insufficiency is a widely cited problem in this literature just over half of all reviewed papers in the economic literature pertaining to wis investments included counterfactual comparisons that allow assessment of their value added our review of the principal methods for measuring and monetizing the benefits and costs in such studies revealed a number of conceptual and measurement challenges related to the complex system dynamics and stochastic nature of water resources the prevalence of untested behavioral assumptions about responses to information the role of strategic behavior and understanding of the nonmarket impacts of wis projects in fact in the absence of improvements in measurement related to these challenges we believe that decision makers will likely remain skeptical about the value of such investments relative to projects that lead to more tangible and measurable improvements we thus close by emphasizing the need for research on the effects and value of wis investments acknowledging that such research will not be feasible in all circumstances we believe that this future research should be oriented towards improving predictions of how resource management systems involving people and water respond to improved information especially those requiring significant investment acknowledgments we are grateful to the world bank for providing support for the research

8709,dams can produce electricity and ensure water security but at the same time they radically alter the hydrological regime of rivers with significant consequences for the economic and environmental welfare of the region in which they are located cost benefit analysis cba is currently the most frequently used framework for the economic evaluations of dams changes at different time scales influence the economic appraisal of dams however change and adaptation at both the operational and the structural level are often not included in the cba evaluation not including change and adaptation limits the realistic estimation of cost and benefits and the appreciation of resilient solutions that offer satisfactory responses for a large set of future scenarios in this paper we consider the specific features of large dams in an african context and identify methods for an economic evaluation that takes into account for change and adaptation at both the operational and the structural scales as well as their interplay these methods are then applied to the ex ante evaluation of a system of existing dams on the senegal river valley results indicate the economic potential of the dams under changing conditions for both adaptive and non adaptive reservoir operation strategies keywords cost benefit analysis climate change reservoir africa dam adaptation reservoir operation deep uncertainty robustness resilience optimization senegal river 1 introduction large dams are strategic assets for the production of electricity and to ensure water security by storing water when it is most abundant and making it available when it is scarcer and hence more valuable notwithstanding the service they provide large dams are mega projects 55 that often radically change the hydrological regime of a river thereby affecting its economic and environmental conditions dams may be the focus of many controversial issues the world commission on dams wcd 51 has been a milestone in a debate that it is still ongoing 2 12 21 47 understanding the effects of new dams and their role within the hydrological cycle taking the costs and the benefits in economic social and environmental terms into account is a precondition to taking responsible and sustainable decisions 63 cost benefit analysis cba is the most frequently used method for the evaluation of economic impacts of dams in the academic literature 33 with a long history 8 of applications in the evaluation of the socio economic feasibility of new projects cba evaluates policy interventions by comparing their negative and positive consequences using a common monetary metric to identify the net effects 40 cba considers the economic dimension of water uses related to goods and services provided by water for which one is willing to pay 77 the value of water is determined by the matching of supply and demand in water systems supply and demand are variable over time climatic variability in particular is especially pronounced in the case of many african rivers whose hydrology is characterized by marked seasonality interannual variation and long periods of droughts 34 42 reservoirs can shift water availability over time water allocation decisions i e releases from the reservoir are taken at the operational level ex ante economic evaluation of dams and their future operational management are closely intertwined their operation depends on system characteristics such as expected water availability size and location of the dam on the other hand the economic yield of dams depends on how they are operated therefore assessing a dams costs and benefits cannot be separated from analyzing how the system is operated dams have a very long expected lifetime often spanning more than one generation this raises different questions about the appropriate way to evaluate future costs and benefits apart from the important and problematic selection of an appropriate discount factor 17 54 78 the meaningfulness of a cba can be limited by the level of confidence that one has in the assumptions underlying the analysis cba in fact is based on a large set of assumptions that are not certain to hold for such a long period climate change in particular to which investment in dams is particularly sensitive may radically alter water availability and its distribution over the year 70 under non stationary conditions 45 using past data to quantify the operational variability implicitly assuming stationary conditions 48 may be questionable cba guidelines suggest testing the robustness of results by performing a sensitivity analysis 53 61 with respect to the assumptions for which there is little confidence this analysis however is limited to the final stage and it is often regarded as secondary both in time and importance plus it is applied to relatively small changes in a few parameters marginalist economics in which cba is rooted focuses historically more on equilibria than on dynamics and change as a consequence change is generally overlooked in cba the non marginal effects of new large dams on the african electric system and food markets call for the inclusion in the analysis of both exogenous and endogenous change much of the literature on cba is in fact dedicated to the empirical challenges on how to give a market value to goods or services for which a market does not exist or it is not efficient 25 46 not considering the possible structural changes that affects dams or are triggered by dams can lead to poor decisions it encourages overconfidence in strategies that fail if the future unfolds differently than expected 37 49 dams are long term almost irreversible structural interventions conversely their operational management i e the step by step release strategy is a non structural measure that can be easily adapted to changing structural conditions this adaptation capacity extends the number of scenarios in which dams can be economically sustainable adaptation to changing structural condition however must be analyzed at the interface of operational management considering how the latter adapts in the shorter term to operational variability the aim of this paper is to identify methods able to take into account change and adaptation at both operational and structural level and their interplay for the ex ante economic evaluation of large dams specific to the african context the usefulness of these proposed tool is demonstrated in an ex ante cba on an existing system of dams on the senegal river west africa where the net value of the dams is estimated under different hydrological conditions corresponding to different levels of climate change the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we discuss how to evaluate alternatives projects by including variability interaction change and adaptation at both the operational and the structural level in section 3 we demonstrate how the proposals presented in the paper can be used for the ex ante economic evaluation of an existing system of dams on the senegal river our results indicate the economic potential that a sustainable dam management can offer in section 4 we draw our conclusions 2 methodology we differentiate between variability and change at two scales that we define as operational and structural operational variability is the change within a stationary condition operational variability if boundary conditions have not changed can be estimated from historical data structural change refers to the possible fundamental changes in behaviour of the system that may occur in the future for which no data are available yet only scenarios 2 1 operational variability in ex ante assessment of dams the system being evaluated does not yet exist consequently the analyst has to hypothesize how the system will be operated by defining its operational rules in reservoir operation the rules almost always depend on the reservoir water level and often on the state of the hydrological and the electric system operational rules can be designed using either optimization and simulation methods 26 72 in simulation methods the analyst draws up some operational rules selecting them by testing their effects in a simulation model in optimization methods the analyst defines the system objective and uses an optimization procedure identifying operation rules as the output of this procedure in cba the objective to be maximized is the welfare function operating a reservoir system under uncertainty requires trade offs between resource allocation over time present benefits must be balanced against future uncertain ones 11 67 including uncertainty when simulating operation is necessary to avoid the over optimistic assumption of disposing of perfect information which leads to overestimating the performance of the system 57 at the operational level decisions and uncertainty resolution are nested one after another after each decision new information becomes available and partially reduces uncertainty this continuous alternation of decision and information provides a feedback mechanism in which the release decisions can be adapted to the present conditions the capacity of a reservoir to delay supply can be used to hedge risk resulting in an increased resilience to short term variability of both demand and supply 27 multistage stochastic programming 64 which for long horizon is efficiently solved by stochastic dynamic programming 6 can be used to include this adaptation mechanism in the optimization procedure the use of a method derived from stochastic dynamic programming is demonstrated in the application section the selection of the simulation time step should take into account the system dynamics and the relative short term reservoir s capacity to adapt in the short term a long time step aggregates and hence disregards hydro economic processes that have a faster dynamics in african rivers in particular the model should be able to reproduce the flood process 59 flooding is a relatively rapid process so using a monthly time step which is often the case in strategic evaluations of dams 71 would neglect this process almost completely 58 some water uses such as those with environmental objectives transboundary water treaties or pre existing water rights may have to be guaranteed in this case the operational management of the dam must give higher priority to these objectives than to economic ones the demand of these high priority water uses must be included in the simulation model in the optimization procedure higher priority water uses can be included in the operational rules as soft constraints or high priority objectives 11 that have to be met before the economic ones 2 2 structural change the system in which a dam will operate is a complex adaptive one 39 ideally the system model should include the representation of all the components that may change in the long term and will have a critical influence on the economic evaluation of dams we consider that in africa environmental and socio economic change are two families of possible dynamics that can radically modify the economic benefits of new dams fig 1 presents the components we consider should take priority in being included in the analysis and their relationships meteorological and hydrological components can simulate environmental change namely change in the hydro climatic conditions of the system population dynamics and electric system components are intended to reproduce socio economic changes the meteorological component is designed to represent precipitation and temperature patterns and possible changes caused by climate change 31 32 the hydrological system represents the availability of water in space and over time considering all possible scenarios of change and long term effects for example due to changes in land use or in the hydrological response 14 the irrigation system component represents the crop water production functions 26 this component should include possible future irrigation strategies or future technologies 28 the reservoir operation component simulates the operational management including adaptation to changing condition adaptation occurs both at in the short term to balance operational variability and in the longer term to ensure resilience in the face of structural change operational rules are non structural measures that can be adapted as soon as change is detected 60 the population dynamics component reproduces how population growth and migration influence and are influenced by the demand for electricity and vulnerability to drought and flood events 22 41 44 the electric system component is used to assess the value of electricity produced by the dam also in relation with other sources of electricity both on and off grid 73 including possible changes in the energy mix driven by new technologies solar and wind power among others 29 or new demands use of electrical appliances and air conditioning for example 30 in enlarging the system boundary most of the variables will move beyond the range of currently observed behaviour therefore the enlarged system response is not predictable in the long term introducing new deep uncertainties deep uncertainties can be defined as uncertainties for which one can incompletely enumerate multiple possibilities for the system models the probability distributions and sets of values without being able or willing to rank the possibilities in terms of how likely or plausible they are judged to be 76 the policy analysis literature has produced a large set of approaches and methodologies to deal with the problem of deep uncertainties such as robust decision making 23 assumption based policies 15 dynamic adaptive policy pathways 24 and decision scaling 10 among others rather than starting with predictions these methods evaluate all the possible consequences of structural changes in order to identify the condition required to guarantee the success of the investment when models are used in this type of analysis the effects of a wide set of possible scenarios are explored through multiple runs of the system model 35 38 states that these methods are catholic regarding the measure of policy success and their criteria can easily incorporate economic criteria as in cba cba used in combination with these methods will include testing the robustness of the system to structural change including the adaptation capacity beyond the observed variability considering a larger set of possible future conditions will help better appreciate resilient solutions that offer a portfolio of uses that can hedge risk if for example one water use turns out to be less profitable than expected the hydro economic model can be used to simulate the augmented resilience offered by adaptive operational rules i e reservoir operational rules that adapt to change at the structural level 1 optimal operational rules are particularly advantageous in exploratory approaches optimization methods can be used to simulate the capacity to adapt operational rules to changing structural conditions when water is allocated according to a criterion of welfare function maximization it is used where it is most valuable for example if a water use becomes more profitable the operational rules adapt and allocate more water to that use at the expense of relatively less profitable alternative uses 3 application in this section we demonstrate the methodologies by using them for the ex ante cba of an existing system of reservoirs on the senegal river for this purpose we use a system model designed to represent the main economic outputs of the system and the socio environmental constraints that must be met the operational variability the physical institutional constraints and their multiple interactions are taken into account by a dynamic system model the model inputs are the current hydrological conditions i e the water availability and its variability over time the model outputs are the hydropower production irrigated area and irrigation discharge the system model has the following components i two hydrological sub systems i e the upper senegal river and the aggregated lateral contributions ii two reservoirs i e manantali and diama and iii the irrigation crop sub system these components are interconnected as shown in fig 2 reservoir components are made of the continuity equation representing the mass balances and the reservoir physical and legal constraints on the reservoirs the irrigation crop model component represents rice growth as a function of water input over time rice is in fact the crop planted in the irrigated district the hydrological catchments are represented by a stochastic model that reproduces interannual variability uncertainty in the streamflow process over the hydrological year and correlation among catchments the operational management of the reservoirs is assumed to be centralized hydrological uncertainty especially at the seasonal scale poses a challenge to the design of efficient operational rules 56 which are defined by use of stochastic dual dynamic programming 65 a method derived from classic stochastic dynamic programming 69 whose applicability extends to larger systems but it requires the time step optimization problem to be convex all model components are further detailed in appendix b in the cba costs include all the initial investment plus operation and maintenance costs benefits include hydropower and irrigation production only the model represents uncertainties in two forms at operational level we estimated the hydrological variability from past observed discharge at structural level we consider the possible reduction in water availability due to climate change in the rest of this section we first present the system under analysis then describe the main features of the cba i e how costs and benefits socio economic constraints and effects of climate change and adaptation are included in the analysis finally we show the results of the analysis and a discussion on its main assumptions 3 1 senegal river the senegal river is 1 790 k m long it is the second longest river in west africa the river flow regime depends mostly on the rainfall in the upper basin in guinea the river inflow is extremely variable reflecting the seasonality of tropical rainfall every year under the natural regime and when the discharge is sufficiently high water spills into the valley floodplain facilitating flood recession agriculture flood recession agriculture is a profitable production system for farmers that does not require any purchased inputs every time the floodplain is inundated by the flood vast areas are systematically sown with sorghum apart from agricultural production the flood provides the conditions required for forested ecosystems livestock breeding fish reproduction and groundwater recharge in 1972 senegal mauritania and mali created the organisation for the development of the senegal river omvs organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve sénégal the river water authority with a mandate to ensure food security energy production and harmony among all riparian users the omvs has gradually embraced the principles of integrated water resources management in which water allocation decisions are based on economic social technical and political factors in accordance with stakeholders interests 19 construction of new dams is among ovms s tasks the hydraulic conditions of the river offers a good potential for dams 13 36 74 plans for development if implemented extensively could lead to the damming of all river tributaries see fig 3 presently however only three reservoirs are fully operational manantali and felou in mali and diama close to the river delta as we do not dispose of sufficient information on felou dam our analysis only concerns manantali and diama dams for these dams an ex post evaluation already exists 16 despite some limitations the whole project is considered a successful integration project 20 3 2 cost benefit analysis we chose to perform a narrow cba 62 i e our analysis is limited to the economic services in this analysis energy production and irrigation in particular rice production are included as the main economic uses of the water as a

evidence shows that the cost of large infrastructural projects is systematically underestimated 18 also in case of large dams 68 2 suggest adjusting ex ante cost estimation by using a correction factor calculated based on similar past projects in absence of any other information that justifies a different value we use a correction factor of between 0 and 50 the latter value corresponds to the average overrun for the construction of dams in africa this stochastic correction factor is included in the cba to estimate the uncertainty about the cost of initial investments the sum of yearly

such that b y b y e b y i c y c y e c y i operation and maintenance costs and yearly benefits for electricity production e and irrigation i defined in appendix a can be calculated from the output of the simulation model the economic effects of flood support and drinking water supply are not sufficiently known hence these two water uses are not included in the cba even if not economically evaluated drinking water and flood support are included in the reservoir management as high priority objectives i e considered as constraints to the reservoirs operation fulfilling the flood support objective would require the production of 45 000 h a of cultivated land each year the relationship between the discharge trajectory and the flood surface has been clearly established 3 but being non convex it cannot be used in the optimization procedure used in the analysis the flood support objective is therefore included by a simplified criterion minimizing the difference between the discharge and the historically observed discharge under natural conditions i e without the effects of dams the rationale behind this modeling choice is that reproducing natural discharge is beneficial for the flood support effects are then quantified by considering the volume of water whose discharge is larger than the flood threshold above which water is considered to spill into the flood plain drinking water objective requires maintaining discharge higher than demand set at 10 m 3 s at bakel 4 3 3 response to climate change climate change has been already detected in this region 52 moreover climate studies from the combined used of regional climate models and hydrological models 43 shows that the impact on water availability and time space distribution in the senegal basin is expected to decrease in most of the upper basin the analysis of structural change explores possible scenarios of climate change we performed a stress test 9 of the system to evaluate how the system will respond to a reduction in water availability the inflow series was reduced by a multiplicative factor to represent variation in discharge for three scenarios stationary condition no change moderate climate change 15 and severe climate change 30 the system was tested under adaptive and non adaptive policies in adaptive policies the system adapts the release strategy to the structural change i e the new hydrological conditions in non adaptive policies the release strategy does not adapt to the structural change performances of non adaptive policies correspond to what one would have estimated using a cba approach in which structural change is not taken into account when non adaptive policies are evaluated under changing structural conditions their performance is a benchmark with which the performances of adaptive policies can be compared the mark up that adaptive policies offer indicates the added value of including adaptation 3 4 results table 1 summarizes the results of the cba climatic variability is reported by the range around the average plus minus the standard deviation corresponding to about the 70 of cases the uncertainty on investment costs is included in the estimation of the net value climate change is reported by showing results for the three scenarios the results in table 1 reveal a considerable difference between the lowest and the highest estimates this is true for all the change and adaptation scenarios this difference is mostly driven by the notable climatic variability of this river the comparison between the scenarios of adaptation and non adaptation to climate change highlight the importance of including the adaptation capacity when the reservoir operation adapts to new structural conditions i e the adaptation to cc column the loss due to climate change is mitigated resulting in a positive net value for all climate change scenarios when the reservoir operation does not adapt to new structural conditions i e the non adaptation to cc column the reduction of water availability is not counterbalanced by an appropriate reservoir operational management resulting in a bigger drop in performance that in the severe cc scenario may result in a negative net value table 2 presents some details of results for the stationary case the results in table 2 show that the net benefits from electricity and irrigation are comparable and that variation in the benefits from irrigation is higher than in those from electricity considering that irrigation variability is related to climatic variability the results can be interpreted as an indication of the low resilience of the irrigation sector to climate in the stationary case the benefits from electricity production range between 420 and 900 g w h y e a r this range corresponds to other cba estimations the higher value in corresponds to the initial cba estimates 50 a posteriori considered to be over optimistic and not feasible under present climate conditions the lower value corresponds to other cba estimates 20 we do not have details on how these estimations were made the marked variability of rice production has important consequences for food security dry years can result in the loss of the crop with catastrophic consequences for regional stability in this simulation however we consider that the system is operated as if the decision maker is risk neutral in practice it is usually preferable to avoid large variability in this case a risk benefit analysis rba could be conducted in rba risk aversion is taken into account by including risk as a cost 66 flood support presents an extremely large variability this variability however occurs both when dams are present and under natural conditions and can therefore not be attributed to the presence of the dams dams cause instead a small loss of flood support that we considered acceptable the drinking water objective not included in the economic analysis benefits from the presence of the dams a dam can help ensure almost constant availability of water that can be used for drinking the economic sustainability of manantali only suggests the practicability of an adaptive policy 75 where manantali is constructed first and the decision about the construction of diama is postponed an adaptive plan in two stages has some advantages over the simultaneous construction of all infrastructures it makes it possible to test the assumptions underlying the policy to evaluate the initial investment to develop new valuable knowledge and to gain experience the irrigation variability is heterogeneously distributed among cropping seasons fig 4 shows that most of the income is concentrated in the wet season these results are in line with the estimation in the sdage 50 which consider a crop surface of 2 5 10 e 5 ha in the wet season and a crop surface of 0 5 10 e 5 ha in the dry season in fig 4 the presence of many outliers defined as data points falling outside the 97 5 range indicate the long tail of the crop distribution in the dry season fig 5 highlights the cost of flood support showing irrigation and electricity benefits for two cases reservoir operation with and without flood support as a constraint a significant drop in both irrigation and electricity benefits can be observed not knowing the benefits of flood support nor the long term effects of not producing a flood a reservoir operation designed without flood support is not an option at the moment further research into the effects of floods would however advance our understanding of the flood recession agriculture process this information could then be used to calibrate better flood support resulting in more efficient use of water fig 6 shows the system response to climate change the figure includes some details of the stress test when water availability is reduced due to climate change the benefit of both electricity and irrigation decreases with a decline in water availability nonetheless in most of the cases climatic variability is much greater than the reduction due to climate change if climate change is not taken into account and the system is operated like in non adaptive policies energy production decreases and irrigation production becomes more erratic adaptive system operation limits the negative impacts of climate change concerning electricity production adaptive operation limits the loss in production this is achieved by adapting the drawing down of the reservoir hence maintaining a higher water head concerning irrigation adaptive policies reduce production variability this is achieved by adapting the irrigated area to the new conditions 3 5 limitations the analysis has several limitations that need to be clearly indicated here we list some of the relevant elements this cba does not consider without claiming to be exhaustive all other modeling choices can be inferred by analyzing the system model we do not have sufficient information to include in the cba the other relevant components from fig 1 namely population dynamics the energy system and meteorological components this is a major limitation of this analysis future research will expand the system boundaries to include all the key components included in fig 1 the analysis does not include the indirect effects on secondary markets and on changes in demand the benefit of navigation and the cost of alternative land use is not considered in fact assuming that navigation will not be practiced and that land availability for irrigation is not a limiting factor we use a mono culture irrigation production function only considering rice de facto limiting the capacity to represent the real adaptation capacity of the agricultural system the estimation of the price of electricity does not consider different uses hence different values for different seasons we consider only aggregated production the cost due to an irregular electricity supply is not taken into account the value of electricity does not include the opportunity cost offered by other renewable energy sources the irrigation model is largely simplified and its uncertainty is not represented the cost of labour like many other variables is considered to be fixed whereas in practice it depends on the dynamics of development that are partially exogenous partially influenced by the presence of the dams all dynamics faster than the model time step i e one week are excluded hydrological dynamics lasting more than one year such as the hurst effect 34 are not included in the reservoir operation the effect of climate change on water availability is represented by rescaling the hydrological inflow by a multiplicative factor hence reducing the total amount of available water but not considering other possible changes in the hydrograph 4 conclusions in this paper we indicated how the ex ante economic evaluation of large dams specific to the african context can benefit from the use of methods that take into account change and adaptation at both the operational and the structural level and their interplay we applied these methods in a cost benefit analysis cba of an existing system of dams on the senegal river in which we used an exploratory approach to map the net value of the projects under different conditions that may change in the future the exploratory analysis is limited in this case to changing water availability due to climate change marginalist economics in which cba is rooted focuses historically more on equilibria than on dynamics and change as a consequence change is generally overlooked in cba nonetheless for the economic appraisal of large dams we suggest that approaches that consider system dynamics under uncertainty and their capacity for adaptation are more appropriate than detailed but static deterministic procedures dams do in fact have non marginal impacts and are dependent on external climatic conditions that are currently undergoing a rapid and structural change in our analysis we show how overlooking the fact that water availability may change in the future can have negative consequences for the economic performances of dams our results shows how including adaptation adaptive policies in the test case at the structural scale can help mitigate these negative consequences compared with the case in which adaptation is not included non adaptive policies the mitigation of the negative consequences of climate change in this specific test case is however not particularly remarkable if compared to the operational variability of the hydrological system the economic appraisal of a dam cannot be separated from how it will be managed at the operational level i e from the design of its operational rules in the application the operational rules were designed using sddp a stochastic dynamic programming method using sddp operational rules can be directly defined from the system model and the system objective which in the case of cba is the welfare function this is particularly advantageous in exploratory approaches optimization methods can be used to redesign operational rules according to changing structural conditions hence simulating a system capable of adapting at both structural and operational level in the cba we redesigned the reservoir operational rules for all water availability scenarios the analysis shows a limited drop in performances for hydropower and more variability for irrigation the cba reveals the potential for economic exploitation on the senegal river made possible by the presence of new dams without excessively affecting the environmental conditions of the river the dynamic model of the system enabled the representation of main hydro economic processes related to the dams and their impacts including flood support the analysis shows how thanks to their adaptive operational management the dams are able to partially hedge the natural variability of the senegal river despite this hedging effect some interannual variability explicitly communicated in the cba results is necessarily present the cba was based on a large set of assumptions and simplifications that we have clearly underlined despite our intention and the effort invested to extend what can be considered as dynamic important variables were assumed to be static this is likely the main limitation of this analysis if not of cba in general a more realistic estimation would need to extend the system boundaries to enlarge the set of variables that are dynamic in the african socio economic and environmental context we identified some sub systems as key components that will have to be integrated in the cba beyond the reservoir dynamics and its operation these are i the meterological system ii the hydrological system iii population dynamics iv the irrigation system and v the electric system extending the whole system however requires modeling processes that are not completely understood and consequently not yet predictable thereby increasing the need for and the importance of an exploratory approach robust decision making and adaptation research in the near future will fill this gap thereby expanding the system boundaries to include all the key components appendix a operational costs and benefits yearly operational costs and benefits are defined in equations a 1 a 4 a 1 b y e p e t 1 h e t a 2 c y e c e f t 1 h c e v e t

8709,dams can produce electricity and ensure water security but at the same time they radically alter the hydrological regime of rivers with significant consequences for the economic and environmental welfare of the region in which they are located cost benefit analysis cba is currently the most frequently used framework for the economic evaluations of dams changes at different time scales influence the economic appraisal of dams however change and adaptation at both the operational and the structural level are often not included in the cba evaluation not including change and adaptation limits the realistic estimation of cost and benefits and the appreciation of resilient solutions that offer satisfactory responses for a large set of future scenarios in this paper we consider the specific features of large dams in an african context and identify methods for an economic evaluation that takes into account for change and adaptation at both the operational and the structural scales as well as their interplay these methods are then applied to the ex ante evaluation of a system of existing dams on the senegal river valley results indicate the economic potential of the dams under changing conditions for both adaptive and non adaptive reservoir operation strategies keywords cost benefit analysis climate change reservoir africa dam adaptation reservoir operation deep uncertainty robustness resilience optimization senegal river 1 introduction large dams are strategic assets for the production of electricity and to ensure water security by storing water when it is most abundant and making it available when it is scarcer and hence more valuable notwithstanding the service they provide large dams are mega projects 55 that often radically change the hydrological regime of a river thereby affecting its economic and environmental conditions dams may be the focus of many controversial issues the world commission on dams wcd 51 has been a milestone in a debate that it is still ongoing 2 12 21 47 understanding the effects of new dams and their role within the hydrological cycle taking the costs and the benefits in economic social and environmental terms into account is a precondition to taking responsible and sustainable decisions 63 cost benefit analysis cba is the most frequently used method for the evaluation of economic impacts of dams in the academic literature 33 with a long history 8 of applications in the evaluation of the socio economic feasibility of new projects cba evaluates policy interventions by comparing their negative and positive consequences using a common monetary metric to identify the net effects 40 cba considers the economic dimension of water uses related to goods and services provided by water for which one is willing to pay 77 the value of water is determined by the matching of supply and demand in water systems supply and demand are variable over time climatic variability in particular is especially pronounced in the case of many african rivers whose hydrology is characterized by marked seasonality interannual variation and long periods of droughts 34 42 reservoirs can shift water availability over time water allocation decisions i e releases from the reservoir are taken at the operational level ex ante economic evaluation of dams and their future operational management are closely intertwined their operation depends on system characteristics such as expected water availability size and location of the dam on the other hand the economic yield of dams depends on how they are operated therefore assessing a dams costs and benefits cannot be separated from analyzing how the system is operated dams have a very long expected lifetime often spanning more than one generation this raises different questions about the appropriate way to evaluate future costs and benefits apart from the important and problematic selection of an appropriate discount factor 17 54 78 the meaningfulness of a cba can be limited by the level of confidence that one has in the assumptions underlying the analysis cba in fact is based on a large set of assumptions that are not certain to hold for such a long period climate change in particular to which investment in dams is particularly sensitive may radically alter water availability and its distribution over the year 70 under non stationary conditions 45 using past data to quantify the operational variability implicitly assuming stationary conditions 48 may be questionable cba guidelines suggest testing the robustness of results by performing a sensitivity analysis 53 61 with respect to the assumptions for which there is little confidence this analysis however is limited to the final stage and it is often regarded as secondary both in time and importance plus it is applied to relatively small changes in a few parameters marginalist economics in which cba is rooted focuses historically more on equilibria than on dynamics and change as a consequence change is generally overlooked in cba the non marginal effects of new large dams on the african electric system and food markets call for the inclusion in the analysis of both exogenous and endogenous change much of the literature on cba is in fact dedicated to the empirical challenges on how to give a market value to goods or services for which a market does not exist or it is not efficient 25 46 not considering the possible structural changes that affects dams or are triggered by dams can lead to poor decisions it encourages overconfidence in strategies that fail if the future unfolds differently than expected 37 49 dams are long term almost irreversible structural interventions conversely their operational management i e the step by step release strategy is a non structural measure that can be easily adapted to changing structural conditions this adaptation capacity extends the number of scenarios in which dams can be economically sustainable adaptation to changing structural condition however must be analyzed at the interface of operational management considering how the latter adapts in the shorter term to operational variability the aim of this paper is to identify methods able to take into account change and adaptation at both operational and structural level and their interplay for the ex ante economic evaluation of large dams specific to the african context the usefulness of these proposed tool is demonstrated in an ex ante cba on an existing system of dams on the senegal river west africa where the net value of the dams is estimated under different hydrological conditions corresponding to different levels of climate change the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we discuss how to evaluate alternatives projects by including variability interaction change and adaptation at both the operational and the structural level in section 3 we demonstrate how the proposals presented in the paper can be used for the ex ante economic evaluation of an existing system of dams on the senegal river our results indicate the economic potential that a sustainable dam management can offer in section 4 we draw our conclusions 2 methodology we differentiate between variability and change at two scales that we define as operational and structural operational variability is the change within a stationary condition operational variability if boundary conditions have not changed can be estimated from historical data structural change refers to the possible fundamental changes in behaviour of the system that may occur in the future for which no data are available yet only scenarios 2 1 operational variability in ex ante assessment of dams the system being evaluated does not yet exist consequently the analyst has to hypothesize how the system will be operated by defining its operational rules in reservoir operation the rules almost always depend on the reservoir water level and often on the state of the hydrological and the electric system operational rules can be designed using either optimization and simulation methods 26 72 in simulation methods the analyst draws up some operational rules selecting them by testing their effects in a simulation model in optimization methods the analyst defines the system objective and uses an optimization procedure identifying operation rules as the output of this procedure in cba the objective to be maximized is the welfare function operating a reservoir system under uncertainty requires trade offs between resource allocation over time present benefits must be balanced against future uncertain ones 11 67 including uncertainty when simulating operation is necessary to avoid the over optimistic assumption of disposing of perfect information which leads to overestimating the performance of the system 57 at the operational level decisions and uncertainty resolution are nested one after another after each decision new information becomes available and partially reduces uncertainty this continuous alternation of decision and information provides a feedback mechanism in which the release decisions can be adapted to the present conditions the capacity of a reservoir to delay supply can be used to hedge risk resulting in an increased resilience to short term variability of both demand and supply 27 multistage stochastic programming 64 which for long horizon is efficiently solved by stochastic dynamic programming 6 can be used to include this adaptation mechanism in the optimization procedure the use of a method derived from stochastic dynamic programming is demonstrated in the application section the selection of the simulation time step should take into account the system dynamics and the relative short term reservoir s capacity to adapt in the short term a long time step aggregates and hence disregards hydro economic processes that have a faster dynamics in african rivers in particular the model should be able to reproduce the flood process 59 flooding is a relatively rapid process so using a monthly time step which is often the case in strategic evaluations of dams 71 would neglect this process almost completely 58 some water uses such as those with environmental objectives transboundary water treaties or pre existing water rights may have to be guaranteed in this case the operational management of the dam must give higher priority to these objectives than to economic ones the demand of these high priority water uses must be included in the simulation model in the optimization procedure higher priority water uses can be included in the operational rules as soft constraints or high priority objectives 11 that have to be met before the economic ones 2 2 structural change the system in which a dam will operate is a complex adaptive one 39 ideally the system model should include the representation of all the components that may change in the long term and will have a critical influence on the economic evaluation of dams we consider that in africa environmental and socio economic change are two families of possible dynamics that can radically modify the economic benefits of new dams fig 1 presents the components we consider should take priority in being included in the analysis and their relationships meteorological and hydrological components can simulate environmental change namely change in the hydro climatic conditions of the system population dynamics and electric system components are intended to reproduce socio economic changes the meteorological component is designed to represent precipitation and temperature patterns and possible changes caused by climate change 31 32 the hydrological system represents the availability of water in space and over time considering all possible scenarios of change and long term effects for example due to changes in land use or in the hydrological response 14 the irrigation system component represents the crop water production functions 26 this component should include possible future irrigation strategies or future technologies 28 the reservoir operation component simulates the operational management including adaptation to changing condition adaptation occurs both at in the short term to balance operational variability and in the longer term to ensure resilience in the face of structural change operational rules are non structural measures that can be adapted as soon as change is detected 60 the population dynamics component reproduces how population growth and migration influence and are influenced by the demand for electricity and vulnerability to drought and flood events 22 41 44 the electric system component is used to assess the value of electricity produced by the dam also in relation with other sources of electricity both on and off grid 73 including possible changes in the energy mix driven by new technologies solar and wind power among others 29 or new demands use of electrical appliances and air conditioning for example 30 in enlarging the system boundary most of the variables will move beyond the range of currently observed behaviour therefore the enlarged system response is not predictable in the long term introducing new deep uncertainties deep uncertainties can be defined as uncertainties for which one can incompletely enumerate multiple possibilities for the system models the probability distributions and sets of values without being able or willing to rank the possibilities in terms of how likely or plausible they are judged to be 76 the policy analysis literature has produced a large set of approaches and methodologies to deal with the problem of deep uncertainties such as robust decision making 23 assumption based policies 15 dynamic adaptive policy pathways 24 and decision scaling 10 among others rather than starting with predictions these methods evaluate all the possible consequences of structural changes in order to identify the condition required to guarantee the success of the investment when models are used in this type of analysis the effects of a wide set of possible scenarios are explored through multiple runs of the system model 35 38 states that these methods are catholic regarding the measure of policy success and their criteria can easily incorporate economic criteria as in cba cba used in combination with these methods will include testing the robustness of the system to structural change including the adaptation capacity beyond the observed variability considering a larger set of possible future conditions will help better appreciate resilient solutions that offer a portfolio of uses that can hedge risk if for example one water use turns out to be less profitable than expected the hydro economic model can be used to simulate the augmented resilience offered by adaptive operational rules i e reservoir operational rules that adapt to change at the structural level 1 optimal operational rules are particularly advantageous in exploratory approaches optimization methods can be used to simulate the capacity to adapt operational rules to changing structural conditions when water is allocated according to a criterion of welfare function maximization it is used where it is most valuable for example if a water use becomes more profitable the operational rules adapt and allocate more water to that use at the expense of relatively less profitable alternative uses 3 application in this section we demonstrate the methodologies by using them for the ex ante cba of an existing system of reservoirs on the senegal river for this purpose we use a system model designed to represent the main economic outputs of the system and the socio environmental constraints that must be met the operational variability the physical institutional constraints and their multiple interactions are taken into account by a dynamic system model the model inputs are the current hydrological conditions i e the water availability and its variability over time the model outputs are the hydropower production irrigated area and irrigation discharge the system model has the following components i two hydrological sub systems i e the upper senegal river and the aggregated lateral contributions ii two reservoirs i e manantali and diama and iii the irrigation crop sub system these components are interconnected as shown in fig 2 reservoir components are made of the continuity equation representing the mass balances and the reservoir physical and legal constraints on the reservoirs the irrigation crop model component represents rice growth as a function of water input over time rice is in fact the crop planted in the irrigated district the hydrological catchments are represented by a stochastic model that reproduces interannual variability uncertainty in the streamflow process over the hydrological year and correlation among catchments the operational management of the reservoirs is assumed to be centralized hydrological uncertainty especially at the seasonal scale poses a challenge to the design of efficient operational rules 56 which are defined by use of stochastic dual dynamic programming 65 a method derived from classic stochastic dynamic programming 69 whose applicability extends to larger systems but it requires the time step optimization problem to be convex all model components are further detailed in appendix b in the cba costs include all the initial investment plus operation and maintenance costs benefits include hydropower and irrigation production only the model represents uncertainties in two forms at operational level we estimated the hydrological variability from past observed discharge at structural level we consider the possible reduction in water availability due to climate change in the rest of this section we first present the system under analysis then describe the main features of the cba i e how costs and benefits socio economic constraints and effects of climate change and adaptation are included in the analysis finally we show the results of the analysis and a discussion on its main assumptions 3 1 senegal river the senegal river is 1 790 k m long it is the second longest river in west africa the river flow regime depends mostly on the rainfall in the upper basin in guinea the river inflow is extremely variable reflecting the seasonality of tropical rainfall every year under the natural regime and when the discharge is sufficiently high water spills into the valley floodplain facilitating flood recession agriculture flood recession agriculture is a profitable production system for farmers that does not require any purchased inputs every time the floodplain is inundated by the flood vast areas are systematically sown with sorghum apart from agricultural production the flood provides the conditions required for forested ecosystems livestock breeding fish reproduction and groundwater recharge in 1972 senegal mauritania and mali created the organisation for the development of the senegal river omvs organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve sénégal the river water authority with a mandate to ensure food security energy production and harmony among all riparian users the omvs has gradually embraced the principles of integrated water resources management in which water allocation decisions are based on economic social technical and political factors in accordance with stakeholders interests 19 construction of new dams is among ovms s tasks the hydraulic conditions of the river offers a good potential for dams 13 36 74 plans for development if implemented extensively could lead to the damming of all river tributaries see fig 3 presently however only three reservoirs are fully operational manantali and felou in mali and diama close to the river delta as we do not dispose of sufficient information on felou dam our analysis only concerns manantali and diama dams for these dams an ex post evaluation already exists 16 despite some limitations the whole project is considered a successful integration project 20 3 2 cost benefit analysis we chose to perform a narrow cba 62 i e our analysis is limited to the economic services in this analysis energy production and irrigation in particular rice production are included as the main economic uses of the water as a synthetic index we selected the net present value because of the advantages it offers over other indexes 61 the net value n v of the project is the difference between overall benefits b and overall costs c overall costs and overall benefits are calculated as in equations 1 and 2 1 b y 0 n b y 1 r y 2 c c i y 0 n c y 1 r y in equations 1 and 2 c i are the initial investments costs c y the yearly operation and maintenance costs and b y the yearly benefits y is the year index n is the project horizon in years set at 30 years and r the discount factor set at 10 the yearly benefits and costs b y c y are stochastic variables with mean e b y e c y and variance v a r b y v a r c y assuming quasi stationarity of b y and c y i e there are no long term trends in the series of benefits and costs and independences among yearly benefits the yearly benefits and costs over the project horizon are distributed as in equation 3 which is obtained by applying the property of sum of stochastic variables 3 b n e b y v a r b y d 4 c c i n e c y v a r c y d where d y 0 n 1 1 r y the initial investment costs for the entire project i e c i are 413 billion west african francs french acronym cfa distributed as follows 135 billion cfa for manantali 36 billion cfa for diama 205 billion cfa for hydropower plant and transmission lines and 37 billion cfa for other complementary measures and analysis 20 strong evidence shows that the cost of large infrastructural projects is systematically underestimated 18 also in case of large dams 68 2 suggest adjusting ex ante cost estimation by using a correction factor calculated based on similar past projects in absence of any other information that justifies a different value we use a correction factor of between 0 and 50 the latter value corresponds to the average overrun for the construction of dams in africa this stochastic correction factor is included in the cba to estimate the uncertainty about the cost of initial investments the sum of yearly operation and maintenance costs and yearly benefits for electricity production and irrigation make up the total yearly operation and maintenance costs and the total yearly benefits i e c y and b y such that b y b y e b y i c y c y e c y i operation and maintenance costs and yearly benefits for electricity production e and irrigation i defined in appendix a can be calculated from the output of the simulation model the economic effects of flood support and drinking water supply are not sufficiently known hence these two water uses are not included in the cba even if not economically evaluated drinking water and flood support are included in the reservoir management as high priority objectives i e considered as constraints to the reservoirs operation fulfilling the flood support objective would require the production of 45 000 h a of cultivated land each year the relationship between the discharge trajectory and the flood surface has been clearly established 3 but being non convex it cannot be used in the optimization procedure used in the analysis the flood support objective is therefore included by a simplified criterion minimizing the difference between the discharge and the historically observed discharge under natural conditions i e without the effects of dams the rationale behind this modeling choice is that reproducing natural discharge is beneficial for the flood support effects are then quantified by considering the volume of water whose discharge is larger than the flood threshold above which water is considered to spill into the flood plain drinking water objective requires maintaining discharge higher than demand set at 10 m 3 s at bakel 4 3 3 response to climate change climate change has been already detected in this region 52 moreover climate studies from the combined used of regional climate models and hydrological models 43 shows that the impact on water availability and time space distribution in the senegal basin is expected to decrease in most of the upper basin the analysis of structural change explores possible scenarios of climate change we performed a stress test 9 of the system to evaluate how the system will respond to a reduction in water availability the inflow series was reduced by a multiplicative factor to represent variation in discharge for three scenarios stationary condition no change moderate climate change 15 and severe climate change 30 the system was tested under adaptive and non adaptive policies in adaptive policies the system adapts the release strategy to the structural change i e the new hydrological conditions in non adaptive policies the release strategy does not adapt to the structural change performances of non adaptive policies correspond to what one would have estimated using a cba approach in which structural change is not taken into account when non adaptive policies are evaluated under changing structural conditions their performance is a benchmark with which the performances of adaptive policies can be compared the mark up that adaptive policies offer indicates the added value of including adaptation 3 4 results table 1 summarizes the results of the cba climatic variability is reported by the range around the average plus minus the standard deviation corresponding to about the 70 of cases the uncertainty on investment costs is included in the estimation of the net value climate change is reported by showing results for the three scenarios the results in table 1 reveal a considerable difference between the lowest and the highest estimates this is true for all the change and adaptation scenarios this difference is mostly driven by the notable climatic variability of this river the comparison between the scenarios of adaptation and non adaptation to climate change highlight the importance of including the adaptation capacity when the reservoir operation adapts to new structural conditions i e the adaptation to cc column the loss due to climate change is mitigated resulting in a positive net value for all climate change scenarios when the reservoir operation does not adapt to new structural conditions i e the non adaptation to cc column the reduction of water availability is not counterbalanced by an appropriate reservoir operational management resulting in a bigger drop in performance that in the severe cc scenario may result in a negative net value table 2 presents some details of results for the stationary case the results in table 2 show that the net benefits from electricity and irrigation are comparable and that variation in the benefits from irrigation is higher than in those from electricity considering that irrigation variability is related to climatic variability the results can be interpreted as an indication of the low resilience of the irrigation sector to climate in the stationary case the benefits from electricity production range between 420 and 900 g w h y e a r this range corresponds to other cba estimations the higher value in corresponds to the initial cba estimates 50 a posteriori considered to be over optimistic and not feasible under present climate conditions the lower value corresponds to other cba estimates 20 we do not have details on how these estimations were made the marked variability of rice production has important consequences for food security dry years can result in the loss of the crop with catastrophic consequences for regional stability in this simulation however we consider that the system is operated as if the decision maker is risk neutral in practice it is usually preferable to avoid large variability in this case a risk benefit analysis rba could be conducted in rba risk aversion is taken into account by including risk as a cost 66 flood support presents an extremely large variability this variability however occurs both when dams are present and under natural conditions and can therefore not be attributed to the presence of the dams dams cause instead a small loss of flood support that we considered acceptable the drinking water objective not included in the economic analysis benefits from the presence of the dams a dam can help ensure almost constant availability of water that can be used for drinking the economic sustainability of manantali only suggests the practicability of an adaptive policy 75 where manantali is constructed first and the decision about the construction of diama is postponed an adaptive plan in two stages has some advantages over the simultaneous construction of all infrastructures it makes it possible to test the assumptions underlying the policy to evaluate the initial investment to develop new valuable knowledge and to gain experience the irrigation variability is heterogeneously distributed among cropping seasons fig 4 shows that most of the income is concentrated in the wet season these results are in line with the estimation in the sdage 50 which consider a crop surface of 2 5 10 e 5 ha in the wet season and a crop surface of 0 5 10 e 5 ha in the dry season in fig 4 the presence of many outliers defined as data points falling outside the 97 5 range indicate the long tail of the crop distribution in the dry season fig 5 highlights the cost of flood support showing irrigation and electricity benefits for two cases reservoir operation with and without flood support as a constraint a significant drop in both irrigation and electricity benefits can be observed not knowing the benefits of flood support nor the long term effects of not producing a flood a reservoir operation designed without flood support is not an option at the moment further research into the effects of floods would however advance our understanding of the flood recession agriculture process this information could then be used to calibrate better flood support resulting in more efficient use of water fig 6 shows the system response to climate change the figure includes some details of the stress test when water availability is reduced due to climate change the benefit of both electricity and irrigation decreases with a decline in water availability nonetheless in most of the cases climatic variability is much greater than the reduction due to climate change if climate change is not taken into account and the system is operated like in non adaptive policies energy production decreases and irrigation production becomes more erratic adaptive system operation limits the negative impacts of climate change concerning electricity production adaptive operation limits the loss in production this is achieved by adapting the drawing down of the reservoir hence maintaining a higher water head concerning irrigation adaptive policies reduce production variability this is achieved by adapting the irrigated area to the new conditions 3 5 limitations the analysis has several limitations that need to be clearly indicated here we list some of the relevant elements this cba does not consider without claiming to be exhaustive all other modeling choices can be inferred by analyzing the system model we do not have sufficient information to include in the cba the other relevant components from fig 1 namely population dynamics the energy system and meteorological components this is a major limitation of this analysis future research will expand the system boundaries to include all the key components included in fig 1 the analysis does not include the indirect effects on secondary markets and on changes in demand the benefit of navigation and the cost of alternative land use is not considered in fact assuming that navigation will not be practiced and that land availability for irrigation is not a limiting factor we use a mono culture irrigation production function only considering rice de facto limiting the capacity to represent the real adaptation capacity of the agricultural system the estimation of the price of electricity does not consider different uses hence different values for different seasons we consider only aggregated production the cost due to an irregular electricity supply is not taken into account the value of electricity does not include the opportunity cost offered by other renewable energy sources the irrigation model is largely simplified and its uncertainty is not represented the cost of labour like many other variables is considered to be fixed whereas in practice it depends on the dynamics of development that are partially exogenous partially influenced by the presence of the dams all dynamics faster than the model time step i e one week are excluded hydrological dynamics lasting more than one year such as the hurst effect 34 are not included in the reservoir operation the effect of climate change on water availability is represented by rescaling the hydrological inflow by a multiplicative factor hence reducing the total amount of available water but not considering other possible changes in the hydrograph 4 conclusions in this paper we indicated how the ex ante economic evaluation of large dams specific to the african context can benefit from the use of methods that take into account change and adaptation at both the operational and the structural level and their interplay we applied these methods in a cost benefit analysis cba of an existing system of dams on the senegal river in which we used an exploratory approach to map the net value of the projects under different conditions that may change in the future the exploratory analysis is limited in this case to changing water availability due to climate change marginalist economics in which cba is rooted focuses historically more on equilibria than on dynamics and change as a consequence change is generally overlooked in cba nonetheless for the economic appraisal of large dams we suggest that approaches that consider system dynamics under uncertainty and their capacity for adaptation are more appropriate than detailed but static deterministic procedures dams do in fact have non marginal impacts and are dependent on external climatic conditions that are currently undergoing a rapid and structural change in our analysis we show how overlooking the fact that water availability may change in the future can have negative consequences for the economic performances of dams our results shows how including adaptation adaptive policies in the test case at the structural scale can help mitigate these negative consequences compared with the case in which adaptation is not included non adaptive policies the mitigation of the negative consequences of climate change in this specific test case is however not particularly remarkable if compared to the operational variability of the hydrological system the economic appraisal of a dam cannot be separated from how it will be managed at the operational level i e from the design of its operational rules in the application the operational rules were designed using sddp a stochastic dynamic programming method using sddp operational rules can be directly defined from the system model and the system objective which in the case of cba is the welfare function this is particularly advantageous in exploratory approaches optimization methods can be used to redesign operational rules according to changing structural conditions hence simulating a system capable of adapting at both structural and operational level in the cba we redesigned the reservoir operational rules for all water availability scenarios the analysis shows a limited drop in performances for hydropower and more variability for irrigation the cba reveals the potential for economic exploitation on the senegal river made possible by the presence of new dams without excessively affecting the environmental conditions of the river the dynamic model of the system enabled the representation of main hydro economic processes related to the dams and their impacts including flood support the analysis shows how thanks to their adaptive operational management the dams are able to partially hedge the natural variability of the senegal river despite this hedging effect some interannual variability explicitly communicated in the cba results is necessarily present the cba was based on a large set of assumptions and simplifications that we have clearly underlined despite our intention and the effort invested to extend what can be considered as dynamic important variables were assumed to be static this is likely the main limitation of this analysis if not of cba in general a more realistic estimation would need to extend the system boundaries to enlarge the set of variables that are dynamic in the african socio economic and environmental context we identified some sub systems as key components that will have to be integrated in the cba beyond the reservoir dynamics and its operation these are i the meterological system ii the hydrological system iii population dynamics iv the irrigation system and v the electric system extending the whole system however requires modeling processes that are not completely understood and consequently not yet predictable thereby increasing the need for and the importance of an exploratory approach robust decision making and adaptation research in the near future will fill this gap thereby expanding the system boundaries to include all the key components appendix a operational costs and benefits yearly operational costs and benefits are defined in equations a 1 a 4 a 1 b y e p e t 1 h e t a 2 c y e c e f t 1 h c e v e t
