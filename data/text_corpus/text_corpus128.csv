640,we study the dynamics of a sandy bed around a slender vertical cylinder forced by progressive non linear water waves the seabed evolves continuously under the effects of the up welling down welling and rolling events induced by vortical coherent structures in turn these are closely connected to the shape of the seabed which is modified by the scouring and or the deposition of the sand starting from a flat seabed progressive waves induce a rapid and transient modification of the bottom morphology towards a dynamically stable equilibrium state which is the focus of this work the dynamical equilibrium state is a function of the wave period and is reached when the seabed morphology is not substantially altered we describe such a state by an eulerian in phase analysis of the sand particle motion inferred from lagrangian data collected over a large number of wave passages this analysis relies on the use of the defocusing digital piv technique ddpiv for the first time applied to the specific flow of interest here on the basis of the eulerian analysis the triggering of the key events up and down welling rolling over the wave phase is captured by identifying through the q 0 criterion the coherent flow structures responsible for the events this analysis is coupled with the description of the sediment trajectories analyzed in a lagrangian manner and effectively assessing how and where the solid phase is transported during the key events five main mobilization transport mechanisms have been identified three during the onshore flow and two during the offshore flow i generation of a coherent structure reminiscent of a horseshoe vortex at the toe ii intense scouring at the top of the flatbed region iii vortex shedding in the wake during direct onshore flow iv shear crossflow on the lee side of the cylinder and v large vertical shearing in the flatbed region during the reverse offshore flow at flow reversal this shearing mechanism impacts on a significant area of sediments in the incoming region of the flow keywords waves morphodynamics sediment transport cylinder volumetric tracking trajectories 1 introduction the presence of an obstacle close to the seabed e g pipeline vertical cylinder in a marine environment influences and modifies the flow patterns resulting in the development of coherent flow structures close to the seabed such structures are responsible for an amplification of the sediment dynamics that leads to erosion at the root of the obstacles manes and brocchini 2015 and to the formation of periodic rolling grain or vortex ripples see blondeaux 2012 for a review about ripple formation small perturbations induced by the wave passage over the seabed give rise to recirculating cells that are capable of dragging sediments from the troughs of the seabed undulations towards their crests sleath 1984 thus altering the seabed morphology in a dynamic balance between gravity and drag during this process the seabed evolves towards a dynamical equilibrium known as the equilibrium scour state the configuration of which is also a function of the granulometric distribution of the sediments foti and blondeaux 1995 here we focus on the equilibrium scour morphodynamics induced by a vertical slender cylinder fitted into a sandy seabed under the influence of non linear progressive waves we follow the morphodynamic evolution over an entire wave phase focusing on the uplift transport and deposition of the sand particles by means of a lagrangian approach and of the lagrangian derived eulerian flow description we study the flow around the cylinder specifically the vortex structures at the cylinder s toe and their evolution under the continuous remoulding of the seabed to this aim we combine measurements of pressure at the seabed and seabed morphology with a 3d lagrangian description of the sand grain displacement this set of information allows us to clarify some of the complex phenomena that characterize the morphodynamics of the seabed by relating the fluid phase with the solid one through a two way coupling process the uplifting transport deposition of the sand by the flow on one hand and the evolution of coherent flow structures as imposed by the changes of the seabed morphology on the other in spite of its apparent simplicity the flow around a cylinder exhibits a rich set of complex scenarios varying with the flow conditions in the case of a cylinder impacted upon by a steady cross flow at re 1 4 105 the phenomenology of the observed flow is characterized by a transition in the shear layer subcritical regime before the onset of the drag crisis see zdravkovich 1997 and sumer and fredsøe 1997 downstream of the stagnation point a laminar boundary layer develops on the surface of the cylinder until the adverse pressure gradient caused by the cylinder wall curvature forces the flow separation zdravkovich 1997 transition waves roll up in discrete eddies that evolve into turbulent eddies the shear layer undergoes a laminar turbulent transition which energizes the flow before reattaching to the surface zdravkovich 1997 where the turbulent boundary layer finally separates the wake on the lee side of the cylinder is then delimited by a pair of shear layers separated by an oscillating laminar separation bubble that appears in the region between the point of the laminar separation and the turbulent shear layer reattachment see capone et al 2016 and miozzi et al 2016 in wall mounted cylinders the junction flow around the obstacle produces a three dimensional separation with horseshoe vortices that wrap around the obstacle simpson 2001 the incoming boundary layer splits in front of the cylinder at the stagnation point generating a topologically complex system of horseshoe vortices baker 1979 ballio and franzetti 2000 as a general rule the primary horseshoe vortex rotates in the same direction of the incoming boundary layer vorticity whereas the secondary vortices arrange their rotation direction to guarantee topological consistency as a consequence high intensity events originating in the incoming flow are captured inside the primary vortex leading to an increase of drag and pressure fluctuations in the junction flow region and promoting intense scouring events simpson 2001 the significant increase in drag coefficient cd is mainly caused by the asymmetric distribution of the pressure between the upstream and the downstream sides of the cylinder horseshoe vortices in steady currents are responsible for much of the scouring around an obstacle when a cylinder fitted into a mobile bed is impacted upon by an oscillating wave the above scenario operates differently and the scour is mainly governed by the wake vortices not only the wave induced flow velocity periodically changes sign but its intensity oscillates between negative and positive maxima thus the whole set of flow conditions for a cylinder in a 0 to re max crossflow occurs in our case the non linear waves are not sinusoidal and display an asymmetric and skewed profile hence asymmetric behaviors on the formation of vortices during each half cycle are also expected in order to relate the wave induced flow and the geometry of the obstacle the keulegan carpenter number k c u m t d 2 π a d has been introduced in keulegan and carpenter 1958 where d is the cylinder diameter t is the wave period um is the maximum value of the undisturbed orbital velocity at the bed and a is the semi amplitude of the orbital displacement in addition to re kc is a dimensionless parameter useful to describe the different flow regimes that take place at different wave conditions sumer et al 1997 illustrate the evolution of different flow features as a function of kc the evolution of a mobile seabed in response to the horseshoe vortex system and in general to the whole set of coherent structures is highly non linear and not straightforward we have observed that in the first part of the test the spatial profile of the undisturbed initially flat seabed around the cylinder was largely modified by the passage of the startup waves after the decay of the transient phase a periodically steady equilibrium the equilibrium scour state was reached where the morphology of the seabed was preserved in a periodic fashion despite being subject to accretion and erosion hence during each half cycle the live bed condition of the flow was such that sediments were lifted off the bed and transported roughly from and to the same regions thus a minor net transport of sediments occurred which only slightly modified the seabed morphology baykal et al 2017 sand grains are mobilized by turbulent flows when the local shear stress exceeds the local resistance to detachment of the sand particle nearing 1991 in that respect the local slope of the bed as experienced by the fluid flow nearing 1991 is of fundamental importance with the loci of slant reduction at the top of the ripples being the favorite locations for sand detachment foti and blondeaux 1995 in fact different flow regimes take place during a wave period at the seabed around the toe of the cylinder baykal et al 2017 sumer and fredsøe 2002 differential sand detachment occurs as a function of the local flow shear stress and bed slope and modifies the slope itself both in terms of steepness and height both bedload and suspended load transport can induce a net solid transport from and to different bed regions hence the flow regime is strongly influenced by the seabed mobility and efforts to reproduce all the dynamics evolving at an erodible bed through use of a rigid mould may not be adequate manes and brocchini 2015 in the present study all data on scour refer to the asymptotic scour state which corresponds to the final morphology measured when the seabed is dried section 2 details the experimental setup whereas section 3 outlines the methodologies used to assess the wave and the scour characteristic features section 4 describes the experimental approach and procedures used to quantify the transport of the liquid and solid phases the results of the study are outlined in section 5 where the instantaneous lagrangian and eulerian quantities of the fluid flow are discussed in conjunction with the mobilization and transport processes of sediments as well as with the asymptotic scour maps conclusions are provided in section 6 2 the experimental setup the experimental tests have been performed in the wave flume of the hydraulics laboratory of the università politecnica delle marche ancona italy the flume is 50 m long 1 3 m high and 1 m wide see fig 1 the sidewalls are glassed for the central 36 m and enable one to carry out optical measurements an adsorbing mildly sloping beach made of coarse gravel was used to reduce the wave reflection about 4 5 and to guarantee an undisturbed flow in the measuring area the water level η at different locations in the flume were measured and monitored by seven electro sensitive elevation gauges see fig 1 in particular elevation gauges s4 and s5 were placed upstream and downstream of the cylinder respectively see fig 2 the diameter of the vertical cylinder was d 10 cm and the water depth over the physical model was h 50 cm both regular and irregular waves were tested with different wave heights h 7 cm 27 cm and periods t 1 8 s 2 7 s as such kc ranged from 2 to 20 the study is centered on a wave setting characterized by an incident height h i 0 17 m a period t 2 739 s and a kc 10 this wave is of practical interest because it represents a realistic condition for intermediate water flows kc has been computed by using the maximum of the undisturbed velocity at the bed um this velocity has been calculated using the linear theory for the small discrepancy between measured and predicted horizontal velocities over an impermeable bed corvaro et al 2014b miozzi et al 2015 the cylinder diameter to wavelength ratio was smaller than 0 1 which is typical of a slender cylinder configuration the mobile seabed model had a length of 1 5 m a width of 1 0 m and a thickness of 0 13 m and was composed of sieved sand with mean diameter d 50 0 6 mm and density ρ s 2 63 g cm 3 in view of the optical measurements to be performed during this experiment the fine sand part was filtered out in order to reduce the water turbidity fig 3 shows a schematic drawing of the physical model depicting the coordinate system and the location of the wave elevation gauges s4 and s5 in the context of the cylinder seabed configuration the origin of the reference frame x y z was such that the x axis indicated the streamwise direction the z axis the cross flow or transversal direction and the y axis the upward direction along the cylinder axis the center of the cylinder in the horizontal plane x z at the flatbed y location was chosen to be the origin of the reference system also reported are the three regions of interest that will be used for flow and sand characterization in addition seven pressure transducers were placed in the seabed upstream downstream and around the cylinder here with an angular spacing δ ϕ 45 starting at the stagnation point see fig 4 these sensors were placed about 5 mm above the flat seabed during most of the wave phases the transducers were not covered by sand depending on the local bed morphodynamic evolution 3 wave elevation and scour bathymetry 3 1 in phase wave description in order to describe the flow in terms of phase averaged quantities elevation positive zero crossing epzc points were identified by taking the values of η closest to the zero crossing of the growing wave phase at the location of the cylinder axis given the wave celerity the time histories of the wave elevation at gauges s4 and s5 see fig 3 were combined to obtain the wave elevation η at x 0 see fig 5 a number of about 150 wave periods was extracted with a median value t between epzcs of 2 74 s see fig 6 the sampling frequencies of the free surface elevation and of the flow snapshots see section 4 differ significantly hence the measurements of η were linearly resampled in order to match the sampling rate used for the flow analysis as described in section 4 on the basis of the wave periodicity quantities of interest are described using the triple decomposition introduced in reynolds and hussain 1972 this approach separates wave and turbulence components from the time average of any function f 1 f x t f x f x t s f x t where f x is the time average f x t s is the periodic component and f x t is the turbulence component ts 0 t and t is the wave period we define the time and the phase averages respectively as 2a f x t t f x lim t 1 t 0 t f x t d t 2b f x t p lim n 1 n n 1 n f x t s n t where n is the number of wave cycles and t is a time large enough for a correct estimate of the average terms application of the phase average to eq 1 gives the following wave contribution 3 f x t s f x t p f x so that the original signal can be written as 4 f x t f x t p f x t 3 2 bathymetry at equilibrium scour state after flattening the seabed each experimental test was carried out by starting the wavemaker in still water conditions the free surface elevation and the seabed profile evolved progressively during the initial transient period after which the flow was assumed to reach an equilibrium state of dynamical stability the equilibrium scour state sumer and fredsøe 2002 at the conclusion of the test the asymptotic scour topography was reconstructed by a laser distance measurement and mapped to uniformly spaced points on a 1 cm 1 cm grid the timescale ts of the scour process represents the period over which the scour undergoes a significant change and is defined by 5 t s d 2 g ρ s 1 d 50 3 0 5 t where t is the dimensionless timescale for waves t is function of both the shields parameter θ and kc here θ 0 08 is defined as θ u f 2 g s 1 d where u f τ ρ is the undisturbed velocity at bed g is the gravity acceleration s and d are the specific density and the diameter of the sediment grains sumer and fredsøe 1997 proposed the following formulation 6 t 10 6 k c θ for our wave the ts obtained by applying eq 5 is about 270 s fig 7 shows the comparison in time between the measured and predicted dimensionless scour depth s t d around the surface of the cylinder with s t being defined as 7 s t s 1 e t t s where s is the scour depth at steady state the timescale needed to reach the equilibrium scour depth red dotted line in fig 7 was found to be about one half of the predicted value therefore a time of 180 s after the start of the wavemaker was chosen as the time sufficient to reach the equilibrium scour state after about 70 wave cycles the system transitions to an equilibrium state where the bed morphology changes over the wave phase but returns to the initial state at each new cycle our study is centered on the measurement of this equilibrium scour state condition in the absence of an instantaneous measure of the bathymetry around the cylinder a sketch of the seabed as it appeared at asymptotic scour condition is shown in fig 8 see corvaro et al 2018 for further details it is characterized by a spatially organized pattern of ripples with peaks and troughs with a depth variation of about 12 5 mm from this plot it is possible to identify an eroded area that appears concentric with the cylinder with an increased depth at 60 upstream and at 180 downstream in the near wake region blue regions upstream the trough centered at around x 75 mm and crest at about x 125 mm delimit a large scour in front of the cylinder this trench evolves around the cylinder in the downstream direction and converges into a narrow channel in the wake of the cylinder this channel passes in between two peaks symmetrically placed downstream of the cylinder at x 75 mm and across zones ii and iii in these morphologically active regions large vortical structures arise at wave passage both during the direct and reversal flow conditions 4 flow field and sand transport the nearbed flow kinematics and the sediment transport paths were reconstructed by means of the defocusing digital piv technique ddpiv see pereira and gharib 2002 a volumetric velocimetry technique that retrieves the three components of the velocity field in a volume based on the determination of the physical three dimensional coordinates of flow tracers the velocity is calculated upon the displacement in space of the tracer during a predefined time interval ddpiv is therefore a lagrangian technique that can track particles if the tracking is performed on a time resolved manner for instance using a high speed implementation it is possible to reconstruct the trajectories of individual particles and consequently the velocity along the path to our knowledge this work represents the first application of the technique to this class of flows a four camera system was installed to perform the measurements see fig 9 three regions were investigated as shown in fig 3 respectively centered on the cylinder zone ii upstream zone i and downstream zone iii of the cylinder each zone corresponded to a volume of measurement with dimensions 180 120 100 mm3 the need to capture the behavior of sand particles in the close vicinity of the seabed implies the acquisition of images containing large views of the seabed itself thus a background removal is required to perform this operation a moving median on a buffer at frame n 12 frames is subtracted from each image at frame n resulting in a robust separation of the flow particles from the background this procedure is particularly effective around the epzc points where the number of trajectories is increased by as much as 50 see fig 10 4 1 ddpiv implementation defocusing digital particle image velocimetry ddpiv as described in pereira and gharib 2002 was implemented using a system consisting of four dalsa falcon 1 4m100 cameras with a resolution of 1400 1024 pixels and a 10 bit pixel depth these cameras have a small physical footprint 44 mm 44 mm 44 mm and can record full resolution images at a framerate of 100 hz in our case the image size was reduced to 1400 751 pixels in order to increase the framerate to 130 hz in this manner the pixel displacement of particles was also reduced to levels compatible with the ddpiv analysis allowing for a correct time resolved reconstruction of both the water and sand flow field ddpiv requires a volumetric calibration to build a camera model that is equivalent to the ddpiv optical system of pereira and gharib 2002 in the present implementation each sensor was equipped with different lenses and the geometry was defined according to the available optical accessibility implying the determination of the camera geometry and of its equivalent focal length and focal distance calibration was also necessary to correct for the perspective and non linear image distortions introduced by the specific optical path of the experimental setup this path comprised different lenses and the channel wall made of tempered glass this latter introduced significant distortion and aberration see for instance hirsch et al 2015 the calibration procedure was performed by translating a dot type target through the volume of measurement and by recording the target image at different planes along the system optical axis which corresponded to the z axis of the reference system see fig 11 left a least square minimization was operated to determine the best fit parameters between the ddpiv model and the actual camera design the resulting equivalent system had a focal length of 47 4 mm and a distance to the focal plane of 950 mm measurement uncertainties were calculated to be approximately 20 μm along the x and y axes and 70 μm along the z axis crossflow while their distribution in the measurement volume is shown in fig 11 right the ratio between the in plane and the out of plane uncertainties was within the range reported in pereira and gharib 2002 three halogen flood lamps for a total power of 3 kw generated a light volume along the central section of the flume and were placed above the volumes of interest zones i ii or iii the light cone was masked in the z direction in order to bound the depth of the measurement volume and limit it to the flow domain of interest the volume mapped by the ddpiv volumetric system was 180 120 100 mm3 see figs 3 and 11 4 2 seeding and sand particles the experiments were carried out in clean water with sand particles being used as tracers for the solid phase and piv type seeding particles for the liquid phase the flow seeding consisted of silver coated hollow glass particles with a narrow granulometric distribution around a median value of 100 μm and a density ρ p 1 1 g cm 3 the behavior of a particle under the action of the surrounding flow is governed by the stokes number st defined as the ratio between the timescale for the particle to react τp 1 18 ρp ρf d2 p ν and the smallest timescale of the turbulent flow the kolmogorov timescale τη ν ϵ 1 2 where ϵ is the turbulent energy dissipation rate per unit mass if the particle size dp is smaller than the kolmogorov length scale η ν 3 ϵ 1 4 the stokes number can be approximated as 8 s t k τ p τ η 1 18 ρ p ρ f d p η 2 where ρp and ρf are the particle and fluid density respectively when st k 1 the particles follow closely the fluid motion for particles larger than the kolmogorov length scale the appropriate flow timescale is not the kolmogorov timescale τη but the turbulent dynamic time at the scale of the particle size τ d d p 2 ϵ 1 3 this taylor type timescale defined through dp gives a new stokes number defined as 9 s t d τ p τ d 1 18 ρ p ρ f d p η 4 3 the stokes number has been evaluated for both the piv seeding and the sand particles resulting in s t d 0 13 and s t k 0 35 for the former particles d p 0 1 mm while s t d 1 03 and s t k 4 43 for the heavier and larger d p 0 6 mm sand particles as expected the piv seeding particles std 1 follow the flow closely while the sand particles std 1 behave like massive particles std is of order one therefore the sediment size is relatively large compared with the kolmogorov scale and the particle entrainment mechanisms are dominated by macro turbulence structures soldati and marchioli 2009 the stokes number influence on particle suspension and deposition has been highlighted in previous works soldati and marchioli 2009 xu and bodenschatz 2008 larger particles require larger momentum than smaller ones to enter into suspension large stokes number particles that possess enough momentum may either coast through some accretion region and deposit by impact directly at the wall or go into suspension otherwise those particles that have not received enough momentum simply deposit on the seabed due to gravity and inertia mattioli et al 2012 4 3 separation between liquid and solid phases the 3d lagrangian technique provided location and size for each tracked particle during the particle identification the particle image was fitted by a 2d gaussian surface the equivalent radius of the cross sectional ellipse was taken as the size parameter during the trajectory identification and reconstruction process a constraint was imposed on the radius assigning to each trajectory a radius r corresponding to the median value along the trajectory lifetime with this in mind the experiments were performed with two goals i solid phase observation in which no seeding was added and ii solid phase and seeding observation where a consistent amount of silver coated hollow glass particles with a narrow granulometric distribution around a median value of 100 μm was dispersed close to the measurement volume the large difference between the seeding and the sand particle sizes allows to define a clustering criterion to classify and separate the trajectories of the solid particles from those of the seeding the plot of the particle equivalent size distribution is shown in fig 12 left distributions are shown for the transient and equilibrium scour state phases of the seabed and for different zones the black and red lines show the normalized probability density function p r max p r in zone i for the transient and equilibrium scour state phases respectively the distribution of r appears as a lognormal distribution which retains its features also when the equilibrium scour state is reached on the contrary blue and cyan lines represent the transition and equilibrium scour state values of r when seeding particles are added these distributions exhibit a neat bimodal shape which we can characterize through a maximum likelihood procedure the single solid phase follows a lognormal distribution while the hollow silver coated glass particles follow a normal gaussian distribution to demonstrate the validity of this approach we report in fig 12 right the granulometric distributions with their normal and lognormal fits both the seeding particles and the sand particles maintain their statistical properties as we move from the transient to the equilibrium scour state the lognormal shape agrees well with the physics of the investigated phenomenon the stronger shear required to mobilize a large heavy sand grain also mobilizes smaller and lighter particles while weaker events can only move smaller and lighter particles a first characterization of the erosion transport and deposition processes is done by inspecting the evolution of the spatial distribution of the particle concentration c over the wave phase ωt data were sampled in phase following the procedure described in section 3 then the particle concentration histograms were extracted by discretizing the wave phase space into bins with phase width δ ω t 8 and the geometric space into cells with dimensions δ x 4 mm δ y 4 mm δ z 4 mm the intersection between the gaussian and the lognormal distribution provides a threshold to separate flow seeding from sand grains the results about suspended sand grains in section 5 are represented by isosurfaces of the sand particle number density ρn 4 4 trajectory identification a tracking algorithm was fed with the sequence of 3d positions of particles identified through the ddpiv technique the process required the knowledge of the expected maximum displacement and maximum displacement gradient respectively associated to the particle velocity v and acceleration a with dt being the time between two snapshots of the particle field and assigning the velocity vector to the middle point in order to take advantage of the central difference accuracy three steps were required for trajectory identification and validation i at t 0 each identified particle was taken as the initial point of a possible trajectory ii at t 0 d t a set of candidates at successive locations along the trajectory were sought within a circle of radius v dt iii for each pair of particles belonging to a potential trajectory a third companion was sought at t 0 2 d t within a circle of radius v a d t d t centered at the midpoint between the first two particles and within a given tolerance if a particle was found at t 0 2 d t the potential trajectory was validated and used to extend the search further in time by applying step iii in succession the procedure needs the existence of a triplet of particles at the required positions in space and time and enforces a strong constraint on the trajectory reconstruction however some of these reconstructed trajectories may be parts of a longer particle trajectory in fact 3d detection may fail at any time step thus interrupting the trajectory reconstruction at that time step to reconnect these broken trajectories step iii was applied up to eight further timesteps beyond the end of each previously identified partial trajectory using a parametric catmull rom spline catmull and rom 1974 with the last two particle positions of the trajectory under test and the first two of the candidate extension as control points a last check was done on the continuity of the velocity magnitude between the trajectories to be reconnected and the extension segment under this c 1 type condition up to 5 of broken trajectories was reconnected 4 5 flow descriptors for the sand transport the large number of lagrangian trajectories of sand grains determined over the whole time duration of an experiment can be broken into in phase subsets at each epzc thus allowing one to study the influence of the local action of the coherent flow structures on the sediment grains subsequently a spatial resampling was applied to the lagrangian data to build an eulerian 3d velocity dataset averaged in phase and space resulting in a 3d grid with cells 3 mm in side and with phase increments δ ω t 8 the velocity gradient tensor d d i j u i x j can be decomposed into a symmetric and a skew symmetric part d i j ω i j s i j the characteristic equation for d can be written as 10 λ 3 p λ 2 q λ r 0 where p q and r are the invariants of the velocity gradient tensor applying the symmetric skew symmetric decomposition to the second invariant q we obtain 11 q 1 2 t r d 2 t r d 2 1 2 ω 2 s 2 1 2 u x 2 v y 2 w z 2 u y v x u z w x v z w y q represents the local balance between shear strain rate and vorticity intensity identifying vortices as elliptic areas where the vorticity is larger than the rate of strain kolar 2007 s is the rate of strain tensor and ω the rigid rotation tensor the q 0 criterion states that a vortex can be defined as a connected fluid region where the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor is positive although the eulerian and q descriptors are applied to the solid phase the resulting vortex formations thereby identified are robust indicators of fluid vortical structures which explain why the sand grains are subject to up welling down welling and rolling at different wave phase angles in that respect these quantities are complementary to the lagrangian description of where these phenomena occur 4 6 error analysis the implementation of the 3d ddpiv requires a calibration procedure upon which the expected accuracy of the system is calculated inside the whole measurement volume as described in pereira and gharib 2002 measurement uncertainties in the 3d particles centroids identification were approximately 20 μm along the x and y axes and 70 μm along the z axis crossflow the reconstruction of the trajectory of a particle p between ta and tb requires the identification of the particle s position at successive times with the particle s sequence at hand the velocity vector is 12 u i t k x i t j 1 x i t j δ t where j a b and k a b is assigned to the middle point between the particle centroid positions at tj and t j 1 this results in a central difference scheme whose uncertainty is of o δ t 2 the reconstruction of the broken trajectories described in section 4 4 imposes the c 1 continuity between the connecting paths and the pre existing segments and a negligible level of artifacts is expected during the eulerian in phase resampling the expected accuracy for a 95 confidence interval follows 13 u u σ t n s 1 δ 2 n s where u is the parameter of interest u and σ are the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution and δ is the probability that u does not fall within the interval 5 results on flow sediment and seabed evolution 5 1 overview the discussion is centered on the possible couplings between the flow structures the transport of sand grains and the seabed evolution during the equilibrium scour state we first introduce the results regarding the pressure signature from the pressure transducers then the bulk behavior of the sediment mobilization along the wave phase is reported finally the description of transport of sand grains by the fluid flow is given multiple events of detachment transport and sinking of individual sand grains are followed in a lagrangian fashion over the wave phase in order to investigate the regions of active detachment and sinking of the moving solid particles see section 5 4 the lagrangian trajectories acquired for more than 150 wave periods have been broken into pieces and shifted in time to obtain a wave phased representation of the sparse velocity field of the detached solid particles they are then interpolated on a regular 3d grid to obtain a phase averaged eulerian description of the coherent structures inside the flow as experienced by the displaced grains to this aim the representation of 2d slices showing the three components of the eulerian velocity field combined with 3d isosurfaces the q criterion contribute to clarify the role of the fundamental coherent structures responsible for the seabed morphodynamics around the cylinder these structures indicate why the sand grains are subject to up welling down welling and rolling at different wave phase angles and are complementary to the lagrangian description of where these phenomena occur the lagrangian and eulerian velocity fields are based on the motion of the sand grains and we can extract information only where detachment transport or sinking are active i e in the lower layers of fluid close to the seabed and to the cylinder s toe among the large number of distinct elementary transport processes we focus on five main mobilization transport mechanisms three during the onshore and two during the offshore flows i generation and distortion of the horseshoe vortex at the toe point and o in fig 8 ii intense scouring at the top of the flatbed region point p in fig 8 iii vortex shedding in the wake during direct onshore flow iv shear crossflow on the lee side of the cylinder and v large vertical shearing in the flatbed region during the reverse offshore flow point p in fig 8 5 2 pressure distribution the combination of free surface elevation and flow dynamics induces a pressure field evolution that is captured by the pressure transducers the wave phase averaged signature of the absolute pressure and of its spatial gradients hydrostatic plus dynamic contributions are illustrated in fig 13 for the former and in figs 14 and 15 for the latter standard deviations not reported are lower than 2 4 10 4 for pressure transducer p3 and lower than 2 0 10 4 for the other sensors here the pressure gradient dp dx where x is a curvilinear coordinate along the surface of the cylinder from the stagnation point was analyzed by dividing the wave cycle into two stages the wave crest stage 0 ωt 130 and the wave trough stage 130 ωt 360 the maximum surface elevation occurred at about ω t 60 since the pressure transducers were located every δ ϕ 45 around the cylinder the distance dx between two neighboring pressure transducers was constant and equal to π d 0 5 p s 8 where p s 0 038 m is the size of the pressure sensor the distances p7 to p8 and p3 to p1 are 53 8 mm the cylinder induces pressure gradients adverse to the fluid motion causing flow separation at the wall the pressure is used to identify the location of this separation the oscillating boundary layer forced by the progressive wave splits vertically in front of the cylinder at the stagnation point and flushes horizontally around the cylinder s surface during the wave crest stage the forcing wave with kc 10 is strong enough to separate the incoming bottom boundary layer flushing this latter around the cylinder under the action of the adverse pressure gradient sumer et al 1997 the pressure measurements in front of the cylinder sensors p7 and p8 confirm that the pressure gradient is adverse positive from ωt 20 hence a horseshoe vortex is expected a discussion on how this coherent structure in interacting with the sand grains is proposed in section 5 4 for phases 40 ωt 70 which correspond to the passage of the wave crest the pressure data around the surface of the cylinder see fig 14 reveal that the adverse pressure gradient is located between the pressure transducers p4 and p3 during this interval the pressure gradient between p5 and p4 is negative boundary layer separation occurs at about ϕ 135 thus the formation of lee wake vortices is favoured and shedding is possibly responsible for the strong scour observed behind the cylinder at ϕ 180 after the passage of the wave crest flow deceleration occurs with the pressure gradients p4 p5 and p5 p6 becoming positive such condition can explain the strong particle mobilization observed in fig 17 b and c when flow deceleration occurs the pressure gradient decreases between p7 and p8 and increases between p8 and p6 at ωt 70 we argue that this is induced by the motion of the horseshoe vortex around the cylinder during the wave trough stage or flow reversal the wave asymmetry induces smaller pressure gradients see fig 15 along the surface of the cylinder the adverse pressure gradient occurs for a very short period 180 ωt 210 between p5 and p6 whereas the pressure gradient between p3 and p4 remains negative the separation point seems to be placed at about 90 the pressure gradient p 3 p 1 is positive for almost the whole phase ωt 300 5 3 bulk phase evolution of sediment transport the phase evolution of the bulk quantity of sediment that is lifted from the bottom and eventually displaced away by the action of the fluid close to the bed is analyzed in order to identify and capture the phenomena that influence the bed morphodynamics fig 16 compares the total number of trajectories with the wave elevation at x 0 and with the horizontal velocity u at point p of coordinates 29 mm 12 mm 79 mm placed at about 6 mm from the bed this point was selected because the most intense dynamics were observed in this area the wave elevation peak corresponds to the minimum number of trajectories while the maximum number is reached at the enzc and persists till about the wave trough the phase variation of the horizontal velocity at p is seen to slightly anticipate that of the free surface the correspondence between the peak of the wave elevation and the minimum number of captured trajectories which is followed by a rapid increase as the wave elevation approached its enzc is not observed during epzc this is expected because of the strong asymmetry of the wave the intense wave elevation gradient and the consequent pressure gradient forcing is concentrated in less than a third of the whole wave period in turn the negative counterpart has a lower amplitude variation and extends on two thirds of the wave period to illustrate this scenario we report in fig 17 four phases each representing five consecutively recorded images of the particle field in region ii arrows are drawn to indicate the sand displacement at ω t 33 and before the wave crest a strong acceleration of the lower fluid layers displaces particles downstream simultaneously scouring the bulk of sediments close to point p of fig 8 the flow action is limited to a narrow layer close to the bottom only during the flow deceleration and near the bed a large quantity of sediments is mobilized fig 17 top right then convected upstream after flow reversal fig 17 bottom left and right during the last stage of the offshore flow the sediment concentration drops to minimum values as the sand deposits without significant contribution from local scouring this scenario confirms that particle mobilization is strongly promoted by the flow deceleration as reported e g in alsina et al 2012 5 4 flow structures and solid transport here we investigate the correlations between the wave phase the generation and persistence of coherent structures and the sand mobilization and displacement the key agents influencing the flow around the slender cylinder are i the cylinder ii the mobile seabed molded by the action of the flow iii the non linear gravity wave which transfers energy to the system and sets the periodicity of the sand fluid coupling the analysis is limited to the equilibrium scour state to reduce the role of the mobile seabed to an almost regular periodic contribution where a phase average operator can be successfully applied to velocity data the wave induced flow velocity see fig 16 oscillates between a negative minimum and a larger positive maximum value consequently and depending on re t the cylinder and the mobile seabed are subjected to a number of asymmetric flow conditions in particular at the beginning of the onshore flow ω t 0 the velocity crosses the zero towards positive values and increases under the action of the progressive wave 5 4 1 the horseshoe vortex for small particle orbital dimension relative to the cylinder s diameter i e for small kc the horseshoe vortex may not appear because the stroke of the fluid motion is too weak to allow the boundary layer to separate for large values of kc the stroke of the fluid motion is so large that the flow for each period replicates that observed in a steady current baykal et al 2017 in flat bed conditions the lower limit of k c 6 is assumed for horseshoe vortex occurrence see sumer et al 1997 but the observed seabed morphological evolution significantly changes the conditions of interaction between the incoming boundary layer and the cylinder the central vertical section of the bathymetry at equilibrium scour condition reported in fig 18 is characterized by a sequence of peaks and throughs culminating in a deep upside down truncated cone around the cylinder notwithstanding an horseshoe vortex is still allowed to develop by this novel bed shape as detected by the pressure transducers its efficiency in scouring the seabed is strongly inhibited because the scour around the cylinder reduces the shear stress at the cylinder s nose the downward flow close to the cylinder can freely expand in the seabed hole below the stagnation point which results in a negative bed shear stress amplification see e g baykal et al 2017 fig 16 b for a comparison with a numerical simulation the deeper scour downstream the obstacle suggests that the same behavior may be occurring downstream the obstacle during the reverse flow activity fig 19 reports the isosurface q 80 red to illustrate the evolution of the horseshoe vortex along with the sediment number density ρn at a value of 1 3 mm 3 a large mobilization of sand grains at the toe of the cylinder is observed see fig 19 plots a and b and occurs after epzc causing a steep scouring around the cylinder close to the reference point at ϕ 90 in fig 8 this process is due to the evolution of the horseshoe vortex generated below the stagnation point on the upstream side of the cylinder which wraps around the obstacle and emerges from the trough at about ϕ 90 point in fig 8 in an almost flat region of the seabed the flat bed amplifies the horseshoe vortex capability to interact with the sand grains and a small coherent structure arises close to the toe of the cylinder at ω t 8 and stretches upward around the obstacle as seen in plots b to c of fig 19 sand particles that are trapped inside the core of the horseshoe vortex are lifted up as shown by the trajectories in fig 20 a and by the strong upward velocity region seen in fig 21 from phase ω t 0 48 yellow and white vectors this region evolves next to the surface of the cylinder progresses downstream and expands along the vertical direction see fig 22 the upward stretching of the horseshoe vortex at ω t 8 see fig 19a is localized close to the bed at ϕ 135 point o in fig 8 and is determined by the steep rise of the bathymetry at larger wave phases the upward stretching is enforced by the rise of the adverse pressure gradient in the wake and at the base of the cylinder in fact a positive pressure difference is seen between locations p3 and p4 at ω t 32 see fig 14 5 4 2 intense scouring at the top of the flatbed region at the same time the flow in the lower fluid layers undergoes an intense acceleration and interacts strongly with the bed around point p of fig 8 the bathymetry profile forces the fluid to move upward see fig 21 for ω t 32 and ωt 48 inducing an ejection of sediments from the top of the sand crest the intense scouring displaces a large amount of sand as shown in fig 17 top left and reorganizes the local flow in a large transversely oriented shear region as seen in fig 19 d ω t 40 the flow bed interaction is intense but impulsive thus the sand displacement is limited yet contributes to restore the previously scoured area 5 4 3 wake vortex shedding during onshore direct flow as the fluid accelerates along the seabed the flow detaches due to the adverse pressure gradient and generates two shear layers in the wake of the cylinder the horizontal flow is laminar around the cylinder and the streamline curvature encloses the whole body the further increase in velocity induces an adverse pressure gradient that determines flow separation and the formation of vertically oriented coherent structures shedding vortices fig 23 gives the isosurface q 80 red and the sediment number density ρn at a value of 1 3 mm 3 blue to illustrate the generation and evolution of the horseshoe vortex after the passage of the wave crest when the horizontal pressure gradient changes sign and flow reversal acceleration starts at ϕ 135 the incipient reverse flow creates a region of upward flow see fig 21 at ω t 48 and fig 24 for ω t 64 and 80 which is also seen to translate upstream this finding is consistent with the pressure gradient p4 p5 which is lower than the p5 p6 difference seen in fig 14 in the upstream section where p5 and p6 are located the flow is mainly downward see fig 24 on the lee side of the cylinder a pair of wake vortices is also generated along the cylinder axis see fig 21 at ω t 48 such a result is in agreement with the pressure data reported in fig 14 the interaction of the wake vortices with the horseshoe structure contributes to its deformation in the upward direction displacing also the sediment fig 23 at ω t 48 the lower layers of fluid are more sensitive to the inversion of the velocity gradient hence a thin tongue of fluid close to the cylinder starts to move offshore while the fluid layers above are still moving onshore following the free surface elevation a similar result is observed when a significant increase of the bottom shear stresses are produced corvaro et al 2014a miozzi et al 2015 the base of the lee wake vortex is captured in this movement and stretches outwards in the crossflow direction see plots b to d in figs 19 and fig 23 from ω t 48 to 72 sand grains are massively displaced from the seabed during this event mainly in the vertical direction with some horizontal spreading see fig 17 at ω t 88 and fig 23 from ω t 104 to 136 however this sediment is not captured by the free stream flow not yet active in that region as seen in fig 24 for ω t 80 5 4 4 shear crossflow on the lee side of the cylinder as the phase increases the flow progressively reverses starting from the downstream section of the cylinder the flow field is seen to rotate clockwise see fig 24 from ω t 96 to 136 during this flow reorientation a crossflow current is created from the interaction between the direct and reverse flows see fig 24 at ω t 104 at ω t 120 no onshore flow is visible creating a region of almost quiescent conditions at ω t 136 the reverse flow is fully established fig 20 from ω t 112 to 132 and fig 23 from ω t 120 to 136 show the particle displacement during this process a large volume of lifted sediment evolves in the region around ϕ 90 and ϕ 270 where flows of opposite direction meet then develop along the extended shear layer in the crossflow direction as a consequence the accumulation region at ϕ 135 is replenished with the sand scoured during the final stage of the onshore flow evolution see fig 8 interestingly this sediment was mobilized during the onset of the lee wake vortices originating mostly from the wake area of the cylinder see the comments made upon fig 24 5 4 5 large vertical shearing in the flatbed region during reverse flow once the reverse flow occupies the whole space a large quantity of sediment moves upstream towards an almost clean quiescent region as observed at ω t 132 in fig 20 and ω t 136 in fig 23 a coherent structure also appears from the residue of the horseshoe vortex created during the direct flow phase see plots g and h of the same figure this structure is re energized at the beginning of offshore flow propagation and sweeps around the cylinder in the upstream direction and towards the seabed see the q isosurface at ω t 136 and ω t 152 in fig 23 being far from the seabed its capacity to mobilize sediment is negligible however it contributes to displace sand grains across long distances around the cylinder thus adding little change to the erosion at the cylinder toe after ω t 152 and onward see fig 20 and fig 23 the coherent structures disaggregate while the sand in the lower flow layers settle on the seabed 6 conclusions we described the motion of sand grains around a slender cylinder fitted into a mobile seabed and forced by a train of progressive non linear waves during wave evolution the sand was mobilized displaced and settled starting from a flat bed a system of ripples with troughs and crests was generated during the initial transient regime before reaching an equilibrium scour state regime in spite of the particle movement at the wave passage the bed morphology remained almost unchanged over each wave period on this basis an in phase average analysis was conducted on the sand grain motion during the equilibrium scour state regime via a particle tracking velocimetry technique and results have been reported in terms of both lagrangian and eulerian viewpoints this analysis relied on the use of the defocusing digital piv technique ddpiv for the first time applied to the specific flow of interest here data from a set of pressure transducers and free surface elevation gauges were integrated with the velocity data we captured the dynamics of sand particles generated by five main phenomena occurring in the region of interest i generation and distortion of the horseshoe vortex around the cylinder under the effect of the direct flow ii intense localized scour at the top of the flatbed region iii onset and distortion of the lee wake vortex pair iv cross flow current generated from flow reversal v large vertical shearing that occurred in the cross flow region at the onset of the flow reversal which was responsible for an intense mobilization of sand particles the wave asymmetry imposed a large acceleration during the growth of wave elevation this implied an intense scouring close to the bed surface peaks that displaced sand grains away from their source location the scour was concentrated in small areas closely connected to the top of the seabed at around 135 downstream close to the regions where the topographic slope decreased to zero on the contrary when the flow decelerated a large number of particles were mobilized and then transported by the external flow this mobilization took place in the flat regions of the bed where the incoming offshore flow generated a shear able to uplift the sand during the onshore flow displaced particles moved towards the region of flat bathymetry during the offshore flow a transversal flow component arose to partially inhibit the upstream particle displacement thus preserving the large accumulation region at 135 from particle depletion the horseshoe vortex was responsible of the narrow and deep scour at the cylinder toe sand grains captured inside its core were carried upward close to the cylinder and displaced away the lee wake vortex pair caused the scouring of the bed downstream of the cylinder and was followed by the mobilization of particles and their displacement upstream by the incoming reverse flow at the bottom prospective work will regard the analysis of the liquid phase mapped using the low stokes number seeding particles we expect to obtain a better insight on the coupling mechanisms between the liquid and the solid phases and therefrom clarify the role of inertia and particle size in the transport of sand grains 
640,we study the dynamics of a sandy bed around a slender vertical cylinder forced by progressive non linear water waves the seabed evolves continuously under the effects of the up welling down welling and rolling events induced by vortical coherent structures in turn these are closely connected to the shape of the seabed which is modified by the scouring and or the deposition of the sand starting from a flat seabed progressive waves induce a rapid and transient modification of the bottom morphology towards a dynamically stable equilibrium state which is the focus of this work the dynamical equilibrium state is a function of the wave period and is reached when the seabed morphology is not substantially altered we describe such a state by an eulerian in phase analysis of the sand particle motion inferred from lagrangian data collected over a large number of wave passages this analysis relies on the use of the defocusing digital piv technique ddpiv for the first time applied to the specific flow of interest here on the basis of the eulerian analysis the triggering of the key events up and down welling rolling over the wave phase is captured by identifying through the q 0 criterion the coherent flow structures responsible for the events this analysis is coupled with the description of the sediment trajectories analyzed in a lagrangian manner and effectively assessing how and where the solid phase is transported during the key events five main mobilization transport mechanisms have been identified three during the onshore flow and two during the offshore flow i generation of a coherent structure reminiscent of a horseshoe vortex at the toe ii intense scouring at the top of the flatbed region iii vortex shedding in the wake during direct onshore flow iv shear crossflow on the lee side of the cylinder and v large vertical shearing in the flatbed region during the reverse offshore flow at flow reversal this shearing mechanism impacts on a significant area of sediments in the incoming region of the flow keywords waves morphodynamics sediment transport cylinder volumetric tracking trajectories 1 introduction the presence of an obstacle close to the seabed e g pipeline vertical cylinder in a marine environment influences and modifies the flow patterns resulting in the development of coherent flow structures close to the seabed such structures are responsible for an amplification of the sediment dynamics that leads to erosion at the root of the obstacles manes and brocchini 2015 and to the formation of periodic rolling grain or vortex ripples see blondeaux 2012 for a review about ripple formation small perturbations induced by the wave passage over the seabed give rise to recirculating cells that are capable of dragging sediments from the troughs of the seabed undulations towards their crests sleath 1984 thus altering the seabed morphology in a dynamic balance between gravity and drag during this process the seabed evolves towards a dynamical equilibrium known as the equilibrium scour state the configuration of which is also a function of the granulometric distribution of the sediments foti and blondeaux 1995 here we focus on the equilibrium scour morphodynamics induced by a vertical slender cylinder fitted into a sandy seabed under the influence of non linear progressive waves we follow the morphodynamic evolution over an entire wave phase focusing on the uplift transport and deposition of the sand particles by means of a lagrangian approach and of the lagrangian derived eulerian flow description we study the flow around the cylinder specifically the vortex structures at the cylinder s toe and their evolution under the continuous remoulding of the seabed to this aim we combine measurements of pressure at the seabed and seabed morphology with a 3d lagrangian description of the sand grain displacement this set of information allows us to clarify some of the complex phenomena that characterize the morphodynamics of the seabed by relating the fluid phase with the solid one through a two way coupling process the uplifting transport deposition of the sand by the flow on one hand and the evolution of coherent flow structures as imposed by the changes of the seabed morphology on the other in spite of its apparent simplicity the flow around a cylinder exhibits a rich set of complex scenarios varying with the flow conditions in the case of a cylinder impacted upon by a steady cross flow at re 1 4 105 the phenomenology of the observed flow is characterized by a transition in the shear layer subcritical regime before the onset of the drag crisis see zdravkovich 1997 and sumer and fredsøe 1997 downstream of the stagnation point a laminar boundary layer develops on the surface of the cylinder until the adverse pressure gradient caused by the cylinder wall curvature forces the flow separation zdravkovich 1997 transition waves roll up in discrete eddies that evolve into turbulent eddies the shear layer undergoes a laminar turbulent transition which energizes the flow before reattaching to the surface zdravkovich 1997 where the turbulent boundary layer finally separates the wake on the lee side of the cylinder is then delimited by a pair of shear layers separated by an oscillating laminar separation bubble that appears in the region between the point of the laminar separation and the turbulent shear layer reattachment see capone et al 2016 and miozzi et al 2016 in wall mounted cylinders the junction flow around the obstacle produces a three dimensional separation with horseshoe vortices that wrap around the obstacle simpson 2001 the incoming boundary layer splits in front of the cylinder at the stagnation point generating a topologically complex system of horseshoe vortices baker 1979 ballio and franzetti 2000 as a general rule the primary horseshoe vortex rotates in the same direction of the incoming boundary layer vorticity whereas the secondary vortices arrange their rotation direction to guarantee topological consistency as a consequence high intensity events originating in the incoming flow are captured inside the primary vortex leading to an increase of drag and pressure fluctuations in the junction flow region and promoting intense scouring events simpson 2001 the significant increase in drag coefficient cd is mainly caused by the asymmetric distribution of the pressure between the upstream and the downstream sides of the cylinder horseshoe vortices in steady currents are responsible for much of the scouring around an obstacle when a cylinder fitted into a mobile bed is impacted upon by an oscillating wave the above scenario operates differently and the scour is mainly governed by the wake vortices not only the wave induced flow velocity periodically changes sign but its intensity oscillates between negative and positive maxima thus the whole set of flow conditions for a cylinder in a 0 to re max crossflow occurs in our case the non linear waves are not sinusoidal and display an asymmetric and skewed profile hence asymmetric behaviors on the formation of vortices during each half cycle are also expected in order to relate the wave induced flow and the geometry of the obstacle the keulegan carpenter number k c u m t d 2 π a d has been introduced in keulegan and carpenter 1958 where d is the cylinder diameter t is the wave period um is the maximum value of the undisturbed orbital velocity at the bed and a is the semi amplitude of the orbital displacement in addition to re kc is a dimensionless parameter useful to describe the different flow regimes that take place at different wave conditions sumer et al 1997 illustrate the evolution of different flow features as a function of kc the evolution of a mobile seabed in response to the horseshoe vortex system and in general to the whole set of coherent structures is highly non linear and not straightforward we have observed that in the first part of the test the spatial profile of the undisturbed initially flat seabed around the cylinder was largely modified by the passage of the startup waves after the decay of the transient phase a periodically steady equilibrium the equilibrium scour state was reached where the morphology of the seabed was preserved in a periodic fashion despite being subject to accretion and erosion hence during each half cycle the live bed condition of the flow was such that sediments were lifted off the bed and transported roughly from and to the same regions thus a minor net transport of sediments occurred which only slightly modified the seabed morphology baykal et al 2017 sand grains are mobilized by turbulent flows when the local shear stress exceeds the local resistance to detachment of the sand particle nearing 1991 in that respect the local slope of the bed as experienced by the fluid flow nearing 1991 is of fundamental importance with the loci of slant reduction at the top of the ripples being the favorite locations for sand detachment foti and blondeaux 1995 in fact different flow regimes take place during a wave period at the seabed around the toe of the cylinder baykal et al 2017 sumer and fredsøe 2002 differential sand detachment occurs as a function of the local flow shear stress and bed slope and modifies the slope itself both in terms of steepness and height both bedload and suspended load transport can induce a net solid transport from and to different bed regions hence the flow regime is strongly influenced by the seabed mobility and efforts to reproduce all the dynamics evolving at an erodible bed through use of a rigid mould may not be adequate manes and brocchini 2015 in the present study all data on scour refer to the asymptotic scour state which corresponds to the final morphology measured when the seabed is dried section 2 details the experimental setup whereas section 3 outlines the methodologies used to assess the wave and the scour characteristic features section 4 describes the experimental approach and procedures used to quantify the transport of the liquid and solid phases the results of the study are outlined in section 5 where the instantaneous lagrangian and eulerian quantities of the fluid flow are discussed in conjunction with the mobilization and transport processes of sediments as well as with the asymptotic scour maps conclusions are provided in section 6 2 the experimental setup the experimental tests have been performed in the wave flume of the hydraulics laboratory of the università politecnica delle marche ancona italy the flume is 50 m long 1 3 m high and 1 m wide see fig 1 the sidewalls are glassed for the central 36 m and enable one to carry out optical measurements an adsorbing mildly sloping beach made of coarse gravel was used to reduce the wave reflection about 4 5 and to guarantee an undisturbed flow in the measuring area the water level η at different locations in the flume were measured and monitored by seven electro sensitive elevation gauges see fig 1 in particular elevation gauges s4 and s5 were placed upstream and downstream of the cylinder respectively see fig 2 the diameter of the vertical cylinder was d 10 cm and the water depth over the physical model was h 50 cm both regular and irregular waves were tested with different wave heights h 7 cm 27 cm and periods t 1 8 s 2 7 s as such kc ranged from 2 to 20 the study is centered on a wave setting characterized by an incident height h i 0 17 m a period t 2 739 s and a kc 10 this wave is of practical interest because it represents a realistic condition for intermediate water flows kc has been computed by using the maximum of the undisturbed velocity at the bed um this velocity has been calculated using the linear theory for the small discrepancy between measured and predicted horizontal velocities over an impermeable bed corvaro et al 2014b miozzi et al 2015 the cylinder diameter to wavelength ratio was smaller than 0 1 which is typical of a slender cylinder configuration the mobile seabed model had a length of 1 5 m a width of 1 0 m and a thickness of 0 13 m and was composed of sieved sand with mean diameter d 50 0 6 mm and density ρ s 2 63 g cm 3 in view of the optical measurements to be performed during this experiment the fine sand part was filtered out in order to reduce the water turbidity fig 3 shows a schematic drawing of the physical model depicting the coordinate system and the location of the wave elevation gauges s4 and s5 in the context of the cylinder seabed configuration the origin of the reference frame x y z was such that the x axis indicated the streamwise direction the z axis the cross flow or transversal direction and the y axis the upward direction along the cylinder axis the center of the cylinder in the horizontal plane x z at the flatbed y location was chosen to be the origin of the reference system also reported are the three regions of interest that will be used for flow and sand characterization in addition seven pressure transducers were placed in the seabed upstream downstream and around the cylinder here with an angular spacing δ ϕ 45 starting at the stagnation point see fig 4 these sensors were placed about 5 mm above the flat seabed during most of the wave phases the transducers were not covered by sand depending on the local bed morphodynamic evolution 3 wave elevation and scour bathymetry 3 1 in phase wave description in order to describe the flow in terms of phase averaged quantities elevation positive zero crossing epzc points were identified by taking the values of η closest to the zero crossing of the growing wave phase at the location of the cylinder axis given the wave celerity the time histories of the wave elevation at gauges s4 and s5 see fig 3 were combined to obtain the wave elevation η at x 0 see fig 5 a number of about 150 wave periods was extracted with a median value t between epzcs of 2 74 s see fig 6 the sampling frequencies of the free surface elevation and of the flow snapshots see section 4 differ significantly hence the measurements of η were linearly resampled in order to match the sampling rate used for the flow analysis as described in section 4 on the basis of the wave periodicity quantities of interest are described using the triple decomposition introduced in reynolds and hussain 1972 this approach separates wave and turbulence components from the time average of any function f 1 f x t f x f x t s f x t where f x is the time average f x t s is the periodic component and f x t is the turbulence component ts 0 t and t is the wave period we define the time and the phase averages respectively as 2a f x t t f x lim t 1 t 0 t f x t d t 2b f x t p lim n 1 n n 1 n f x t s n t where n is the number of wave cycles and t is a time large enough for a correct estimate of the average terms application of the phase average to eq 1 gives the following wave contribution 3 f x t s f x t p f x so that the original signal can be written as 4 f x t f x t p f x t 3 2 bathymetry at equilibrium scour state after flattening the seabed each experimental test was carried out by starting the wavemaker in still water conditions the free surface elevation and the seabed profile evolved progressively during the initial transient period after which the flow was assumed to reach an equilibrium state of dynamical stability the equilibrium scour state sumer and fredsøe 2002 at the conclusion of the test the asymptotic scour topography was reconstructed by a laser distance measurement and mapped to uniformly spaced points on a 1 cm 1 cm grid the timescale ts of the scour process represents the period over which the scour undergoes a significant change and is defined by 5 t s d 2 g ρ s 1 d 50 3 0 5 t where t is the dimensionless timescale for waves t is function of both the shields parameter θ and kc here θ 0 08 is defined as θ u f 2 g s 1 d where u f τ ρ is the undisturbed velocity at bed g is the gravity acceleration s and d are the specific density and the diameter of the sediment grains sumer and fredsøe 1997 proposed the following formulation 6 t 10 6 k c θ for our wave the ts obtained by applying eq 5 is about 270 s fig 7 shows the comparison in time between the measured and predicted dimensionless scour depth s t d around the surface of the cylinder with s t being defined as 7 s t s 1 e t t s where s is the scour depth at steady state the timescale needed to reach the equilibrium scour depth red dotted line in fig 7 was found to be about one half of the predicted value therefore a time of 180 s after the start of the wavemaker was chosen as the time sufficient to reach the equilibrium scour state after about 70 wave cycles the system transitions to an equilibrium state where the bed morphology changes over the wave phase but returns to the initial state at each new cycle our study is centered on the measurement of this equilibrium scour state condition in the absence of an instantaneous measure of the bathymetry around the cylinder a sketch of the seabed as it appeared at asymptotic scour condition is shown in fig 8 see corvaro et al 2018 for further details it is characterized by a spatially organized pattern of ripples with peaks and troughs with a depth variation of about 12 5 mm from this plot it is possible to identify an eroded area that appears concentric with the cylinder with an increased depth at 60 upstream and at 180 downstream in the near wake region blue regions upstream the trough centered at around x 75 mm and crest at about x 125 mm delimit a large scour in front of the cylinder this trench evolves around the cylinder in the downstream direction and converges into a narrow channel in the wake of the cylinder this channel passes in between two peaks symmetrically placed downstream of the cylinder at x 75 mm and across zones ii and iii in these morphologically active regions large vortical structures arise at wave passage both during the direct and reversal flow conditions 4 flow field and sand transport the nearbed flow kinematics and the sediment transport paths were reconstructed by means of the defocusing digital piv technique ddpiv see pereira and gharib 2002 a volumetric velocimetry technique that retrieves the three components of the velocity field in a volume based on the determination of the physical three dimensional coordinates of flow tracers the velocity is calculated upon the displacement in space of the tracer during a predefined time interval ddpiv is therefore a lagrangian technique that can track particles if the tracking is performed on a time resolved manner for instance using a high speed implementation it is possible to reconstruct the trajectories of individual particles and consequently the velocity along the path to our knowledge this work represents the first application of the technique to this class of flows a four camera system was installed to perform the measurements see fig 9 three regions were investigated as shown in fig 3 respectively centered on the cylinder zone ii upstream zone i and downstream zone iii of the cylinder each zone corresponded to a volume of measurement with dimensions 180 120 100 mm3 the need to capture the behavior of sand particles in the close vicinity of the seabed implies the acquisition of images containing large views of the seabed itself thus a background removal is required to perform this operation a moving median on a buffer at frame n 12 frames is subtracted from each image at frame n resulting in a robust separation of the flow particles from the background this procedure is particularly effective around the epzc points where the number of trajectories is increased by as much as 50 see fig 10 4 1 ddpiv implementation defocusing digital particle image velocimetry ddpiv as described in pereira and gharib 2002 was implemented using a system consisting of four dalsa falcon 1 4m100 cameras with a resolution of 1400 1024 pixels and a 10 bit pixel depth these cameras have a small physical footprint 44 mm 44 mm 44 mm and can record full resolution images at a framerate of 100 hz in our case the image size was reduced to 1400 751 pixels in order to increase the framerate to 130 hz in this manner the pixel displacement of particles was also reduced to levels compatible with the ddpiv analysis allowing for a correct time resolved reconstruction of both the water and sand flow field ddpiv requires a volumetric calibration to build a camera model that is equivalent to the ddpiv optical system of pereira and gharib 2002 in the present implementation each sensor was equipped with different lenses and the geometry was defined according to the available optical accessibility implying the determination of the camera geometry and of its equivalent focal length and focal distance calibration was also necessary to correct for the perspective and non linear image distortions introduced by the specific optical path of the experimental setup this path comprised different lenses and the channel wall made of tempered glass this latter introduced significant distortion and aberration see for instance hirsch et al 2015 the calibration procedure was performed by translating a dot type target through the volume of measurement and by recording the target image at different planes along the system optical axis which corresponded to the z axis of the reference system see fig 11 left a least square minimization was operated to determine the best fit parameters between the ddpiv model and the actual camera design the resulting equivalent system had a focal length of 47 4 mm and a distance to the focal plane of 950 mm measurement uncertainties were calculated to be approximately 20 μm along the x and y axes and 70 μm along the z axis crossflow while their distribution in the measurement volume is shown in fig 11 right the ratio between the in plane and the out of plane uncertainties was within the range reported in pereira and gharib 2002 three halogen flood lamps for a total power of 3 kw generated a light volume along the central section of the flume and were placed above the volumes of interest zones i ii or iii the light cone was masked in the z direction in order to bound the depth of the measurement volume and limit it to the flow domain of interest the volume mapped by the ddpiv volumetric system was 180 120 100 mm3 see figs 3 and 11 4 2 seeding and sand particles the experiments were carried out in clean water with sand particles being used as tracers for the solid phase and piv type seeding particles for the liquid phase the flow seeding consisted of silver coated hollow glass particles with a narrow granulometric distribution around a median value of 100 μm and a density ρ p 1 1 g cm 3 the behavior of a particle under the action of the surrounding flow is governed by the stokes number st defined as the ratio between the timescale for the particle to react τp 1 18 ρp ρf d2 p ν and the smallest timescale of the turbulent flow the kolmogorov timescale τη ν ϵ 1 2 where ϵ is the turbulent energy dissipation rate per unit mass if the particle size dp is smaller than the kolmogorov length scale η ν 3 ϵ 1 4 the stokes number can be approximated as 8 s t k τ p τ η 1 18 ρ p ρ f d p η 2 where ρp and ρf are the particle and fluid density respectively when st k 1 the particles follow closely the fluid motion for particles larger than the kolmogorov length scale the appropriate flow timescale is not the kolmogorov timescale τη but the turbulent dynamic time at the scale of the particle size τ d d p 2 ϵ 1 3 this taylor type timescale defined through dp gives a new stokes number defined as 9 s t d τ p τ d 1 18 ρ p ρ f d p η 4 3 the stokes number has been evaluated for both the piv seeding and the sand particles resulting in s t d 0 13 and s t k 0 35 for the former particles d p 0 1 mm while s t d 1 03 and s t k 4 43 for the heavier and larger d p 0 6 mm sand particles as expected the piv seeding particles std 1 follow the flow closely while the sand particles std 1 behave like massive particles std is of order one therefore the sediment size is relatively large compared with the kolmogorov scale and the particle entrainment mechanisms are dominated by macro turbulence structures soldati and marchioli 2009 the stokes number influence on particle suspension and deposition has been highlighted in previous works soldati and marchioli 2009 xu and bodenschatz 2008 larger particles require larger momentum than smaller ones to enter into suspension large stokes number particles that possess enough momentum may either coast through some accretion region and deposit by impact directly at the wall or go into suspension otherwise those particles that have not received enough momentum simply deposit on the seabed due to gravity and inertia mattioli et al 2012 4 3 separation between liquid and solid phases the 3d lagrangian technique provided location and size for each tracked particle during the particle identification the particle image was fitted by a 2d gaussian surface the equivalent radius of the cross sectional ellipse was taken as the size parameter during the trajectory identification and reconstruction process a constraint was imposed on the radius assigning to each trajectory a radius r corresponding to the median value along the trajectory lifetime with this in mind the experiments were performed with two goals i solid phase observation in which no seeding was added and ii solid phase and seeding observation where a consistent amount of silver coated hollow glass particles with a narrow granulometric distribution around a median value of 100 μm was dispersed close to the measurement volume the large difference between the seeding and the sand particle sizes allows to define a clustering criterion to classify and separate the trajectories of the solid particles from those of the seeding the plot of the particle equivalent size distribution is shown in fig 12 left distributions are shown for the transient and equilibrium scour state phases of the seabed and for different zones the black and red lines show the normalized probability density function p r max p r in zone i for the transient and equilibrium scour state phases respectively the distribution of r appears as a lognormal distribution which retains its features also when the equilibrium scour state is reached on the contrary blue and cyan lines represent the transition and equilibrium scour state values of r when seeding particles are added these distributions exhibit a neat bimodal shape which we can characterize through a maximum likelihood procedure the single solid phase follows a lognormal distribution while the hollow silver coated glass particles follow a normal gaussian distribution to demonstrate the validity of this approach we report in fig 12 right the granulometric distributions with their normal and lognormal fits both the seeding particles and the sand particles maintain their statistical properties as we move from the transient to the equilibrium scour state the lognormal shape agrees well with the physics of the investigated phenomenon the stronger shear required to mobilize a large heavy sand grain also mobilizes smaller and lighter particles while weaker events can only move smaller and lighter particles a first characterization of the erosion transport and deposition processes is done by inspecting the evolution of the spatial distribution of the particle concentration c over the wave phase ωt data were sampled in phase following the procedure described in section 3 then the particle concentration histograms were extracted by discretizing the wave phase space into bins with phase width δ ω t 8 and the geometric space into cells with dimensions δ x 4 mm δ y 4 mm δ z 4 mm the intersection between the gaussian and the lognormal distribution provides a threshold to separate flow seeding from sand grains the results about suspended sand grains in section 5 are represented by isosurfaces of the sand particle number density ρn 4 4 trajectory identification a tracking algorithm was fed with the sequence of 3d positions of particles identified through the ddpiv technique the process required the knowledge of the expected maximum displacement and maximum displacement gradient respectively associated to the particle velocity v and acceleration a with dt being the time between two snapshots of the particle field and assigning the velocity vector to the middle point in order to take advantage of the central difference accuracy three steps were required for trajectory identification and validation i at t 0 each identified particle was taken as the initial point of a possible trajectory ii at t 0 d t a set of candidates at successive locations along the trajectory were sought within a circle of radius v dt iii for each pair of particles belonging to a potential trajectory a third companion was sought at t 0 2 d t within a circle of radius v a d t d t centered at the midpoint between the first two particles and within a given tolerance if a particle was found at t 0 2 d t the potential trajectory was validated and used to extend the search further in time by applying step iii in succession the procedure needs the existence of a triplet of particles at the required positions in space and time and enforces a strong constraint on the trajectory reconstruction however some of these reconstructed trajectories may be parts of a longer particle trajectory in fact 3d detection may fail at any time step thus interrupting the trajectory reconstruction at that time step to reconnect these broken trajectories step iii was applied up to eight further timesteps beyond the end of each previously identified partial trajectory using a parametric catmull rom spline catmull and rom 1974 with the last two particle positions of the trajectory under test and the first two of the candidate extension as control points a last check was done on the continuity of the velocity magnitude between the trajectories to be reconnected and the extension segment under this c 1 type condition up to 5 of broken trajectories was reconnected 4 5 flow descriptors for the sand transport the large number of lagrangian trajectories of sand grains determined over the whole time duration of an experiment can be broken into in phase subsets at each epzc thus allowing one to study the influence of the local action of the coherent flow structures on the sediment grains subsequently a spatial resampling was applied to the lagrangian data to build an eulerian 3d velocity dataset averaged in phase and space resulting in a 3d grid with cells 3 mm in side and with phase increments δ ω t 8 the velocity gradient tensor d d i j u i x j can be decomposed into a symmetric and a skew symmetric part d i j ω i j s i j the characteristic equation for d can be written as 10 λ 3 p λ 2 q λ r 0 where p q and r are the invariants of the velocity gradient tensor applying the symmetric skew symmetric decomposition to the second invariant q we obtain 11 q 1 2 t r d 2 t r d 2 1 2 ω 2 s 2 1 2 u x 2 v y 2 w z 2 u y v x u z w x v z w y q represents the local balance between shear strain rate and vorticity intensity identifying vortices as elliptic areas where the vorticity is larger than the rate of strain kolar 2007 s is the rate of strain tensor and ω the rigid rotation tensor the q 0 criterion states that a vortex can be defined as a connected fluid region where the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor is positive although the eulerian and q descriptors are applied to the solid phase the resulting vortex formations thereby identified are robust indicators of fluid vortical structures which explain why the sand grains are subject to up welling down welling and rolling at different wave phase angles in that respect these quantities are complementary to the lagrangian description of where these phenomena occur 4 6 error analysis the implementation of the 3d ddpiv requires a calibration procedure upon which the expected accuracy of the system is calculated inside the whole measurement volume as described in pereira and gharib 2002 measurement uncertainties in the 3d particles centroids identification were approximately 20 μm along the x and y axes and 70 μm along the z axis crossflow the reconstruction of the trajectory of a particle p between ta and tb requires the identification of the particle s position at successive times with the particle s sequence at hand the velocity vector is 12 u i t k x i t j 1 x i t j δ t where j a b and k a b is assigned to the middle point between the particle centroid positions at tj and t j 1 this results in a central difference scheme whose uncertainty is of o δ t 2 the reconstruction of the broken trajectories described in section 4 4 imposes the c 1 continuity between the connecting paths and the pre existing segments and a negligible level of artifacts is expected during the eulerian in phase resampling the expected accuracy for a 95 confidence interval follows 13 u u σ t n s 1 δ 2 n s where u is the parameter of interest u and σ are the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution and δ is the probability that u does not fall within the interval 5 results on flow sediment and seabed evolution 5 1 overview the discussion is centered on the possible couplings between the flow structures the transport of sand grains and the seabed evolution during the equilibrium scour state we first introduce the results regarding the pressure signature from the pressure transducers then the bulk behavior of the sediment mobilization along the wave phase is reported finally the description of transport of sand grains by the fluid flow is given multiple events of detachment transport and sinking of individual sand grains are followed in a lagrangian fashion over the wave phase in order to investigate the regions of active detachment and sinking of the moving solid particles see section 5 4 the lagrangian trajectories acquired for more than 150 wave periods have been broken into pieces and shifted in time to obtain a wave phased representation of the sparse velocity field of the detached solid particles they are then interpolated on a regular 3d grid to obtain a phase averaged eulerian description of the coherent structures inside the flow as experienced by the displaced grains to this aim the representation of 2d slices showing the three components of the eulerian velocity field combined with 3d isosurfaces the q criterion contribute to clarify the role of the fundamental coherent structures responsible for the seabed morphodynamics around the cylinder these structures indicate why the sand grains are subject to up welling down welling and rolling at different wave phase angles and are complementary to the lagrangian description of where these phenomena occur the lagrangian and eulerian velocity fields are based on the motion of the sand grains and we can extract information only where detachment transport or sinking are active i e in the lower layers of fluid close to the seabed and to the cylinder s toe among the large number of distinct elementary transport processes we focus on five main mobilization transport mechanisms three during the onshore and two during the offshore flows i generation and distortion of the horseshoe vortex at the toe point and o in fig 8 ii intense scouring at the top of the flatbed region point p in fig 8 iii vortex shedding in the wake during direct onshore flow iv shear crossflow on the lee side of the cylinder and v large vertical shearing in the flatbed region during the reverse offshore flow point p in fig 8 5 2 pressure distribution the combination of free surface elevation and flow dynamics induces a pressure field evolution that is captured by the pressure transducers the wave phase averaged signature of the absolute pressure and of its spatial gradients hydrostatic plus dynamic contributions are illustrated in fig 13 for the former and in figs 14 and 15 for the latter standard deviations not reported are lower than 2 4 10 4 for pressure transducer p3 and lower than 2 0 10 4 for the other sensors here the pressure gradient dp dx where x is a curvilinear coordinate along the surface of the cylinder from the stagnation point was analyzed by dividing the wave cycle into two stages the wave crest stage 0 ωt 130 and the wave trough stage 130 ωt 360 the maximum surface elevation occurred at about ω t 60 since the pressure transducers were located every δ ϕ 45 around the cylinder the distance dx between two neighboring pressure transducers was constant and equal to π d 0 5 p s 8 where p s 0 038 m is the size of the pressure sensor the distances p7 to p8 and p3 to p1 are 53 8 mm the cylinder induces pressure gradients adverse to the fluid motion causing flow separation at the wall the pressure is used to identify the location of this separation the oscillating boundary layer forced by the progressive wave splits vertically in front of the cylinder at the stagnation point and flushes horizontally around the cylinder s surface during the wave crest stage the forcing wave with kc 10 is strong enough to separate the incoming bottom boundary layer flushing this latter around the cylinder under the action of the adverse pressure gradient sumer et al 1997 the pressure measurements in front of the cylinder sensors p7 and p8 confirm that the pressure gradient is adverse positive from ωt 20 hence a horseshoe vortex is expected a discussion on how this coherent structure in interacting with the sand grains is proposed in section 5 4 for phases 40 ωt 70 which correspond to the passage of the wave crest the pressure data around the surface of the cylinder see fig 14 reveal that the adverse pressure gradient is located between the pressure transducers p4 and p3 during this interval the pressure gradient between p5 and p4 is negative boundary layer separation occurs at about ϕ 135 thus the formation of lee wake vortices is favoured and shedding is possibly responsible for the strong scour observed behind the cylinder at ϕ 180 after the passage of the wave crest flow deceleration occurs with the pressure gradients p4 p5 and p5 p6 becoming positive such condition can explain the strong particle mobilization observed in fig 17 b and c when flow deceleration occurs the pressure gradient decreases between p7 and p8 and increases between p8 and p6 at ωt 70 we argue that this is induced by the motion of the horseshoe vortex around the cylinder during the wave trough stage or flow reversal the wave asymmetry induces smaller pressure gradients see fig 15 along the surface of the cylinder the adverse pressure gradient occurs for a very short period 180 ωt 210 between p5 and p6 whereas the pressure gradient between p3 and p4 remains negative the separation point seems to be placed at about 90 the pressure gradient p 3 p 1 is positive for almost the whole phase ωt 300 5 3 bulk phase evolution of sediment transport the phase evolution of the bulk quantity of sediment that is lifted from the bottom and eventually displaced away by the action of the fluid close to the bed is analyzed in order to identify and capture the phenomena that influence the bed morphodynamics fig 16 compares the total number of trajectories with the wave elevation at x 0 and with the horizontal velocity u at point p of coordinates 29 mm 12 mm 79 mm placed at about 6 mm from the bed this point was selected because the most intense dynamics were observed in this area the wave elevation peak corresponds to the minimum number of trajectories while the maximum number is reached at the enzc and persists till about the wave trough the phase variation of the horizontal velocity at p is seen to slightly anticipate that of the free surface the correspondence between the peak of the wave elevation and the minimum number of captured trajectories which is followed by a rapid increase as the wave elevation approached its enzc is not observed during epzc this is expected because of the strong asymmetry of the wave the intense wave elevation gradient and the consequent pressure gradient forcing is concentrated in less than a third of the whole wave period in turn the negative counterpart has a lower amplitude variation and extends on two thirds of the wave period to illustrate this scenario we report in fig 17 four phases each representing five consecutively recorded images of the particle field in region ii arrows are drawn to indicate the sand displacement at ω t 33 and before the wave crest a strong acceleration of the lower fluid layers displaces particles downstream simultaneously scouring the bulk of sediments close to point p of fig 8 the flow action is limited to a narrow layer close to the bottom only during the flow deceleration and near the bed a large quantity of sediments is mobilized fig 17 top right then convected upstream after flow reversal fig 17 bottom left and right during the last stage of the offshore flow the sediment concentration drops to minimum values as the sand deposits without significant contribution from local scouring this scenario confirms that particle mobilization is strongly promoted by the flow deceleration as reported e g in alsina et al 2012 5 4 flow structures and solid transport here we investigate the correlations between the wave phase the generation and persistence of coherent structures and the sand mobilization and displacement the key agents influencing the flow around the slender cylinder are i the cylinder ii the mobile seabed molded by the action of the flow iii the non linear gravity wave which transfers energy to the system and sets the periodicity of the sand fluid coupling the analysis is limited to the equilibrium scour state to reduce the role of the mobile seabed to an almost regular periodic contribution where a phase average operator can be successfully applied to velocity data the wave induced flow velocity see fig 16 oscillates between a negative minimum and a larger positive maximum value consequently and depending on re t the cylinder and the mobile seabed are subjected to a number of asymmetric flow conditions in particular at the beginning of the onshore flow ω t 0 the velocity crosses the zero towards positive values and increases under the action of the progressive wave 5 4 1 the horseshoe vortex for small particle orbital dimension relative to the cylinder s diameter i e for small kc the horseshoe vortex may not appear because the stroke of the fluid motion is too weak to allow the boundary layer to separate for large values of kc the stroke of the fluid motion is so large that the flow for each period replicates that observed in a steady current baykal et al 2017 in flat bed conditions the lower limit of k c 6 is assumed for horseshoe vortex occurrence see sumer et al 1997 but the observed seabed morphological evolution significantly changes the conditions of interaction between the incoming boundary layer and the cylinder the central vertical section of the bathymetry at equilibrium scour condition reported in fig 18 is characterized by a sequence of peaks and throughs culminating in a deep upside down truncated cone around the cylinder notwithstanding an horseshoe vortex is still allowed to develop by this novel bed shape as detected by the pressure transducers its efficiency in scouring the seabed is strongly inhibited because the scour around the cylinder reduces the shear stress at the cylinder s nose the downward flow close to the cylinder can freely expand in the seabed hole below the stagnation point which results in a negative bed shear stress amplification see e g baykal et al 2017 fig 16 b for a comparison with a numerical simulation the deeper scour downstream the obstacle suggests that the same behavior may be occurring downstream the obstacle during the reverse flow activity fig 19 reports the isosurface q 80 red to illustrate the evolution of the horseshoe vortex along with the sediment number density ρn at a value of 1 3 mm 3 a large mobilization of sand grains at the toe of the cylinder is observed see fig 19 plots a and b and occurs after epzc causing a steep scouring around the cylinder close to the reference point at ϕ 90 in fig 8 this process is due to the evolution of the horseshoe vortex generated below the stagnation point on the upstream side of the cylinder which wraps around the obstacle and emerges from the trough at about ϕ 90 point in fig 8 in an almost flat region of the seabed the flat bed amplifies the horseshoe vortex capability to interact with the sand grains and a small coherent structure arises close to the toe of the cylinder at ω t 8 and stretches upward around the obstacle as seen in plots b to c of fig 19 sand particles that are trapped inside the core of the horseshoe vortex are lifted up as shown by the trajectories in fig 20 a and by the strong upward velocity region seen in fig 21 from phase ω t 0 48 yellow and white vectors this region evolves next to the surface of the cylinder progresses downstream and expands along the vertical direction see fig 22 the upward stretching of the horseshoe vortex at ω t 8 see fig 19a is localized close to the bed at ϕ 135 point o in fig 8 and is determined by the steep rise of the bathymetry at larger wave phases the upward stretching is enforced by the rise of the adverse pressure gradient in the wake and at the base of the cylinder in fact a positive pressure difference is seen between locations p3 and p4 at ω t 32 see fig 14 5 4 2 intense scouring at the top of the flatbed region at the same time the flow in the lower fluid layers undergoes an intense acceleration and interacts strongly with the bed around point p of fig 8 the bathymetry profile forces the fluid to move upward see fig 21 for ω t 32 and ωt 48 inducing an ejection of sediments from the top of the sand crest the intense scouring displaces a large amount of sand as shown in fig 17 top left and reorganizes the local flow in a large transversely oriented shear region as seen in fig 19 d ω t 40 the flow bed interaction is intense but impulsive thus the sand displacement is limited yet contributes to restore the previously scoured area 5 4 3 wake vortex shedding during onshore direct flow as the fluid accelerates along the seabed the flow detaches due to the adverse pressure gradient and generates two shear layers in the wake of the cylinder the horizontal flow is laminar around the cylinder and the streamline curvature encloses the whole body the further increase in velocity induces an adverse pressure gradient that determines flow separation and the formation of vertically oriented coherent structures shedding vortices fig 23 gives the isosurface q 80 red and the sediment number density ρn at a value of 1 3 mm 3 blue to illustrate the generation and evolution of the horseshoe vortex after the passage of the wave crest when the horizontal pressure gradient changes sign and flow reversal acceleration starts at ϕ 135 the incipient reverse flow creates a region of upward flow see fig 21 at ω t 48 and fig 24 for ω t 64 and 80 which is also seen to translate upstream this finding is consistent with the pressure gradient p4 p5 which is lower than the p5 p6 difference seen in fig 14 in the upstream section where p5 and p6 are located the flow is mainly downward see fig 24 on the lee side of the cylinder a pair of wake vortices is also generated along the cylinder axis see fig 21 at ω t 48 such a result is in agreement with the pressure data reported in fig 14 the interaction of the wake vortices with the horseshoe structure contributes to its deformation in the upward direction displacing also the sediment fig 23 at ω t 48 the lower layers of fluid are more sensitive to the inversion of the velocity gradient hence a thin tongue of fluid close to the cylinder starts to move offshore while the fluid layers above are still moving onshore following the free surface elevation a similar result is observed when a significant increase of the bottom shear stresses are produced corvaro et al 2014a miozzi et al 2015 the base of the lee wake vortex is captured in this movement and stretches outwards in the crossflow direction see plots b to d in figs 19 and fig 23 from ω t 48 to 72 sand grains are massively displaced from the seabed during this event mainly in the vertical direction with some horizontal spreading see fig 17 at ω t 88 and fig 23 from ω t 104 to 136 however this sediment is not captured by the free stream flow not yet active in that region as seen in fig 24 for ω t 80 5 4 4 shear crossflow on the lee side of the cylinder as the phase increases the flow progressively reverses starting from the downstream section of the cylinder the flow field is seen to rotate clockwise see fig 24 from ω t 96 to 136 during this flow reorientation a crossflow current is created from the interaction between the direct and reverse flows see fig 24 at ω t 104 at ω t 120 no onshore flow is visible creating a region of almost quiescent conditions at ω t 136 the reverse flow is fully established fig 20 from ω t 112 to 132 and fig 23 from ω t 120 to 136 show the particle displacement during this process a large volume of lifted sediment evolves in the region around ϕ 90 and ϕ 270 where flows of opposite direction meet then develop along the extended shear layer in the crossflow direction as a consequence the accumulation region at ϕ 135 is replenished with the sand scoured during the final stage of the onshore flow evolution see fig 8 interestingly this sediment was mobilized during the onset of the lee wake vortices originating mostly from the wake area of the cylinder see the comments made upon fig 24 5 4 5 large vertical shearing in the flatbed region during reverse flow once the reverse flow occupies the whole space a large quantity of sediment moves upstream towards an almost clean quiescent region as observed at ω t 132 in fig 20 and ω t 136 in fig 23 a coherent structure also appears from the residue of the horseshoe vortex created during the direct flow phase see plots g and h of the same figure this structure is re energized at the beginning of offshore flow propagation and sweeps around the cylinder in the upstream direction and towards the seabed see the q isosurface at ω t 136 and ω t 152 in fig 23 being far from the seabed its capacity to mobilize sediment is negligible however it contributes to displace sand grains across long distances around the cylinder thus adding little change to the erosion at the cylinder toe after ω t 152 and onward see fig 20 and fig 23 the coherent structures disaggregate while the sand in the lower flow layers settle on the seabed 6 conclusions we described the motion of sand grains around a slender cylinder fitted into a mobile seabed and forced by a train of progressive non linear waves during wave evolution the sand was mobilized displaced and settled starting from a flat bed a system of ripples with troughs and crests was generated during the initial transient regime before reaching an equilibrium scour state regime in spite of the particle movement at the wave passage the bed morphology remained almost unchanged over each wave period on this basis an in phase average analysis was conducted on the sand grain motion during the equilibrium scour state regime via a particle tracking velocimetry technique and results have been reported in terms of both lagrangian and eulerian viewpoints this analysis relied on the use of the defocusing digital piv technique ddpiv for the first time applied to the specific flow of interest here data from a set of pressure transducers and free surface elevation gauges were integrated with the velocity data we captured the dynamics of sand particles generated by five main phenomena occurring in the region of interest i generation and distortion of the horseshoe vortex around the cylinder under the effect of the direct flow ii intense localized scour at the top of the flatbed region iii onset and distortion of the lee wake vortex pair iv cross flow current generated from flow reversal v large vertical shearing that occurred in the cross flow region at the onset of the flow reversal which was responsible for an intense mobilization of sand particles the wave asymmetry imposed a large acceleration during the growth of wave elevation this implied an intense scouring close to the bed surface peaks that displaced sand grains away from their source location the scour was concentrated in small areas closely connected to the top of the seabed at around 135 downstream close to the regions where the topographic slope decreased to zero on the contrary when the flow decelerated a large number of particles were mobilized and then transported by the external flow this mobilization took place in the flat regions of the bed where the incoming offshore flow generated a shear able to uplift the sand during the onshore flow displaced particles moved towards the region of flat bathymetry during the offshore flow a transversal flow component arose to partially inhibit the upstream particle displacement thus preserving the large accumulation region at 135 from particle depletion the horseshoe vortex was responsible of the narrow and deep scour at the cylinder toe sand grains captured inside its core were carried upward close to the cylinder and displaced away the lee wake vortex pair caused the scouring of the bed downstream of the cylinder and was followed by the mobilization of particles and their displacement upstream by the incoming reverse flow at the bottom prospective work will regard the analysis of the liquid phase mapped using the low stokes number seeding particles we expect to obtain a better insight on the coupling mechanisms between the liquid and the solid phases and therefrom clarify the role of inertia and particle size in the transport of sand grains 
641,the spatial lag effect on sediment transport around a hydraulic structure is quantified through numerical simulation using a eulerian lagrangian model the eulerian lagrangian model uses a deterministic approach of bed load motion and stochastic approach of einstein s concept which allows for a reasonable quantification of both non equilibrium and equilibrium bed load transport rates numerical simulations are conducted for local scour around a spur dyke and a weir type structure as pointed out in previous experimental studies on the one dimensional problem eulerian lagrangian simulation reveals an unsaturated bed load in a scour hole around a hydraulic structure furthermore an oversaturated bed load is also found in the deposition region particularly behind the structure the validity of the linear adaptation equation is discussed using numerical results revealing the possibility that the linear adaptation equation does not appropriately represent the existence of the strong spatial lag effect the present study finds there are two modes in the response of the adaptation length to the unsaturated bed load which depend on the clear water scour condition or the live

using multi phase numerical models to simulate solid liquid two phase flows the eulerian lagrangian approach has emerged as a promising method of simulating solid grain motion in water by coupling the large eddy simulation les or the direct numerical simulation dns with the discrete element method dem e g fukuoka et al 2014 schmeeckle 2014 ji et al 2013 state of the art eulerian lagrangian models allow for the strict resolution of the dynamics of two phase flow which sheds light on more of the underlaid physics of sediment transport from the viewpoint of practical fluvial simulation however the applicability of the state of the art model to an actual river remains limited owing to the computational costs in this context improving a conventional sediment transport model remains highly beneficial in hydraulic engineering a classical issue that makes sediment transport simulation still insufficient is the effect of non equilibrium sediment transport in particular the non equilibrium effect of the bed load is called the spatial lag effect and it affects the bed load transport rate and topological change bell and sutherland 1983 nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 fig 1 shows the bed load being affected by the spatial lag effect under a steady and uniform flow condition a movable bed is connected with a rigid bed set at the upstream end no sediment is supplied from the rigid bed resulting in a spatial gradient of the local bed load transport rate in the movable bed previous theoretical and experimental studies have shown that the bed load transport rate approaches an equilibrium state with the exponential function of the distance x bell and sutherland 1983 nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 the distance required to reach the equilibrium state is known as the adaptation length i e the spatial lag length it is well known that the spatial derivative of the one dimensional 1d bed load flux is computed by the linear adaptation equation 1 q b x x q be x q b x l e where le is the adaptation length and qb x and qbe x are respectively the bed load transport rate and equilibrium bed load transport rate in the x direction on the right hand side of eq 1 q b x le and q be x le respectively represent the deposition rate and pick up rate eq 1 has been widely incorporated into a multi dimensional sediment transport simulation to take into account the effect of the spatial lag of a bed load e g fukuoka et al 1994 wu et al 2000 marsooli and wu 2014 mosselman and le 2016 although eq 1 has been experimentally validated in the case of 1d sediment transport nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 the validity of eq 1 has hardly been investigated in the case of multi dimensional sediment transport mosselman and le 2016 indicated that eq 1 plays a role in making the sediment transport simulation diffusive and warned that le may be used to make simulations stable while claiming that it represents a real physical effect of the retarded adaptation of non equilibrium sediment transport even if the spatial lag effect does not exist their opinion emphasizes the necessity of quantitatively revealing the spatial lag effect in appropriately using eq 1 for multidimensional sediment transport simulations the spatial lag effect becomes more complicated in sediment transport around a hydraulic structure because bed shear stress changes spatially previous experimental studies demonstrated that the spatial lag effect exists in a scour hole bell and sutherland 1983 nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 by conducting experiments for the bed load downstream of a rigid bed various experimental techniques such as the use of a bed load sampler bell and sutherland 1983 a high speed video camera nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 and an ultrasonic technique phillips and sutherland 1989 were used to measure the non equilibrium bed load transport rate in these experiments the non equilibrium and equilibrium bed load transport rate were evaluated to quantify the spatial lag effect however these studies assumed 1d i e longitudinal bed load motion and the measuring techniques of the spatial lag effect were thus limited to 1d morphological change unlike the case for 1d bed load motion it is extremely difficult to experimentally evaluate both the non equilibrium and equilibrium bed load transport rates around a three dimensional 3d hydraulic structure e g bridge foundation or spur dyke during areal topological change an alternative to the experimental approach of quantifying the spatial lag effect is a numerical approach such as a eulerian lagrangian simulation to compute sediment transport around a hydraulic structure nagata et al 2005 introduced a lagrangian framework that tracks groups of bed load particles they used the einstein based stochastic approach to treat sediment pick up and deposition between the bed load and stationary bed zhang et al 2015 extended the eulerian lagrangian model proposed by nagata et al 2005 to bed load transport consisting of nonuniform sediment and successfully simulated sediment transport around a spur dyke we ota et al 2016a extended the eulerian lagrangian model proposed by nagata et al 2005 to the bed material load by incorporating the suspended load into the model and applied the model to local scour around a weir type structure where the contribution of the suspended load could not be neglected our numerical results were shown to be sufficiently accurate through validation of the temporal change in the three dimensional scour shape around a hydraulic structure ota et al 2016a these validation results indicate that the eulerian lagrangian model can reliably track bed load particles around a hydraulic structure nagata et al 2005 zhang et al 2015 ota et al 2016a it is noted that state of the art eulerian lagrangian approaches e g dns dem ji et al 2013 and les dem fukuoka et al 2014 schmeeckle 2014 are able to more strictly solve grain motion however one difficulty faced in quantifying the spatial lag effect is the evaluation of the equilibrium bed load transport rate i e qbe in fig 1 even if the bed load transport rate qb is exactly simulated the eulerian lagrangian framework proposed by nagata et al 2005 can overcome this issue because it incorporates the stochastic approach based on einstein s concept for evaluating qbe this eulerian lagrangian framework makes allows the evaluation of both qb and qbe and thus a reasonable quantification of the spatial lag effect the present study therefore quantifies the spatial lag effect on sediment transport around a hydraulic structure by means of numerical simulation using the eulerian lagrangian model numerical analyses are conducted for local scour around a spur dyke and a weir type structure where bed load sampling is difficult to perform by taking an experimental approach the bed load calculated in the lagrangian frame is converted to the bed load flux to allow a comparison of the non equilibrium and equilibrium bed load transport rates results of a eulerian lagrangian simulation and a conventional sediment transport simulation are compared to evaluate the effect of the spatial lag on morphological change the adaptation length is also inversely computed in a lagrangian simulation to discuss the validity of the linear adaptation equation i e eq 1 using the aforementioned numerical approaches the present paper discusses the spatial lag effect around a hydraulic structure during the scour process under both clear water and live bed scour conditions 2 numerical model 2 1 hydrodynamic model the governing equations are the 3d continuity and reynolds

lagrangian model in the eulerian lagrangian simulation a parcel of bed load particles picked up from the bed is tracked using the lagrangian method with the motion equation for a bed load particle some of the bed load particles transit to the suspension owing to a fluctuating vertical flow velocity and the suspended load conversely returns to the bed load because of gravitational settlement the suspended load transport is solved using the eulerian method with a typical advection diffusion equation the lagrangian and eulerian models are connected through transition between the bed load and suspended load the bed surface deforms because of sediment exchange between the bed load and stationary bed i e the pickup and the deposition the volume of sediment pickup per unit time from a

11 and 12 the velocity and trajectory of a sediment particle can be known at any time after the particle is dislodged from the bed and the motion of the sediment particle does not affect the hydrodynamic model although the lagrangian model tracks a parcel of bed load particles in reality all bed load particles included in a parcel do not always behave in the same manner for example some particles in a parcel continue moving whereas others may be deposited on the bed surface or transit to the suspension owing to fluctuating vertical flow because these phenomena are related to fluid turbulence or irregularity of the bed roughness the stochastic approach is connected to the lagrangian method the sediment volume of deposition vd and transition into suspension vt along the trajectory of bed load transport are computed using the probability density function 18 v d n v b 0 f s n 1 f t n 19 v t n v b 0 1 f s n f t n 20 in which v b 0 v p v slide v sett le where superscript

vp a sediment slide on a steep slope vslide and gravitational settlement of the suspended load near the bed vsettle vslide and vsettle are described later in this section fs n is the probability of a bed load particle depositing on the bed and ft n is the probability of a bed load particle being entrained into the suspension to compute eqs 14 and 15 the deposition probability fs n is written as 21 f s n f s s sed n δ s 22 in which f s s sed n 1 λ exp s sed n λ where fs s sed n is the probability density function of the step length s sed n is the distance the sediment particle moves from the

is the coefficient of the variation of the lift force and λ0 100 is a constant einstein 1950 to evaluate the transition probability ft n used for eqs 14 and 15 a probability density function with a poisson distribution is introduced following nakagawa et al 1990 the transition probability ft n is written as 24 f t n f t t n δ t 25 in which f t t n p t exp p t t n where ft t n is the probability density function of the transition from bed load motion to suspension at the nth step after a sediment pickup while pt is the transition rate representing the reciprocal of the average time until a bed load particle transits into the suspension from the time it is picked up the transition rate pt is calculated from the fluctuating vertical flow velocity nakagawa et al 1990 ota et al 2016a 26 p t d ρ s ρ 1 g 0 0159 w 2 w s 0 4 1 w s w 2 1 1 for w 2 w s where ws is the settling velocity while w 2 is the fluctuating vertical flow velocity in the near bed flow the w 2 is computed using prandtl s mixing length formulation which was modified by van driest 1956 as 27 w 2 κ δ z w z with l m κ δ z 1 exp u 26 ν δ z where lm is the mixing length considering the damping effect near a wall κ 0 41 is the von karman constant and δz is the vertical distance from the bed surface to the center of the first cell near the bed this study uses a standard advection diffusion equation for the eulerian model of the suspended load 28 c s t q s ν t c s with q s u w s g g c s where cs is the sediment concentration qs is the flux of the suspended load νt is the turbulence eddy viscosity and ws is the sediment settling velocity the source and sink terms are added to the advection diffusion equation at the bed boundary by considering transition between the bed load and suspended load the source term represents the transition from the bed load to the suspension and the volume of the transited sediment in a lagrangian frame is transformed to the entrainment flux into an eulerian computational cell adjacent to the bed boundary gravitational settling of the suspended load to the bed is used for the sink term of the advection diffusion equation as 29 q s n n v t n v sett le s b 30 in which v sett le w s c s b s b where c s b is the sediment concentration near the bed the sediment volume settling onto the bed vsettle is added to vb 0 i e the sediment volume when the computation of the bed load trajectory starts at the computational cell where the settling event takes place as expressed in eq 20 using the volumes of sediment pickup and deposition the temporal variation in the bed elevation is expressed as 31 1 λ z b t n v d n v p s b p where zb is the bed elevation and sb p is the area of the bed surface cell projected onto a horizontal plane where the sediment is deposited the summation of vd n represents the total volume of deposited sediment after summing vd n for each time step n after pickup when the local bed slope θb exceeds an angle of repose θbc the sediment sliding is calculated sekine 2004 3 method of quantifying the spatial lag effect the eulerian lagrangian model uses not only a deterministic approach to capture the motion of a bed load particle but also a stochastic approach representing how many bed load particles are picked up and deposited in this framework one can compute the bed load transport rate and its equilibrium rate from the eulerian view which allows for a reasonable quantification of the spatial lag effect in a multidimensional simulation the vector of the bed load transport rate qb is calculated by proportionally distributing bed load particles captured in the lagrangian way to the computational cell on the bed surface as 32 q b j q b j sg d 3 n v bed n u sed j n sg d 3 s f for j 1 2 with 33 v bed n v p m 1 n v d m v t m δ t where vbed n is the substantial volume of the bed load existing at the nth step after a sediment pickup while q b is the bed load transport rate in dimensionless form in addition the equilibrium bed load transport rate qbe is computed according to einstein s concept einstein 1950 as 34 q be j q be j sg d 3 1 λ p s d λ sg d 3 τ b j τ b for j 1 2 where q be is the equilibrium bed load transport rate in dimensionless form the pickup rate ps and average step length λ are respectively computed using eqs 8 and 23 which have bed shear stress τ and its critical value τ c see eq 9 for τ c as variables since the q be consists of variables τ and τ c the expression for q be is essentially the same as the conventional bed load formulae e g ashida and michiue 1972 engelund and fredsøe 1976 the dimensionless bed load flux q b and its equilibrium flux q be do not coincide in the region where the spatial lag effect exists while they should coincide under the uniform and steady bed load condition it is noted that q b includes the sediment slide volume occurring at the steep sloped bed in the eulerian lagrangian simulation the sediment slide volume is thus also added to q be the present paper also quantifies and discusses the adaptation length using the lagrangian computation the linear adaptation equation expressed with an adaptation length le has been widely used to account for the spatial lag effect on bed load transport as shown in eq 1 empirical or semiempirical formulae e g phillips and sutherland 1989 are usually used for le when using eq 1 in sediment transport simulations e g fukuoka et al 1994 wu et al 2000 marsooli and wu 2014 these formulae implicitly assume that le is determined by only the local hydraulic parameter i e τ and τ c and unaffected by the spatial lag effect eq 1 can be generalized by considering that both the bed load transport rate and adaptation length can be affected by the spatial lag effect according to 35 q b q be l e q b l with l e λ where le is the equilibrium adaptation length and l is the adaptation length affected by the spatial lag effect q be le is equivalent to the pickup rate and the le is identical to the average step length λ the adaptation length l is also based on einstein s concept einstein 1950 and q b l is equivalent to the rate of deposition uchida and fukuoka 2014 incorporated eq 35 into a momentum equation of bed load motion using a semiempirical model of le and l however l cannot in principle be explicitly determined by a local hydraulic value unlike le because l is affected by the hysteresis of the bed load trajectory thus to examine the characteristics of l the present study treats l as an unknown variable and inversely calculates l using numerical results of the eulerian lagrangian simulation eq 35 can be rewritten using quantities obtained in the lagrangian simulation as 36 q b 1 λ p s d n v d n s b unlike the case of eq 1 l is not usually equal to le because of the spatial lag effect from eqs 35 and 36 a relation is obtained regarding the rate of deposition 37 q b l n v d n s b the left hand side of eq 37 represents the deposition rate from the eulerian view while the right hand side represents the rate from the lagrangian view following eq 37 the present paper inversely computes l using the results of eulerian lagrangian simulation and then discusses the validity of the linear adaptation equation i e eq 1 for multi dimensional sediment transport simulation when the spatial lag effect exists 4 results to quantify the spatial lag effect in multi dimensional problems the eulerian lagrangian model is applied to two previously conducted experiments of sediment transport around a hydraulic structure case a is local scour upstream of a slit weir under the clear water scour condition i e no sediment moves far upstream of the weir we also conduct a numerical simulation using a conventional sediment transport model considering no spatial lag effect and then compare the numerical result with the experimental result and the eulerian lagrangian simulation case b is local scour around a spur dyke under the live bed scour condition i e sediment moves upstream of the spur dyke unlike case a case b includes deposition regions downstream of the obstacle 4 1 case a slit weir the original experiment was conducted by ota et al 2016a using a flume that is 10 5 m long 0 50 m wide and 0 35 m deep as shown in fig 2 a slit weir made of plexiglas was placed in the flume and a sediment bed with specific density of 1 41 and median diameter of 0 77 mm was positioned upstream of the slit weir the experiment was carried out under the clear water scour condition the flow rate was 4 0 10 3 m3 s in addition the approaching flow depth was 72 7 mm the approaching flow velocity was 0 11 m s and the froude and reynolds numbers were respectively 0 13 and 8 2 103 the bed topography measurement was carried out after closing the slit and scanning with laser displacement sensors the development of the scour hole did not reach a complete equilibrium state because the clear water scour upstream of the slit weir required a long time to achieve such a state ota et al 2016b the same experiment was conducted three times for each experimental condition to check the experimental scatter this section compares the numerical results of the eulerian lagrangian model with those of a conventional sediment transport model the conventional model consists of the bed load and suspended load without using the linear adaptation equation eq 1 a typical exner equation used in the conventional model is 38 1 λ z b t q becm c s b w s e sus where and esus are respectively the rates of reattachment and entrainment for suspended load q becm is the bed load flux given by ashida and michiue 1972 which is widely used for multi dimensional simulations in japan e g uchida and fukuoka 2014 jacobsen 2015 ota et al 2016b kubota et al 2015 and is expressed as 39 q be c m j sg d 3 q τ b j τ b with q 17 τ 1 5 1 τ c τ 1 τ c τ for j 1 2 where critical bed shear stress τ c is given by eq 9 including the effect of the sloped bed thus q becm in eq 39 depends only on the local value of τ and the bed slope which has essentially the same physical meaning as the equilibrium bed load transport q be defined in eq 34 the suspended load transport is solved by the advection diffusion equation shown in eq 28 which has a source term esus and a sink term c s b ws at the bed boundary esus is given by the well known garcia and parker formula garcia and parker 1991 however it is noted that the contribution of esus to morphological change is very small compared with that of the bed load transport rate in the numerical simulations conducted in this study the conventional model includes the sediment sliding procedure used in the euler lagrange model fig 3 shows the computational domain and grid an inlet boundary is set 1 0 m upstream of the slit weir which is a distance equal to approximately 14 times the approaching water depth the outlet boundaries are set downstream of the weir allowing water to flow out of the computational domain after freely overflowing hexahedral cells are used throughout the computational domain refer to ota et al 2016a for further details of the numerical setup the direction of the bed load depends on the bed load velocity vector used in the eulerian lagrangian model and on the bed shear stress vector τ b in the conventional model for both simulation models therefore not only the suspended load but also the bed load is allowed to flow out of the slit depending on the bed load vector located adjacent to the slit fig 4 shows contour maps of the scour depth obtained in the experiment and the two simulations i e simulations using the eulerian lagrangian model and conventional model because a comparison of the experiment and the eulerian lagrangian simulation was presented by ota et al 2016a the present study focuses mainly on the comparison of the two numerical models used the conventional model obviously produces a larger scour hole compared with the hole observed in the experiment and the hole produced with the eulerian lagrangian model in particular the shallowly scoured region seen upstream of the weir in the case of the conventional model is remarkably different from the scour holes obtained in the cases of the euler lagrange model and experiment this difference is due to the spatial lag effect explained later in this section fig 5 a shows the horizontal flow velocity vector near the bed a distance 2d from the bed surface while fig 5 b shows the fluctuating vertical flow velocity w 2 near the bed see eq 27 because water flow near the bed is interrupted by the weir the flow goes to the slit in the vicinity of the slit the water flow at near the bed goes upwards because of the free surface overflow resulting in a strong vertical turbulence in front of the slit as shown in fig 5 b fig 6 compares the scoured volume vs and the scoured depth ds obtained in the experiment for the eulerian lagrangian model and for the conventional sediment transport model the conventional model overpredicts the scoured volume vs while the results of the eulerian lagrangian model are in good agreement with the experimental results regarding the maximum scour depth both numerical simulations are in good agreement with the experiments in addition fig 7 compares results of the scoured length and width defined in fig 7 a and nondimensionalized by the length dimension of the scoured volume vs 1 3 the two simulations and experiment agree well in terms of the dimensionless scour width ys vs 1 3 however the conventional model produces an obviously larger dimensionless scour length xs vs 1 3 than the experiment and eulerian lagrangian model which means that the scour shape of the conventional model is flatter than that in the experiment in the longitudinal direction note that in the case of the conventional model the rate of sediment entrainment into suspension esus is less than o 10 6 m s which is equivalent to the contribution of o 0 1 mm after 100 s because the suspension has a minor effect on the scour depth the shallowly scoured region of the conventional model is a result of the spatial lag effect as discussed later in this section this numerical result implies that the conventional model can overpredict the scoured area in the case of the clear water scour condition note that even the eulerian lagrangian model does not well reproduce the deeply scoured region at the corner where the slit and side wall meet it is well known that a tornado like vortex appears at the corner of the upstream face of a weir ota et al 2016b kubota et al 2015 garcia and parker 1991 baud and hager 2000 the vortex tube of the tornado like vortex is stretched by the upward flow owing to free surface overflow when the vortex is stretched the diameter of the vortex decreases and the vorticity increases as described by the theory of helmholtz this process results in the pickup of many bed particles at the corner and the conveyance of the picked up particles upwards ota et al 2016b because the tornado like vortex is of small scale high frequency and anisotropic turbulence the hydrodynamic model i e rans model does not sufficiently resolve the tornado like vortex nevertheless the eulerian lagrangian model quantitatively reproduces the temporal variation in the representative length parameters of the scour hole as shown in figs 7 and 8 which ensures that the result of the eulerian lagrangian model can be used to quantify the spatial lag effect to quantify the spatial lag effect the bed load simulated in a lagrangian frame is converted to the bed load flux as described in section 3 fig 8 shows a the magnitude of the dimensionless equilibrium bed load transport rate q be b the magnitude of the dimensionless bed load transport rate q b and c the ratio q b q b e obtained in the eulerian lagrangian simulation after 160 s no bed load is produced in the hatched parts because of the clear water scour condition i e q b q be 0 roughly speaking both q be and q b tend to increase as the slit is approached however the quantities of q be and q b are completely different as shown in fig 8 c the warm colors represent q b q be 1 while the cool colors represent q b q be 1 q b q be is o 0 1 100 to 200 mm upstream of the weir at which point the bed is hardly scoured in the eulerian lagrangian simulation see fig 4 b when q b q be 1 the bed load is unsaturated this was also found in previous experiments bell and sutherland 1983 nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 conducted for 1d bed load transport downstream of a rigid bed see fig 1 however the mechanism of the unsaturated bed load in fig 8 is different from that of the experiments downstream of the rigid bed bell and sutherland 1983 phillips and sutherland 1989 the positive gradient of the bed load transport rate downstream of the rigid bed is due to a deficit of sediment supply while the bed shear stress is spatially uniform unless the bed is deeply scoured nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 however the unsaturated q b in fig 8 is due to the spatial gradient of the bed shear stress and a lack of sediment pickup far upstream of the weir it is interesting to note that q b q be exceeds 1 and attains a value more than o 1 in the vicinity of the slit which indicates an oversaturated bed load fig 8 c the existence of an oversaturated q b was not considered in previous experiments for the downstream of the 1d rigid bed bell and sutherland 1983 nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 because the previous experiments neglected lateral bed load motion because q b consists of a bed load flux vector parallel to the local bed q b can be larger than q be owing to the superposition of the longitudinal and lateral directional components of the bed load flux this phenomenon occurs in the vicinity of the slit because the bed load upstream of the weir approaches the slit at various angles as shown by the flow velocity vector near the bed in fig 5 the movement of the bed load toward the slit accelerates and combines near the slit because of contracted flow at the slit resulting in an oversaturated q b bed load particles are likely to transit into suspension because of strong upward flow as the bed load particles approach the corner where the slit and side wall meet ota et al 2016a although q b increases because of the superposition effect of two directional components the suspension process reduces q b and mitigates the oversaturation of the bed load in this study the conventional model ignores the spatial lag effect which essentially means that the so called saturated bed load is conveyed the conventional model results in more active bed load motion in the unsaturated bed load region than the eulerian lagrangian model the shallowly scoured region in the conventional model see fig 4 is therefore caused by the spatial lag effect resulting in a deviation from the experimental results because q b is comparable to q be located adjacent to the weir in the lateral direction as shown in fig 7 c there is a far weaker spatial lag effect compared with that in the longitudinal direction this tendency is consistent with the numerical result of fig 6 with there being good agreement of the dimensionless scour width ys vs 1 3 among the experiment eulerian lagrangian model and conventional model fig 9 compares the equilibrium adaptation length le and the adaptation length l obtained in the eulerian lagrangian simulation after 160 s in fig 9 c warm colors represent l le 1 while cool colors represent l le 1 although le and l have similar distributions le tends to be larger than l in regions 1 adjacent to the weir and 2 at the edge of the contour map i e the boundary at which the bed load begins to move as shown in fig 9 c fig 10 shows the relationship between l le and q b q be obtained in the eulerian lagrangian simulation after 160 and 1280 s as is obvious from eq 35 erosion occurs in a region where l le q b q be and deposition occurs in a region where l le q b q be the majority of plots are associated with erosion because sediment is transported downstream of the slit and the scour hole develops under the clear water scour condition l le is o 1 for q b q be 0 1 which represents little spatial lag effect on the adaptation length l and thus ensures the validity of the linear adaptation equation eq 1 it is interesting to note that l le increases for q b q be 0 1 representing a strong spatial lag effect this result implies that the adaptation length is also affected by the spatial lag effect and that eq 1 is not appropriate in this situation although the causes of increasing l le with q b q be 0 are discussed in detail in section 5 this tendency is closely related to a small q b and flow acceleration which occurs at the boundary where the bed load begins to move under the clear water scour condition 4 2 case b spur dyke numerical simulation is subsequently applied to the bed deformation around a spur dyke in the experiment conducted by michiue and hinokidani 1992 previous studies have already performed numerical simulations of this experiment using a eulerian lagrangian model in which the suspended load was neglected nagata et al 2005 onda et al 2007 the present study examines the spatial lag effect through the numerical results of the eulerian lagrangian model as shown in fig 11 the spur dyke was a vertical plate 0 1 m long and 0 01 m wide placed at a 90 angle to the left bank of the straight channel and protruding from the water surface uniform sand with a median particle diameter of 0 6 mm was used in the experiment the experiment was conducted under live bed scour conditions and the scour hole thus reached a dynamic equilibrium state in 15 min the scour geometry was measured in the equilibrium stage because the sediment deposits in the downstream region of the spur dyke not only the scour process but also the deposition process is important in this numerical simulation the deposition process depends on the average step length λin this numerical model however it is well known that the relationship between λ and dimensionless bed shear stress τ has uncertainty sekine and kikkawa 1992 because λcan affect the deposition process downstream of the spur dyke it is meaningful to examine the effect of λbefore quantifying the spatial lag effect in this section thus as preliminary work a series of numerical simulations is conducted using different parameters of λ0 and η0 which are included in einstein s step length formula expressed by eq 23 existing studies nagata et al 2005 zhang et al 2015 ota et al 2016a onda et al 2007 generally used λ0 100 and η0 0 5 following einstein s recommendation einstein 1950 based on the experimental findings of einstein and el samni 1949 a simulation result obtained using λ0 100 and η0 0 5 is shown in fig 12 as a comparison with the experiment regarding bed shapes in the equilibrium stage overall the scour pattern and maximum scour depth approximately 9 cm are well reproduced unfortunately the simulation slightly underestimates the most deeply scoured area at the corner where the sidewall and upstream face of the spur dyke meet the cause and effect of this underestimation are described in detail later in this section to check the effect of λ additional simulations are conducted using λ0 η0 70 0 5 200 0 5 100 0 3 and 100 0 7 fig 13 a shows the relationship between λ and τ expressed by eq 23 for each combination of λ0 η0 obviously λ decreases with η0 that is the standard deviation of the fluctuation of the dimensionless lift force bed load particles are likely to deposit on the bed when the lift force is weaker than the gravitational force thus larger η0 under constant τ and η0 extends duration of time varying lift force being less than the gravitational force which facilitates more deposition on the bed and a decrease in λ the results of numerical simulations are compared for the maximum scour depth and horizontal length parameters xsu xsd and ys that are defined in fig 12 and represent the maximum horizontal distance from the spur dyke to the edge a 2 cm scour depth of the scour hole in upstream downstream and lateral directions respectively as shown in fig 13 b xsd tends to increase with λ0 and decrease with η0 which essentially means xsd increases with λ this is because the picked up sediment deposits downstream of the spur dyke after traveling as a bed load although no systematic difference is found among the numerical results of xsu ys and ds a simulation run using λ0 η0 100 0 5 is best in terms of reproducing these three parameters note that the combination of λ0 η0 does not affect the conclusion of the spatial lag effect because the effect of λ is included in le and q be as discussed in section 5 from these considerations the numerical condition λ0 η0 100 0 5 recommended by einstein 1950 is adopted in the following analysis and discussion fig 14 shows the 3d stream line generated 1 cm above the bed and dimensionless bed shear stress τ on the bed in the early and equilibrium stages of the scour in the early stage the horseshoe vortex stably exists and results in high τ on the bed additionally there is an obvious difference in the water elevation between the upstream and downstream of the spur dyke bringing high τ to the bed downstream of the spur dyke in the equilibrium stage the complicated flow field forms around a spur dyke and water flow goes upwards along the upslope of the scour hole with various flow directions these flow properties are consistent previous observations of 3d flow around a spur dyke zhang et al 2015 koken and constantinescu 2008a b however koken and constantinescu 2008a b 2011 showed the existence of multiple corner vortices immediately upstream of the spur dyke in particular a smaller but relatively intense corner vortex see fig 3 in koken and constantinescu 2011 is present at the junction of the upstream face of the spur dyke and the bottom wall which contributes to scour in the vicinity of the spur dyke such a small and anisotropic turbulence locally appearing at the corner is not fully resolved by the rans based model used in this study unfortunately this deficiency results in underestimation of the scour depth at the corner where the sidewall and upstream face of the spur dyke meet see fig 12 the underestimation at the corner is similar to that seen in the previous section i e the slit weir case however it should be emphasized again that our numerical simulation can quantitatively reproduce the representative scour length parameters as shown in fig 13 which ensures that the eulerian lagrangian model can be used to quantify the spatial lag effect manes and brocchini 2015 showed that the energy cascade based on kolmogorov s theory explains the relationship between turbulence and scour development they indicated that the size of the horseshoe vortex can be used as the length scale of the large scale eddy linked to the maximum scour depth the rans based model used in this study resolves such a representative large scale eddy see fig 14 and can calculate the energy cascade according to the k ω sst model which also supports the validity of the numerical model fig 15 shows contour maps of a the near bed velocity field with the bed elevation described using warm colors for deposited regions and cool colors for scoured regions b the magnitude of the equilibrium bed load transport rate q be c the dimensionless bed load transport rate q b d the ratio q b q be described using warm colors for q b q be 1 and cool colors for q b q be 1 e the equilibrium adaptation length le and f the adaptation length l in the early and equilibrium stages of scour development throughout all scour stages q b is nearly equal to q be in the region far upstream of the spur dyke where water flow is not disturbed by the existence of the spur dyke resulting in no spatial lag effect fig 15 c interestingly this tendency is completely different for the unsaturated q b seen in the previous section case a which is attributed to the difference between the clear water scour condition of case a and the live bed scour condition of case b as shown in fig 15 c q b q be is larger than 1 at 0 2 m upstream of the spur dyke in the early stage this phenomenon is due to the deceleration of the bed load motion in the longitudinal direction because of the existence of the spur dyke which is visualized by the near bed flow velocity vector in fig 15 a throughout all scour stages q b q be obviously deviates from 1 around the spur dyke and in the downstream region which points to the existence of the spatial lag effect in the early stage q b is much smaller than q be at the nose of the spur dyke where the bed is most likely to be scoured the bed load around the nose is strongly accelerated by the horseshoe vortex in the early scour stage see fig 14 a which produces unsaturated q b at the location koken and constantinescu 2008a experimentally and numerically showed that under the flat bed condition the wake and horseshoe vortex bring sediment to behind the spur dyke this observation is similar to the simulation results of q b obtained in this work as shown in the early stage of fig 15 c d high values of q b are distributed along the horseshoe vortex see fig 14 a and the bed load is thus mainly transported to behind the spur dyke allowing oversaturation koken and constantinescu 2008b showed that for the scoured bed the upward flow appearing at the legs of a necklace vertical structure removes the bed load out of the scour hole and conveys it to behind the spur dyke and the main channel in the equilibrium stage of the present study q b picked up from the scour hole is transported to both immediately behind the spur dyke and the main channel owing to the upward flow at the upslope of the scour hole see figs 14 b and 15 c d in contrast to the clear water scour condition used in koken and constantinescu 2008b the present study conducts simulations under the live bed scour condition the sediment thus moves more actively than in koken and constantinescu 2008b even in the equilibrium stage the adaptation length l is equal to the equilibrium adaptation length le in the upstream region of the spur dyke the patterns of l are obviously different from those of le around the spur dyke and its downstream region l is less than le around the nose of the spur dyke where the high bed shear stress is distributed especially in the early scour stage conversely l is larger than le behind the spur dyke fig 16 shows the relationship between q b q be and l le in a the early stage b the intermediate stage and c the equilibrium stage of the scour development l le obviously decreases with q b q be for q b q be o 0 1 surprisingly this tendency is contrary to that in case a see fig 10 although the relationship between q b q be and l le is summarized including case a in the following section this tendency is related to the live bed scour condition and high bed shear stress l le tends to increase with q b q be in the region of the oversaturated bed load although l le is scattered especially in the early stage of the scour even if q b q be has a constant value in the deposition region l le is affected by the average distance that bed load particles move to reach the deposition location in other words l le in the deposition region has the spatial hysteresis effect and is depicted on the right hand side of eq 37 unlike the sediment transport in front of the slit weir in case a the sediment deposition mainly occurs after deceleration downstream of the spur dyke the deposition process downstream of a hydraulic structure therefore results in a wide range of l le for l le o 1 in the oversaturated bed load as shown in fig 16 the equilibrium stage has plots with less scattering compared with the early stage for both l le and q b q be this result indicates that the spatial lag effect is mitigated as the equilibrium scour stage is approached because the spatial distribution of the bed shear stress becomes more uniform in the equilibrium stage see fig 14 onda et al 2007 compared numerical results of the eulerian lagrangian model and a conventional sediment transport model by incorporating the equilibrium bed load transport rate eq 34 into their conventional model they reported that the maximum scour depth computed using the conventional model developed much more quickly than that computed using the eulerian lagrangian model while the maximum scour depths achieved in the equilibrium scour stage are similar for the two models they also reported that the scour volume calculated from the conventional model is larger than that calculated from eulerian lagrangian model their findings are consistent with the spatial lag effect shown in fig 15 in that the scour depth and scoured volume rapidly increase in the unsaturated region 5 discussion because the unsaturated bed load is closely related to the scour process this section comprehensively discusses the response of l le to the unsaturated q b q be obtained in cases a and b i e figs 10 and 16 for both cases l le varies dramatically with q b q be in the region q b q be o 0 1 in case a l le increases with q b q be 0 at the boundary where the bed load begins to move or at locations adjacent to the weir inversely in case b l le decreases with q b q be 0 in the scour hole especially in the early scour stage these contradictory tendencies can be explained by the fact that the unsaturated bed load is due to the acceleration of the bed load motion however the response of l le to q b q be 0 depends on the balance of the sediment supply i e q b and the bed shear stress as shown in fig 17 that is to say l le has two modes of response when q b q be approaches zero the first mode is the case that q b l 0 presented as mode a in fig 17 and occurring in case a i e clear water scour as described in eq 37 this mode represents that no deposition of the bed load is likely to occur at the boundary where sediment begins to move and the bed load is accelerated that is to say this mode responds to the clear water scour condition that the bed load transport rate approaches zero as the distance to a hydraulic structure increases the second mode is the case that q be presented as mode b in fig 17 and occurring in case b i e live bed scour q be is a mathematical function that monotonically increases with the bed shear stress and le as described in section 3 there thus exists a response l le 0 when q b q be 0 i e mode b note that l le does not monotonically decrease with q b q be q b q be in the case that q b decreases with the bed shear stress which occurs at the edge of a scour hole under the clear water scour condition as shown in fig 9 c and fig 10 mode b is therefore likely to occur at the scour hole under the live bed scour condition mode b is likely to occur at the scour hole of the live bed scour condition previous experiments bell and sutherland 1983 nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 on the 1d bed load downstream of the rigid bed did not report the response of l le however nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 reported that their experimental finding and the linear adaptation equation were valid for weak non equilibrium bed load transport because the spatial variation of the bed shear stress was weak in their experiments therefore previous experiments did not evaluate a strong unsaturated bed load region q b q be o 0 1 which is the scope of discussion in this section although l le deviates from o 1 in the range q b q be o 0 1 this study ensures l l e o 1 in the range o 0 1 q b q be 1 that occurs in the erosion region for this range the linear adaptation equation eq 1 is able to represent the spatial lag effect because l le which is consistent with conclusions obtained previously from experiments conducted for a 1d unsaturated bed load in o 0 1 q b x q be x 1 bell and sutherland 1983 nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 although previous experiments bell and sutherland 1983 nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 did not deal with an oversaturated bed load considering directional bed load motion our numerical results indicate that the linear adaptation equation does not appropriately capture the adaptation length of an oversaturated bed load downstream of an obstacle because of the spatial hysteresis effect of the deposition these results indicate the possibility that the linear adaptation equation is not suitable for a bed load transport being affected by a strong spatial lag effect in q b q be o 0 1 and q b q be o 1 an alternative to the linear adaptation equation is eq 35 that has been incorporated into the momentum equation of bed load motion by uchida and fukuoka 2014 to simulate sediment transport in a compound meandering channel however their model considered only the situation of l le and q b q be representing the deposition process for an oversaturated bed load unfortunately their method of computing l does not consider modes a and b appearing in the unsaturated bed load shown in fig 17 results of the present work imply the importance of considering modes a and b in accurately simulating the time variation of a local scour when using the adaptation length several works have investigated the spatial lag effect for 1d problems through numerical simulation cao et al 2016 quantified the spatial lag effect of a nonuniform bed load by conducting 1d simulations of movable bed experiments they observed an unsaturated bed load in a degradation process and oversaturated bed load in an aggradation process these previous findings are consistent with the results of the present study as shown in figs 10 and 16 which represent the spatial lag depending on erosion and deposition in the dimensional simulation although the strong spatial lag depicted in fig 17 was not mentioned previous studies on 1d problems indicate that the adaptation length for suspended sediment increases with the suspension index or rouse number li et al 2014 cao et al 2016 such a finding will be useful when the equilibrium suspended load transport model is applied to 1d simulation the suspended load transport in the present 3d simulation is solved using the advection diffusion equation including the entrainment and settling term at the bed boundary see eq 28 the effect of the suspended load on the spatial lag of the bed load is considered by the process of sediment transition between the bed load and suspended load one such example is represented by case a i e the slit weir case where the oversaturation of the bed load in the vicinity of the corner is mitigated by sediment transition from the bed load to suspended load 6 conclusions this study quantified the spatial lag effect of bed load transport by means of numerical simulation using the eulerian lagrangian model numerical analyses were conducted for the local scour around a spur dyke and weir type structure where evaluating the equilibrium and non equilibrium bed load transport rates is difficult when taking an experimental approach the bed load simulated in a lagrangian frame was converted to a bed load flux because the eulerian lagrangian model couples the deterministic approach of bed load motion with the stochastic approach of einstein s concept the numerical model allows for reasonable quantification of the equilibrium and non equilibrium bed load transport rates we also compared the numerical results of the eulerian lagrangian model with those of the conventional sediment transport model considering no spatial lag to the best of our knowledge this is first work that quantifies the spatial lag effect on multi dimensional sediment transport using a numerical approach the eulerian lagrangian simulation mainly showed an unsaturated bed load transport rate upstream of a slit weir under the clear water scour condition this spatial lag effect was found to be the cause of an overestimation of the scour hole simulated by the conventional model the spatial lag effect was also examined for the local scour around a spur dyke under the live bed scour condition after the effect of the average step length function was checked in the early scour stage an unsaturated bed load appeared around the nose of the spur dyke and an oversaturated bed load appeared behind the spur dyke the spatial lag effect of the live bed scour was mitigated under the dynamic equilibrium condition the present study examined whether the relationship between the bed load transport rate q b and its equilibrium rate q be can be accurately represented by the linear adaptation equation the adaptation length l obviously deviated from the equilibrium value le for q b q be o 0 1 because of the acceleration of the bed load particles there are two modes of response of l le when q b q be approaches zero and the modes depend on the balance of the deposition rate and the bed shear stress under the clear water scour condition l le increases with q b q be 0 in the region where the bed load begins to move under the live bed scour condition l le decreases with q b q be 0 in the scour hole the response of l le to q b q be in the deposition region downstream of the hydraulic structure was scattered because of the spatial hysteresis effect of the deposition although l le increased with q b q be qualitatively numerical results indicate that the linear adaptation equation is valid in the range o 0 1 q b q be 1 which is consistent with the results of previous experiments conducted within this range for 1d bed load transport downstream of a rigid bed however the numerical results suggest the possibility that the linear adaptation equation does not appropriately represent the strong spatial lag effect in q b q be o 0 1 and q b q be o 1 owing to the strong spatial gradient of the bed shear stress and the superimposition of the bed load respectively 
641,the spatial lag effect on sediment transport around a hydraulic structure is quantified through numerical simulation using a eulerian lagrangian model the eulerian lagrangian model uses a deterministic approach of bed load motion and stochastic approach of einstein s concept which allows for a reasonable quantification of both non equilibrium and equilibrium bed load transport rates numerical simulations are conducted for local scour around a spur dyke and a weir type structure as pointed out in previous experimental studies on the one dimensional problem eulerian lagrangian simulation reveals an unsaturated bed load in a scour hole around a hydraulic structure furthermore an oversaturated bed load is also found in the deposition region particularly behind the structure the validity of the linear adaptation equation is discussed using numerical results revealing the possibility that the linear adaptation equation does not appropriately represent the existence of the strong spatial lag effect the present study finds there are two modes in the response of the adaptation length to the unsaturated bed load which depend on the clear water scour condition or the live

using multi phase numerical models to simulate solid liquid two phase flows the eulerian lagrangian approach has emerged as a promising method of simulating solid grain motion in water by coupling the large eddy simulation les or the direct numerical simulation dns with the discrete element method dem e g fukuoka et al 2014 schmeeckle 2014 ji et al 2013 state of the art eulerian lagrangian models allow for the strict resolution of the dynamics of two phase flow which sheds light on more of the underlaid physics of sediment transport from the viewpoint of practical fluvial simulation however the applicability of the state of the art model to an actual river remains limited owing to the computational costs in this context improving a conventional sediment transport model remains highly beneficial in hydraulic engineering a classical issue that makes sediment transport simulation still insufficient is the effect of non equilibrium sediment transport in particular the non equilibrium effect of the bed load is called the spatial lag effect and it affects the bed load transport rate and topological change bell and sutherland 1983 nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 fig 1 shows the bed load being affected by the spatial lag effect under a steady and uniform flow condition a movable bed is connected with a rigid bed set at the upstream end no sediment is supplied from the rigid bed resulting in a spatial gradient of the local bed load transport rate in the movable bed previous theoretical and experimental studies have shown that the bed load transport rate approaches an equilibrium state with the exponential function of the distance x bell and sutherland 1983 nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 the distance required to reach the equilibrium state is known as the adaptation length i e the spatial lag length it is well known that the spatial derivative of the one dimensional 1d bed load flux is computed by the linear adaptation equation 1 q b x x q be x q b x l e where le is the adaptation length and qb x and qbe x are respectively the bed load transport rate and equilibrium bed load transport rate in the x direction on the right hand side of eq 1 q b x le and q be x le respectively represent the deposition rate and pick up rate eq 1 has been widely incorporated into a multi dimensional sediment transport simulation to take into account the effect of the spatial lag of a bed load e g fukuoka et al 1994 wu et al 2000 marsooli and wu 2014 mosselman and le 2016 although eq 1 has been experimentally validated in the case of 1d sediment transport nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 the validity of eq 1 has hardly been investigated in the case of multi dimensional sediment transport mosselman and le 2016 indicated that eq 1 plays a role in making the sediment transport simulation diffusive and warned that le may be used to make simulations stable while claiming that it represents a real physical effect of the retarded adaptation of non equilibrium sediment transport even if the spatial lag effect does not exist their opinion emphasizes the necessity of quantitatively revealing the spatial lag effect in appropriately using eq 1 for multidimensional sediment transport simulations the spatial lag effect becomes more complicated in sediment transport around a hydraulic structure because bed shear stress changes spatially previous experimental studies demonstrated that the spatial lag effect exists in a scour hole bell and sutherland 1983 nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 by conducting experiments for the bed load downstream of a rigid bed various experimental techniques such as the use of a bed load sampler bell and sutherland 1983 a high speed video camera nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 and an ultrasonic technique phillips and sutherland 1989 were used to measure the non equilibrium bed load transport rate in these experiments the non equilibrium and equilibrium bed load transport rate were evaluated to quantify the spatial lag effect however these studies assumed 1d i e longitudinal bed load motion and the measuring techniques of the spatial lag effect were thus limited to 1d morphological change unlike the case for 1d bed load motion it is extremely difficult to experimentally evaluate both the non equilibrium and equilibrium bed load transport rates around a three dimensional 3d hydraulic structure e g bridge foundation or spur dyke during areal topological change an alternative to the experimental approach of quantifying the spatial lag effect is a numerical approach such as a eulerian lagrangian simulation to compute sediment transport around a hydraulic structure nagata et al 2005 introduced a lagrangian framework that tracks groups of bed load particles they used the einstein based stochastic approach to treat sediment pick up and deposition between the bed load and stationary bed zhang et al 2015 extended the eulerian lagrangian model proposed by nagata et al 2005 to bed load transport consisting of nonuniform sediment and successfully simulated sediment transport around a spur dyke we ota et al 2016a extended the eulerian lagrangian model proposed by nagata et al 2005 to the bed material load by incorporating the suspended load into the model and applied the model to local scour around a weir type structure where the contribution of the suspended load could not be neglected our numerical results were shown to be sufficiently accurate through validation of the temporal change in the three dimensional scour shape around a hydraulic structure ota et al 2016a these validation results indicate that the eulerian lagrangian model can reliably track bed load particles around a hydraulic structure nagata et al 2005 zhang et al 2015 ota et al 2016a it is noted that state of the art eulerian lagrangian approaches e g dns dem ji et al 2013 and les dem fukuoka et al 2014 schmeeckle 2014 are able to more strictly solve grain motion however one difficulty faced in quantifying the spatial lag effect is the evaluation of the equilibrium bed load transport rate i e qbe in fig 1 even if the bed load transport rate qb is exactly simulated the eulerian lagrangian framework proposed by nagata et al 2005 can overcome this issue because it incorporates the stochastic approach based on einstein s concept for evaluating qbe this eulerian lagrangian framework makes allows the evaluation of both qb and qbe and thus a reasonable quantification of the spatial lag effect the present study therefore quantifies the spatial lag effect on sediment transport around a hydraulic structure by means of numerical simulation using the eulerian lagrangian model numerical analyses are conducted for local scour around a spur dyke and a weir type structure where bed load sampling is difficult to perform by taking an experimental approach the bed load calculated in the lagrangian frame is converted to the bed load flux to allow a comparison of the non equilibrium and equilibrium bed load transport rates results of a eulerian lagrangian simulation and a conventional sediment transport simulation are compared to evaluate the effect of the spatial lag on morphological change the adaptation length is also inversely computed in a lagrangian simulation to discuss the validity of the linear adaptation equation i e eq 1 using the aforementioned numerical approaches the present paper discusses the spatial lag effect around a hydraulic structure during the scour process under both clear water and live bed scour conditions 2 numerical model 2 1 hydrodynamic model the governing equations are the 3d continuity and reynolds

lagrangian model in the eulerian lagrangian simulation a parcel of bed load particles picked up from the bed is tracked using the lagrangian method with the motion equation for a bed load particle some of the bed load particles transit to the suspension owing to a fluctuating vertical flow velocity and the suspended load conversely returns to the bed load because of gravitational settlement the suspended load transport is solved using the eulerian method with a typical advection diffusion equation the lagrangian and eulerian models are connected through transition between the bed load and

11 and 12 the velocity and trajectory of a sediment particle can be known at any time after the particle is dislodged from the bed and the motion of the sediment particle does not affect the hydrodynamic model although the lagrangian model tracks a parcel of bed load particles in reality all bed load particles included in a parcel do not always behave in the same manner for example some particles in a parcel continue moving whereas others may be deposited on the bed surface or transit to the suspension owing to fluctuating vertical flow because these phenomena are related to fluid turbulence or irregularity of the bed roughness the stochastic approach is connected to the lagrangian method the sediment volume of deposition vd and transition into suspension vt along the

pickup point which is computed from eq 12 and λ is the average step length estimated using a formula given by einstein 1942 23 λ λ 0 d 0 156 τ 1 η 0 0 156 τ 1 η 0 1 2 π exp r 2 2 dr where η 0 η 0 0 5 is the coefficient of the variation of the lift force and λ0 100 is a constant einstein 1950 to evaluate the transition probability ft n used for eqs 14 and 15 a probability density function with a poisson distribution is introduced following nakagawa et al 1990 the transition probability ft n is written as 24 f t n f t t n δ t 25 in which f t t n p t exp p t t n where ft t n is the probability density function of the transition from bed load motion to suspension at the nth step after a sediment pickup while pt is the transition rate representing the reciprocal of the average time until a bed load particle transits into the suspension from the time it is picked up the transition rate pt is calculated from the fluctuating vertical flow velocity nakagawa et al 1990 ota et al 2016a 26 p t d ρ s ρ 1 g 0 0159 w 2 w s 0 4 1 w s w 2 1 1 for w 2 w s where ws is the settling velocity while w 2 is the fluctuating vertical flow velocity in the near bed flow the w 2 is computed using prandtl s mixing length formulation which was modified by van driest 1956 as 27 w 2 κ δ z w z with l m κ δ z 1 exp u 26 ν δ z where lm is the mixing length considering the damping effect near a wall κ 0 41 is the von karman constant and δz is the vertical distance from the bed surface to the center of the first cell near the bed this study uses a standard advection diffusion equation for the eulerian model of the suspended load 28 c s t q s ν t c s with q s u w s g g c s where cs is the sediment concentration qs is the flux of the suspended load νt is the turbulence eddy viscosity and ws is the sediment settling velocity the source and sink terms are added to the advection diffusion equation at the bed boundary by considering transition between the bed load and suspended load the source term represents the transition from the bed load to the suspension and the volume of the transited sediment in a lagrangian frame is transformed to the entrainment flux into an eulerian computational cell adjacent to the bed boundary gravitational settling of the suspended load to the bed is used for the sink term of the advection diffusion equation as 29 q s n n v t n v sett le s b 30 in which v sett le w s c s b s b where c s b is the sediment concentration near the bed the sediment volume settling onto the bed vsettle is added to vb 0 i e the sediment volume when the computation of the bed load trajectory starts at the computational cell where the settling event takes place as expressed in eq 20 using the volumes of sediment pickup and deposition the temporal variation in the bed elevation is expressed as 31 1 λ z b t n v d n v p s b p where zb is the bed elevation and sb p is the area of the bed surface cell projected onto a horizontal plane where the sediment is deposited the summation of vd n represents the total volume of deposited sediment after summing vd n for each time step n after pickup when the local bed slope θb exceeds an angle of repose θbc the sediment sliding is calculated sekine 2004 3 method of quantifying the spatial lag effect the eulerian lagrangian model uses not only a deterministic approach to capture the motion of a bed load particle but also a stochastic approach representing how many bed load particles are picked up and deposited in this framework one can compute the bed load transport rate and its equilibrium rate from the eulerian view which allows for a reasonable quantification of the spatial lag effect in a multidimensional simulation the vector of the bed load transport rate qb is calculated by proportionally distributing bed load particles captured in the lagrangian way to the computational cell on the bed surface as 32 q b j q b j sg d 3 n v bed n u sed j n sg d 3 s f for j 1 2 with 33 v bed n v p m 1 n v d m v t m δ t where vbed n is the substantial volume of the bed load existing at the nth step after a sediment pickup while q b is the bed load transport rate in dimensionless form in addition the equilibrium bed load transport rate qbe is computed according to einstein s concept einstein 1950 as 34 q be j q be j sg d 3 1 λ p s d λ sg d 3 τ b j τ b for j 1 2 where q be is the equilibrium bed load transport rate in dimensionless form the pickup rate ps and average step length λ are respectively computed using eqs 8 and 23 which have bed shear stress τ and its critical value τ c see eq 9 for τ c as variables since the q be consists of variables τ and τ c the expression for q be is essentially the same as the conventional bed load formulae e g ashida and michiue 1972 engelund and fredsøe 1976 the dimensionless bed load flux q b and its equilibrium flux q be do not coincide in the region where the spatial lag effect exists while they should coincide under the uniform and steady bed load condition it is noted that q b includes the sediment slide volume occurring at the steep sloped bed in the eulerian lagrangian simulation the sediment slide volume is thus also added to q be the present paper also quantifies and discusses the adaptation length using the lagrangian computation the linear adaptation equation expressed with an adaptation length le has been widely used to account for the spatial lag effect on bed load transport as shown in eq 1 empirical or semiempirical formulae e g phillips and sutherland 1989 are usually used for le when using eq 1 in sediment transport simulations e g fukuoka et al 1994 wu et al 2000 marsooli and wu 2014 these formulae implicitly assume that le is determined by only the local hydraulic parameter i e τ and τ c and unaffected by the spatial lag effect eq 1 can be generalized by considering that both the bed load transport rate and adaptation length can be affected by the spatial lag effect according to 35 q b q be l e q b l with l e λ where le is the equilibrium adaptation length and l is the adaptation length affected by the spatial lag effect q be le is equivalent to the pickup rate and the le is identical to the average step length λ the adaptation length l is also based on einstein s concept einstein 1950 and q b l is equivalent to the rate of deposition uchida and fukuoka 2014 incorporated eq 35 into a momentum equation of bed load motion using a semiempirical model of le and l however l cannot in principle be explicitly determined by a local hydraulic value unlike le because l is affected by the hysteresis of the bed load trajectory thus to examine the characteristics of l the present study treats l as an unknown variable and inversely calculates l using numerical results of the eulerian lagrangian simulation eq 35 can be rewritten using quantities obtained in the lagrangian simulation as 36 q b 1 λ p s d n v d n s b unlike the case of eq 1 l is not usually equal to le because of the spatial lag effect from eqs 35 and 36 a relation is obtained regarding the rate of deposition 37 q b l n v d n s b the left hand side of eq 37 represents the deposition rate from the eulerian view while the right hand side represents the rate from the lagrangian view following eq 37 the present paper inversely computes l using the results of eulerian lagrangian simulation and then discusses the validity of the linear adaptation equation i e eq 1 for multi dimensional sediment transport simulation when the spatial lag effect exists 4 results to quantify the spatial lag effect in multi dimensional problems the eulerian lagrangian model is applied to two previously conducted experiments of sediment transport around a hydraulic structure case a is local scour upstream of a slit weir under the clear water scour condition i e no sediment moves far upstream of the weir we also conduct a numerical simulation using a conventional sediment transport model considering no spatial lag effect and then compare the numerical result with the experimental result and the eulerian lagrangian simulation case b is local scour around a spur dyke under the live bed scour condition i e sediment moves upstream of the spur dyke unlike case a case b includes deposition regions downstream of the obstacle 4 1 case a slit weir the original experiment was conducted by ota et al 2016a using a flume that is 10 5 m long 0 50 m wide and 0 35 m deep as shown in fig 2 a slit weir made of plexiglas was placed in the flume and a sediment bed with specific density of 1 41 and median diameter of 0 77 mm was positioned upstream of the slit weir the experiment was carried out under the clear water scour condition the flow rate was 4 0 10 3 m3 s in addition the approaching flow depth was 72 7 mm the approaching flow velocity was 0 11 m s and the froude and reynolds numbers were respectively 0 13 and 8 2 103 the bed topography measurement was carried out after closing the slit and scanning with laser displacement sensors the development of the scour hole did not reach a complete equilibrium state because the clear water scour upstream of the slit weir required a long time to achieve such a state ota et al 2016b the same experiment was conducted three times for each experimental condition to check the experimental scatter this section compares the numerical results of the eulerian lagrangian model with those of a conventional sediment transport model the conventional model consists of the bed load and suspended load without using the linear adaptation equation eq 1 a typical exner equation used in the conventional model is 38 1 λ z b t q becm c s b w s e sus where and esus are respectively the rates of reattachment and entrainment for suspended load q becm is the bed load flux given by ashida and michiue 1972 which is widely used for multi dimensional simulations in japan e g uchida and fukuoka 2014 jacobsen 2015 ota et al 2016b kubota et al 2015 and is expressed as 39 q be c m j sg d 3 q τ b j τ b with q 17 τ 1 5 1 τ c τ 1 τ c τ for j 1 2 where critical bed shear stress τ c is given by eq 9 including the effect of the sloped bed thus q becm in eq 39 depends only on the local value of τ and the bed slope which has essentially the same physical meaning as the equilibrium bed load transport q be defined in eq 34 the suspended load transport is solved by the advection diffusion equation shown in eq 28 which has a source term esus and a sink term c s b ws at the bed boundary esus is given by the well known garcia and parker formula garcia and parker 1991 however it is noted that the contribution of esus to morphological change is very small compared with that of the bed load transport rate in the numerical simulations conducted in this study the conventional model includes the sediment sliding procedure used in the euler lagrange model fig 3 shows the computational domain and grid an inlet boundary is set 1 0 m upstream of the slit weir which is a distance equal to approximately 14 times the approaching water depth the outlet boundaries are set downstream of the weir allowing water to flow out of the computational domain after freely overflowing hexahedral cells are used throughout the computational domain refer to ota et al 2016a for further details of the numerical setup the direction of the bed load depends on the bed load velocity vector used in the eulerian lagrangian model and on the bed shear stress vector τ b in the conventional model for both simulation models therefore not only the suspended load but also the bed load is allowed to flow out of the slit depending on the bed load vector located adjacent to the slit fig 4 shows contour maps of the scour depth obtained in the experiment and the two simulations i e simulations using the eulerian lagrangian model and conventional model because a comparison of the experiment and the eulerian lagrangian simulation was presented by ota et al 2016a the present study focuses mainly on the comparison of the two numerical models used the conventional model obviously produces a larger scour hole compared with the hole observed in the experiment and the hole produced with the eulerian lagrangian model in particular the shallowly scoured region seen upstream of the weir in the case of the conventional model is remarkably different from the scour holes obtained in the cases of the euler lagrange model and experiment this difference is due to the spatial lag effect explained later in this section fig 5 a shows the horizontal flow velocity vector near the bed a distance 2d from the bed surface while fig 5 b shows the fluctuating vertical flow velocity w 2 near the bed see eq 27 because water flow near the bed is interrupted by the weir the flow goes to the slit in the vicinity of the slit the water flow at near the bed goes upwards because of the free surface overflow resulting in a strong vertical turbulence in front of the slit as shown in fig 5 b fig 6 compares the scoured volume vs and the scoured depth ds obtained in the experiment for the eulerian lagrangian model and for the conventional sediment transport model the conventional model overpredicts the scoured volume vs while the results of the eulerian lagrangian model are in good agreement with the experimental results regarding the maximum scour depth both numerical simulations are in good agreement with the experiments in addition fig 7 compares results of the scoured length and width defined in fig 7 a and nondimensionalized by the length dimension of the scoured volume vs 1 3 the two simulations and experiment agree well in terms of the dimensionless scour width ys vs 1 3 however the conventional model produces an obviously larger dimensionless scour length xs vs 1 3 than the experiment and eulerian lagrangian model which means that the scour shape of the conventional model is flatter than that in the experiment in the longitudinal direction note that in the case of the conventional model the rate of sediment entrainment into suspension esus is less than o 10 6 m s which is equivalent to the contribution of o 0 1 mm after 100 s because the suspension has a minor effect on the scour depth the shallowly scoured region of the conventional model is a result of the spatial lag effect as discussed later in this section this numerical result implies that the conventional model can overpredict the scoured area in the case of the clear water scour condition note that even the eulerian lagrangian model does not well reproduce the deeply scoured region at the corner where the slit and side wall meet it is well known that a tornado like vortex appears at the corner of the upstream face of a weir ota et al 2016b kubota et al 2015 garcia and parker 1991 baud and hager 2000 the vortex tube of the tornado like vortex is stretched by the upward flow owing to free surface overflow when the vortex is stretched the diameter of the vortex decreases and the vorticity increases as described by the theory of helmholtz this process results in the pickup of many bed particles at the corner and the conveyance of the picked up particles upwards ota et al 2016b because the tornado like vortex is of small scale high frequency and anisotropic turbulence the hydrodynamic model i e rans model does not sufficiently resolve the tornado like vortex nevertheless the eulerian lagrangian model quantitatively reproduces the temporal variation in the representative length parameters of the scour hole as shown in figs 7 and 8 which ensures that the result of the eulerian lagrangian model can be used to quantify the spatial lag effect to quantify the spatial lag effect the bed load simulated in a lagrangian frame is converted to the bed load flux as described in section 3 fig 8 shows a the magnitude of the dimensionless equilibrium bed load transport rate q be b the magnitude of the dimensionless bed load transport rate q b and c the ratio q b q b e obtained in the eulerian lagrangian simulation after 160 s no bed load is produced in the hatched parts because of the clear water scour condition i e q b q be 0 roughly speaking both q be and q b tend to increase as the slit is approached however the quantities of q be and q b are completely different as shown in fig 8 c the warm colors represent q b q be 1 while the cool colors represent q b q be 1 q b q be is o 0 1 100 to 200 mm upstream of the weir at which point the bed is hardly scoured in the eulerian lagrangian simulation see fig 4 b when q b q be 1 the bed load is unsaturated this was also found in previous experiments bell and sutherland 1983 nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 conducted for 1d bed load transport downstream of a rigid bed see fig 1 however the mechanism of the unsaturated bed load in fig 8 is different from that of the experiments downstream of the rigid bed bell and sutherland 1983 phillips and sutherland 1989 the positive gradient of the bed load transport rate downstream of the rigid bed is due to a deficit of sediment supply while the bed shear stress is spatially uniform unless the bed is deeply scoured nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 however the unsaturated q b in fig 8 is due to the spatial gradient of the bed shear stress and a lack of sediment pickup far upstream of the weir it is interesting to note that q b q be exceeds 1 and attains a value more than o 1 in the vicinity of the slit which indicates an oversaturated bed load fig 8 c the existence of an oversaturated q b was not considered in previous experiments for the downstream of the 1d rigid bed bell and sutherland 1983 nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 because the previous experiments neglected lateral bed load motion because q b consists of a bed load flux vector parallel to the local bed q b can be larger than q be owing to the superposition of the longitudinal and lateral directional components of the bed load flux this phenomenon occurs in the vicinity of the slit because the bed load upstream of the weir approaches the slit at various angles as shown by the flow velocity vector near the bed in fig 5 the movement of the bed load toward the slit accelerates and combines near the slit because of contracted flow at the slit resulting in an oversaturated q b bed load particles are likely to transit into suspension because of strong upward flow as the bed load particles approach the corner where the slit and side wall meet ota et al 2016a although q b increases because of the superposition effect of two directional components the suspension process reduces q b and mitigates the oversaturation of the bed load in this study the conventional model ignores the spatial lag effect which essentially means that the so called saturated bed load is conveyed the conventional model results in more active bed load motion in the unsaturated bed load region than the eulerian lagrangian model the shallowly scoured region in the conventional model see fig 4 is therefore caused by the spatial lag effect resulting in a deviation from the experimental results because q b is comparable to q be located adjacent to the weir in the lateral direction as shown in fig 7 c there is a far weaker spatial lag effect compared with that in the longitudinal direction this tendency is consistent with the numerical result of fig 6 with there being good agreement of the dimensionless scour width ys vs 1 3 among the experiment eulerian lagrangian model and conventional model fig 9 compares the equilibrium adaptation length le and the adaptation length l obtained in the eulerian lagrangian simulation after 160 s in fig 9 c warm colors represent l le 1 while cool colors represent l le 1 although le and l have similar distributions le tends to be larger than l in regions 1 adjacent to the weir and 2 at the edge of the contour map i e the boundary at which the bed load begins to move as shown in fig 9 c fig 10 shows the relationship between l le and q b q be obtained in the eulerian lagrangian simulation after 160 and 1280 s as is obvious from eq 35 erosion occurs in a region where l le q b q be and deposition occurs in a region where l le q b q be the majority of plots are associated with erosion because sediment is transported downstream of the slit and the scour hole develops under the clear water scour condition l le is o 1 for q b q be 0 1 which represents little spatial lag effect on the adaptation length l and thus ensures the validity of the linear adaptation equation eq 1 it is interesting to note that l le increases for q b q be 0 1 representing a strong spatial lag effect this result implies that the adaptation length is also affected by the spatial lag effect and that eq 1 is not appropriate in this situation although the causes of increasing l le with q b q be 0 are discussed in detail in section 5 this tendency is closely related to a small q b and flow acceleration which occurs at the boundary where the bed load begins to move under the clear water scour condition 4 2 case b spur dyke numerical simulation is subsequently applied to the bed deformation around a spur dyke in the experiment conducted by michiue and hinokidani 1992 previous studies have already performed numerical simulations of this experiment using a eulerian lagrangian model in which the suspended load was neglected nagata et al 2005 onda et al 2007 the present study examines the spatial lag effect through the numerical results of the eulerian lagrangian model as shown in fig 11 the spur dyke was a vertical plate 0 1 m long and 0 01 m wide placed at a 90 angle to the left bank of the straight channel and protruding from the water surface uniform sand with a median particle diameter of 0 6 mm was used in the experiment the experiment was conducted under live bed scour conditions and the scour hole thus reached a dynamic equilibrium state in 15 min the scour geometry was measured in the equilibrium stage because the sediment deposits in the downstream region of the spur dyke not only the scour process but also the deposition process is important in this numerical simulation the deposition process depends on the average step length λin this numerical model however it is well known that the relationship between λ and dimensionless bed shear stress τ has uncertainty sekine and kikkawa 1992 because λcan affect the deposition process downstream of the spur dyke it is meaningful to examine the effect of λbefore quantifying the spatial lag effect in this section thus as preliminary work a series of numerical simulations is conducted using different parameters of λ0 and η0 which are included in einstein s step length formula expressed by eq 23 existing studies nagata et al 2005 zhang et al 2015 ota et al 2016a onda et al 2007 generally used λ0 100 and η0 0 5 following einstein s recommendation einstein 1950 based on the experimental findings of einstein and el samni 1949 a simulation result obtained using λ0 100 and η0 0 5 is shown in fig 12 as a comparison with the experiment regarding bed shapes in the equilibrium stage overall the scour pattern and maximum scour depth approximately 9 cm are well reproduced unfortunately the simulation slightly underestimates the most deeply scoured area at the corner where the sidewall and upstream face of the spur dyke meet the cause and effect of this underestimation are described in detail later in this section to check the effect of λ additional simulations are conducted using λ0 η0 70 0 5 200 0 5 100 0 3 and 100 0 7 fig 13 a shows the relationship between λ and τ expressed by eq 23 for each combination of λ0 η0 obviously λ decreases with η0 that is the standard deviation of the fluctuation of the dimensionless lift force bed load particles are likely to deposit on the bed when the lift force is weaker than the gravitational force thus larger η0 under constant τ and η0 extends duration of time varying lift force being less than the gravitational force which facilitates more deposition on the bed and a decrease in λ the results of numerical simulations are compared for the maximum scour depth and horizontal length parameters xsu xsd and ys that are defined in fig 12 and represent the maximum horizontal distance from the spur dyke to the edge a 2 cm scour depth of the scour hole in upstream downstream and lateral directions respectively as shown in fig 13 b xsd tends to increase with λ0 and decrease with η0 which essentially means xsd increases with λ this is because the picked up sediment deposits downstream of the spur dyke after traveling as a bed load although no systematic difference is found among the numerical results of xsu ys and ds a simulation run using λ0 η0 100 0 5 is best in terms of reproducing these three parameters note that the combination of λ0 η0 does not affect the conclusion of the spatial lag effect because the effect of λ is included in le and q be as discussed in section 5 from these considerations the numerical condition λ0 η0 100 0 5 recommended by einstein 1950 is adopted in the following analysis and discussion fig 14 shows the 3d stream line generated 1 cm above the bed and dimensionless bed shear stress τ on the bed in the early and equilibrium stages of the scour in the early stage the horseshoe vortex stably exists and results in high τ on the bed additionally there is an obvious difference in the water elevation between the upstream and downstream of the spur dyke bringing high τ to the bed downstream of the spur dyke in the equilibrium stage the complicated flow field forms around a spur dyke and water flow goes upwards along the upslope of the scour hole with various flow directions these flow properties are consistent previous observations of 3d flow around a spur dyke zhang et al 2015 koken and constantinescu 2008a b however koken and constantinescu 2008a b 2011 showed the existence of multiple corner vortices immediately upstream of the spur dyke in particular a smaller but relatively intense corner vortex see fig 3 in koken and constantinescu 2011 is present at the junction of the upstream face of the spur dyke and the bottom wall which contributes to scour in the vicinity of the spur dyke such a small and anisotropic turbulence locally appearing at the corner is not fully resolved by the rans based model used in this study unfortunately this deficiency results in underestimation of the scour depth at the corner where the sidewall and upstream face of the spur dyke meet see fig 12 the underestimation at the corner is similar to that seen in the previous section i e the slit weir case however it should be emphasized again that our numerical simulation can quantitatively reproduce the representative scour length parameters as shown in fig 13 which ensures that the eulerian lagrangian model can be used to quantify the spatial lag effect manes and brocchini 2015 showed that the energy cascade based on kolmogorov s theory explains the relationship between turbulence and scour development they indicated that the size of the horseshoe vortex can be used as the length scale of the large scale eddy linked to the maximum scour depth the rans based model used in this study resolves such a representative large scale eddy see fig 14 and can calculate the energy cascade according to the k ω sst model which also supports the validity of the numerical model fig 15 shows contour maps of a the near bed velocity field with the bed elevation described using warm colors for deposited regions and cool colors for scoured regions b the magnitude of the equilibrium bed load transport rate q be c the dimensionless bed load transport rate q b d the ratio q b q be described using warm colors for q b q be 1 and cool colors for q b q be 1 e the equilibrium adaptation length le and f the adaptation length l in the early and equilibrium stages of scour development throughout all scour stages q b is nearly equal to q be in the region far upstream of the spur dyke where water flow is not disturbed by the existence of the spur dyke resulting in no spatial lag effect fig 15 c interestingly this tendency is completely different for the unsaturated q b seen in the previous section case a which is attributed to the difference between the clear water scour condition of case a and the live bed scour condition of case b as shown in fig 15 c q b q be is larger than 1 at 0 2 m upstream of the spur dyke in the early stage this phenomenon is due to the deceleration of the bed load motion in the longitudinal direction because of the existence of the spur dyke which is visualized by the near bed flow velocity vector in fig 15 a throughout all scour stages q b q be obviously deviates from 1 around the spur dyke and in the downstream region which points to the existence of the spatial lag effect in the early stage q b is much smaller than q be at the nose of the spur dyke where the bed is most likely to be scoured the bed load around the nose is strongly accelerated by the horseshoe vortex in the early scour stage see fig 14 a which produces unsaturated q b at the location koken and constantinescu 2008a experimentally and numerically showed that under the flat bed condition the wake and horseshoe vortex bring sediment to behind the spur dyke this observation is similar to the simulation results of q b obtained in this work as shown in the early stage of fig 15 c d high values of q b are distributed along the horseshoe vortex see fig 14 a and the bed load is thus mainly transported to behind the spur dyke allowing oversaturation koken and constantinescu 2008b showed that for the scoured bed the upward flow appearing at the legs of a necklace vertical structure removes the bed load out of the scour hole and conveys it to behind the spur dyke and the main channel in the equilibrium stage of the present study q b picked up from the scour hole is transported to both immediately behind the spur dyke and the main channel owing to the upward flow at the upslope of the scour hole see figs 14 b and 15 c d in contrast to the clear water scour condition used in koken and constantinescu 2008b the present study conducts simulations under the live bed scour condition the sediment thus moves more actively than in koken and constantinescu 2008b even in the equilibrium stage the adaptation length l is equal to the equilibrium adaptation length le in the upstream region of the spur dyke the patterns of l are obviously different from those of le around the spur dyke and its downstream region l is less than le around the nose of the spur dyke where the high bed shear stress is distributed especially in the early scour stage conversely l is larger than le behind the spur dyke fig 16 shows the relationship between q b q be and l le in a the early stage b the intermediate stage and c the equilibrium stage of the scour development l le obviously decreases with q b q be for q b q be o 0 1 surprisingly this tendency is contrary to that in case a see fig 10 although the relationship between q b q be and l le is summarized including case a in the following section this tendency is related to the live bed scour condition and high bed shear stress l le tends to increase with q b q be in the region of the oversaturated bed load although l le is scattered especially in the early stage of the scour even if q b q be has a constant value in the deposition region l le is affected by the average distance that bed load particles move to reach the deposition location in other words l le in the deposition region has the spatial hysteresis effect and is depicted on the right hand side of eq 37 unlike the sediment transport in front of the slit weir in case a the sediment deposition mainly occurs after deceleration downstream of the spur dyke the deposition process downstream of a hydraulic structure therefore results in a wide range of l le for l le o 1 in the oversaturated bed load as shown in fig 16 the equilibrium stage has plots with less scattering compared with the early stage for both l le and q b q be this result indicates that the spatial lag effect is mitigated as the equilibrium scour stage is approached because the spatial distribution of the bed shear stress becomes more uniform in the equilibrium stage see fig 14 onda et al 2007 compared numerical results of the eulerian lagrangian model and a conventional sediment transport model by incorporating the equilibrium bed load transport rate eq 34 into their conventional model they reported that the maximum scour depth computed using the conventional model developed much more quickly than that computed using the eulerian lagrangian model while the maximum scour depths achieved in the equilibrium scour stage are similar for the two models they also reported that the scour volume calculated from the conventional model is larger than that calculated from eulerian lagrangian model their findings are consistent with the spatial lag effect shown in fig 15 in that the scour depth and scoured volume rapidly increase in the unsaturated region 5 discussion because the unsaturated bed load is closely related to the scour process this section comprehensively discusses the response of l le to the unsaturated q b q be obtained in cases a and b i e figs 10 and 16 for both cases l le varies dramatically with q b q be in the region q b q be o 0 1 in case a l le increases with q b q be 0 at the boundary where the bed load begins to move or at locations adjacent to the weir inversely in case b l le decreases with q b q be 0 in the scour hole especially in the early scour stage these contradictory tendencies can be explained by the fact that the unsaturated bed load is due to the acceleration of the bed load motion however the response of l le to q b q be 0 depends on the balance of the sediment supply i e q b and the bed shear stress as shown in fig 17 that is to say l le has two modes of response when q b q be approaches zero the first mode is the case that q b l 0 presented as mode a in fig 17 and occurring in case a i e clear water scour as described in eq 37 this mode represents that no deposition of the bed load is likely to occur at the boundary where sediment begins to move and the bed load is accelerated that is to say this mode responds to the clear water scour condition that the bed load transport rate approaches zero as the distance to a hydraulic structure increases the second mode is the case that q be presented as mode b in fig 17 and occurring in case b i e live bed scour q be is a mathematical function that monotonically increases with the bed shear stress and le as described in section 3 there thus exists a response l le 0 when q b q be 0 i e mode b note that l le does not monotonically decrease with q b q be q b q be in the case that q b decreases with the bed shear stress which occurs at the edge of a scour hole under the clear water scour condition as shown in fig 9 c and fig 10 mode b is therefore likely to occur at the scour hole under the live bed scour condition mode b is likely to occur at the scour hole of the live bed scour condition previous experiments bell and sutherland 1983 nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 on the 1d bed load downstream of the rigid bed did not report the response of l le however nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 reported that their experimental finding and the linear adaptation equation were valid for weak non equilibrium bed load transport because the spatial variation of the bed shear stress was weak in their experiments therefore previous experiments did not evaluate a strong unsaturated bed load region q b q be o 0 1 which is the scope of discussion in this section although l le deviates from o 1 in the range q b q be o 0 1 this study ensures l l e o 1 in the range o 0 1 q b q be 1 that occurs in the erosion region for this range the linear adaptation equation eq 1 is able to represent the spatial lag effect because l le which is consistent with conclusions obtained previously from experiments conducted for a 1d unsaturated bed load in o 0 1 q b x q be x 1 bell and sutherland 1983 nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 although previous experiments bell and sutherland 1983 nakagawa and tsujimoto 1980 phillips and sutherland 1989 did not deal with an oversaturated bed load considering directional bed load motion our numerical results indicate that the linear adaptation equation does not appropriately capture the adaptation length of an oversaturated bed load downstream of an obstacle because of the spatial hysteresis effect of the deposition these results indicate the possibility that the linear adaptation equation is not suitable for a bed load transport being affected by a strong spatial lag effect in q b q be o 0 1 and q b q be o 1 an alternative to the linear adaptation equation is eq 35 that has been incorporated into the momentum equation of bed load motion by uchida and fukuoka 2014 to simulate sediment transport in a compound meandering channel however their model considered only the situation of l le and q b q be representing the deposition process for an oversaturated bed load unfortunately their method of computing l does not consider modes a and b appearing in the unsaturated bed load shown in fig 17 results of the present work imply the importance of considering modes a and b in accurately simulating the time variation of a local scour when using the adaptation length several works have investigated the spatial lag effect for 1d problems through numerical simulation cao et al 2016 quantified the spatial lag effect of a nonuniform bed load by conducting 1d simulations of movable bed experiments they observed an unsaturated bed load in a degradation process and oversaturated bed load in an aggradation process these previous findings are consistent with the results of the present study as shown in figs 10 and 16 which represent the spatial lag depending on erosion and deposition in the dimensional simulation although the strong spatial lag depicted in fig 17 was not mentioned previous studies on 1d problems indicate that the adaptation length for suspended sediment increases with the suspension index or rouse number li et al 2014 cao et al 2016 such a finding will be useful when the equilibrium suspended load transport model is applied to 1d simulation the suspended load transport in the present 3d simulation is solved using the advection diffusion equation including the entrainment and settling term at the bed boundary see eq 28 the effect of the suspended load on the spatial lag of the bed load is considered by the process of sediment transition between the bed load and suspended load one such example is represented by case a i e the slit weir case where the oversaturation of the bed load in the vicinity of the corner is mitigated by sediment transition from the bed load to suspended load 6 conclusions this study quantified the spatial lag effect of bed load transport by means of numerical simulation using the eulerian lagrangian model numerical analyses were conducted for the local scour around a spur dyke and weir type structure where evaluating the equilibrium and non equilibrium bed load transport rates is difficult when taking an experimental approach the bed load simulated in a lagrangian frame was converted to a bed load flux because the eulerian lagrangian model couples the deterministic approach of bed load motion with the stochastic approach of einstein s concept the numerical model allows for reasonable quantification of the equilibrium and non equilibrium bed load transport rates we also compared the numerical results of the eulerian lagrangian model with those of the conventional sediment transport model considering no spatial lag to the best of our knowledge this is first work that quantifies the spatial lag effect on multi dimensional sediment transport using a numerical approach the eulerian lagrangian simulation mainly showed an unsaturated bed load transport rate upstream of a slit weir under the clear water scour condition this spatial lag effect was found to be the cause of an overestimation of the scour hole simulated by the conventional model the spatial lag effect was also examined for the local scour around a spur dyke under the live bed scour condition after the effect of the average step length function was checked in the early scour stage an unsaturated bed load appeared around the nose of the spur dyke and an oversaturated bed load appeared behind the spur dyke the spatial lag effect of the live bed scour was mitigated under the dynamic equilibrium condition the present study examined whether the relationship between the bed load transport rate q b and its equilibrium rate q be can be accurately represented by the linear adaptation equation the adaptation length l obviously deviated from the equilibrium value le for q b q be o 0 1 because of the acceleration of the bed load particles there are two modes of response of l le when q b q be approaches zero and the modes depend on the balance of the deposition rate and the bed shear stress under the clear water scour condition l le increases with q b q be 0 in the region where the bed load begins to move under the live bed scour condition l le decreases with q b q be 0 in the scour hole the response of l le to q b q be in the deposition region downstream of the hydraulic structure was scattered because of the spatial hysteresis effect of the deposition although l le increased with q b q be qualitatively numerical results indicate that the linear adaptation equation is valid in the range o 0 1 q b q be 1 which is consistent with the results of previous experiments conducted within this range for 1d bed load transport downstream of a rigid bed however the numerical results suggest the possibility that the linear adaptation equation does not appropriately represent the strong spatial lag effect in q b q be o 0 1 and q b q be o 1 owing to the strong spatial gradient of the bed shear stress and the superimposition of the bed load respectively

kasuga bunkyo ku tokyo 112 8551 japan research and development initiative chuo university 1 13 27 kasuga bunkyo ku tokyo 112 8551 japan corresponding author interface resolved large eddy simulations were performed to reproduce hyperconcentrated water particle mixture flows in a laboratory experiment conducted by egashira et al 2001 the flows were simulated at sediment concentrations of 0 196 and 0 444 using spheres and gravel particles simulations using gravel with a suitable shape properly reproduced the discharge rates of water and particles as well as the wall normal distributions of the particle velocities in the experiments the study involved an examination of the effects of particle shapes and the coefficients of contact forces coefficients of restitution and friction angles of particle surfaces used in the discrete element method on mixture flows significantly different flows were obtained for spherical and gravel particles under dense conditions whereby the particle shear stress became much greater than that for water the simulations of spheres at different coefficients of contact forces could not adequately represent the mixture flows of nonspherical particles keywords interface resolved large eddy simulation hyperconcentrated flow particle shape stress friction angle fluid force 1 introduction heavy water and sediment runoff due to debris or sediment laden flows during large floods sometimes causes topographical changes and severe sediment disasters to develop countermeasures in anticipation of these types of disasters the development of appropriate prediction methods for these hyperconcentrated flows is required continuum models of fluid particle mixture flows have often been used for simulations of these hyperconcentrated flows e g armanini et al 2014 bagnold 1954 drew 1983 egashira et al 1997 jenkins and hanes 1998 kranenburg et al 2014 meruane and tamburrino 2012 takahashi 1991 continuum models can be classified into single phase flow models e g bagnold 1954 egashira et al 1997 takahashi 1991 and two phase flow models e g armanini et al 2014 drew 1983 jenkins and hanes 1998 kranenburg et al 2014 meruane and tamburrino 2012 the single phase flow models do not distinguish the fluid phase and the sediment phase but treat them as a single multiphase flow while the two phase flow models treat the momentums of the fluid and sediment phases individually despite the single phase models having already been used in many simulations of geophysical flows the two phase models were assumed to better predict complicated flows such those with complicated boundary geometries or severely unsteady flows compared to single phase models however developing appropriate constitutive equations of the stress of the fluid and particles or fluid forces on particles is difficult for example although several constitutive relationships representing particle collision stress were derived by estimating the frequency of collisions based on the strain rate of the particles and the concentration the effect of a particle s shape was not theoretically considered furthermore it is difficult to experimentally measure the forces on the fluid and the particles even in cases of uniform flows thus more appropriate constitutive equations of the stress and the fluid force are required for the two phase models numerical investigations of the dynamic mechanisms of fluid particle mixture flows increased when fluid flow simulations and individual particle simulations generated using the discrete element method dem cundall and strack 1979 were coupled fukuda and fukuoka 2014 fukuoka et al 2014 gotoh and sakai 1997 harada and gotoh 2013 ji et al 2014 kidanemariam and uhlmann 2014 schmeekle 2015 vowinckel et al 2014 these numerical simulations are referred to as numerical movable bed nmb simulations in the remainder of this manuscript a numerical methodology gotoh and sakai 1997 in the early stage of the nmb employed drag coefficients to simulate fluid forces however extreme difficulty remained in selecting a suitable drag coefficient to represent dense particle motion this required the development of nmb based on high accuracy simulations in numerical investigation of the dynamics of the fluid particle multiphase flow interface resolved euler lagrange simulations irs have been developed kajishima et al 2001 ushijima et al 2008 wherein flow motions around solid objects were adequately simulated in the eulerian approach using computational grids smaller than the objects while solid objects were simulated with the lagrangian approach using the dem method several studies have demonstrated the efficiency of this strategy in multiphase flow simulations the irs can directly simulate fluid forces from flow motions surrounding objects without drag coefficients recently increases in computational efficiency have led to an investigation of the dynamics of water sediment mixture flows using irs fukuda and fukuoka 2014 fukuoka et al 2014 harada and gotoh 2013 ji et al 2014 kidanemariam and uhlmann 2014 vowinckel et al 2014 the irs is able to be classified into interface resolved direct numerical simulation irdns ji et al 2014 kidanemariam and uhlmann 2014 vowinckel et al 2014 and interface resolved large eddy simulation irles fukuda and fukuoka 2014 fukuoka et al 2014 harada and gotoh 2013 irdns directly simulates the flow motion around particles without employing the turbulence model irles models the subgrid scale turbulence and directly simulates large eddies greater than the grid scale that are produced by the particles irdns requires smaller computational grids than those in irles and it has a larger computational cost thus for investigation of fluid particle interactions with a high reynolds number where the flow around the particles is severely disturbed irles is a more effective tool with respect to the computational cost for geophysical flows the shape of the nonspherical particles is considered to play a significant role in flow dynamics in a study of dem simulations under dry conditions matsushima et al 2009 reported that particle shapes have considerable influence on the repose angle maeda and hirabayashi 2006 performed two dimensional biaxial compression simulations and found that it is difficult to reproduce noncircular particle motions with a cylinder even if the friction angles of the particle surfaces vary despite this most nmb simulations employ spheres without sufficient examination into whether these types of simulations are able to represent the mixture of nonspherical particles to investigate the mixture flow dynamics of nonspherical particles by irs sufficient validations have to be performed against the hyperconcentrated flows of nonspherical particles using data such as the wall normal distributions of the particle velocities and the particle concentrations it is also necessary to examine the effect of particle shapes on flow configurations impacting the simulation results and to assess whether sphere simulations are able to reproduce mixtures of nonspherical particles by only varying the coefficient of contact forces that are used in the dem method in a study by fukuoka et al 2014 a numerical simulation code arbitrary particle multiphase apm was developed based on irles the apm simulated fluid and arbitrarily shaped particle mixture flows validation of the apm was conducted fukuoka et al 2014 using experimental data in which real size gravel flowed in a stream on a 45 m long large concrete fixed bed channel the vertical distribution of the particle velocities simulated using apm agreed well with the experimental results however the particle concentration of the flow was approximately 2 which was too small in the present study the validation of the apm code against hyperconcentrated fluid and nonspherical particle mixture flows was examined the apm simulation was performed to reproduce the hyperconcentrated flows that were demonstrated in a laboratory experiment by egashira et al 2001 in which valuable hyperconcentrated flow data were measured at different concentrations both spheres and gravel shaped particles were used in the simulations validation of the apm code was examined based on comparisons of the simulations to the experimental data with respect to the water and particle discharge rates the wall normal distributions of the particle velocities and the concentrations for the simulations of spheres different coefficients of damping forces and friction sliders were used in the dem method to determine whether the sphere simulations could reproduce water and nonspherical particle mixture flows furthermore differences in the mixture flow dynamics between spheres and gravels were discussed by predicting the water and particle stresses fluid forces on particles and energy dissipation rates that are necessary for two phase flow models 2 hyperconcentrated flow experiments egashira et al 2001 conducted experiments on uniform hyperconcentrated flows at sediment discharge concentrations cf that ranged from 0 141 to 0 444 cf q p q w q p where q w and q p are the discharge rates per unit width of the water and particles respectively which measured the important dynamic properties of water particle mixture flows a rectangular open channel 12 m long 0 1 m wide with a bed slope θ of 19 was used in the experiment fine gravel 0 00218 m in diameter an internal friction angle of 38 7 a stationary volume concentration of 0 512 and a sediment particle specific gravity of 2 62 was used in the experiment the same material was fixed to the bed to create a rough surface water was supplied at a constant rate from upstream and fine gravel was fed into a section that was 6 m away from the channel end water and sediment discharge were measured by sampling the water sediment mixture at the downstream end the wall normal distributions of particle velocities were photographed using video cameras from one side of the channel which were measured using image analyses the wall normal distributions of the gravel concentrations were also measured using a sampler that had several inlets at different levels 3 numerical methods in this study the numerical simulation code apm fukuoka et al 2014 was used this code is capable of simulating the three dimensional motion of fluid and particles with different shapes in a simulation of the fluid motion particles were considered to be liquids with different densities all the domains of fluids and particles were simulated using the governing equations of a single fluid model for incompressible solid liquid multiphase flow in the eulerian approach gravel particles consisted of several small superimposed spheres their motions were simulated using rigid bodies based on the lagrangian approach simulations of uniform flows were often performed by not considering the variation of the free surface kidanemariam and uhlmann 2014 ji et al 2014 stoesser 2010 vowinckel et al 2014 however with respect to the target experimental flow in this study the ratio of the flow depth to the particle diameter hm d was considerably small at most 11 9 case 2 see table 1 this implied that the free surface continued to be disturbed owing to the distribution of the moving particles to directly take into account the effect of the disturbed free surface on the motion of the fluid and the particles free surface variation was simulated in this study 3 1 numerical method of fluid motions fluid motions were simulated using the governing equations of a single fluid model for solid liquid multiphase flows to perform the irles the smagorinsky model was used as the subgrid scale turbulence model which was additionally introduced to the single fluid model in literature based on the irdns ushijima et al 2008 as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j g i 1 ρ p x i x j 2 ν ν t s ij 3 s ij 1 2 u i x j u j x i 4 ν μ ρ 5 ν t c s δ 2 2 s ij s ij where ui is the ith component of the weighted average velocity including the particles ρ and μ are the volume averaged density and viscosity respectively gi is the gravitational acceleration p is the sum of the pressure and isotropic component of sgs stresses and sij is the strain rate tensor in addition cs is the smagorinsky constant and δ is the computational grid size germano et al 1991 developed a subgrid scale eddy viscosity model that dynamically determined the value of cs however the model assumed flows in which no particles existed and thus the applicability of this model to fluid particle mixture flows remains uncertain thus as a basic first stage examination of irles a constant cs value was selected in this study simulations of the above equations were performed using the finite difference method of a simplified marker and cell smac scheme on a staggered grid arrangement the first order differencing scheme was applied to the time derivatives and the third order upwind differencing scheme was applied to the advection term of eq 2 the grid averages of ρ and ui were computed using the subcells located in a grid as follows see fig 1 6 ρ sub f ρ β sub f 1 7 u i sub f ρ β u i β sub f ρ where sub f a denotes the summation notation for a at every subcell center in the grid the superscripts β are assigned to the symbols w or p when the center of the subcell is located in the water or in the particles respectively the superscripts w or p denote the values of the water and the particles respectively equivalently u i w is the water velocity and u i w was substituted by the ui which was accounted for at previous time step by solving equations of the continuity and the momentum u i p is the particle velocity at the center of the subcell which is computed in accordance with the following equation 8 u i p r i g ε ijk ω j r k s where r i g is the velocity vector at the center of the rigid body that includes the subcell ε ijk is the levi civita symbol ω i is the angular velocity of the rigid body and r i s is the position vector from the center of the gravity of the rigid body to the center of the subcell the particle motions affected by the fluid and the contact forces are reflected in the fluid flow simulation through using eqs 6 and 7 at every time step the free surface variation was simulated using the continuity equation of the fluid volume fraction α f based on the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 as follows 9 α f t α f u i x i 0 the donor acceptor flux approximation hirt and nichols 1981 was used for the computation of the above equation the gas phase was not solved in this simulation the boundary conditions for the fluid velocity and the pressure are schematically shown in fig 2 at a specific velocity computational point that neighbors a grid with a volume fraction 0 α f 1 the momentum equation eq 2 was solved to estimate the velocity u t cal parallel to the free surface and the velocity u n cal normal to the free surface which was included in the fluid the momentum equation was not solved for the velocity u n bound normal to the free surface which was not included in the fluid the velocity boundary condition of u n bound normal to the free surface was specified such that ui xi 0 in the grid that included the free surface a boundary condition of u t bound parallel to the free surface was given so that the strain rate was zero for example in the case where the direction of the free surface matched that depicted in fig 2 the boundary condition was given in such a way to satisfy the relationship of u 1 x 2 u 2 x 1 0 at point a additionally the pressure was only computed at point p cal at which point the volume fraction was α f 1 the boundary condition of the pressure p bound with a volume fraction 0 α f 1 was defined in such a way that the pressure at the free surface was equal to zero this estimation was executed by referring to the neighboring pressure at α f 1 and by assuming that the pressure distribution was linear even though particles sometimes reached the free surface in the simulation of the hyperconcentrated flow in this study the number of these particles was small and the simulation was assumed to predict the flow configuration by using the boundary conditions described above thus no special treatment was applied to account for the boundary condition between the solid and gas phases 3 2 numerical method of particle motion gravel shaped particles were modeled by superposing several small spheres that did not have any gaps matsushima et al 2009 this model can represent naturally shaped round gravel particles with a small number of spheres therefore this gravel model has the advantage in simulations of hyperconcentrated fluid particle mixture flows because it suppresses the computational cost by using a small number of elements in the representation of each gravel particle in the apm code fukuoka et al 2014 gravel motion was simulated based on the following momentum and angular momentum equations 10 m r i g m g i f i f f i c 11 ω i i i j 1 r j i t i f t i c ε j

the levi civita symbol the basis vectors e i fixed on the rigid body for the next time step were computed by using the angular velocity for the next time step solved by eq 11 and the time step δt p the positions of the small spheres in the next time step with respect to the global coordinate system were computed using the initial components of the positions of the small spheres in the local coordinate system the basis vectors e i that were computed at every time step and the center of gravity of the rigid body r i g that was estimated based on eq 10 quaternion was used for the rotation of the basis vector e i and for the coordinate transformation between the global and the local coordinate systems using r j i ushijima et al 2008 the second order adams bashforth scheme was applied to the time integral of the velocity and angular velocity of the gravel particle 3 3 numerical method of fluid forces acting on particles ushijima et al 2008 developed a numerical simulation method in the framework of irdns the method accounted for the fluid force acting on a particle by the volume integral of the forces on the particle region in the multiphase fluid whereby the volume integral was performed by using subcells in the apm code that was based on irles the fluid force acting on a particle was accounted for by the volume integral of the forces owing to the grid scale and subgrid scale stresses in the multiphase fluid simulation as follows 12 f i f sub p p x i ρ x j 2 ν ν t s ij δ v sub 13 t i f sub p ε ijk r j f p x k ρ x l 2 ν ν t s kl δ v sub where f i f and t i f are the ith components of a fluid force and the torque exerted on a particle respectively additionally r i f is the position vector from the particle s center of gravity to the center of the subcell while sub p a denotes the summation of values a at the center of the subcell for each subcell inside the gravel and δvsub is the volume of the subcell 3 4 numerical method of the contact forces the contact forces are simulated using the dem method for each small sphere composing the gravel particles the contact candidate paring of the grid based on the sorted particle index method pgs and the force simulation referencing the contact pair table method fsc which were developed by nishiura and sakaguchi 2011 were used for simulations of the contact detection and the contact force respectively the computations of the contact forces were performed when the distance between the centers of the two small spheres d ij satisfied the relationship of d ij r i r j where r i and r j are the radii of the small spheres i and j respectively the contact forces exerted on the small spheres were accounted for by using springs dampers and friction sliders as follows cundall and strack 1979 14 f i v f i e f i d 15 f n c max f n v 0 16 f t c sign f t v min f t v f n c tan φ p 17 f i e n 1 f i e n k i n δ δ i n 18 f i d n 1 c i n δ δ i n δ t p where i denotes the components that correspond to the unit basis vector e i of the local coordinate system which is defined in consideration of the positions of the two small spheres i and j that are in contact see fig 3 components of the normal direction and the two orthogonal directions on the tangential plane were denoted using the indices n indicated as 1 in fig 3 and t indicated as 2 3 in fig 3 respectively f i v f i e f i d and f i c are the components of the contact forces that are computed at each contact point in this case f i v is the force estimated based on the voigt model which considers only a spring and a damping force f i e is the elastic force f i d is the damping force and f i c is the contact force of the two small spheres obtained by considering the spring the damper and the frictional slider f c f i c e i represents the force exerted on sphere j by sphere i additionally φ p is the friction angle of a particle surface k is the spring constant and c is the damping coefficient furthermore δ δ i is the relative displacement which is defined as δ δ i δ x i δ x j e i where δ x i and δ x j are the displacements of the contact points for time step δt p respectively the superscripts n in the parentheses denote the time step of the simulation the spring constant k is derived using a linear approximation tsuji et al 1992 based on the hertzian contact theory the damping coefficient c is linked to the coefficient of restitution eb under the assumption that the contact motion corresponds to the damping oscillation tsuji et al 1993 as follows 19 k n 4 9 r i r j r i r j e 1 ν p 2 2 f n e 1 3 20 s 0 k

spheres 3 5 flow around a fixed sphere in a uniform stream in accordance with the canonical validation of the flow simulation the three dimensional flow around a fixed sphere was simulated using different grid sizes the computational setup is shown in fig 4 grid sizes of δ d 2 d 4 and d 8 were selected where d is the diameter of the sphere in this simulation the gravitational term the first term on the right side of eq 2 was not counted and only non static pressure was simulated the ratio ρ p ρ w 2 62 the simulations were performed at red ud ν 1 10 100 1000 10 000 by varying the flow velocity u and the kinematic viscosity ν the drag coefficients cd computed by the simulated fluid force are shown in fig 5 the adopted approximation c d 24 r e d 6 1 r e d 0 4 white and frank 2006 is also shown in the figure the drag coefficients estimated by the simulation of d 2 d 4 and d 8 agreed well with the approximation specifically little difference between the drag coefficients d 4 and d 8 was observed however vorticity shedding in the wake of the sphere was not observed even at red 10 000 for d 4 conversely such phenomena were observed at red 1000 or more in the case of d 8 a simulation of hyperconcentrated flow using the d 4 grids case 2 g2 as discussed in section 4 2 took approximately 1 month to complete using a cluster system at chuo university 6 nodes 2 cpu node cpu intel xeon e5 2690 v3 thus even for the d 4 grid the simulations of hyperconcentrated flows require considerable computational cost if a grid size of d 8 is selected the implementation of plural simulations of hyperconcentrated flows required in this study becomes difficult with respect to the simulations of hyperconcentrated flows using d 4 grids there is the possibility that the simulation can reproduce the configuration of hyperconcentrated flows since vorticity is assumed to be shed from complicated arrangements of moving and dispersed particles therefore in section 4 1 the influence of the grid size on the simulations of the hyperconcentrated flows was examined subsequently we chose the computational grid size for the assessment of the effects of particle shapes and the coefficients of contact forces used in dem on the motions of fluid particle mixtures 4 validation of the numerical simulations via hyperconcentrated flow experiments 4 1 simulations of hyperconcentrated flows at different grid sizes an examination of the effect of particle shapes on hyperconcentrated flows in this study required the execution of plural simulations with apm under different particle shapes and concentrations the selection of small computational grids caused considerable difficulty in achieving the aims of this study owing to the significant computational cost therefore before the execution of simulations with different particle shapes and concentrations simulations with different computation grids were performed as a preliminary test and the influence of the grid size on the simulated flow configuration of the fluid particle mixture was examined 4 1 1 computational setup simulations of hyperconcentrated flows in case 1 sediment discharge concentration cf 0 196 depth 0 0139 m see table 1 measured by egashira et al 2001 were performed using the apm code grid sizes of d 2 case 1 s0 d 2 d 4 case 1 s0 d 4 and d 8 case 1 s0 d 8 were selected sphere 0 was used in these simulations as shown in table 2 the width and bed slope of the numerical channel were respectively set to 0 1 m and 19 which matched those in the experiment periodic conditions in the flow direction were applied to simulate uniform flow in the experiment the same particles as those supplied to the flume were fixed at the bottom of the numerical channel in the simulation similar to the experimental setup spheres of the same size as those used for the supplied particles were fixed at the bottom of the numerical channel and were ordered in a zigzag arrangement without overwraps the apm code did not account for the computation of shear force between the spheres and the plane additionally the particles were not fixed to the sidewalls in the experiment and the aspect ratios b hm b is the width of the flume hm is the flow depth case 1 7 2 case 2 3 9 were relatively large thus the friction at the bottom of the channel was the dominant imposing resistance to the flow and the influence of the sidewall friction was assumed to be small therefore the slip condition was adopted for the sidewall a length of the numerical channel of 1 m was selected for case 1 lx hm 72 and for case 2 lx hm 39 where lx is the streamwise length of the computation domain and hm is the depth of the flow as indicated in table 3 the length was determined as a sufficiently long channel by referring to previous studies which applied the periodic condition in the flow direction lx hm 3 and only les simulations of flow were conducted on a bed with realistic roughness stoesser 2010 and lx hm 24 whereby the nmb simulation was conducted based on the irdns vowinckel et al 2014 the cartesian coordinates x x 1 y x 2 and z x 3 corresponded to the streamwise spanwise and wall normal directions respectively under the initial conditions water and particles were supplied into the numerical channel such that the water levels were equal to the experimental water levels particles were arranged at regular intervals in the channel and the particle volume concentrations were equal to the experimental discharge concentrations the initial velocities of the water and the particles were defined as the bulk velocities vm of the experiment see table 1 the parameters used in the simulations are shown in table 4 the values selected in the simulation namely the friction angle of a particle surface φ p 26 6 the coefficient of restitution eb 0 7 the elastic modulus and the poisson s ratio were the same as the values selected in a previous study fukuoka et al 2014 so that the apm simulation reproduced real scale gravel motions in a stream a simulation time of 1 5 s was selected so that the initial transient had almost ended the end of the initial transient was examined using an index δ q β c t t sim q t 2 β q t 1 β δ t q q t 1 β which indicates the variation rates of the discharge rate of water and particles where superscript β denotes the values of water w and particles p tsim is the elapsed simulation time ct 0 1 is a coefficient that determines the ratio of the time needed to evaluate the variation of the discharge to tsim and the subscripts t1 and t2 t2 t1 indicate the times when the values were measured additionally δtq δtq t2 t1 was set to 0 5 s the variables q t 1 β and q t 2 β were accounted for by averaging the data which were output at a frequency of once per 0 02 s for the time δtq at the end of the simulation tsim 1 5 s q w and q p fell below the values of 0 010 and 0 077 respectively 4 1 2 influence of grid size on the simulation of fluid particle multiphase flows distribution of the vorticity in the spanwise direction in the center of the channel at the final simulation time t 1 5 s is shown in fig 6 these figures show that the vorticity in the vicinity of the bottom of the channel became dominant in the case of the simulations using d 4 and d 8 since the particles move actively there in contrast in the simulation of d 2 the vorticity decreased in the vicinity of the bottom part of the channel since numerous particles occupied this region and were larger at the upper levels of the high concentration layer at a level of approximately z 0 01 m these results lead to the conclusion that it became difficult for simulated particles to disperse near the bottom and to move when a relatively large grid size is used with respect to the particle size a selection of smaller grid sizes is desirable for increased simulation accuracy however the computational cost of the simulation at a grid size of d 8 was too large to perform plural simulations the computational time was approximately two weeks using 8 computer nodes for 1 s0 d 8 in this study a grid size of d 4 was selected to examine the effects of particle shapes and coefficients of contact forces on simulated fluid particle mixture flows this grid size was chosen by considering following results the fluid forces on a sphere simulated using a grid size of d 4 under a wide range of reynolds numbers see section 3 5 simulations of the hyperconcentrated flows using d 4 agreed with the experimental particle velocity see section 4 2 and the particles in the d 4 simulation moved dispersedly in a similar manner to those in the case of the d 8 simulation while the motion in the d 2 case could not be simulated as shown in fig 6 the computational cost of irles is generally very large this constituted a major issue in the examination of larger scale fluid particle interactions that involved bed waves this study examined how these simulations predict the hyperconcentrated flows of nonspherical particles by varying the particle shapes and the coefficient of contact forces and the applicability and the limitation of the irles at the relatively large grid size of d 4 was also clearly shown this examination is presumed to contribute to the simulations of large scale fluid particle mixture flows using irles 4 2 simulations of hyperconcentrated flows with different particle shapes simulations of the apm were performed to reproduce the hyperconcentrated flow which was measured in the experiment conducted by egashira et al 2001 to examine the validation of the model in different sediment discharge concentrations the simulation model was applied to two experimental cases of different sediment discharge concentrations case 1 sediment discharge concentration of cf 0 196 depth 0 0139 m case 2 cf 0 444 depth 0 0259 m see table 1 herein the computational grid size of d 4 was selected three particle shapes namely sphere 0 gravel 1 and gravel 2 were used in the simulations as illustrated in table 2 gravels 1 and 2 consisted of nine small spheres and the shape of gravel 1 was closer to a sphere than gravel 2 the size of gravel particles was defined as the diameter of spheres with the same volume the same boundary and initial conditions were given as those described in section 4 1 1 the simulation time was selected as tsim 2 s in case 1 and tsim 10 s in case 2 so that the initial transient had almost ended at the end of the simulation the indices q w q p the definition is described in section 4 1 1 which indicates the variation in the discharge rates of the water or particles fell below 0 0086 and 0 024 in case 1 1 s0 1 g1 1 g2 and 0 11 and 0 15 in case 2 2 s0 2 g1 2 g2 respectively moreover the time difference δtq used for computing the variation rate of discharge was selected as 0 5 s for case 1 and 1 0 s for case 2 the values q t 1 β and q t 2 β used in the computation of the indices were accounted for by averaging the data and they were output at a frequency of once per 0 001 s at time δtq fig 7 shows 3d views of the simulated motions of the spheres gravels and free surfaces as shown in fig 7 many gravels displayed long axes directed in the streamwise direction in a manner identical to the imbrication structure the gravel motion was strongly influenced by the shape of the gravel the wall normal distributions of the particle velocities and concentrations in case 1 cf 0 196 are compared in fig 8 and those in case 2 cf 0 444 are shown in fig 9 these simulation velocity profiles were accounted for by averaging the data in domains lx δ y δ z see table 3 in the center of the channel for the water velocity and the volume concentration and in the domains lx 0 01m δ z for the particle velocity respectively sediment discharge concentrations in the center of the channel were measured in the experiment at different levels by using a sampler which had several inlets at different levels in fig 8 the black vertical bars indicate the sediment discharge concentrations measured by the sampler in the experiment the height of the bar is the vertical range of the sampler inlet and the black plot is the center of the inlet similar to the experiment the averaged sediment discharge concentrations in the vertical range of the sampler inlet were measured in the simulation and are represented as green vertical bars in the figures in the case of a sediment discharge concentration of 0 196 the simulated wall normal distribution of the particle velocity of sphere 0 1 s0 was slightly smaller than the measured velocity distribution for sphere 0 the increasing rate of particle velocity that towered at the upper levels increased slightly at z 0 008 m while the corresponding experimental rate gradually decreased over the flow depth the simulation results of gravel 1 1 g1 and gravel 2 1 g2 were almost identical the slight increase in the rate of particle velocity at z 0 008 m was not seen in the gravel simulation while the simulation gravel velocity was slightly greater than the experimental velocity as mentioned there was little difference between the sphere simulation and the gravel simulation however both particle velocity distributions were close to the experimental distributions the wall normal distributions of the particle volume concentrations of the spherical and gravel particles were slightly higher near the bottom and were slightly smaller near the surface than those of their experimental counterparts however both the simulated concentration distributions approximately reproduced the experimental distributions as mentioned in section 4 1 2 the concentrations near the bottom increased when a large grid was selected the relatively large grid of d 4 was assumed to be the reason for the difference in the profiles of the concentrations between the simulation and the experiment additionally the stationary deposited concentration c which was measured in the experiment corresponded to 0 512 and was smaller than the concentrations in the simulation that corresponded to 0 59 and 0 62 see table 2 this implied that the experimental gravel particles displayed jagged shapes the particle model required the presence of many small spheres to imitate gravel particles with jagged shapes which resulted in simulation difficulties owing to the high computational cost involved therefore the simulations of gravel particles could not properly imitate the stationary deposited concentration of the experimental particles which also appeared to cause the differences in the concentration profiles between the experiment and simulation furthermore the simulated energy dissipation of the water almost entirely depended on the smagorinsky model see e w and e w v of case 1 s0 and 1 g2 indicated in fig 16 in section 5 4 where e w is the energy dissipation rate of water and e w v is the energy dissipation rate of water with respect to the gridscale component the difference between them denotes the energy dissipation rate with respect to the subgrid scale turbulence stress estimated based on smagorinsky s model thus the simulated flow depended considerably on the smagorinsky model there is the possibility that the simulation results could reproduce the experimental mixture flows more accurately by selecting a different smagorinsky constant although detailed analyses of the shapes of the particles and the selection of the subgrid scale model have not yet been conducted this study aimed to clearly show the applicability and the limitation of the current apm simulation against hyperconcentrated flows in the experimental case with cf 0 444 the measurements of the wall normal distributions of the particle volume concentrations were not possible owing to sediment sampler clogging thus only the wall normal distributions of particle velocities were compared between simulations and experiments as shown in fig 9 for cf 0 444 the particle velocity of the experiment did not arise near the channel bottom however the particle velocity of the sphere 2 s0 was considerably larger than that of the experiment near the channel bottom which also became larger over the flow depth the particle velocities of gravel 1 2 g1 and gravel 2 2 g2 were smaller near the channel bottom in a similar manner to their experimental counterparts however overall the particle velocity of gravel 2 was considerably smaller than that measured in the experiment the characteristics of the particle velocity distribution of gravel 1 were in good agreement with the experimental results in comparison to the results for sphere 0 and gravel 2 even though the particle velocity slightly increased at z 0 005 in the experiment this minor velocity variation could not be simulated in the case of gravel 1 comparisons between the simulated discharge rates of the water and the particles and their experimental counterparts are shown in fig 10 the simulations involving gravel 1 with an intermediate shape adequately reproduced the water and sediment discharge rates for both cases of cf 0 196 and 0 444 the examinations case 1 case 1 s0 case 1 g1 and case 1 g2 and case 2 case 2 s case 2 g1 and case 2 g2 were carried out under constraints imposed on the computational grid size and the pattern of particle shapes as a result of computational cost however when the shape of gravel 1 was selected the simulation of the distributions of the particle velocities and the discharge rates of the water and the particles were in agreement with those of the experiment moreover the experimental particle velocities and the discharge rates of the water and particles were between those for sphere 0 and gravel 1 therefore there is room to decrease the level of error by fine tuning the shape of the particle apm code was considered to sufficiently predict the dynamics characterized by different values of the average particle concentration since good agreement was obtained under the use of the simulation parameter values for water and the particles that are commonly seen in the field thus based on the above we believe that the accuracy of the simulations using apm are enough to address this study s purpose of examining the effect of particle shapes on mixture flow 5 differences in two phase flows with different particle shapes 5 1 wall normal distributions of stresses differences in the flow dynamics between water sphere mixtures and water gravel mixtures are discussed based on the water and particle stresses predicted from the results of the present irles simulations in this examination the multiphase flow dynamics for the spheres and gravel 2 are discussed gravel 2 had a significantly different shape than a sphere compared to gravel 1 water and particle stresses in a spatially averaged two phase continuum model at a level of x 3 a could be estimated by assuming uniform flow in accordance with eqs 24 and 25 24 σ 33 β x 3 a x 3 a x 3 s ρ β α β g 3 f 3 β d x 3 25 σ 31 β x 3 a x 3 a x 3 s ρ β α β g 1 f 1 β d x 3 where the overline indicates a value that is accounted for by averaging the data in space superscript βidentifies the values of water w and particle p σ ij β is the average stress including turbulence stresses α β is the average volume fraction of water or particles f i β is the interaction force between the water and the particle and f i p is the fluid force exerted by the fluid on the particles while the reaction force exerted on the fluid is f i w f i p f i p was determined as follows at first the force exerted on a single particle f i f defined by eq 12 was divided into forces on subcells f sub i f as follows f sub i f f i f δ v sub v p where δvsub is the volume of the subcell used in the fluid simulation and vp is the volume of a single particle subsequently the value of f i p was obtained by counting up the all of the forces f sub i f of the subcell located in the particles in the domain v δz x y z lx 0 01m δ z and dividing the sum by the volume of the domain v δz the superscript s denotes the water surface value the coordinate systems are presented in fig 7 the predicted wall normal distributions of stresses and the effective friction angles gdr midi 2004 θ f β arctan σ 31 β σ 33 β are indicated in fig 11 armanini et al 2014 reported that the effective friction angle of particles θ f p tends to become constant and equals the static internal friction angle as it approaches the bed similar characteristics of the effective particle friction angles were seen in the simulation results the simulated effective friction angles of particles θ f p at cf 0 196 exceeded those at cf 0 444 the effective friction angles of particles θ f p at cf 0 444 corresponded to approximately 30 and 35 for the spheres and gravels respectively the angles nearly coincided with the static internal friction angles ψμ shown in table 2 which were examined with direct shear test simulations at a high concentration where cf 0 444 the particle shear stress σ 31 p was dominant while the water shear stress σ 31 w was dominant in the flow where cf 0 196 therefore the primary resistance to the flow in higher particle concentrations was not caused by water but was caused by particles and the resistance was strongly affected by the effective friction angles of the particles hence for hyperconcentrated flows at cf 0 444 the discharge rates of water and particles in the case of gravel 2 case 2 g2 became considerably smaller than those in the case of spheres case 2 s0 as shown in fig 10 owing to the different effective friction angles of particles between the spheres and gravels 5 2 sensitivity of the coefficient of the contact forces in simulations with spheres in many investigations of the nmb spheres were used without examining whether simulations could reproduce natural nonspherical particle motion by varying the coefficient of contact forces in the dem method in this section the sensitivity of coefficients of contact forces was examined against the results of simulations on spheres in the examination sphere simulations were performed cases 2 seb and 2 sφp see table 2 in case 2 that used different coefficients of the contact forces compared to those used in case 2 s0 and the simulation results were compared with the results of case 2 s0 case 2 seb selected a much smaller coefficient of restitution than case 2 s0 corresponding to purely inelastic collisions while case 2 sφp selected much higher friction angles of a particle surface case 2 sφp than those in case 2 s0 as no sliding contacts occurred the effect of the coefficient variation of the contact forces on the two phase flow was assumed to be considerable in case 2 at a high concentration cf 0 444 because particle stress was dominant therefore case 2 was selected in this examination 5 2 1 sensitivities of the damping forces the sensitivity of the damping force in the sphere motions was evaluated by comparing the simulation results between case 2 seb which selected extremely small coefficient of restitution and case 2 s0 the simulated wall normal distributions of the sphere velocities and concentrations for case 2 seb and case 2 sφp were shown in fig 12 the simulation results for cases 2 seb fig 12 and 2 s0 fig 9 were almost identical as illustrated in fig 16 the wall normal energy dissipation profiles for both cases 2 s0 and 2 seb were also identical this implied that the energy dissipations of the damping forces in the dem did not significantly influence the entire energy dissipation of particle motion there are two large energy dissipation mechanisms in the dem method the first mechanism involves the damping forces that are modeled in eq 18 the second mechanism involves not recovering strain energies of the tangential directions into the mechanical energies of the particles shear energy dissipation the shear energy dissipations are modeled in eq 16 in eq 16 the contact forces in the tangential directions f t c depend on the contact forces in the normal directions f n c as well as the friction angle of the particle s surface φ p these normal forces depend on the overlap of the contacting particles and are strongly affected by the geometries of the particles the simulation results of cases 2 s0 and 2 seb indicated that the shear energy dissipation played a dominant role in the total energy dissipation of particle collisions 5 2 2 sensitivities of friction sliders the sensitivity of friction sliders in the sphere motions was evaluated by comparing the simulation results between case 2 sφp with an extremely high friction angle for the particle surface related to the friction sliders and case 2 s0 with a general friction angle of a particle surface as shown in case 2 sφp in fig 12 and in case 2 s0 in fig 9 the particle velocities with large friction angles of particle surfaces 2 sφp decreased compared to those in case 2 s0 and were close to the experimental velocities near the surface of the flow however the simulated particle velocities of 2 sφp near the channel bottom became considerably higher than those in the experiment in contrast the profile of the simulated particle velocity of gravel 1 which is shown in fig 9 closely matched the experimental velocity profile the wall normal distributions of the stresses and effective friction angles of case 2 s0 and case 2 sφp are shown in fig 13 although a very large friction angle was used for the particle surface in case 2 sφp the effective friction angle of the particles in case 2 sφp increased by only approximately 2 in comparison to those in case 2 s0 two dimensional dem simulations maeda and hirabayashi 2006 of the biaxial compression test under dry conditions proved that the use of circular cylinders proved difficult in reproducing the internal friction angles ψμ which exceeded values of approximately 30 by only increasing the friction angle of the particle surface φ p in the present study relationships that were almost identical to dry conditions were identified in the three dimensional simulations of fluid particle mixtures the small increases in the effective particle friction angles in case 2 sφp resulted in small decreases in the flow velocities in case 2 sφp fig 12 in comparison to case 2 s0 fig 9 however the effective particle friction angles in case 2 sφp were still smaller than those of gravel as shown in fig 11 case 2 g2 therefore the particle velocities in case 2 sφp were considerably higher than those in the experimental data in the vicinity of the channel bottom which indicated that even if very large friction angles are used the sphere simulations based on the irs strategy are unable to predict large effective friction angles of gravel and water gravel mixture flows 5 3 wall normal distributions of fluid forces on particles in the fluid particle two phase flow models fluid forces on particles are sometimes described by the following equation armanini et al 2014 26 f i p α p σ ji w x j d i where α p is the particle volume fraction and σ ij w is the water stress the first term on the right side corresponds to the buoyancy force including the isotropic stresses and deviatoric stresses of water and the second term corresponds to the drag force dependent on the relative velocity u i w u i p it is difficult to measure the fluid forces on the particles in the experiments and thus the applicability of the above equation should be examined based on the results obtained from the present irles simulations the buoyancy force of the first term in the streamwise direction was neglected in many studies based on the two phase flow models in this study the buoyancy force described by the above equation was computed by using the water stress σ ij w that was predicted in section 5 1 the effect of the buoyancy force in the fluid force was then examined these investigations were performed in the x 1 direction the streamwise direction owing to the uniform flow the buoyancy force in the x 1 direction f 1 b is expressed in accordance with the following equation 27 f 1 b α p σ 31 w x 3 the fluid forces on particles in a unit volume f 1 p which was accounted for by using the results of the irles simulation as described in section 5 1 and the buoyancy forces f 1 b calculated with the above equation are shown in fig 14 the simulation results of sphere 0 and gravel 2 are shown in these figures to demonstrate the effects of the particle shapes on the fluid forces fig 14 shows that in the upper levels where the volume concentrations were smaller than 0 3 as shown in fig 8 case 1 s0 and case 1 g2 the fluid forces on the particles are approximately in agreement with the buoyancy forces computed based on eq 27 the forces were exerted in the upstream direction particles were not able to move with a constant velocity motion without receiving forces in the upstream direction the negative x 1 direction relative to the gravity forces in the streamwise direction the positive x 1 direction the results implied that in order to resist the streamwise gravity force the particles that moved in the upper levels of low volume concentrations were exposed to forces in the upstream direction that were equivalent to the forces exerted on the water of the same volume from the surrounding water as a result of the water shear stress as illustrated in fig 15 the wall normal distributions of the fluid forces in the x 1 direction for spheres and gravel were almost identical for cf 0 196 in contrast for cf 0 444 the fluid forces on gravel were approximately constant with slight variation in the levels of x 3 0 02 m while the fluid forces on spheres increased considerably for levels of x 3 0 005 the velocities of the spheres exceeded those for the gravel near the channel bottom this high velocity reduced the volume concentration of the spheres as shown in fig 9 near the channel bottom thus it was assumed that the water flew quickly through the sphere gaps and exerted considerable drag forces on the spheres near the channel bottom at high water velocities 5 4 wall normal distributions of the energy dissipation rates if the energy dissipation of either the water or particles is large and the accuracy of the simulation of the larger component is not adequate a large error is involved in the multiphase flow simulations additionally energy dissipation rates play considerable roles in generating models of continuum stress egashira et al 1989 therefore understanding the energy dissipation rates of water and particles are important for two phase flows in this study based on the simulation results of spheres and gravel 2 the wall normal distributions of the energy dissipation rates of water and particles are predicted using their respective equations as follows 28 e w v ω τ ij u i x j dv v ω 29 e p v ω i f i c δ δ i δ t p v ω where e w and e p are the energy dissipation rates of the water and the particles in a unit volume respectively v ω is the averaging domain τ ij 2 ν ν t sij is the deviatoric stress of the flow and σ v ω i a is the symbol that denotes the summation of the value of a with respect to the contacts of particles i at the side of the two contacting particles i and j in the averaging domain v ω additionally f i c is the contact force and δ δ i is the relative displacement of the contact point within a time step δt p in eq 29 the inner product f i c δ δ i δ t p is the energy transformation rate between the mechanical energy of the particles and the strain energy of the particle material and it assumes either a positive or a negative value that is influenced by the timing of the measurement however the total value of the inner products of all contacts in the averaging domain becomes positive and denotes the energy dissipation rate in the domain the averaging domain v ω was selected in the center of the flow as e w x y z lx δ y δ z and e p x y z lx 0 1 m 2δ z the simulated wall normal distributions of the energy dissipation rates in case 1 cf 0 196 and case 2 cf 0 444 for sphere 0 and gravel 2 are shown in fig 16 the figure corresponding to case 2 for the spheres also shows the energy dissipation rates of case 2 seb used for the investigation of the effects of the coefficient of the damping force on the energy dissipation rate as mentioned in section 5 2 1 the energy dissipation rates of the water were dominant in case 1 when cf 0 196 in the simulations of the spheres and gravel hence for this concentration the accuracy of the energy dissipation rates of the water significantly affected the accuracies of the simulations of water particle mixture flows in contrast when cf 0 444 the ratio of the particle energy dissipation rate to the total energy dissipation rate increased more than that of case 1 cf 0 196 and the importance of the particle motions increased in regard to the reproducibility of the mixture flow additionally for spheres the energy dissipation of the water and particles became significant near the channel bottom in contrast for gravels the energy dissipation of the water became significant near the water surface the differences in particle shapes led to differences in the energy dissipation mechanisms with concentration increases 6 conclusions in this study irles simulations using the apm code were performed to reproduce the hyperconcentrated water particle mixture flow obtained in the experiments conducted by egashira et al 2001 the experimental cases of the sediment discharge concentrations of cf 0 196 and 0 444 were simulated using spheres and gravel comparisons of the simulation and experimental results indicated that the present apm code using particles of suitable shapes could reproduce wall normal distributions of the particle velocities and discharge rates of water and particles in flows characterized by different sediment discharge concentrations the simulation results were used to predict water and particle stresses and the effective particle friction angles required in two phase flow models the examination indicated that the effective particle friction angle became a constant that equaled the static internal friction angle near the channel bottom where the concentration was high and increased at the upper levels where the particle moved dispersedly at a low concentration for the flow characterized by higher particle concentrations where cf 0 444 the particle shear stress was dominant relative to the water subsequently the effect of the difference in the effective particle friction angles between the spheres and gravel significantly affected the sediment mixture flows this resulted in a significant decrease in the simulated discharge rates of water and gravel particles compared to those in the sphere simulation the wall normal distributions of the energy dissipations of the water and particles were also predicted for the flows where cf 0 196 the energy dissipation rates of the water and the particles were dominant near the channel bottom in the simulations of the spheres and gravel in contrast for highly concentrated flows at cf 0 444 the energy dissipation of both the water and particles in the sphere simulations were also high near the channel bottom conversely in the gravel simulations the particle energy dissipation was also high near the channel bottom however the energy dissipation of water was high near the water surface where the water velocities increased these findings indicated that the effects of the particle shapes on water particle mixture flows increased with concentration increases furthermore simulations relative to other spheres with high concentrations such as cf 0 444 were performed by varying the coefficients of contact forces in the dem method such as the coefficient of restitution related to the damping forces and the friction angles of particle surfaces related to friction sliders these findings indicated that variation in the damping coefficient did not significantly affect the simulation results which implied that energy dissipation owing to shear motion as opposed to the damping energy dissipation were dominant in particle collisions in flows sphere simulations with an extremely high friction angle of particle surfaces resulted in effective particle friction angles of approximately 30 tan30 0 58 but could not reproduce effective gravel friction angles of approximately 35 tan35 0 70 1 2 0 70 0 58 these simulated spheres with increased surface friction moved fast near the channel bottom in comparison to those in the experimental data which were almost stationary near the same region as a result sphere simulations encountered difficulties in predicting the water and nonspherical mixture flows in the field the fluid forces on particles in the streamwise direction the x 1 direction the x 1 axis was parallel to the channel bottom and the streamwise direction were examined based on the simulation results for concentration levels less than 0 3 negative fluid forces were exerted on the particles along the x 1 direction based on buoyancy forces α p σ 31 w x 3 these results indicate the importance of appropriate consideration of drag forces based on relative velocities of water and particles as well as buoyancy forces generated by the isotropic stress and deviatoric stress of water for the fluid force simulations in two phase flow models the aforementioned analysis indicated significant differences between the flows of water sphere mixtures and those from nonspherical particles especially at high concentrations they also indicated that sphere simulations of the irs encountered difficulties in reproducing the natural hyperconcentrated mixture flows of nonspherical particles acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge professor shinji egashira and dr takahiro itoh for sharing their data in

were performed to reproduce hyperconcentrated water particle mixture flows in a laboratory experiment conducted by egashira et al 2001 the flows were simulated at sediment concentrations of 0 196 and

particle velocities in the experiments the study involved an examination of the effects of particle shapes and the coefficients of contact forces coefficients of restitution and friction angles of particle surfaces used in the discrete element method on mixture flows significantly different flows were obtained for spherical and gravel particles under dense conditions whereby the particle shear stress became much greater than that for water the simulations of spheres at different coefficients of contact forces could not adequately represent the mixture flows of nonspherical particles keywords interface resolved large eddy simulation hyperconcentrated flow particle shape stress friction angle fluid force 1 introduction heavy water and sediment runoff due to debris or sediment laden flows during large floods sometimes causes topographical changes and severe sediment disasters to develop countermeasures in anticipation of these types of disasters the development of appropriate prediction methods for these hyperconcentrated flows is required continuum models of fluid particle mixture flows have often been used for simulations of these hyperconcentrated flows e g armanini et al 2014 bagnold 1954 drew 1983 egashira et al 1997 jenkins and hanes 1998 kranenburg et al 2014 meruane and tamburrino 2012 takahashi 1991 continuum models can be classified into single phase flow models e g bagnold 1954 egashira et al 1997 takahashi 1991 and two phase flow models e g armanini et al 2014 drew 1983 jenkins and hanes 1998 kranenburg et al 2014 meruane and tamburrino 2012 the single phase flow models do not distinguish the fluid phase and the sediment phase but treat them as a single multiphase flow while the two phase flow models treat the momentums of the fluid and sediment phases individually despite the single phase models having already been used in many simulations of geophysical flows the two phase models were assumed to better predict complicated flows such those with complicated boundary geometries or severely unsteady flows compared to single phase models however developing appropriate constitutive equations of the stress of the fluid and particles or fluid forces on particles is difficult for example although several constitutive relationships representing particle collision stress were derived by estimating the frequency of collisions based on the strain rate of the particles and the concentration the effect of a particle s shape was not theoretically considered furthermore it is difficult to experimentally measure the forces on the fluid and the particles even in cases of uniform flows thus more appropriate constitutive equations of the stress and the fluid force are required for the two phase models numerical investigations of the dynamic mechanisms of fluid particle mixture flows increased when fluid flow simulations and individual particle simulations generated using the discrete element method dem

2014 these numerical simulations are referred to as numerical movable bed nmb simulations in the remainder of this manuscript a numerical methodology gotoh and sakai 1997 in the early stage of the nmb employed drag coefficients to simulate fluid forces however extreme difficulty remained in selecting a suitable drag coefficient to represent dense particle motion this required the development of nmb based on high accuracy simulations in numerical investigation of the dynamics of the fluid particle multiphase flow interface resolved euler lagrange simulations irs have been developed kajishima et al 2001 ushijima et al 2008 wherein flow motions around solid objects were adequately simulated in the eulerian approach using computational grids smaller than the objects while solid objects were simulated with the lagrangian approach using the dem method several studies have demonstrated the efficiency of this strategy in multiphase flow simulations the irs can directly simulate fluid forces from flow motions surrounding objects without drag coefficients recently increases in computational efficiency have led to an investigation of the dynamics of water sediment mixture flows using irs fukuda and fukuoka 2014 fukuoka et al 2014 harada and gotoh 2013 ji et al 2014 kidanemariam and uhlmann 2014 vowinckel et al 2014 the irs is able to be classified into interface resolved direct

gotoh 2013 irdns directly simulates the flow motion around particles without employing the turbulence model irles models the subgrid scale turbulence and directly simulates large eddies greater than the grid scale that are produced by the particles irdns requires smaller computational grids than those in irles and it has a larger computational cost thus for investigation of fluid particle interactions with a high reynolds number where the flow around the particles is severely disturbed irles is a more effective tool with respect to the computational cost for geophysical flows the shape of the nonspherical particles is considered to play a significant role in flow dynamics in a study of dem simulations under dry conditions matsushima et al 2009 reported that particle shapes have considerable influence on the repose angle maeda and hirabayashi 2006 performed two dimensional biaxial compression simulations and found that it is difficult to reproduce noncircular particle motions with a cylinder even if the friction angles of the particle surfaces vary despite this most nmb simulations employ spheres without sufficient examination into whether these types of simulations are able to represent the mixture of nonspherical particles to investigate the mixture flow dynamics of nonspherical particles by irs sufficient validations have to be performed against the hyperconcentrated flows of nonspherical particles using data such as the wall normal distributions of the particle velocities and the particle concentrations it is also necessary to examine the effect of particle shapes on flow configurations impacting the simulation results and to assess whether sphere simulations are able to reproduce mixtures of nonspherical particles by only varying the coefficient of contact forces that are used in the dem method in a study by fukuoka et al 2014 a numerical simulation code arbitrary particle multiphase apm was developed based on irles the apm simulated fluid and arbitrarily shaped particle mixture flows validation of the apm was conducted fukuoka et al 2014 using experimental data in which real size gravel flowed in a stream on a 45 m long large concrete fixed bed channel the vertical distribution of the particle velocities simulated using apm agreed well with the experimental results however the particle concentration of the flow was approximately 2 which was too small in the present study the validation of the apm code against hyperconcentrated fluid and nonspherical particle mixture flows was examined the apm simulation was performed to reproduce the hyperconcentrated flows that were demonstrated in a laboratory experiment by egashira et al 2001 in which valuable hyperconcentrated flow data were measured at different concentrations both spheres and gravel shaped particles were used in the simulations validation of the apm code was examined based on comparisons of the simulations to the experimental data with respect to the water and particle discharge rates the wall normal distributions of the particle velocities and the concentrations for the simulations of spheres different coefficients of damping forces and friction sliders were used in the dem method to determine whether the sphere simulations could reproduce water and nonspherical particle mixture flows furthermore differences in the mixture flow dynamics between spheres and gravels were discussed by predicting the water and particle stresses fluid forces on particles and energy dissipation rates that are necessary for two phase flow models 2 hyperconcentrated flow experiments egashira et al 2001 conducted experiments on uniform hyperconcentrated flows at sediment discharge concentrations cf that ranged from 0 141 to 0 444 cf q p q w q p where q w and q p are the discharge rates per unit width of the water and particles respectively which measured the important dynamic properties of water particle mixture flows a rectangular open channel 12 m long 0 1 m wide with a bed slope θ of 19 was used in the experiment fine gravel 0 00218 m in diameter an internal friction angle of 38 7 a stationary volume concentration of 0 512 and a sediment particle specific gravity of 2 62 was used in the experiment the same material was fixed to the bed to create a rough surface water was supplied at a constant rate from upstream and fine gravel was fed into a section that was 6 m away from the channel end water and sediment discharge were measured by sampling the water sediment mixture at the downstream end the wall normal distributions of particle velocities were photographed using video cameras from one side of the channel which were measured using image analyses the wall normal distributions of the gravel concentrations were also measured using a sampler that had several inlets at different levels 3 numerical methods in this study the numerical simulation code apm fukuoka et al 2014 was used this code is capable of simulating the three dimensional motion of fluid and particles with different shapes in a simulation of the fluid motion particles were considered to be liquids with different densities all the domains of fluids and particles were simulated using the governing equations of a single fluid model for incompressible solid liquid multiphase flow in the eulerian approach gravel particles consisted of several small superimposed spheres their motions were simulated using rigid bodies based on the lagrangian approach simulations of uniform flows were often performed by not considering the variation of the free surface kidanemariam and uhlmann 2014 ji et al 2014 stoesser 2010 vowinckel et al 2014 however with respect to the target experimental flow in this study the ratio of the flow depth to the particle diameter hm d was considerably small at most 11 9 case 2 see table 1 this implied that the free surface continued to be disturbed owing to the distribution of the moving particles to directly take into account the effect of the disturbed free surface on the motion of the fluid and the particles free surface variation was simulated in this study 3 1 numerical method of fluid motions fluid motions were simulated using the governing equations of a single fluid model for solid liquid multiphase flows to perform the irles the smagorinsky model was used as the subgrid scale turbulence model which was additionally introduced to the single fluid model in literature based on the irdns ushijima et al 2008 as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j g i 1 ρ p x i x j 2 ν ν t s ij 3 s ij 1 2 u i x j u j x i 4 ν μ ρ 5 ν t c s δ 2 2 s ij s ij where ui is the ith component of the weighted average velocity including the particles ρ and μ are the volume averaged density and viscosity respectively gi is the gravitational acceleration p is the sum of the pressure and isotropic component of sgs stresses and sij is the strain rate tensor in addition cs is the smagorinsky constant and δ is the computational grid size germano et al 1991 developed a subgrid scale eddy viscosity model that dynamically determined the value of cs however the model assumed flows in which no particles existed and thus the applicability of this model to fluid particle mixture flows remains uncertain thus as a basic first stage examination of irles a constant cs value was selected in this study simulations of the above equations were performed using the finite difference method of a simplified marker and cell smac scheme on a staggered grid arrangement the first order differencing scheme was applied to the time derivatives and the third order upwind differencing scheme was applied to the advection term of eq 2 the grid averages of ρ and ui were computed using the subcells located in a grid as follows see fig 1 6 ρ sub f ρ β sub f 1 7 u i sub f ρ β u i β sub f ρ where sub f a denotes the summation notation for a at every subcell center in the grid the superscripts β are assigned to the symbols w or p when the center of the subcell is located in the water or in the particles respectively the superscripts w or p denote the values of the water and the particles respectively equivalently u i w is the water velocity and u i w was substituted by the ui which was accounted for at previous time step by solving equations of the continuity and the momentum u i p is the particle velocity at the center of the subcell which is computed in accordance with the following equation 8 u i p r i g ε ijk ω j r k s where r i g is the velocity vector at the center of the rigid body that includes the subcell ε ijk is the levi civita symbol ω i is the angular velocity of the rigid body and r i s is the position vector from the center of the gravity of the rigid body to the center of the subcell the particle motions affected by the fluid and the contact forces are reflected in the fluid flow simulation through using eqs 6 and 7 at every time step the free surface variation was simulated using the continuity equation of the fluid volume fraction α f based on the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 as follows 9 α f t α f u i x i 0 the donor acceptor flux approximation hirt and nichols 1981 was used for the computation of the above equation the gas phase was not solved in this simulation the boundary conditions for the fluid velocity and the pressure are schematically shown in fig 2 at a specific velocity computational point that neighbors a grid with a volume fraction 0 α f 1 the momentum equation eq 2 was solved to estimate the velocity u t cal parallel to the free surface and the velocity u n cal normal to the free surface which was included in the fluid the momentum equation was not solved for the velocity u n bound normal to the free surface which was not included in the fluid the velocity boundary condition of u n bound normal to the free surface was specified such that ui xi 0 in the grid that included the free surface a boundary condition of u t bound parallel to the free surface was given so that the strain rate was zero for example in the case where the direction of the free surface matched that depicted in fig 2 the boundary condition was given in such a way to satisfy the relationship of u 1 x 2 u 2 x 1 0 at point a additionally the pressure was only computed at point p cal at which point the volume fraction was α f 1 the boundary condition of the pressure p bound with a volume fraction 0 α f 1 was defined in such a way that the pressure at the free surface was equal to zero this estimation was executed by referring to the neighboring pressure at α f 1 and by assuming that the pressure distribution was linear even though particles sometimes reached the free surface in the simulation of the hyperconcentrated flow in this study the number of these particles was small and the simulation was assumed to predict the flow configuration by using the boundary conditions described above thus no special treatment was applied to account for the boundary condition between the solid and gas phases 3 2 numerical method of particle motion gravel shaped particles were modeled by superposing several small spheres that did not have any gaps matsushima et al 2009 this model can represent naturally shaped round gravel particles with a small number of spheres therefore this gravel model has the advantage in simulations of hyperconcentrated fluid particle mixture flows because it suppresses the computational cost by using a small number of elements in the representation of each gravel particle in the apm code fukuoka et al 2014 gravel motion was simulated based on the following momentum and angular momentum equations 10 m r i g m g i f i f f i c 11 ω i i i j 1 r j i t i f t i c ε j k l ω k i l m ω m where index i denotes the components of the global coordinate system fixed on the space the indices i m denote the components of the local coordinate system fixed on a rigid body m is the mass of a particle r i g is the position of the center of gravity of the rigid body ω i is the angular velocity fi is the force acting on the surface of the particle and ti is the torque on the center of the gravity generated by the force the superscripts f and c are the components of the fluid forces and contact forces between particles respectively gi is the gravitational acceleration i i j 1 is the inverse of the matrix consisting of the components of the moment of inertia tensor in the local coordinate system r j i is equal to e j e i e j and e i are unit basis vectors and ε j k l is the levi civita symbol the basis vectors e i fixed on the rigid body for the next time step were computed by using the angular velocity for the next time step solved by eq 11 and the time step δt p the positions of the small spheres in the next time step with respect to the global coordinate system were computed using the initial components of the positions of the small spheres in the local coordinate system the basis vectors e i that were computed at every time step and the center of gravity of the rigid body r i g that was estimated based on eq 10 quaternion was used for the rotation of the basis vector e i and for the coordinate transformation between the global and the local coordinate systems using r j i ushijima et al 2008 the second order adams bashforth scheme was applied to the time integral of the velocity and angular velocity of the gravel particle 3 3 numerical method of fluid forces acting on particles ushijima et al 2008 developed a numerical simulation method in the framework of irdns the method accounted for the fluid force acting on a particle by the volume integral of the forces on the particle region in the multiphase fluid whereby the volume integral was performed by using subcells in the apm code that was based on irles the fluid force acting on a particle was accounted for by the volume integral of the forces owing to the grid scale and subgrid scale stresses in the multiphase fluid simulation as follows 12 f i f sub p p x i ρ x j 2 ν ν t s ij δ v sub 13 t i f sub p ε ijk r j f p x k ρ x l 2 ν ν t s kl δ v sub where f i f and t i f are the ith components of a fluid force and the torque exerted on a particle respectively additionally r i f is the position vector from the particle s center of gravity to the center of the subcell while sub p a denotes the summation of values a at the center of the subcell for each subcell inside the gravel and δvsub is the volume of the subcell 3 4 numerical method of the contact forces the contact forces are simulated using the dem method for each small sphere composing the gravel particles the contact candidate paring of the grid based on the sorted particle index method pgs and the force simulation referencing the contact pair table method fsc which were developed by nishiura and sakaguchi 2011 were used for simulations of the contact detection and the contact force respectively the computations of the contact forces were performed when the distance between the centers of the two small spheres d ij satisfied the relationship of d ij r i r j where r i and r j are the radii of the small spheres i and j respectively the contact forces exerted on the small spheres were accounted for by using springs dampers and friction sliders as follows cundall and strack 1979 14 f i v f i e f i d 15 f n c max f n v 0 16 f t c sign f t v min f t v f n c tan φ p 17 f i e n 1 f i e n k i n δ δ i n 18 f i d n 1 c i n δ δ i n δ t p where i denotes the components that correspond to the unit basis vector e i of the local coordinate system which is defined in consideration of the positions of the two small spheres i and j that are in contact see fig 3 components of the normal direction and the two orthogonal directions on the tangential plane were denoted using the indices n indicated as 1 in fig 3 and t indicated as 2 3 in fig 3 respectively f i v f i e f i d and f i c are the components of the contact forces that are computed at each contact point in this case f i v is the force estimated based on the voigt model which considers only a spring and a damping force f i e is the elastic force f i d is the damping force and f i c is the contact force of the two small spheres obtained by considering the spring the damper and the frictional slider f c f i c e i represents the force exerted on sphere j by sphere i additionally φ p is the friction angle of a particle surface k is the spring constant and c is the damping coefficient furthermore δ δ i is the relative displacement which is defined as δ δ i δ x i δ x j e i where δ x i and δ x j are the displacements of the contact points for time step δt p respectively the superscripts n in the parentheses denote the time step of the simulation the spring constant k is derived using a linear approximation tsuji et al 1992 based on the hertzian contact theory the damping coefficient c is linked to the coefficient of restitution eb under the assumption that the contact motion corresponds to the damping oscillation tsuji et al 1993 as follows 19 k n 4 9 r i r j r i r j e 1 ν p 2 2 f n e 1 3 20 s 0 k

spheres 3 5 flow around a fixed sphere in a uniform stream in accordance with the canonical validation of the flow simulation the three dimensional flow around a fixed sphere was simulated using different grid sizes the computational setup is shown in fig 4 grid sizes of δ d 2 d 4 and d 8 were selected where d is the diameter of the sphere in this simulation the gravitational term the first term on the right side of eq 2 was not counted and only non static pressure was simulated the ratio ρ p ρ w 2 62 the simulations were performed at red ud ν 1 10 100 1000 10 000 by varying the flow velocity u and the kinematic viscosity ν the drag coefficients cd computed by the simulated fluid force are shown in fig 5 the adopted approximation c d 24 r e d 6 1 r e d 0 4 white and frank 2006 is also shown in the figure the drag coefficients estimated by the simulation of d 2 d 4 and d 8 agreed well with the approximation specifically little difference between the drag coefficients d 4 and d 8 was observed however vorticity shedding in the wake of the sphere was not observed even at red 10 000 for d 4 conversely such phenomena were observed at red 1000 or more in the case of d 8 a simulation of hyperconcentrated flow using the d 4 grids case 2 g2 as discussed in section 4 2 took approximately 1 month to complete using a cluster system at chuo university 6 nodes 2 cpu node cpu intel xeon e5 2690 v3 thus even for the d 4 grid the simulations of hyperconcentrated flows require considerable computational cost if a grid size of d 8 is selected the implementation of plural simulations of hyperconcentrated flows required in this study becomes difficult with respect to the simulations of hyperconcentrated flows using d 4 grids there is the possibility that the simulation can reproduce the configuration of hyperconcentrated flows since vorticity is assumed to be shed from complicated arrangements of moving and dispersed particles therefore in section 4 1 the influence of the grid size on the simulations of the hyperconcentrated flows was examined subsequently we chose the computational grid size for the assessment of the effects of particle shapes and the coefficients of contact forces used in dem on the motions of fluid particle mixtures 4 validation of the numerical simulations via hyperconcentrated flow experiments 4 1 simulations of hyperconcentrated flows at different grid sizes an examination of the effect of particle shapes on hyperconcentrated flows in this study required the execution of plural simulations with apm under different particle shapes and concentrations the selection of small computational grids caused considerable difficulty in achieving the aims of this study owing to the significant computational cost therefore before the execution of simulations with different particle shapes and concentrations simulations with different computation grids were performed as a preliminary test and the influence of the grid size on the simulated flow configuration of the fluid particle mixture was examined 4 1 1 computational setup simulations of hyperconcentrated flows in case 1 sediment discharge concentration cf 0 196 depth 0 0139 m see table 1 measured by egashira et al 2001 were performed using the apm code grid sizes of d 2 case 1 s0 d 2 d 4 case 1 s0 d 4 and d 8 case 1 s0 d 8 were selected sphere 0 was used in these simulations as shown in table 2 the width and bed slope of the numerical channel were respectively set to 0 1 m and 19 which matched those in the experiment periodic conditions in the flow direction were applied to simulate uniform flow in the experiment the same particles as those supplied to the flume were fixed at the bottom of the numerical channel in the simulation similar to the experimental setup spheres of the same size as those used for the supplied particles were fixed at the bottom of the numerical channel and were ordered in a zigzag arrangement without overwraps the apm code did not account for the computation of shear force between the spheres and the plane additionally the particles were not fixed to the sidewalls in the experiment and the aspect ratios b hm b is the width of the flume hm is the flow depth case 1 7 2 case 2 3 9 were relatively large thus the friction at the bottom of the channel was the dominant imposing resistance to the flow and the influence of the sidewall friction was assumed to be small therefore the slip condition was adopted for the sidewall a length of the numerical channel of 1 m was selected for case 1 lx hm 72 and for case 2 lx hm 39 where lx is the streamwise length of the computation domain and hm is the depth of the flow as indicated in table 3 the length was determined as a sufficiently long channel by referring to previous studies which applied the periodic condition in the flow direction lx hm 3 and only les simulations of flow were conducted on a bed with realistic roughness stoesser 2010 and lx hm 24 whereby the nmb simulation was conducted based on the irdns vowinckel et al 2014 the cartesian coordinates x x 1 y x 2 and z x 3 corresponded to the streamwise spanwise and wall normal directions respectively under the initial conditions water and particles were supplied into the numerical channel such that the water levels were equal to the experimental water levels particles were arranged at regular intervals in the channel and the particle volume concentrations were equal to the experimental discharge concentrations the initial velocities of the water and the particles were defined as the bulk velocities vm of the experiment see table 1 the parameters used in the simulations are shown in table 4 the values selected in the simulation namely the friction angle of a particle surface φ p 26 6 the coefficient of restitution eb 0 7 the elastic modulus and the poisson s ratio were the same as the values selected in a previous study fukuoka et al 2014 so that the apm simulation reproduced real scale gravel motions in a stream a simulation time of 1 5 s was selected so that the initial transient had almost ended the end of the initial transient was examined using an index δ q β c t t sim q t 2 β q t 1 β δ t q q t 1 β which indicates the variation rates of the discharge rate of water and particles where superscript β denotes the values of water w and particles p tsim is the elapsed simulation time ct 0 1 is a coefficient that determines the ratio of the time needed to evaluate the variation of the discharge to tsim and the subscripts t1 and t2 t2 t1 indicate the times when the values were measured additionally δtq δtq t2 t1 was set to 0 5 s the variables q t 1 β and q t 2 β were accounted for by averaging the data which were output at a frequency of once per 0 02 s for the time δtq at the end of the simulation tsim 1 5 s q w and q p fell below the values of 0 010 and 0 077 respectively 4 1 2 influence of grid size on the simulation of fluid particle multiphase flows distribution of the vorticity in the spanwise direction in the center of the channel at the final simulation time t 1 5 s is shown in fig 6 these figures show that the vorticity in the vicinity of the bottom of the channel became dominant in the case of the simulations using d 4 and d 8 since the particles move actively there in contrast in the simulation of d 2 the vorticity decreased in the vicinity of the bottom part of the channel since numerous particles occupied this region and were larger at the upper levels of the high concentration layer at a level of approximately z 0 01 m these results lead to the conclusion that it became difficult for simulated particles to disperse near the bottom and to move when a relatively large grid size is used with respect to the particle size a selection of smaller grid sizes is desirable for increased simulation accuracy however the computational cost of the simulation at a grid size of d 8 was too large to perform plural simulations the computational time was approximately two weeks using 8 computer nodes for 1 s0 d 8 in this study a grid size of d 4 was selected to examine the effects of particle shapes and coefficients of contact forces on simulated fluid particle mixture flows this grid size was chosen by considering following results the fluid forces on a sphere simulated using a grid size of d 4 under a wide range of reynolds numbers see section 3 5 simulations of the hyperconcentrated flows using d 4 agreed with the experimental particle velocity see section 4 2 and the particles in the d 4 simulation moved dispersedly in a similar manner to those in the case of the d 8 simulation while the motion in the d 2 case could not be simulated as shown in fig 6 the computational cost of irles is generally very large this constituted a major issue in the examination of larger scale fluid particle interactions that involved bed waves this study examined how these simulations predict the hyperconcentrated flows of nonspherical particles by varying the particle shapes and the coefficient of contact forces and the applicability and the limitation of the irles at the relatively large grid size of d 4 was also clearly shown this examination is presumed to contribute to the simulations of large scale fluid particle mixture flows using irles 4 2 simulations of hyperconcentrated flows with different particle shapes simulations of the apm were performed to reproduce the hyperconcentrated flow which was measured in the experiment conducted by egashira et al 2001 to examine the validation of the model in different sediment discharge concentrations the simulation model was applied to two experimental cases of different sediment discharge concentrations case 1 sediment discharge concentration of cf 0 196 depth 0 0139 m case 2 cf 0 444 depth 0 0259 m see table 1 herein the computational grid size of d 4 was selected three particle shapes namely sphere 0 gravel 1 and gravel 2 were used in the simulations as illustrated in table 2 gravels 1 and 2 consisted of nine small spheres and the shape of gravel 1 was closer to a sphere than gravel 2 the size of gravel particles was defined as the diameter of spheres with the same volume the same boundary and initial conditions were given as those described in section 4 1 1 the simulation time was selected as tsim 2 s in case 1 and tsim 10 s in case 2 so that the initial transient had almost ended at the end of the simulation the indices q w q p the definition is described in section 4 1 1 which indicates the variation in the discharge rates of the water or particles fell below 0 0086 and 0 024 in case 1 1 s0 1 g1 1 g2 and 0 11 and 0 15 in case 2 2 s0 2 g1 2 g2 respectively moreover the time difference δtq used for computing the variation rate of discharge was selected as 0 5 s for case 1 and 1 0 s for case 2 the values q t 1 β and q t 2 β used in the computation of the indices were accounted for by averaging the data and they were output at a frequency of once per 0 001 s at time δtq fig 7 shows 3d views of the simulated motions of the spheres gravels and free surfaces as shown in fig 7 many gravels displayed long axes directed in the streamwise direction in a manner identical to the imbrication structure the gravel motion was strongly influenced by the shape of the gravel the wall normal distributions of the particle velocities and concentrations in case 1 cf 0 196 are compared in fig 8 and those in case 2 cf 0 444 are shown in fig 9 these simulation velocity profiles were accounted for by averaging the data in domains lx δ y δ z see table 3 in the center of the channel for the water velocity and the volume concentration and in the domains lx 0 01m δ z for the particle velocity respectively sediment discharge concentrations in the center of the channel were measured in the experiment at different levels by using a sampler which had several inlets at different levels in fig 8 the black vertical bars indicate the sediment discharge concentrations measured by the sampler in the experiment the height of the bar is the vertical range of the sampler inlet and the black plot is the center of the inlet similar to the experiment the averaged sediment discharge concentrations in the vertical range of the sampler inlet were measured in the simulation and are represented as green vertical bars in the figures in the case of a sediment discharge concentration of 0 196 the simulated wall normal distribution of the particle velocity of sphere 0 1 s0 was slightly smaller than the measured velocity distribution for sphere 0 the increasing rate of particle velocity that towered at the upper levels increased slightly at z 0 008 m while the corresponding experimental rate gradually decreased over the flow depth the simulation results of gravel 1 1 g1 and gravel 2 1 g2 were almost identical the slight increase in the rate of particle velocity at z 0 008 m was not seen in the gravel simulation while the simulation gravel velocity was slightly greater than the experimental velocity as mentioned there was little difference between the sphere simulation and the gravel simulation however both particle velocity distributions were close to the experimental distributions the wall normal distributions of the particle volume concentrations of the spherical and gravel particles were slightly higher near the bottom and were slightly smaller near the surface than those of their experimental counterparts however both the simulated concentration distributions approximately reproduced the experimental distributions as mentioned in section 4 1 2 the concentrations near the bottom increased when a large grid was selected the relatively large grid of d 4 was assumed to be the reason for the difference in the profiles of the concentrations between the simulation and the experiment additionally the stationary deposited concentration c which was measured in the experiment corresponded to 0 512 and was smaller than the concentrations in the simulation that corresponded to 0 59 and 0 62 see table 2 this implied that the experimental gravel particles displayed jagged shapes the particle model required the presence of many small spheres to imitate gravel particles with jagged shapes which resulted in simulation difficulties owing to the high computational cost involved therefore the simulations of gravel particles could not properly imitate the stationary deposited concentration of the experimental particles which also appeared to cause the differences in the concentration profiles between the experiment and simulation furthermore the simulated energy dissipation of the water almost entirely depended on the smagorinsky model see e w and e w v of case 1 s0 and 1 g2 indicated in fig 16 in section 5 4 where e w is the energy dissipation rate of water and e w v is the energy dissipation rate of water with respect to the gridscale component the difference between them denotes the energy dissipation rate with respect to the subgrid scale turbulence stress estimated based on smagorinsky s model thus the simulated flow depended considerably on the smagorinsky model there is the possibility that the simulation results could reproduce the experimental mixture flows more accurately by selecting a different smagorinsky constant although detailed analyses of the shapes of the particles and the selection of the subgrid scale model have not yet been conducted this study aimed to clearly show the applicability and the limitation of the current apm simulation against hyperconcentrated flows in the experimental case with cf 0 444 the measurements of the wall normal distributions of the particle volume concentrations were not possible owing to sediment sampler clogging thus only the wall normal distributions of particle velocities were compared between simulations and experiments as shown in fig 9 for cf 0 444 the particle velocity of the experiment did not arise near the channel bottom however the particle velocity of the sphere 2 s0 was considerably larger than that of the experiment near the channel bottom which also became larger over the flow depth the particle velocities of gravel 1 2 g1 and gravel 2 2 g2 were smaller near the channel bottom in a similar manner to their experimental counterparts however overall the particle velocity of gravel 2 was considerably smaller than that measured in the experiment the characteristics of the particle velocity distribution of gravel 1 were in good agreement with the experimental results in comparison to the results for sphere 0 and gravel 2 even though the particle velocity slightly increased at z 0 005 in the experiment this minor velocity variation could not be simulated in the case of gravel 1 comparisons between the simulated discharge rates of the water and the particles and their experimental counterparts are shown in fig 10 the simulations involving gravel 1 with an intermediate shape adequately reproduced the water and sediment discharge rates for both cases of cf 0 196 and 0 444 the examinations case 1 case 1 s0 case 1 g1 and case 1 g2 and case 2 case 2 s case 2 g1 and case 2 g2 were carried out under constraints imposed on the computational grid size and the pattern of particle shapes as a result of computational cost however when the shape of gravel 1 was selected the simulation of the distributions of the particle velocities and the discharge rates of the water and the particles were in agreement with those of the experiment moreover the experimental particle velocities and the discharge rates of the water and particles were between those for sphere 0 and gravel 1 therefore there is room to decrease the level of error by fine tuning the shape of the particle apm code was considered to sufficiently predict the dynamics characterized by different values of the average particle concentration since good agreement was obtained under the use of the simulation parameter values for water and the particles that are commonly seen in the field thus based on the above we believe that the accuracy of the simulations using apm are enough to address this study s purpose of examining the effect of particle shapes on mixture flow 5 differences in two phase flows with different particle shapes 5 1 wall normal distributions of stresses differences in the flow dynamics between water sphere mixtures and water gravel mixtures are discussed based on the water and particle stresses predicted from the results of the present irles simulations in this examination the multiphase flow dynamics for the spheres and gravel 2 are discussed gravel 2 had a significantly different shape than a sphere compared to gravel 1 water and particle stresses in a spatially averaged two phase continuum model at a level of x 3 a could be estimated by assuming uniform flow in accordance with eqs 24 and 25 24 σ 33 β x 3 a x 3 a x 3 s ρ β α β g 3 f 3 β d x 3 25 σ 31 β x 3 a x 3 a x 3 s ρ β α β g 1 f 1 β d x 3 where the overline indicates a value that is accounted for by averaging the data in space superscript βidentifies the values of water w and particle p σ ij β is the average stress including turbulence stresses α β is the average volume fraction of water or particles f i β is the interaction force between the water and the particle and f i p is the fluid force exerted by the fluid on the particles while the reaction force exerted on the fluid is f i w f i p f i p was determined as follows at first the force exerted on a single particle f i f defined by eq 12 was divided into forces on subcells f sub i f as follows f sub i f f i f δ v sub v p where δvsub is the volume of the subcell used in the fluid simulation and vp is the volume of a single particle subsequently the value of f i p was obtained by counting up the all of the forces f sub i f of the subcell located in the particles in the domain v δz x y z lx 0 01m δ z and dividing the sum by the volume of the domain v δz the superscript s denotes the water surface value the coordinate systems are presented in fig 7 the predicted wall normal distributions of stresses and the effective friction angles gdr midi 2004 θ f β arctan σ 31 β σ 33 β are indicated in fig 11 armanini et al 2014 reported that the effective friction angle of particles θ f p tends to become constant and equals the static internal friction angle as it approaches the bed similar characteristics of the effective particle friction angles were seen in the simulation results the simulated effective friction angles of particles θ f p at cf 0 196 exceeded those at cf 0 444 the effective friction angles of particles θ f p at cf 0 444 corresponded to approximately 30 and 35 for the spheres and gravels respectively the angles nearly coincided with the static internal friction angles ψμ shown in table 2 which were examined with direct shear test simulations at a high concentration where cf 0 444 the particle shear stress σ 31 p was dominant while the water shear stress σ 31 w was dominant in the flow where cf 0 196 therefore the primary resistance to the flow in higher particle concentrations was not caused by water but was caused by particles and the resistance was strongly affected by the effective friction angles of the particles hence for hyperconcentrated flows at cf 0 444 the discharge rates of water and particles in the case of gravel 2 case 2 g2 became considerably smaller than those in the case of spheres case 2 s0 as shown in fig 10 owing to the different effective friction angles of particles between the spheres and gravels 5 2 sensitivity of the coefficient of the contact forces in simulations with spheres in many investigations of the nmb spheres were used without examining whether simulations could reproduce natural nonspherical particle motion by varying the coefficient of contact forces in the dem method in this section the sensitivity of coefficients of contact forces was examined against the results of simulations on spheres in the examination sphere simulations were performed cases 2 seb and 2 sφp see table 2 in case 2 that used different coefficients of the contact forces compared to those used in case 2 s0 and the simulation results were compared with the results of case 2 s0 case 2 seb selected a much smaller coefficient of restitution than case 2 s0 corresponding to purely inelastic collisions while case 2 sφp selected much higher friction angles of a particle surface case 2 sφp than those in case 2 s0 as no sliding contacts occurred the effect of the coefficient variation of the contact forces on the two phase flow was assumed to be considerable in case 2 at a high concentration cf 0 444 because particle stress was dominant therefore case 2 was selected in this examination 5 2 1 sensitivities of the damping forces the sensitivity of the damping force in the sphere motions was evaluated by comparing the simulation results between case 2 seb which selected extremely small coefficient of restitution and case 2 s0 the simulated wall normal distributions of the sphere velocities and concentrations for case 2 seb and case 2 sφp were shown in fig 12 the simulation results for cases 2 seb fig 12 and 2 s0 fig 9 were almost identical as illustrated in fig 16 the wall normal energy dissipation profiles for both cases 2 s0 and 2 seb were also identical this implied that the energy dissipations of the damping forces in the dem did not significantly influence the entire energy dissipation of particle motion there are two large energy dissipation mechanisms in the dem method the first mechanism involves the damping forces that are modeled in eq 18 the second mechanism involves not recovering strain energies of the tangential directions into the mechanical energies of the particles shear energy dissipation the shear energy dissipations are modeled in eq 16 in eq 16 the contact forces in the tangential directions f t c depend on the contact forces in the normal directions f n c as well as the friction angle of the particle s surface φ p these normal forces depend on the overlap of the contacting particles and are strongly affected by the geometries of the particles the simulation results of cases 2 s0 and 2 seb indicated that the shear energy dissipation played a dominant role in the total energy dissipation of particle collisions 5 2 2 sensitivities of friction sliders the sensitivity of friction sliders in the sphere motions was evaluated by comparing the simulation results between case 2 sφp with an extremely high friction angle for the particle surface related to the friction sliders and case 2 s0 with a general friction angle of a particle surface as shown in case 2 sφp in fig 12 and in case 2 s0 in fig 9 the particle velocities with large friction angles of particle surfaces 2 sφp decreased compared to those in case 2 s0 and were close to the experimental velocities near the surface of the flow however the simulated particle velocities of 2 sφp near the channel bottom became considerably higher than those in the experiment in contrast the profile of the simulated particle velocity of gravel 1 which is shown in fig 9 closely matched the experimental velocity profile the wall normal distributions of the stresses and effective friction angles of case 2 s0 and case 2 sφp are shown in fig 13 although a very large friction angle was used for the particle surface in case 2 sφp the effective friction angle of the particles in case 2 sφp increased by only approximately 2 in comparison to those in case 2 s0 two dimensional dem simulations maeda and hirabayashi 2006 of the biaxial compression test under dry conditions proved that the use of circular cylinders proved difficult in reproducing the internal friction angles ψμ which exceeded values of approximately 30 by only increasing the friction angle of the particle surface φ p in the present study relationships that were almost identical to dry conditions were identified in the three dimensional simulations of fluid particle mixtures the small increases in the effective particle friction angles in case 2 sφp resulted in small decreases in the flow velocities in case 2 sφp fig 12 in comparison to case 2 s0 fig 9 however the effective particle friction angles in case 2 sφp were still smaller than those of gravel as shown in fig 11 case 2 g2 therefore the particle velocities in case 2 sφp were considerably higher than those in the experimental data in the vicinity of the channel bottom which indicated that even if very large friction angles are used the sphere simulations based on the irs strategy are unable to predict large effective friction angles of gravel and water gravel mixture flows 5 3 wall normal distributions of fluid forces on particles in the fluid particle two phase flow models fluid forces on particles are sometimes described by the following equation armanini et al 2014 26 f i p α p σ ji w x j d i where α p is the particle volume fraction and σ ij w is the water stress the first term on the right side corresponds to the buoyancy force including the isotropic stresses and deviatoric stresses of water and the second term corresponds to the drag force dependent on the relative velocity u i w u i p it is difficult to measure the fluid forces on the particles in the experiments and thus the applicability of the above equation should be examined based on the results obtained from the present irles simulations the buoyancy force of the first term in the streamwise direction was neglected in many studies based on the two phase flow models in this study the buoyancy force described by the above equation was computed by using the water stress σ ij w that was predicted in section 5 1 the effect of the buoyancy force in the fluid force was then examined these investigations were performed in the x 1 direction the streamwise direction owing to the uniform flow the buoyancy force in the x 1 direction f 1 b is expressed in accordance with the following equation 27 f 1 b α p σ 31 w x 3 the fluid forces on particles in a unit volume f 1 p which was accounted for by using the results of the irles simulation as described in section 5 1 and the buoyancy forces f 1 b calculated with the above equation are shown in fig 14 the simulation results of sphere 0 and gravel 2 are shown in these figures to demonstrate the effects of the particle shapes on the fluid forces fig 14 shows that in the upper levels where the volume concentrations were smaller than 0 3 as shown in fig 8 case 1 s0 and case 1 g2 the fluid forces on the particles are approximately in agreement with the buoyancy forces computed based on eq 27 the forces were exerted in the upstream direction particles were not able to move with a constant velocity motion without receiving forces in the upstream direction the negative x 1 direction relative to the gravity forces in the streamwise direction the positive x 1 direction the results implied that in order to resist the streamwise gravity force the particles that moved in the upper levels of low volume concentrations were exposed to forces in the upstream direction that were equivalent to the forces exerted on the water of the same volume from the surrounding water as a result of the water shear stress as illustrated in fig 15 the wall normal distributions of the fluid forces in the x 1 direction for spheres and gravel were almost identical for cf 0 196 in contrast for cf 0 444 the fluid forces on gravel were approximately constant with slight variation in the levels of x 3 0 02 m while the fluid forces on spheres increased considerably for levels of x 3 0 005 the velocities of the spheres exceeded those for the gravel near the channel bottom this high velocity reduced the volume concentration of the spheres as shown in fig 9 near the channel bottom thus it was assumed that the water flew quickly through the sphere gaps and exerted considerable drag forces on the spheres near the channel bottom at high water velocities 5 4 wall normal distributions of the energy dissipation rates if the energy dissipation of either the water or particles is large and the accuracy of the simulation of the larger component is not adequate a large error is involved in the multiphase flow simulations additionally energy dissipation rates play considerable roles in generating models of continuum stress egashira et al 1989 therefore understanding the energy dissipation rates of water and particles are important for two phase flows in this study based on the simulation results of spheres and gravel 2 the wall normal distributions of the energy dissipation rates of water and particles are predicted using their respective equations as follows 28 e w v ω τ ij u i x j dv v ω 29 e p v ω i f i c δ δ i δ t p v ω where e w and e p are the energy dissipation rates of the water and the particles in a unit volume respectively v ω is the averaging domain τ ij 2 ν ν t sij is the deviatoric stress of the flow and σ v ω i a is the symbol that denotes the summation of the value of a with respect to the contacts of particles i at the side of the two contacting particles i and j in the averaging domain v ω additionally f i c is the contact force and δ δ i is the relative displacement of the contact point within a time step δt p in eq 29 the inner product f i c δ δ i δ t p is the energy transformation rate between the mechanical energy of the particles and the strain energy of the particle material and it assumes either a positive or a negative value that is influenced by the timing of the measurement however the total value of the inner products of all contacts in the averaging domain becomes positive and denotes the energy dissipation rate in the domain the averaging domain v ω was selected in the center of the flow as e w x y z lx δ y δ z and e p x y z lx 0 1 m 2δ z the simulated wall normal distributions of the energy dissipation rates in case 1 cf 0 196 and case 2 cf 0 444 for sphere 0 and gravel 2 are shown in fig 16 the figure corresponding to case 2 for the spheres also shows the energy dissipation rates of case 2 seb used for the investigation of the effects of the coefficient of the damping force on the energy dissipation rate as mentioned in section 5 2 1 the energy dissipation rates of the water were dominant in case 1 when cf 0 196 in the simulations of the spheres and gravel hence for this concentration the accuracy of the energy dissipation rates of the water significantly affected the accuracies of the simulations of water particle mixture flows in contrast when cf 0 444 the ratio of the particle energy dissipation rate to the total energy dissipation rate increased more than that of case 1 cf 0 196 and the importance of the particle motions increased in regard to the reproducibility of the mixture flow additionally for spheres the energy dissipation of the water and particles became significant near the channel bottom in contrast for gravels the energy dissipation of the water became significant near the water surface the differences in particle shapes led to differences in the energy dissipation mechanisms with concentration increases 6 conclusions in this study irles simulations using the apm code were performed to reproduce the hyperconcentrated water particle mixture flow obtained in the experiments conducted by egashira et al 2001 the experimental cases of the sediment discharge concentrations of cf 0 196 and 0 444 were simulated using spheres and gravel comparisons of the simulation and experimental results indicated that the present apm code using particles of suitable shapes could reproduce wall normal distributions of the particle velocities and discharge rates of water and particles in flows characterized by different sediment discharge concentrations the simulation results were used to predict water and particle stresses and the effective particle friction angles required in two phase flow models the examination indicated that the effective particle friction angle became a constant that equaled the static internal friction angle near the channel bottom where the concentration was high and increased at the upper levels where the particle moved dispersedly at a low concentration for the flow characterized by higher particle concentrations where cf 0 444 the particle shear stress was dominant relative to the water subsequently the effect of the difference in the effective particle friction angles between the spheres and gravel significantly affected the sediment mixture flows this resulted in a significant decrease in the simulated discharge rates of water and gravel particles compared to those in the sphere simulation the wall normal distributions of the energy dissipations of the water and particles were also predicted for the flows where cf 0 196 the energy dissipation rates of the water and the particles were dominant near the channel bottom in the simulations of the spheres and gravel in contrast for highly concentrated flows at cf 0 444 the energy dissipation of both the water and particles in the sphere simulations were also high near the channel bottom conversely in the gravel simulations the particle energy dissipation was also high near the channel bottom however the energy dissipation of water was high near the water surface where the water velocities increased these findings indicated that the effects of the particle shapes on water particle mixture flows increased with concentration increases furthermore simulations relative to other spheres with high concentrations such as cf 0 444 were performed by varying the coefficients of contact forces in the dem method such as the coefficient of restitution related to the damping forces and the friction angles of particle surfaces related to friction sliders these findings indicated that variation in the damping coefficient did not significantly affect the simulation results which implied that energy dissipation owing to shear motion as opposed to the damping energy dissipation were dominant in particle collisions in flows sphere simulations with an extremely high friction angle of particle surfaces resulted in effective particle friction angles of approximately 30 tan30 0 58 but could not reproduce effective gravel friction angles of approximately 35 tan35 0 70 1 2 0 70 0 58 these simulated spheres with increased surface friction moved fast near the channel bottom in comparison to those in the experimental data which were almost stationary near the same region as a result sphere simulations encountered difficulties in predicting the water and nonspherical mixture flows in the field the fluid forces on particles in the streamwise direction the x 1 direction the x 1 axis was parallel to the channel bottom and the streamwise direction were examined based on the simulation results for concentration levels less than 0 3 negative fluid forces were exerted on the particles along the x 1 direction based on buoyancy forces α p σ 31 w x 3 these results indicate the importance of appropriate consideration of drag forces based on relative velocities of water and particles as well as buoyancy forces generated by the isotropic stress and deviatoric stress of water for the fluid force simulations in two phase flow models the aforementioned analysis indicated significant differences between the flows of water sphere mixtures and those from nonspherical particles especially at high concentrations they also indicated that sphere simulations of the irs encountered difficulties in reproducing the natural hyperconcentrated mixture flows of nonspherical particles acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge professor shinji egashira and dr takahiro itoh for sharing their data in

643,the assumptions of equilibrium flow conditions neglecting the flow acceleration for vertical velocity distributions and of the equilibrium wall law applied to the bottom boundary condition in which the flow acceleration is neglected in the vicinity of the bed are questionable when used to calculate sediment transport for flows that vary rapidly over time and space examples of such flows include dam break flows and flows around structures this study proposes a two phase depth integrated model for large scale geophysical flow applications involving sediment transport phenomena and bed morphology the model for the fluid phase is based on the non hydrostatic quasi 3d method and uses a dynamic rough wall law that employs continuity and momentum equations for the bottom boundary conditions it was confirmed that the proposed model reduces to the previous bedload formulae for uniform flow conditions under the weak sediment transport condition the model was applied in an experiment involving a dam break flow on a movable bed channel with a suddenly enlarged section the comparison between the experimental results and the results calculated with the proposed model and previous models demonstrates the validity of the proposed model the comparison also highlights the advantages of introducing a quasi 3d two phase model to evaluate vertical velocity distributions and non equilibrium sediment motions keywords two phase model dynamic wall law depth integrated model bottom velocity computation method vertical velocity distribution dam break flow 1 introduction violent flows and their accompanying rapid topographical changes along with the large amount of sediment transport they create need to be more thoroughly understood to reduce the risk and damage caused by the failure of hydraulic structures during extreme flood and tsunami events dam break flows are considered the basic problem to be solved in those emergencies many previous studies have examined calculation methods with depth integrated models for complex dam break flows toro 2001 wu 2008 however dam break flows on movable beds are more difficult to calculate because the flows generate a large amount of sediment transport due to the rapid bed variations wu 2008 fraccarollo and capart 2002 soares frazão and zech 2011 wu et al 2012 greco et al 2012 evangelista et al 2013 li et al 2013 cristo et al 2015 marsooli and wu 2014 two layer models and two phase flow models have been developed to calculate non equilibrium sediment motion and the interaction between the fluid and sediment phases with momentum transfer induced by dam break flows fraccarollo and capart 2002 greco et al 2012 evangelista et al 2013 li et al 2013 cristo et al 2015 for the calculation of the dam break flows on movable beds with complex geometry marsooli and wu 2014 developed a three dimensional 3d model that determines the effects of the variations in vertical velocity and pressure distribution on sediment transport for practical applications in geophysical flows with a large spatial scale and a long time span an enhanced depth integrated model with the ability to consider 3d flow effects may be more appropriate however to our knowledge quasi 3d two phase models that are capable of evaluating both 3d flow structures and the momentum transfer between fluid and sediment motions within the framework of a 2d model are not available in general developing a sediment transport model requires two approaches one to evaluate the bed tractive forces acting on the sediment particles and another to describe sediment motions in other words because the accuracy of a sediment transport model depends on the fluid phase model for the sediment driving force and on the sediment phase model for the sediment motions it is important not only to sophisticate each phase model but also to evenly balance their accuracy one 1d or two dimensional 2d fluid phase models have been used to evaluate the bed tractive forces for various types of practical bed variation analyses in order to evaluate the bed tractive forces it is important to calculate the velocity near the bed which is affected by the vertical velocity distribution numerous efforts have been made to develop depth integrated models with the ability to take into account vertical velocity distributions one example involved the employment of sub depth models that were derived from 3d momentum equations with the assumption of a hydrostatic pressure distribution jin and steffler 1993 yeh and kennedy 1993 uchida and fukuoka 2011 several non hydrostatic depth integrated models are available for computing 3d flows and bed variation within the framework of a 2d model khan and steffler 1996 ghamry and steffler 2002 ghamry and steffler 2005 uchida and fukuoka 2014 in a bed variation analysis that utilizes the aforementioned models the bed shear stress is used as the bed tractive force that acts on the sediment particles to calculate the sediment transport rate the equilibrium wall law ewl is employed for the bottom boundary conditions in which the flow near the bed is assumed to be in an equilibrium condition where flow acceleration is neglected however in the case of complex flows that rapidly change over time and space such as dam break flows and flows around hydraulic structures the equilibrium flow assumption is not applicable the assumption is not appropriate for the vertical velocity distribution or for the flow near the bed this includes flows through the porosity produced by surface roughness elements of the bed materials roughness layer uchida et al 2016 as long as the ewl is employed the non equilibrium motions of sediment particles and the dynamic interactions between fluid and sediment motions cannot be evaluated correctly recently a dynamic rough wall law dwl was proposed for a quasi 3d model it employs continuity and momentum equations for the vortex and roughness layers under the bottom of the main calculation domain instead of assuming equilibrium flow conditions near the bed as a result it is able to calculate the non equilibrium flow near the bed and its effects on the main computational domain for gravel bed rivers uchida et al 2016 the dwl is considered to be a suitable method for developing the fluid phase model for bed variation analysis in sediment phase models for previous bed variation analyses conducted on rivers the exner equation of sediment conservation has been used to calculate the time variation in bed elevation this equation uses equilibrium bedload formulae wu 2008 garcia 2008 that were derived for a uniform flow condition without considering the sediment inertia effect the exner equation is obtained by combining the continuity equations of sediment for bed and bedload and by omitting time variation in the bedload thickness detailed reviews of previous bed variation models based on continuity equations for bed bedload and suspended sediment are found in wu wu 2008 and garcia garcia 2008 one familiar method used to evaluate the non equilibrium bedload rate employs the bedload continuity equations as a non equilibrium bedload formula with the adaptation length l wu 2008 garcia 2008 using a suitable adaptation length allows us to apply the non equilibrium formula to sediment transport with suspended sediment wu 2008 garcia 2008 because this type of non equilibrium bedload formula was derived from the continuity equation it needs to either assume an equilibrium condition or adopt an alternative empirical formula for the sediment velocity in the bedload this implies that l should include the effects of sediment acceleration and deceleration varying with the motion patterns aside from the step length einstein 1950 for uniform flows another method applies the bedload momentum equation with the inertia effects parker 1975 uchida fukuoka uchida and fukuoka 2014 proposed a non equilibrium bedload formula based on the momentum conservation law for bedload sediment because they omitted the continuity equation of the bedload sediment evaluation methods for l and bedload thickness were not established and remain as future work to be investigated the above non equilibrium sediment transport models were based on the eulerian method on the other hand nagata et al 2005 developed a lagrangian model for sediment motion based on einstein s method einstein 1950 by using a 3d model for fluid flows in order to calculate local scouring around structures while this model allows us to calculate an accurate path for sediment particles by using the sediment particle motion equation it is difficult to evaluate the step length for a non uniform flow and to apply dense sediment transport phenomena with particle particle interactions for the suspended sediment the advection diffusion equation with the settling velocity of the sediment particles has been adopted above the bedload layer employing an empirical formula for the near bed sediment concentration as a bottom boundary condition wu 2008 garcia 2008 because most of the existing formulae are considered to assume an equilibrium condition near the bed a method for determining the bottom sediment concentration under the effects of non equilibrium sediment motion has not yet been established a two phase model in which continuity and momentum equations for both fluid and sediment phases are coupled with the interphase momentum transfer terms is considered promising when dynamically evaluating non equilibrium sediment motion there are several types of two phase models that focus on a different model resolution scale because it is difficult or perhaps impossible to fully understand the fluid sediment dynamics and interactions through laboratory experiments alone a computational fluid dynamic model with a high or full resolution of the flows around sediment particles coupled with the discrete element model dem for the sediment particle motions has been developed kidanemariam and uhlmann 2014 in this model the resolution of the fluid phase is much smaller than the sediment diameter while the sediment phase resolution is on the scale of the sediment diameter contact forces are modeled with a simplification of the inner stress and strain cundall and strack 1979 fukuoka et al fukuoka et al 2014 developed a numerical simulation model to investigate sediment transport phenomena with different sizes and shapes of gravel particles their high resolution model can calculate complex flow structures with a small number of assumptions in exchange for a limited application range this trade off is necessary because of the expensive computational cost of its application in large scale phenomena the other sediment transport models are based on the dem for the sediment phase and are coupled with a fluid phase model with a computational mesh much larger than the sediment diameter this is accomplished by using interphase momentum transfer models with drag force coefficients yeganeh et al 2000 they are simplified from a high resolution model with the particle fluid interaction model and the turbulence model on the other hand by employing a continuum model that averages sediment phase over the fluid phase resolution scale eularian two phase models can be obtained hsu et al 2004 kranenburg et al 2014 for those methods the evaluation methods of particle collisions stresses the effects of existing particles on fluid turbulence and interphase momentum and turbulence exchange within the control volume scale have been deliberated jenkins and hanes 1998 berzi 2013 berzi and fraccarollo 2015 revil baudard et al 2015 berzi and fraccarollo 2016 for geophysical flows we will have to calculate the sediment transport phenomena with large scale external forces and boundary conditions for flood and tsunami events in rivers which are usually much larger than the water depth scale in this study a new two phase depth integrated model is derived for the calculation of large scale sediment transport phenomena and bed morphology in geophysical flows this new model expands the non hydrostatic depth integrated model by incorporating dwl uchida et al 2016 the validity of the new model and the advantages of evaluating vertical velocity distributions and non equilibrium sediment motion with a two phase model are discussed through comparisons with previous experimental results for dam break flows on mobile beds goutiere et al 2011 and with existing depth integrated models that utilize conventional single phase sediment transport models uchida and fukuoka 2014 2 quasi 3d two phase model 2 1 framework the calculation method used for the fluid phase is based on the general bottom velocity computation method combined with the dynamic rough wall law gbvc4 dwl uchida et al 2016 which takes into account interactions with the sediment phase in the gbvc4 dwl the calculation domain is divided into three layers in the vertical direction the main calculation domain the vortex layer and the roughness layer as shown in fig 1 for the vertical distribution of horizontal velocity in the main calculation domain the fourth degree polynomial velocity distribution is adopted with the following constraint conditions depth averaged velocity water surface bottom velocity and the vertical gradient of velocity at the water surface and the bottom uchida et al 2016 the unknown variables needed to evaluate the vertical distributions of velocity and pressure in the main calculation domain are calculated with several depth integrated equations and momentum equations for water surface flows these equations are derived from reynold s averaged continuity momentum and vorticity equations as described briefly in appendix a 1 the bottom boundary conditions of the main calculation domain for the depth integrated momentum and vorticity equations are given by the dwl and are composed of the continuity and momentum equations for the vortex and roughness layers uchida et al 2016 instead of the uniform velocity distribution under the bottom with the ewl uchida and fukuoka 2011 uchida and fukuoka 2014 not assuming an equilibrium flow condition near the bed in which the sediment particles are actively driven by the fluid flow is a significant advantage in the proposed model this allows us to take into account the interactions between fluid and sediment motions in other words two phase modeling the characteristics of the sediment motions have been categorized by the sediment volume concentration which is generally stratified in the vertical direction due to the difference in density between the fluid and sediment phases and the fluid turbulence intensity kranenburg et al 2014 berzi 2013 berzi and fraccarollo 2016 to develop a quasi 3d two phase model the proposed model assumes a different sub model for the sediment phase in each layer of the gbvc4 dwl uchida et al 2016 as indicated in fig 1 a two phase model which consists of continuity and momentum equations for both fluid and sediment phases and an interaction between the phases is applied to the wall law layer which is composed of the vortex layer and the roughness layer a single phase model utilizing the depth integrated advection diffusion model for the sediment phase is employed for the main calculation domain in the wall law layer the bedload layer is assumed to be in the roughness layer in which the particle skeleton stress is considered to be significant with a dense sediment concentration above the bedload layer the transition layer from the bedload to the suspended sediment load is considered in the vortex layer in which a dilute two phase model without particle collision stress is introduced and sediment concentration and velocity are calculated the bedload layer and suspended sediment region in the main computational domain are considered to correspond to a dense layer and fully turbulent layer berzi and fraccarollo 2016 the unknown variables for the fluid and sediment phases in the proposed model are summarized in table 1 the calculation methods for these variables are described by the governing equations in the following sections 2 2 continuity equations the continuity equations for the roughness vortex layers of the fluid phase and the bedload transition layers of the sediment phase are derived with the assumption of a constant static sediment volume concentration for the roughness

stress for enduring contacts berzi and fraccarollo 2016 several studies have led to the development of a collision model for momentum transfer in the sediment phase jenkins and hanes 1998 berzi 2013 berzi and fraccarollo 2015 revil baudard et al 2015 berzi and fraccarollo 2016 among these studies a few have attempted to bridge the gap between the recent advances in fluid sediment two phase flow theorems and conventional models berzi 2013 the turbulence model employed in the proposed model is crude compared to that found in sophisticated two phase models hsu et al 2004 however as discussed in the introduction the reason for introducing two phase models is not only to take into account the effects of existing particles on flow turbulence momentum the turbulence energy exchange between the two phases and momentum transfer due to particles it is also to evaluate non equilibrium sediment motions under non uniform and unsteady flow conditions that are based on dynamic equations for the sediment phase to clarify the effects of introducing a two phase model concept to the bed variation calculation the momentum exchange terms for the sediment phase are simplified but each model remains to be solved 2 4 sediment entrainment rate and deposition rate the static bed sediment height zb is calculated by eq 3 following the previous depth integrated two phase model greco et al 2012 this

condition with weak sediment transport for a low shields number δ s 0 3 solutions for uniform flows conventional sediment transport models have significantly contributed to the study of bed morphology although their ability to predict instances of massive sediment transport is unreliable berzi 2013 the practical calculation domains needed to calculate sediment transport with geophysical flows inevitably include calculations for low or zero shields numbers area of varying degrees even in cases with massive sediment transport the calculation models need to be validated for the weak sediment

there are considerable differences between previous models regarding step length or adaptation length eq 41 and the proposed model where it is included provide a reasonable step length that is within the range proposed in existing literature although suspended sediment transport is induced at relatively high shields numbers the comparisons between the proposed model and conventional formulae related to suspended sediment are important for understanding the characteristics of the proposed model under uniform flow conditions the sediment concentration at the bottom cb for the boundary condition of the suspended sediment transport equation is derived for the equilibrium condition as follows the sediment vertical flux at the roughness surface is given by eq 42 from eq 6 for the

while eq 44 is derived from eqs 6 and 7 by introducing a constant coefficient a it is considered to provide a common sense concentration at the bottom with a 0 08 4 model applications to dam break flow over mobile bed 4 1 experimental conditions the proposed model gbvc4 dwl for two phase model is applied to the experiment on a dam break flow on movable bed with a sudden enlargement of the left side goutiere et al 2011 the experiment was conducted in a flatbed channel 6 m long and was enlarged 4 m downstream from 0 25 m to 0 50 m the dam break flow was created by the downward movement of a thin gate located 1 m upstream from the enlargement section as shown in fig 5 the nearly uniform sand of medium diameter d 1 72 mm and specific gravity s 1 2 63 covered the entire channel bottom at a thickness of 0 1 m the initial water depth back from the gate with a 3 m longitudinal length was 0 25 m from the initial bed height while there was 0 m of water depth downstream from the gate i e the water surface was set on the initial bed height the downstream end condition was a free outflow over the sediment bed maintained at initial bed height the temporal variations in the water surface profile were measured by nine ultrasonic gauges u1 u9 installed downstream from the gate as presented in fig 5 the details are included in the literature goutiere et al 2011 the experimental data goutiere et al 2011 has been used for the validations of several calculation models including 2d models with equilibrium bedload formula soares frazão and zech 2011 the non equilibrium total load sediment transport model wu et al 2012 the 2d two phase model greco et al 2012 and the 3d model coupled with a non equilibrium suspended and bedload sediment model marsooli and wu 2014 marsooli and wu marsooli and wu 2014 investigated the 3d effects of a dam break flow on the final bed profiles by comparing the 3d and 2d models wu et al 2012 and showed that the calculation of the bed variation induced by a dam break flow was improved with the 3d model 4 2 calculation conditions for the proposed calculations the experimental conditions are given with the roughness coefficients for the bed and sidewall because there are no available experimental data for uniform flow with sand to evaluate the bed roughness parameter as a property value of sand all calculation methods utilized in this study set ks d and dz 0 0 2d these values are similar to those that have been used and validated for a fixed bed with gbvc4 dwl uchida et al 2016 however the values are considered to be small compared to the values used in previous studies for this experiment with their 2d methods soares frazão and zech 2011 wu et al 2012 the manning roughness coefficient for the sidewall of the channel is n 0 01 to reveal the effects of evaluating vertical velocity distribution pressure distribution and non equilibrium flow near the bed and of introducing a two phase model that considers the interphase momentum transfer several single phase calculation methods are compared to the proposed model within these single phase calculation methods the following fluid phase models are coupled with the previous non equilibrium bedload model uchida and fukuoka 2014 table 2 shows the unknown variables that are calculated in several fluid phase models the models are derived from the 2 dimensional calculation 2dc method the simplified bottom velocity computation method sbvc3 which incorporates a shallow water assumption and employs a third degree polynomial of the vertical distribution of horizontal velocity uchida and fukuoka 2011 the general bottom velocity computation gbvc method which incorporates a third degree polynomial of the velocity distribution gbvc3 uchida and fukuoka 2014 and the gbvc method which incorporates a fourth degree polynomial and dynamic wall law gbvc4 dwl uchida et al 2016 in the 2dc method the water depth depth integrated horizontal velocity and kinetic turbulence energy equations are calculated assuming a uniform velocity distribution of the second degree polynomial in the vertical direction wherein equilibrium water surface velocity and vorticity are used the sbvc3 method employs equations for depth integrated vorticity bottom velocity and water surface velocity in addition to the equations for 2dc method in order to evaluate vertical velocity distributions the 2dc and sbvc3 methods both assume a hydrostatic pressure distribution and zero vertical velocity pd w 0 however the gbvc3 method avoids the assumptions of the shallow water flow by employing additional equations those are equations for vertical velocity w and bottom non hydrostatic pressure pdb and are coupled with the equations of sbvc3 method the 2dc sbvc3 and gbvc3 methods adopt equilibrium wall law ewl for the bottom boundary conditions instead of assuming equilibrium conditions for flows near the bed the gbvc4 dwl method takes into account the non equilibrium flows under the bottom as indicated in fig 1 and table 1 the above fluid phase models are coupled with the previous non equilibrium bed load model uchida and fukuoka 2014 for the same condition and parameters used in the current two phase model in this study those calculation methods are referred to as single phase 1ph models with 2dc sbvc3 gbvc3 and gbvc4 dwl while the current model represents a two phase 2ph model with gbvc4 dwl for calculations involving 1ph models the non dimensional adaptation length l d used in the non equilibrium bedload equation is restricted to l d 40 and refers to previous calculations for dam break flows over movable beds wu et al 2012 marsooli and wu 2014 the comparisons of calculation results between two of the above calculation methods can show the effects of particular non equilibrium effects on the calculation results for example the comparison of the calculation results of the single phase models between 2dc and sbvc3 can show the effects of the non equilibrium vertical distributions of velocity because the other calculation and discretization methods for the equations employed in both methods are same similarly the effects of the shallow water assumption neglecting the vertical velocity accelerations and non hydrostatic pressure distributions can be found in the comparisons between sbvc3 and gbvc3 the single phase model with the gbvc3 method is also compared with the gbvc4 dwl method to investigate the effects of non equilibrium flow near the bed on the calculation results on the other hand the role of introducing sediment phase momentum equations considering interphase momentum transfer i e applying two phase model might be found in the comparisons between the current two phase model and the 1ph models for the same condition and parameters used in the proposed model 4 3 calculations results and discussion fig 6 shows comparisons of time variations in water surface height at gauges u1 u9 shown in fig 5 between the experiment goutiere et al 2011 and various calculation methods the proposed calculation methods and 1ph models in which the fluid phase models in table 2 are coupled with the non equilibrium bedload equations uchida and fukuoka 2014 it is noted that the 2dc calculation results are different from those calculated by the other methods compared to the measurement results the calculation results of the time variations in water surface height are improved by sbvc3 through evaluation of the vertical velocity distribution there is little difference between the calculation methods except for the 2dc method those results are similar to the experimental results except for points u2 and u3 the preliminary calculations not shown in this study investigated the effects of bed roughness coefficient on the calculation of water surface profiles because the roughness coefficient affects not only the flow resistance but also the sediment motion and accompanying bed variations the evaluation method for the bottom resistance must be studied further together with the turbulence model of the fluid phase figs 7 and 8 show bed topographies and cross sectional bed forms after dam break flows from the experiment and from various calculation methods from the experimental result of fig 7 the characteristics of the bed profiles include two with scouring s1 just downstream from the enlargement section and s2 along the left boundary wall of the channel and one with deposition d1 between s1 and s2 the deposition areas along the left sidewall are calculated using the single phase models which are not investigated in the experiment while this is considered to be one of the drawbacks of the previous non equilibrium bedload equation with the adaptation length it is not seen in the calculation with the proposed model all calculation results obtained in this study underestimate the bed level near the right boundary wall although similar discrepancies of varying degrees can be seen in the previous calculation results soares frazão and zech 2011 wu et al 2012 greco et al 2012 marsooli and wu 2014 the reason has not been cleared yet from figs 7 and 8 all calculation methods show the existence of s1 and d1 the calculated deposition volume and height of d1 of the 1ph model with the 2dc method underestimate the experimental d1 form the volume and height of d1 calculated by the 1ph model with sbvc3 gbvc3 and gbvc4 dwl are still smaller than those obtained from the experiment compared to the 1ph models d1 is well characterized by the proposed model the relative calculation errors for d1 s1 and s2 are indicated in fig 9 and vary with the number of equations employed in several calculation methods both for the fluid and sediment phases here the number of equations for the sediment phase of the 1ph models is three it is found that the relative calculation error of d1 has a general tendency to decrease as the number of equations increases on the other hand compared to the cross sectional form of s1 in fig 8 the 1ph model with the 2dc method and the proposed model can explain the experimental value of s1 while the other calculation methods overestimate the scour depth of s1 this relationship can be seen in fig 9 in the large calculation errors associated with the 1ph models with sbvc3 gbvc3 and gbvc4 dwl methods this complex reproducibility for s1 is attributed to the complex temporal variation in scour depth of s1 as discussed later with fig 11 while the 2dc method failed to predict the existence of s2 it is calculated with the other gbvc methods the discrepancy in bed profiles between the experiment and 2d calculation near the left boundary wall has been ascribed to the existence of 3d flow soares frazão and zech 2011 wu et al 2012 greco et al 2012 marsooli and wu 2014 fig 10 shows the bottom velocity fields calculated by the proposed model the counter clockwise vortex facing the downstream direction is developed along the left boundary wall after the dam break flow hits the wall inducing a bottom velocity from the wall this phenomenon was investigated in the experiment and previously reported by goutiere et al 2011 similar bottom velocity fields are investigated in the other calculation results of single phase models with sbvc3 gbvc3 and gbvc4 dwl although s2 of gbvc3 is disrupted being developed by the deposition along the left sidewall including the reproducibility of s2 employing the gbvc method i e taking into account 3d flow effects improved the results in comparison to the 2d calculation results based on the results presented in figs 7 9 the proposed model significantly improves the bed profile minimizes the discrepancies from the measurement compared to single phase models with the several calculation methods and satisfactorily captures the characteristics of the experimental results except for the range of s1 in which calculated s1 is wider than that found in the experimental result fig 11 shows the temporal variation in maximum scour depth in s1 and s2 along with the deposition height in d1 calculated by several calculation methods and measured after the experiment as indicated in figs 7 9 the ultimate values obtained by the proposed model are in good agreement with those obtained from the experiment demonstrating considerable improvements from those calculated by 1ph models with several fluid phase models the time variations calculated by the proposed model in fig 11 are not simple especially in the case of s1 which involved backfilling after the maximum scour depth occurred at approximately 5 s in the case of overestimated s1 value with 1ph models with sbvc3 gbvc3 and gbvc4 dwl a small amount of back filling occurred but the deep scour depth is maintained because the experimental data on the temporal variations in bed level are not available further discussions are needed to validate the model for bed scouring with temporal data fig 12 presents the bedload thickness calculated by the proposed model 3 0 s after gate opening when the bed topography actively varies as indicated in fig 11 after the considerable amount of sediment passed through accompanied by the water wave in front of the dam break flow the bedload layer of which thickness is a few times larger than the sediment diameter widely covers the bed around s1 while the thickness is significantly smaller than the water depth see fig 6 for water depth the thickness is not small enough to be negligible compared to the sediment diameter in other words the weak sediment transport introduced in the discussion in chapter 3 is not applicable to this case this is considered to be another advantage of the proposed two phase model in the proposed model in addition to the coefficients proposed in previous studies three coefficients a γb and cl are empirically introduced in eqs 8 20 and 24 respectively to close the sediment equations in the preliminary calculations only small differences were confirmed with the range of 0 01 a 0 25 by the proposed model for the calculation condition in this study the sensitiveness of cl and γb on the calculation results is investigated as follow fig 13 compares the temporal variation in s1 s2 and d1 obtained by the proposed calculation results with those obtained from calculations using different coefficients the different coefficients used were cl 17 and 8 5 which are considered the potential maximum and minimum values of cl from the physical definition of cl u u at the saltation height of the sediment fig 14 shows the bed topography after the calculations using those values the maximum scour depth of s2 and the maximum deposition height of d1 are increased with larger values of cl while there is not a large difference in the maximum scour depth of s1 because cl includes the height of the saltation motion of a sediment particle relative to the sediment diameter or the roughness height the effects of cl are considered to vary with a vertical velocity gradient near the bed and water depth relative to sediment particle diameter however the constant value cl 12 which is simply adopted for the uniform flow condition compared to the previous bedload formulae as discussed in the foregoing section is considered a reasonable value for the proposed calculation condition similar to figs 13 and 14 for the sensitivity analysis of cl the effects of γb on the calculation results are investigated in figs 15 and 16 these figures compare the calculation results with the minimum γb 0 and maximum values γb 0 6 in substitution for eq 20 for this condition the calculations with constant values of γb 0 0 6 provide nearly similar results with that evaluated by eq 20 although adequate evaluation methods for cl and γb are considered to improve the reproducibility of the experimental results the influence of those coefficients on the calculation results obtained by the proposed model is relatively small compared to the influence of the calculation methods as indicated in figs 7 10 this indicates the advantage of the proposed model 5 conclusions a new two phase depth integrated model based on a non hydrostatic quasi 3d flow model with a dynamic wall law gbvc4 dwl is proposed for geophysical flow applications involving large scale sediment transport phenomena and bed morphology a bedload layer and a transition layer are assumed for the wall law layer under the main calculation domain of the gbvc4 dwl method with suspended sediment sediment transport dynamics in open channel flows are then formulated by considering a 3d flow and momentum exchange between the fluid and sediment phases within the framework of a 2d model in contrast to the conventional sediment transport model each process of sediment particle motion such as pick up and entrainment to the flow acceleration and deceleration and deposition to the bed is dynamically evaluated in our proposed model by considering the gravitational effects on the motion of each sediment in an inclined bed and the transition between bedload and suspended sediment transport to close the sediment phase model three empirical coefficients are introduced while the other closure models proposed in the previous studies are applied as they are for the condition of uniform flow with weak sediment transport the equilibrium bedload and step length or adaptation length are derived from the proposed model for the sediment phase through comparisons with conventional formulae it is demonstrated that the proposed model is reduced to the conventional formulae in the uniform flow condition it is also indicated for the uniform flow condition that the solution of the proposed model provides similar values with those of previous formulae the proposed two phase model with gbvc4 dwl and the single phase models with several fluid phase models including 2dc sbvc3 gbvc3 and gbvc4 dwl are applied to a dam break flow over a movable bed in the experimental channel with an abrupt width enlargement section compared to the experimental results the bvc method improves the upon the calculation of temporal change in water levels compared to the results of the 2dc method and predicts the existence of scouring along the left bank which is not calculated with the 2dc method the advantages of the proposed model are mainly found in the reproducibility of the bed profile in which the characteristics of bed topography measured by the experiment are well explained in the calculation results the sensitivity analysis indicates that the advantage of the proposed model is maintained within the possible range of the empirical coefficients it is also shown that the constant value cl 12 which is determined by a comparison with the previous bedload formulae for uniform flow condition is considered to be a reasonable value for the proposed calculation condition acknowledgment the first author would like to acknowledge the support provided to this study through a jsps

643,the assumptions of equilibrium flow conditions neglecting the flow acceleration for vertical velocity distributions and of the equilibrium wall law applied to the bottom boundary condition in which the flow acceleration is neglected in the vicinity of the bed are questionable when used to calculate sediment transport for flows that vary rapidly over time and space examples of such flows include dam break flows and flows around structures this study proposes a two phase depth integrated model for large scale geophysical flow applications involving sediment transport phenomena and bed morphology the model for the fluid phase is based on the non hydrostatic quasi 3d method and uses a dynamic rough wall law that employs continuity and momentum equations for the bottom boundary conditions it was confirmed that the proposed model reduces to the previous bedload formulae for uniform flow conditions under the weak sediment transport condition the model was applied in an experiment involving a dam break flow on a movable bed channel with a suddenly enlarged section the comparison between the experimental results and the results calculated with the proposed model and previous models demonstrates the validity of the proposed model the comparison also highlights the advantages of introducing a quasi 3d two phase model to evaluate vertical velocity distributions and non equilibrium sediment motions keywords two phase model dynamic wall law depth integrated model bottom velocity computation method vertical velocity distribution dam break flow 1 introduction violent flows and their accompanying rapid topographical changes along with the large amount of sediment transport they create need to be more thoroughly understood to reduce the risk and damage caused by the failure of hydraulic structures during extreme flood and tsunami events dam break flows are considered the basic problem to be solved in those emergencies many previous studies have examined calculation methods with depth integrated models for complex dam break flows toro 2001 wu 2008 however dam break flows on movable beds are more difficult to calculate because the flows generate a large amount of sediment transport due to the rapid bed variations wu 2008 fraccarollo and capart 2002 soares frazão and zech 2011 wu et al 2012 greco et al 2012 evangelista et al 2013 li et al 2013 cristo et al 2015 marsooli and wu 2014 two layer models and two phase flow models have been developed to calculate non equilibrium sediment motion and the interaction between the fluid and sediment phases with momentum transfer induced by dam break flows fraccarollo and capart 2002 greco et al 2012 evangelista et al 2013 li et al 2013 cristo et al 2015 for the calculation of the dam break flows on movable beds with complex geometry marsooli and wu 2014 developed a three dimensional 3d model that determines the effects of the variations in vertical velocity and pressure distribution on sediment transport for practical applications in geophysical flows with a large spatial scale and a long time span an enhanced depth integrated model with the ability to consider 3d flow effects may be more appropriate however to our knowledge quasi 3d two phase models that are capable of evaluating both 3d flow structures and the momentum transfer between fluid and sediment motions within the framework of a 2d model are not available in general developing a sediment transport model requires two approaches one to evaluate the bed tractive forces acting on the sediment particles and another to describe sediment motions in other words because the accuracy of a sediment transport model depends on the fluid phase model for the sediment driving force and on the sediment phase model for the sediment motions it is important not only to sophisticate each phase model but also to evenly balance their accuracy one 1d or two dimensional 2d fluid phase models have been used to evaluate the bed tractive forces for various types of practical bed variation analyses in order to evaluate the bed tractive forces it is important to calculate the velocity near the bed which is affected by the vertical velocity distribution numerous efforts have been made to develop depth integrated models with the ability to take into account vertical velocity distributions one example involved the employment of sub depth models that were derived from 3d momentum equations with the assumption of a hydrostatic pressure distribution jin and steffler 1993 yeh and kennedy 1993 uchida and fukuoka 2011 several non hydrostatic depth integrated models are available for computing 3d flows and bed variation within the framework of a 2d model khan and steffler 1996 ghamry and steffler 2002 ghamry and steffler 2005 uchida and fukuoka 2014 in a bed variation analysis that utilizes the aforementioned models the bed shear stress is used as the bed tractive force that acts on the sediment particles to calculate the sediment transport rate the equilibrium wall law ewl is employed for the bottom boundary conditions in which the flow near the bed is assumed to be in an equilibrium condition where flow acceleration is neglected however in the case of complex flows that rapidly change over time and space such as dam break flows and flows around hydraulic structures the equilibrium flow assumption is not applicable the assumption is not appropriate for the vertical velocity distribution or for the flow near the bed this includes flows through the porosity produced by surface roughness elements of the bed materials roughness layer uchida et al 2016 as long as the ewl is employed the non equilibrium motions of sediment particles and the dynamic interactions between fluid and sediment motions cannot be evaluated correctly recently a dynamic rough wall law dwl was proposed for a quasi 3d model it employs continuity and momentum equations for the vortex and roughness layers under the bottom of the main calculation domain instead of assuming equilibrium flow conditions near the bed as a result it is able to calculate the non equilibrium flow near the bed and its effects on the main computational domain for gravel bed rivers uchida et al 2016 the dwl is considered to be a suitable method for developing the fluid phase model for bed variation analysis in sediment phase models for previous bed variation analyses conducted on rivers the exner equation of sediment conservation has been used to calculate the time variation in bed elevation this equation uses equilibrium bedload formulae wu 2008 garcia 2008 that were derived for a uniform flow condition without considering the sediment inertia effect the exner equation is obtained by combining the continuity equations of sediment for bed and bedload and by omitting time variation in the bedload thickness detailed reviews of previous bed variation models based on continuity equations for bed bedload and suspended sediment are found in wu wu 2008 and garcia garcia 2008 one familiar method used to evaluate the non equilibrium bedload rate employs the bedload continuity equations as a non equilibrium bedload formula with the adaptation length l wu 2008 garcia 2008 using a suitable adaptation length allows us to apply the non equilibrium formula to sediment transport with suspended sediment wu 2008 garcia 2008 because this type of non equilibrium bedload formula was derived from the continuity equation it needs to either assume an equilibrium condition or adopt an alternative empirical formula for the sediment velocity in the bedload this implies that l should include the effects of sediment acceleration and deceleration varying with the motion patterns aside from the step length einstein 1950 for uniform flows another method applies the bedload momentum equation with the inertia effects parker 1975 uchida fukuoka uchida and fukuoka 2014 proposed a non equilibrium bedload formula based on the momentum conservation law for bedload sediment because they omitted the continuity equation of the bedload sediment evaluation methods for l and bedload thickness were not established and remain as future work to be investigated the above non equilibrium sediment transport models were based on the eulerian method on the other hand nagata et al 2005 developed a lagrangian model for sediment motion based on einstein s method einstein 1950 by using a 3d model for fluid flows in order to calculate local scouring around structures while this model allows us to calculate an accurate path for sediment particles by using the sediment particle motion equation it is difficult to evaluate the step length for a non uniform flow and to apply dense sediment transport phenomena with particle particle interactions for the suspended sediment the advection diffusion equation with the settling velocity of the sediment particles has been adopted above the bedload layer employing an empirical formula for the near bed sediment concentration as a bottom boundary condition wu 2008 garcia 2008 because most of the existing formulae are considered to assume an equilibrium condition near the bed a method for determining the bottom sediment concentration under the effects of non equilibrium sediment motion has not yet been established a two phase model in which continuity and momentum equations for both fluid and sediment phases are coupled with the interphase momentum transfer terms is considered promising when dynamically evaluating non equilibrium sediment motion there are several types of two phase models that focus on a different model resolution scale because it is difficult or perhaps impossible to fully understand the fluid sediment dynamics and interactions through laboratory experiments alone a computational fluid dynamic model with a high or full resolution of the flows around sediment particles coupled with the discrete element model dem for the sediment particle motions has been developed kidanemariam and uhlmann 2014 in this model the resolution of the fluid phase is much smaller than the sediment diameter while the sediment phase resolution is on the scale of the sediment diameter contact forces are modeled with a simplification of the inner stress and strain cundall and strack 1979 fukuoka et al fukuoka et al 2014 developed a numerical simulation model to investigate sediment transport phenomena with different sizes and shapes of gravel particles their high resolution model can calculate complex flow structures with a small number of assumptions in exchange for a limited application range this trade off is necessary because of the expensive computational cost of its application in large scale phenomena the other sediment transport models are based on the dem for the sediment phase and are coupled with a fluid phase model with a computational mesh much larger than the sediment diameter this is accomplished by using interphase momentum transfer models with drag force coefficients yeganeh et al 2000 they are simplified from a high resolution model with the particle fluid interaction model and the turbulence model on the other hand by employing a continuum model that averages sediment phase over the fluid phase resolution scale eularian two phase models can be obtained hsu et al 2004 kranenburg et al 2014 for those methods the evaluation methods of particle collisions stresses the effects of existing particles on fluid turbulence and interphase momentum and turbulence exchange within the control volume scale have been deliberated jenkins and hanes 1998 berzi 2013 berzi and fraccarollo 2015 revil baudard et al 2015 berzi and fraccarollo 2016 for geophysical flows we will have to calculate the sediment transport phenomena with large scale external forces and boundary conditions for flood and tsunami events in rivers which are usually much larger than the water depth scale in this study a new two phase depth integrated model is derived for the calculation of large scale sediment transport phenomena and bed morphology in geophysical flows this new model expands the non hydrostatic depth integrated model by incorporating dwl uchida et al 2016 the validity of the new model and the advantages of evaluating vertical velocity distributions and non equilibrium sediment motion with a two phase model are discussed through comparisons with previous experimental results for dam break flows on mobile beds goutiere et al 2011 and with existing depth integrated models that utilize conventional single phase sediment transport models uchida and fukuoka 2014 2 quasi 3d two phase model 2 1 framework the calculation method used for the fluid phase is based on the general bottom velocity computation method combined with the dynamic rough wall law gbvc4 dwl uchida et al 2016 which takes into account interactions with the sediment phase in the gbvc4 dwl the calculation domain is divided into three layers in the vertical direction the main calculation domain the vortex layer and the roughness layer as shown in fig 1 for the vertical distribution of horizontal velocity in the main calculation domain the fourth degree polynomial velocity distribution is adopted with the following constraint conditions depth averaged velocity water surface bottom velocity and the vertical gradient of velocity at the water surface and the bottom uchida et al 2016 the unknown variables needed to evaluate the vertical distributions of velocity and pressure in the main calculation domain are calculated with several depth integrated equations and momentum equations for water surface flows these equations are derived from reynold s averaged continuity momentum and vorticity equations as described briefly in appendix a 1 the bottom boundary conditions of the main calculation domain for the depth integrated momentum and vorticity equations are given by the dwl and are composed of the continuity and momentum equations for the vortex and roughness layers uchida et al 2016 instead of the uniform velocity distribution under the bottom with the ewl uchida and fukuoka 2011 uchida and fukuoka 2014 not assuming an equilibrium flow condition near the bed in which the sediment particles are actively driven by the fluid flow is a significant advantage in the proposed model this allows us to take into account the interactions between fluid and sediment motions in other words two phase modeling the characteristics of the sediment motions have been categorized by the sediment volume concentration which is generally stratified in the vertical direction due to the difference in density between the fluid and sediment phases and the fluid turbulence intensity kranenburg et al 2014 berzi 2013 berzi and fraccarollo 2016 to develop a quasi 3d two phase model the proposed model assumes a different sub model for the sediment phase in each layer of the gbvc4 dwl uchida et al 2016 as indicated in fig 1 a two phase model which consists of continuity and momentum equations for both fluid and sediment phases and an interaction between the phases is applied to the wall law layer which is composed of the vortex layer and the roughness layer a single phase model utilizing the depth integrated advection diffusion model for the sediment phase is employed for the main calculation domain in the wall law layer the bedload layer is assumed to be in the roughness layer in which the particle skeleton stress is considered to be significant with a dense sediment concentration above the bedload layer the transition layer from the bedload to the suspended sediment load is considered in the vortex layer in which a dilute two phase model without particle collision stress is introduced and sediment concentration and velocity are calculated the bedload layer and suspended sediment region in the main computational domain are considered to correspond to a dense layer and fully turbulent layer berzi and fraccarollo 2016 the unknown variables for the fluid and sediment phases in the proposed model are summarized in table 1 the calculation methods for these variables are described by the governing equations in the following sections 2 2 continuity equations the continuity equations for the roughness vortex layers of the fluid phase and the bedload transition layers of the sediment phase are derived with the assumption of a constant static sediment volume concentration for the roughness

theorems and conventional models berzi 2013 the turbulence model employed in the proposed model is crude compared to that found in sophisticated two phase models hsu et al 2004 however as discussed in the introduction the reason for introducing two phase models is not only to take into account the effects of existing particles on flow turbulence momentum the turbulence energy exchange between the two phases and momentum transfer due to particles it is also to evaluate non equilibrium sediment motions under non uniform and unsteady flow conditions that are based on dynamic equations for the sediment phase to clarify the effects of introducing a two phase model concept to the bed variation calculation the momentum exchange terms for the sediment phase are simplified but each model remains

there are considerable differences between previous models regarding step length or adaptation length eq 41 and the proposed model where it is included provide a reasonable step length that is within the range proposed in existing literature although suspended sediment transport is induced at relatively high shields numbers the comparisons between the proposed model and conventional formulae related to suspended sediment are important for understanding the characteristics of the proposed model under uniform flow conditions the sediment concentration at the bottom cb for the boundary

flow over mobile bed 4 1 experimental conditions the proposed model gbvc4 dwl for two phase model is applied to the experiment on a dam break flow on movable bed with a sudden enlargement of the left side goutiere et al 2011 the experiment was conducted in a flatbed channel 6 m long and was enlarged 4 m downstream from 0 25 m to 0 50 m the dam break flow was created by the downward movement of a thin gate located 1 m upstream from the enlargement section as shown in fig 5 the nearly uniform sand of medium diameter d 1 72 mm and specific gravity s 1 2 63 covered the entire channel bottom at a thickness of 0 1 m the initial water depth back from the gate with a 3 m longitudinal length was 0 25 m from the initial bed height while there was 0 m of water depth downstream from the gate i e the water surface was set on the initial bed height the downstream end condition was a free outflow over the sediment bed maintained at initial bed height the temporal variations in the water surface profile were measured by nine ultrasonic gauges u1 u9 installed downstream from the gate as presented in fig 5 the details are included in the literature goutiere et al 2011 the experimental data goutiere et al 2011 has been used for the validations of several calculation models including 2d models with equilibrium bedload formula soares frazão and zech 2011 the non equilibrium total load sediment transport model wu et al 2012 the 2d two phase model greco et al 2012 and the 3d model coupled with a non equilibrium suspended and bedload sediment model marsooli and wu 2014 marsooli and wu marsooli and wu 2014 investigated the 3d effects of a dam break flow on the final bed profiles by comparing the 3d and 2d models wu et al 2012 and showed that the calculation of the bed variation induced by a dam break flow was improved with the 3d model 4 2 calculation conditions for the proposed calculations the experimental conditions are given with the roughness coefficients for the bed and sidewall because there are no available experimental data for uniform flow with sand to evaluate the bed roughness parameter as a property value of sand all calculation methods utilized in this study set ks d and dz 0 0 2d these values are similar to those that have been used and validated for a fixed bed with gbvc4 dwl uchida et al 2016 however the values are considered to be small compared to the values used in previous studies for this experiment with their 2d methods soares frazão and zech 2011 wu et al 2012 the manning roughness coefficient for the sidewall of the channel is n 0 01 to reveal the effects of evaluating vertical velocity distribution pressure distribution and non equilibrium flow near the bed and of introducing a two phase model that considers the interphase momentum transfer several single phase calculation methods are compared to the proposed model within these single phase calculation methods the following fluid phase models are coupled with the previous non equilibrium bedload model uchida and fukuoka 2014 table 2 shows the unknown variables that are calculated in several fluid phase models the models are derived from the 2 dimensional calculation 2dc method the simplified bottom velocity computation method sbvc3 which incorporates a shallow water assumption and employs a third degree polynomial of the vertical distribution of horizontal velocity uchida and fukuoka 2011 the general bottom velocity computation gbvc method which incorporates a third degree polynomial of the velocity distribution gbvc3 uchida and fukuoka 2014 and the gbvc method which incorporates a fourth degree polynomial and dynamic wall law gbvc4 dwl uchida et al 2016 in the 2dc method the water depth depth integrated horizontal velocity and kinetic turbulence energy equations are calculated assuming a uniform velocity distribution of the second degree polynomial in the vertical direction wherein equilibrium water surface velocity and vorticity are used the sbvc3 method employs equations for depth integrated vorticity bottom velocity and water surface velocity in addition to the equations for 2dc method in order to evaluate vertical velocity distributions the 2dc and sbvc3 methods both assume a hydrostatic pressure distribution and zero vertical velocity pd w 0 however the gbvc3 method avoids the assumptions of the shallow water flow by employing additional equations those are equations for vertical velocity w and bottom non hydrostatic pressure pdb and are coupled with the equations of sbvc3 method the 2dc sbvc3 and gbvc3 methods adopt equilibrium wall law ewl for the bottom boundary conditions instead of assuming equilibrium conditions for flows near the bed the gbvc4 dwl method takes into account the non equilibrium flows under the bottom as indicated in fig 1 and table 1 the above fluid phase models are coupled with the previous non equilibrium bed load model uchida and fukuoka 2014 for the same condition and parameters used in the current two phase model in this study those calculation methods are referred to as single phase 1ph models with 2dc sbvc3 gbvc3 and gbvc4 dwl while the current model represents a two phase 2ph model with gbvc4 dwl for calculations involving 1ph models the non dimensional adaptation length l d used in the non equilibrium bedload equation is restricted to l d 40 and refers to previous calculations for dam break flows over movable beds wu et al 2012 marsooli and wu 2014 the comparisons of calculation results between two of the above calculation methods can show the effects of particular non equilibrium effects on the calculation results for example the comparison of the calculation results of the single phase models between 2dc and sbvc3 can show the effects of the non equilibrium vertical distributions of velocity because the other calculation and discretization methods for the equations employed in both methods are same similarly the effects of the shallow water assumption neglecting the vertical velocity accelerations and non hydrostatic pressure distributions can be found in the comparisons between sbvc3 and gbvc3 the single phase model with the gbvc3 method is also compared with the gbvc4 dwl method to investigate the effects of non equilibrium flow near the bed on the calculation results on the other hand the role of introducing sediment phase momentum equations considering interphase momentum transfer i e applying two phase model might be found in the comparisons between the current two phase model and the 1ph models for the same condition and parameters used in the proposed model 4 3 calculations results and discussion fig 6 shows comparisons of time variations in water surface height at gauges u1 u9 shown in fig 5 between the experiment goutiere et al 2011 and various calculation methods the proposed calculation methods and 1ph models in which the fluid phase models in table 2 are coupled with the non equilibrium bedload equations uchida and fukuoka 2014 it is noted that the 2dc calculation results are different from those calculated by the other methods compared to the measurement results the calculation results of the time variations in water surface height are improved by sbvc3 through evaluation of the vertical velocity distribution there is little difference between the calculation methods except for the 2dc method those results are similar to the experimental results except for points u2 and u3 the preliminary calculations not shown in this study investigated the effects of bed roughness coefficient on the calculation of water surface profiles because the roughness coefficient affects not only the flow resistance but also the sediment motion and accompanying bed variations the evaluation method for the bottom resistance must be studied further together with the turbulence model of the fluid phase figs 7 and 8 show bed topographies and cross sectional bed forms after dam break flows from the experiment and from various calculation methods from the experimental result of fig 7 the characteristics of the bed profiles include two with scouring s1 just downstream from the enlargement section and s2 along the left boundary wall of the channel and one with deposition d1 between s1 and s2 the deposition areas along the left sidewall are calculated using the single phase models which are not investigated in the experiment while this is considered to be one of the drawbacks of the previous non equilibrium bedload equation with the adaptation length it is not seen in the calculation with the proposed model all calculation results obtained in this study underestimate the bed level near the right boundary wall although similar discrepancies of varying degrees can be seen in the previous calculation results soares frazão and zech 2011 wu et al 2012 greco et al 2012 marsooli and wu 2014 the reason has not been cleared yet from figs 7 and 8 all calculation methods show the existence of s1 and d1 the calculated deposition volume and height of d1 of the 1ph model with the 2dc method underestimate the experimental d1 form the volume and height of d1 calculated by the 1ph model with sbvc3 gbvc3 and gbvc4 dwl are still smaller than those obtained from the experiment compared to the 1ph models d1 is well characterized by the proposed model the relative calculation errors for d1 s1 and s2 are indicated in fig 9 and vary with the number of equations employed in several calculation methods both for the fluid and sediment phases here the number of equations for the sediment phase of the 1ph models is three it is found that the relative calculation error of d1 has a general tendency to decrease as the number of equations increases on the other hand compared to the cross sectional form of s1 in fig 8 the 1ph model with the 2dc method and the proposed model can explain the experimental value of s1 while the other calculation methods overestimate the scour depth of s1 this relationship can be seen in fig 9 in the large calculation errors associated with the 1ph models with sbvc3 gbvc3 and gbvc4 dwl methods this complex reproducibility for s1 is attributed to the complex temporal variation in scour depth of s1 as discussed later with fig 11 while the 2dc method failed to predict the existence of s2 it is calculated with the other gbvc methods the discrepancy in bed profiles between the experiment and 2d calculation near the left boundary wall has been ascribed to the existence of 3d flow soares frazão and zech 2011 wu et al 2012 greco et al 2012 marsooli and wu 2014 fig 10 shows the bottom velocity fields calculated by the proposed model the counter clockwise vortex facing the downstream direction is developed along the left boundary wall after the dam break flow hits the wall inducing a bottom velocity from the wall this phenomenon was investigated in the experiment and previously reported by goutiere et al 2011 similar bottom velocity fields are investigated in the other calculation results of single phase models with sbvc3 gbvc3 and gbvc4 dwl although s2 of gbvc3 is disrupted being developed by the deposition along the left sidewall including the reproducibility of s2 employing the gbvc method i e taking into account 3d flow effects improved the results in comparison to the 2d calculation results based on the results presented in figs 7 9 the proposed model significantly improves the bed profile minimizes the discrepancies from the measurement compared to single phase models with the several calculation methods and satisfactorily captures the characteristics of the experimental results except for the range of s1 in which calculated s1 is wider than that found in the experimental result fig 11 shows the temporal variation in maximum scour depth in s1 and s2 along with the deposition height in d1 calculated by several calculation methods and measured after the experiment as indicated in figs 7 9 the ultimate values obtained by the proposed model are in good agreement with those obtained from the experiment demonstrating considerable improvements from those calculated by 1ph models with several fluid phase models the time variations calculated by the proposed model in fig 11 are not simple especially in the case of s1 which involved backfilling after the maximum scour depth occurred at approximately 5 s in the case of overestimated s1 value with 1ph models with sbvc3 gbvc3 and gbvc4 dwl a small amount of back filling occurred but the deep scour depth is maintained because the experimental data on the temporal variations in bed level are not available further discussions are needed to validate the model for bed scouring with temporal data fig 12 presents the bedload thickness calculated by the proposed model 3 0 s after gate opening when the bed topography actively varies as indicated in fig 11 after the considerable amount of sediment passed through accompanied by the water wave in front of the dam break flow the bedload layer of which thickness is a few times larger than the sediment diameter widely covers the bed around s1 while the thickness is significantly smaller than the water depth see fig 6 for water depth the thickness is not small enough to be negligible compared to the sediment diameter in other words the weak sediment transport introduced in the discussion in chapter 3 is not applicable to this case this is considered to be another advantage of the proposed two phase model in the proposed model in addition to the coefficients proposed in previous studies three coefficients a γb and cl are empirically introduced in eqs 8 20 and 24 respectively to close the sediment equations in the preliminary calculations only small differences were confirmed with the range of 0 01 a 0 25 by the proposed model for the calculation condition in this study the sensitiveness of cl and γb on the calculation results is investigated as follow fig 13 compares the temporal variation in s1 s2 and d1 obtained by the proposed calculation results with those obtained from calculations using different coefficients the different coefficients used were cl 17 and 8 5 which are considered the potential maximum and minimum values of cl from the physical definition of cl u u at the saltation height of the sediment fig 14 shows the bed topography after the calculations using those values the maximum scour depth of s2 and the maximum deposition height of d1 are increased with larger values of cl while there is not a large difference in the maximum scour depth of s1 because cl includes the height of the saltation motion of a sediment particle relative to the sediment diameter or the roughness height the effects of cl are considered to vary with a vertical velocity gradient near the bed and water depth relative to sediment particle diameter however the constant value cl 12 which is simply adopted for the uniform flow condition compared to the previous bedload formulae as discussed in the foregoing section is considered a reasonable value for the proposed calculation condition similar to figs 13 and 14 for the sensitivity analysis of cl the effects of γb on the calculation results are investigated in figs 15 and 16 these figures compare the calculation results with the minimum γb 0 and maximum values γb 0 6 in substitution for eq 20 for this condition the calculations with constant values of γb 0 0 6 provide nearly similar results with that evaluated by eq 20 although adequate evaluation methods for cl and γb are considered to improve the reproducibility of the experimental results the influence of those coefficients on the calculation results obtained by the proposed model is relatively small compared to the influence of the calculation methods as indicated in figs 7 10 this indicates the advantage of the proposed model 5 conclusions a new two phase depth integrated model based on a non hydrostatic quasi 3d flow model with a dynamic wall law gbvc4 dwl is proposed for geophysical flow applications involving large scale sediment transport phenomena and bed morphology a bedload layer and a transition layer are assumed for the wall law layer under the main calculation domain of the gbvc4 dwl method with suspended sediment sediment transport dynamics in open channel flows are then formulated by considering a 3d flow and momentum exchange between the fluid and sediment phases within the framework of a 2d model in contrast to the conventional sediment transport model each process of sediment particle motion such as pick up and entrainment to the flow acceleration and deceleration and deposition to the bed is dynamically evaluated in our proposed model by considering the gravitational effects on the motion of each sediment in an inclined bed and the transition between bedload and suspended sediment transport to close the sediment phase model three empirical coefficients are introduced while the other closure models proposed in the previous studies are applied as they are for the condition of uniform flow with weak sediment transport the equilibrium bedload and step length or adaptation length are derived from the proposed model for the sediment phase through comparisons with conventional formulae it is demonstrated that the proposed model is reduced to the conventional formulae in the uniform flow condition it is also indicated for the uniform flow condition that the solution of the proposed model provides similar values with those of previous formulae the proposed two phase model with gbvc4 dwl and the single phase models with several fluid phase models including 2dc sbvc3 gbvc3 and gbvc4 dwl are applied to a dam break flow over a movable bed in the experimental channel with an abrupt width enlargement section compared to the experimental results the bvc method improves the upon the calculation of temporal change in water levels compared to the results of the 2dc method and predicts the existence of scouring along the left bank which is not calculated with the 2dc method the advantages of the proposed model are mainly found in the reproducibility of the bed profile in which the characteristics of bed topography measured by the experiment are well explained in the calculation results the sensitivity analysis indicates that the advantage of the proposed model is maintained within the possible range of the empirical coefficients it is also shown that the constant value cl 12 which is determined by a comparison with the previous bedload formulae for uniform flow condition is considered to be a reasonable value for the proposed calculation condition acknowledgment the first author would like to acknowledge the support provided to this study through a jsps

644,we examine the effect of wind induced shear on the orientation and distribution of motile micro swimmers in free surface turbulence winds blowing above the air water interface can influence the distribution and productivity of motile organisms via the shear generated just below the surface swimmer dynamics depend not only on the advection of the fluid but also on external stimuli like nutrient concentration light gravity which are in turn coupled to and influenced by the distribution of the swimmers here we focus on gyrotaxis resulting from the gravitational torque generated by an asymmetric mass distribution within the organism the combination of such torque with the viscous torque due to shear can reorient swimmers reducing their vertical migration and causing entrapment in horizontal fluid layers through dns based euler lagrangian simulations we investigate the effect of wind induced shear on the motion of gyrotactic swimmers in turbulent open channel flow we consider different wind forcing and swimmers with different reorientation time reflecting the ability to react to turbulent fluctuations we show that only stable high gyrotaxis swimmers may reach the surface and form densely concentrated filaments the topology of which depends on the wind direction otherwise swimmers exhibit weaker vertical fluxes and loose segregation at the surface keywords clustering free surface shear flows turbulence gyrotaxis numerical simulation 1 introduction wind induced shear has a profound effect on the transport and mixing processes in the upper layers of large water bodies in oceans wind shear affects the vertical distribution and residence time of phytoplankton species rising and sinking across the near surface region enriquez and taylor 2015 moreno ostos et al 2009 in lakes where water movement is mainly driven by wind field measurements have shown that strong heterogeneities can be induced in the horizontal concentration distribution patchiness of phytoplankton cells mcgillicuddy 2007 verhagen 1994 in the case of shallow productive lakes wind induced currents can also influence phytoplankton biomass and composition carrick et al 1993 motivated by this practical importance wind forced physical biological models that provide statistical estimates of the seasonal phytoplankton cycles in marine ecosystems have been developed macías et al 2012 and simulations aimed at understanding the effect of wind on the physical and or biological triggers of spring phytoplankton blooms have been performed enriquez and taylor 2015 mcgillicuddy 2007 one important source of complexity associated with modeling and simulation of plankton interaction with wind forced fluid turbulence is plankton motility many phytoplankton species are self propelled durham et al 2009 durham and stocker 2012 guasto et al 1992 and even if their swimming speeds are typically smaller than ambient flow speeds there is well documented evidence that the interplay between motility and turbulence can result in complex and ecologically important phenomena durham et al 2011 guasto et al 1992 in particular motility can lead to a striking focusing effect known as gyrotaxis when coupled with shear in the form of vertical gradients in horizontal fluid velocity guasto et al 1992 hoecker martínez and smyth 2012 gyrotaxis is the directed motility of cells arising from the combination of gravitaxis which stabilizes cell orientation in the vertical direction typically through bottom heaviness and destabilization by the ambient fluid shear durham et al 2011 2009 durham and stocker 2012 kessler 1986 pedley and kessler 1990 1992 this results in a balance between the gravitational torque due to the uneven density distribution within the cell which tends to keep the center of mass below the center of buoyancy and the hydrodynamic torque exerted by the fluid that surrounds the cell gyrotaxis was first observed by showing that phytoplankton cells tend to collect along the centerline of a laminar poiseuille flow kessler 1986 subsequent experiments and simulations have demonstrated that gyrotactic plankton can be trapped in horizontal layers in laminar vertical shear durham et al 2009 ghorai 2016 santamaria et al 2014 only recently it was discovered that plankton accumulation due to gyrotaxis can occur also in synthetic or homogeneous isotropic turbulence croze et al 2013 de lillo et al 2013 2014 durham et al 2013 santamaria et al 2014 thorn and bearon 2016 zhan et al 2014 in this situation the resulting spatial distribution is far from uniform and small scale densely concentrated clusters with fractal properties are observed de lillo et al 2014 durham et al 2013 fouxon and leshansky 2015 zhan et al 2014 gradients in plankton concentration typically span a huge range of length scales from regions covering thousands of kilometres to patchiness occuring at the scale of centimetres dekshenieks et al 2001 durham et al 2009 steinbuck et al 2009 experiments have shown that gyrotactic trapping durham et al 2009 durham and stocker 2012 occurs when vertically migrating cells reach localized areas of the flow where the vertical gradient of horizontal velocity exceeds a critical shear threshold this causes cells to tumble end over end disrupting collective upward motions and preventing any equilibrium orientation from being reached to the best of our knowledge the interplay between wind induced shear and gyrotaxis in a three dimensional turbulent flow has never been examined in detail therefore the physical mechanisms that govern the dynamics of motile aquatic micro organisms referred to as swimmers hereinafter in wind sheared turbulence are not fully understood and the possibility of observing trapping phenomena in the presence of strong wind induced shear not yet assessed among the few available numerical studies enriquez and taylor 2015 have examined the competition between wind driven mixing and thermal stratification due to surface heating in triggering spring phytoplankton blooms to this aim an eulerian transport equation with a prescribed depth dependent growth rate model was used to determine the evolution of plankton concentration other processes such as plankton motility and buoyancy were assumed to be too weak to counteract turbulent mixing and therefore were not accounted for other studies see de lillo et al 2014 hoecker martínez and smyth 2012 manela and frankel 2003 thorn and bearon 2016 zhan et al 2014 among others have considered gyrotaxis yet only in idealized or simplified flow configurations and in the absence of stratification for instance hoecker martínez and smyth 2012 considered a two dimensional dynamically unstable stratified shear layer which mimics the surface mixed layer of large water bodies and found that the resulting pre turbulent kelvin helmoltz instability is sufficient to enhance the ability of the shear layer to retain gyrotactic organisms gyrotactic trapping was also observed by manela and frankel 2003 in steady homogeneous shear flow and by thorn and bearon 2016 in synthetic turbulence more recently zhan et al 2014 and de lillo et al 2014 investigated the same phenomena considering three dimensional time dependent homogeneous isotropic turbulence compared to laminar and linear shear flows clustering and patchiness are significantly reduced but still occur in the downwelling regions of the flow zhan et al 2014 when fluid acceleration is of the same order as gravitational acceleration however accumulation phenomena can be enhanced this condition is unlikely in most marine environments yet possible under non homogeneous flow conditions as those encountered in the bottom boundary layer de lillo et al 2014 in an effort to advance current understanding of how gyrotactic swimmers propel themselves through a wind sheared fluid in this paper we investigate their dynamics for the reference case of turbulent open channel flow in particular we want to quantify the effect of wind on the vertical migration of swimmers at varying gyrotaxis covering a wide range of re orientation times and at self propelling speeds that are typical of the most common phytoplankton species to this aim we use direct numerical simulation dns and lagrangian particle tracking lpt modeling swimmers as inertialess pointwise spheres advected by the local fluid velocity while moving with constant self propelling speed in the direction of their orientation vector the same methodology has been recently applied to study the surfacing of floaters and the rising of aquatic micro organisms in free surface turbulence with and without thermal stratification lovecchio et al 2013 2017 2014 in particular lovecchio et al 2013 showed that clusters at the free surface outlive the eulerian turbulent structures that produced them this finding was later confirmed by pratt et al 2017 and indicates that the instantaneous divergence field alone is not sufficient to capture the formation of the cluster fractal structure and that a lagrangian approach is needed to capture this long term clustering we analyze the effect of different wind directions on surfacing and clustering of the swimmers we perform this analysis considering swimmers with different bottom heaviness because this is known to drive different spatial cell distributions and possibly determine the success of different species in processes like the competition for nutrients and sexual reproduction arrieta et al 2015 durham et al 2011 in particular we take into account the competition between the capability of the swimmers to re orient themselves against gravity which favors preferential alignment in the vertical direction and in turn surfacing and the action of the small scale turbulent fluctuations around the swimmer which favors tumbling and may hinder surfacing in the present flow configuration the effect of wind is reproduced imposing a constant shear stress at the free surface the paper is organized as follows the problem statement the governing equations and the numerical methodology used for the simulations are presented in section 2 section 3 is devoted to the analysis and discussion of concentration and orientation statistics which are used to examine the occurrence of temporary confinement regions for both short and long re orientation times finally concluding remarks are made in section 4 2 physical problem and methodology the physical problem considered in this study is the dispersion of gyrotactic swimmers in a wind sheared turbulent flow in an open channel with a flat undeformable surface free surface turbulence the choice of imposing a flat free surface is based on the findings of several previous studies gutiérrez and aumaître 2016 lovecchio et al 2013 2014 2015 which have shown that light particles moving at the deformed free surface of a turbulent flow are subject to clustering mechanisms that come from the horizontal divergence in the surface these mechanisms induce a compressible effect similar to the one observed for flat surface in addition transfer mechanisms across a gas liquid interface like the one considered in this study are controlled mainly by coherent structures on the liquid side for wind driven turbulence under the condition of low wind velocity and no wave breaking takagaki et al 2016 the reference geometry consists of two horizontal infinite flat parallel walls with the x y and z axis of the coordinate system pointing in the streamwise spanwise and wall normal directions indicating with h the channel height the size of the channel is 2πh πh h in x y and z respectively conservation of mass and momentum of the fluid is described by the following set of three dimensional time dependent equations written in dimensionless vector form 1 u 0 2 u t u u p 1 r e τ 2 u δ p where u u x u y u z is the fluid velocity p is the gradient of the fluctuating pressure p δ p is the imposed pressure gradient that drives the flow in the streamwise direction and r e τ u τ h ν is the shear reynolds number based on the shear velocity uτ and on the kinematic fluid viscosity ν μ ρ with μ the fluid kinematic viscosity and ρ the fluid density the shear velocity is defined as u τ τ w ρ with τw the mean shear stress at the bottom wall in the reference case of no wind forcing acting on the free surface based on this definition δ p 2 π ρ u τ 2 in dimensional units for the fluid velocity periodic boundary conditions are applied in x and y whereas no slip boundary conditions are enforced at the bottom wall u x u y u z 0 at the free surface a zero vertical velocity no penetration boundary condition is imposed in combination with a constant stress boundary condition applied to model the wind induced forcing in particular the condition τ x y z h τ w i n d is imposed to simulate the case of wind blowing in the streamwise direction referred to as co current wind hereinafter whereas the condition τ x y z h τ w i n d is imposed to simulate the case of wind blowing against the streamwise direction referred to as counter current wind hereinafter eqs 1 and 2 are discretized using a pseudo spectral method based on transforming the field variables into the wavenumber space through a fourier representation for the periodic homogeneous directions x and y and a chebychev representation for the wall normal non homogeneous direction z a two level explicit adams bashfort scheme for the non linear terms and an implicit crank nicolson method for the viscous terms are employed for the time advancement as commonly done in pseudospectral methods the convective non linear terms are first computed in the physical space and then transformed in the wavenumber space using a de aliasing procedure based on the 2 3 rule derivatives are evaluated directly in the wavenumber space to maintain spectral accuracy further details can be found in lovecchio et al 2013 individual swimmers are modeled as spherical particles whose position x p evolves in time according to the following equation 3 x p t u p x p t v s p where vs is the constant swimming speed u p x p t the velocity of fluid in the position of swimmer and p defines the spatial orientation of the swimmer the orientation vector p evolves in time according to the response of the swimmer to the biasing torques acting upon it the viscous torque on the swimmer body caused by the local shear and the gyrotactic torque arising from bottom heaviness pedley and kessler 1992 see fig 1 for spherical inertialess swimmers the orientation rate is computed from the following equation voth and soldati 2017 4 d p d t 1 2 b k k p p 1 2 ω p p where k 0 0 1 is a unit vector pointing upward in the vertical direction ω p is the fluid vorticity at the swimmer s position and b is the characteristic time a perturbed gyrotactic swimmer takes to return to the vertical orientation when ω p 0 such re orientation time can be computed as b μ α 2 h ρ g where α is the dimensionless resistance coefficient for rotation about an axis perpendicular to p and h is the center of mass offset relative to the center of buoyancy located at point b in fig 1 the first term on the right hand side of eq 4 represents the tendency of a swimmer to remain aligned with the vertical direction due to bottom heaviness while the second term represents the tendency of fluid vorticity to overturn the swimmer through a viscous torque the time evolution of swimmer s position and orientation were computed upon time integration of the non dimensional form of eqs 3 and 4 which read as 5 d x p d t u p x p t φ p 6 d p d t ψ k k p p 1 2 ω p p where superscript represents dimensionless variables in wall units obtained using uτ and ν the key parameters in eqs 5 and 6 are the swimming number φ v s u τ and the stability number ψ 1 2 b ν u τ 2 which parameterises the importance of vortical overturning with respect to directional swimming time integration exploits a fourth order adams bashforth scheme starting from a two dimensional random distribution in both space and orientation of 106 lagrangian swimmers at the centerplane of the channel swimmers are tracked using a point particle approach justified by the sub kolmogorov size typical of aquatic micro organisms and are injected into the flow at a concentration low enough to consider dilute conditions the effect of the swimmers on turbulence is neglected one way coupling as well as collisions between swimmers periodic boundary conditions are imposed on swimmers moving outside the computational domain in the horizontal homogeneous directions in the wall normal direction the swimmers rebound elastically at both boundaries the assumption of fully elastic rebound to describe particle interaction with a free surface might not be obvious indeed the proper numerical modeling of particle rebound at a free surface is an issue that has been little explored in the literature as far as point particle euler lagrange simulations in open channel flow are concerned we are only aware of the study by chidambaran et al 2003 where the free surface was treated as a perfectly absorbing boundary in the present study we have decided to impose an elastic rebound because differently from inelastic rebound or absorbing wall it does not enhance artificially particle trapping at the free surface hence this boundary condition is the most conservative as far as surfacing is concerned in addition it appears reasonable in view of the fact that swimmers see the free surface as a non deformable boundary we also remark that any other choice of boundary condition would have imposed a constraint on particle dynamics a perfectly absorbing free surface would have required re initialization of the absorbed particle to keep the total number of particles constant in time this way however the velocities of the reintroduced particles would have been affected by the imposed initial condition for a certain amount of time an inelastic rebound would have required to select the value of the restitution coefficient which accounts for the amount of energy dissipated during the contact to the best of our knowledge this problem has never been investigated and therefore the only option one is left with is to pick an arbitrary value the fluid velocity and vorticity at the instantaneous location of the swimmer is obtained through interpolation based on 6th order lagrange polynomials a campaign of direct numerical simulations summarized in table 1 was performed to investigate the role of wind induced shear on the motion of the swimmers all simulations were run at reference reynolds number r e τ 171 with spatial grid resolution of 128 128 129 points grid points are uniformly distributed in the horizontal directions x and y and the corresponding grid spacings are δ x 8 4 and δ y 4 2 in the wall normal direction a non uniform distribution of nodes based on chebychev polynomials has been used and the grid spacing varies from δ z 0 025 near the vertical boundaries to δ z 2 12 in the domain center considering that the kolmogorov length scale in the flow ranges from η k 1 6 at the bottom wall to η k 3 6 at the free surface this resolution appears sufficient to solve for all flow scales as shown by nagaosa 1999 nagaosa and hadler 2003 and calmet and magnaudet 2003 the structure of the turbulent flow that characterizes the free surface at reynolds numbers comparable to the one considered in the present study is strongly connected to the bursting phenomena that occur near the bottom wall the imposed wind stress was set equal to τ w i n d 0 006 pa 0 7 in wall units for the counter current wind simulations indicated as s1 in table 1 and to τ w i n d 0 003 pa 0 35 in wall units for the co current wind simulations indicated as s2 in table 1 these values correspond to a mild wind speed of about 1 5 m s at a reference altitude of 10 m yelland and taylor 1996 based on the experimental findings of walker and peirson 2008 such wind speed does not generate any wave motion at an air water interface present results thus apply to gas liquid interfaces that are free of impurities or surfactants and to situations in which surface tension and gravity are sufficiently strong namely the froude and weber numbers are sufficiently small to damp the vertical liquid motions at the surface we also remark that the restriction to a non deformable free surface and a uniform wind stress excludes processes such as wave breaking and langmuir circulations kramer et al 2010 to relate the two forces driving the flow i e the pressure gradient and the free surface stress the ratio r τ τ w i n d τ w a l l between the applied surface stress and the maximum stress observed at the bottom τwall can be used in the present simulations wind forcing yields r τ 0 3 clearly r τ 0 with no forcing to simulate the motion of the micro organisms we considered a fixed value of the swimming number φ 0 048 corresponding to a dimensional swimming velocity v s 100 μ m s typical of chlamydomonas augustae cells croze et al 2013 durham et al 2013 but three different values of the stability number ψ h 1 13 ψ i 0 113 ψ l 0 0113 corresponding to b 0 054 0 54 and 5 4 s respectively these values fall within the typical range of motile phytoplankton species 0 1 s b 10 s we remark here that in the present flow configuration the kolmogorov timescale varies from τ k m i n 2 at the wall to τ k m a x 13 at the free surface lovecchio et al 2013 therefore the selected values of the stability number correspond to three different physical instances with respect to τ k m a x at one extreme ψ l τ k m a x o 10 1 represents the case in which the timescale of gravitaxis is large compared to the timescale of the dissipative surface eddies and so the directional motion of the swimmers is dominated by the destabilizing effect of small scale turbulence throughout the channel at the opposite extreme ψ h τ k m a x o 10 represents the case in which the timescale of gravitaxis is small compared to the timescale of the dissipative surface eddies and so the directional motion of the swimmers is dominated by the stabilizing effect of bottom heaviness the intermediate case ψ i τ k m a x o 1 represents the situation in which the two timescales are comparable and so the motion of the swimmers results from the competition between small scale turbulence around each cell and bottom heaviness 3 results and discussion in this section we discuss first the statistical features of the velocity field in the presence of wind forcing at the surface then we examine the effects of such turbulent flow on plankton surfacing in terms of preferential segregation patchiness vertical concentration and orientation distribution 3 1 statistical characterization of the flow field we start our analysis by considering how the wind induced shear influences the mean flow field in the open channel in fig 2 a the mean streamwise velocity profile u x in wall units is shown for the different wind directions as a function of the wall normal distance from the free surface z z r e τ brackets indicate time and space average the averaging procedure is the same adopted in lovecchio et al 2014 and is based on snapshots of the velocity field separated in time exceeding the correlation time and in space exceeding the integral scale a boundary layer is present at the no slip bottom where the fluid velocity is reduced to zero with different slope depending on the type of wind forcing applied in the free surface layer the velocity adapts to the value at the surface which is u x s u r f 24 8 in the co current wind case and u x s u r f 18 4 in the counter current wind case compared to a value u x s u r f 14 1 in the free surface case in fig 2 b we show the corresponding mean shear d u x d z which reaches its maximum value at the bottom wall note that the value of this maximum changes among the different simulations due to wind forcing the wall shear stress in the co current case increases with respect to the free slip simulation whereas the wall shear stress in the counter current case decreases changes of the wall shear stress correspond to changes of the shear velocity and in turn of the shear reynolds number because the overall force balance on the channel is affected elaborating in the co current resp counter current case the effect of wind on the fluid at r e τ 171 is to generate the same fluid statistics that would be obtained in a simulation without wind forcing at suitably higher resp lower shear reynolds number flow field statistics in the different wind configurations must thus be examined taking this effect into account another important feature of d u x d z is that a local peak of shear is reached at the free surface when wind forcing is applied a similar situation is observed in the case of stably stratified turbulent flow where strong shear is generated below the free surface in regions of large temperature gradients and low mixing thermoclines lovecchio et al 2017 our aim is precisely to quantify the effect of such shear on the vertical migration and surfacing of the swimmers in a situation of competition between gravitaxis which tends to preferentially orient the swimmers in the vertical direction and the ambient fluid shear which tends to randomize cell orientation to observe the influence of wind on mixing and turbulence characteristics in fig 3 we examine the root mean square rms of the fluid velocity fluctuations in each direction when no wind forcing is applied solid lines the velocity fluctuations near the bottom wall where turbulence production is maximum are similar to those observed in standard closed channel simulations indicating that the near wall turbulence is not influenced by the presence of a free slip top boundary lovecchio et al 2014 the most evident difference associated to the presence of the free surface is that r m s u x and r m s u y are not zero at the surface itself where r m s u z is bound to vanish thus making turbulence nearly two dimensional in a tiny sub surface layer when wind forcing is applied along the mean flow direction dashed lines all rms components increase significantly throughout the channel with the exception of the very near wall region confined within a distance z 10 from the bottom where the typical dynamics of the wall turbulence is maintained this behavior is related to the increase of wall shear stress and shear velocity observed in the co current case the increase of velocity fluctuations in the horizontal directions persists up to the free surface where r m s u z is less influenced owing to the strong constraint on u z imposed by the assumption of undeformable free surface when wind forcing is applied against the mean flow direction dotted lines a general decrease of velocity fluctuations is found with a slightly weaker effect observed for r m s u x this behavior is related to the decrease of wall shear stress and shear velocity observed in the counter current case therefore counter current wind forcing reduces agitation due to turbulence and has a stabilizing effect on the flow field because the characteristic timescale of turbulent advection along the vertical direction is much shorter one order of magnitude at least than the timescale of self propelling advection the observed changes of velocity fluctuations have a non negligible impact on the vertical motion of gyrotactic swimmers and on their capability to reach the surface 3 2 characterization of plankton clustering through surface divergence planktonic swimmers are initially positioned midway between the bottom wall and the free surface z h 0 5 with random orientation due to gravitaxis swimmers tend to rise towards the free surface once there helped by the reduction of wall normal velocity fluctuations gravitaxis further acts to keep the cells at the surface in this region of the flow swimmer dynamics is closely related to the local structure of the velocity field lovecchio et al 2013 2014 for the flow reynolds number considered in this study turbulence at the free surface is nearly two dimensional with surface structures generated and sustained by bursting phenomena that are continuously produced by wall shear turbulence inside the buffer layer calmet and magnaudet 2003 nagaosa 1999 nagaosa and hadler 2003 the correlation between free surface structures and bursting phenomena is known to weaken as the flow reynolds number increases calmet and magnaudet 2003 two dimensional turbulence can be characterized by the divergence of the velocity field 7 2 d u x v y w z in the present flow configuration 2d does not vanish at the free surface cressman et al 2004 therefore plankton cells probe a compressible two dimensional system lovecchio et al 2013 where velocity sources are regions of local flow expansion 2d 0 generated by sub surface upwellings and velocity sinks are regions of local compression 2d 0 due to downwellings cressman et al 2004 in fig 4 we provide a qualitative characterization of plankton clustering on the free surface by correlating the instantaneous particle patterns with the colormap of 2d strong velocity sources are visualised in red strong velocity sinks are visualised in blue all flow configurations and all gyrotaxis levels are considered in this figure as shown by lovecchio et al 2013 2017 2014 a general behavior common to all cases we examined is that plankton cells reach the surface mainly through velocity sources and subsequently collect into velocity sinks once trapped in these regions swimmers organize themselves in clusters that are stretched by the fluid forming filamentary structures eventually sharp patches of plankton density distribution are produced which correlate very well with the rapidly changing patches of 2d as shown by fig 4 similar behavior the formation of clusters with fractal mass distribution has been observed for the case of floaters in surface flow turbulence both with lovecchio et al 2014 and without mean shear lovecchio et al 2013 fig 4 demonstrates clearly that the topology of the velocity sources sinks and the fractal dimension of the plankton clusters are both dependent on the wind forcing and on gyrotaxis in the reference case of free surface flow with no wind forcing top panels in fig 4 we observe a clear and rather sharp alternation of sources and sinks flanked by densely populated clusters forming only for high enough gyrotaxis corresponding to stability numbers equal to or larger than ψi in our simulations if gyrotaxis is low as in panel 4 a then only very few cells can reach the surface and no evident cluster is formed in the co current wind case middle row panels in fig 4 we observe a sharper alternation of velocity sources and sinks which appear to be characterized by smaller spatial extent this is in agreement with the increase of velocity fluctuations in the horizontal directions discussed previously clusters form only in the case of very high gyrotaxis fig 4f indicating that plankton cells need strong vertical stability to overcome the wind induced shear barrier and reach the surface compared to the no wind case with ψ ψ h fig 4c clustered filaments appear to be more concentrated and aligned with the mean flow direction in the counter current wind case bottom row panels in fig 4 we observe a strikingly different flow topology surface flow structures more rarely appear in the form of strong sources sinks in agreement with the observed decrease of velocity fluctuations on the surface plane clusters start forming already at intermediate gyrotaxis ψ ψ i fig 4h yet become evident only in the high gyrotaxis case ψ ψ h fig 4i indeed compared to the co current case the counter current wind generates lower shear in the near surface layers which can thus be reached also by cells with intermediate vertical stability compared to the ψh case with no wind forcing fig 4c clustered filaments appear again more aligned with the mean flow direction 3 3 characterization of plankton surfacing the different clustering dynamics discussed in fig 4 provide qualitative evidence of significant wind effects on the capability of motile organisms to migrate vertically and reach the surface to quantify this effect we examine next the instantaneous swimmer concentration c z along the vertical direction the concentration c z represents a volumetric number density and has been obtained by coarse graining the instantaneous vertical position of the swimmers on horizontal fluid slabs this observable is shown in fig 5 at the end of the simulation namely at time t 2000 after injection of the plankton cells into the turbulent flow and for all cases simulated in the r τ ψ parameter space each profile in fig 5 corresponds to a specific level of gyrotaxis the inset in each panel provides a close up view of the different concentration profiles below the free surface for ease of reading symbols have been added to lines in the free slip case fig 5a concentration builds up within a thin layer just below the surface the maximum value of concentration is reached right at the surface and increases monotonically with gyrotaxis in the bulk of the flow the distribution of the swimmers remains uniform whereas the bottom wall is depleted of cells indicating a continuous steady migration towards the free surface in the co current case fig 5b it can be observed that wind induced shear prevents the formation of the concentration peak unless the vertical stability of the swimmers is high as indicated by the black squares in the inset of fig 5b accumulation is prohibited when swimmers react slowly to external fluid velocity fluctuations and gradients similar considerations can be made for the counter current case fig 5c noting that wind induced shear is lower compared to the co current case and therefore a detectable concentration peak can develop also at ψi a general conclusion that can be drawn from fig 5 is that differently from the case of steady shear flows or homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows de lillo et al 2014 durham et al 2009 fouxon and leshansky 2015 ghorai 2016 hoecker martínez and smyth 2012 manela and frankel 2003 santamaria et al 2014 thorn and bearon 2016 zhan et al 2014 no gyrotactic trapping occurs and local peaks of concentration do not develop below the high shear layers below the surface this happens because the characteristic timescale of turbulent advection along the vertical direction is much shorter one order of magnitude at least than the timescale of self propelling advection therefore the concentration profiles in the turbulence dominated region are always smoothed out by turbulent advection mechanisms to conclude our analysis of wind effects on swimmer dynamics we present orientation statistics in particular in fig 6 we show the behavior of px and pz along the wall normal direction for all simulated cases to correlate swimmer orientation with vertical migration and surfacing we focus our attention on the upper portion of the flow domain where the swimmers interact with wind induced shear in the free slip case panels a and d in fig 6 px is always small while pz increases with ψ it is clear that even without wind forcing turbulence can disrupt directional swimming for low gyrotaxis a similar finding has been reported for floaters lovecchio et al 2013 2014 as gyrotaxis increases bottom heaviness becomes predominant and allows swimmers to reach an equilibrium orientation in the direction opposite to gravity in the co current case panels b and e in fig 6 weak resp strong vertical swimming is observed for low resp high gyrotaxis for the ψl case this result indicates that local turbulent fluctuations are still strong enough to destabilize the directional motion of the swimmers being ψ l τ k m a x o 10 1 and wind induced shear seems to bring minor quantitative changes to the statistics for the ψh case it indicates that cell motility is mainly determined by gravitaxis since gravitational acceleration is larger than fluid acceleration and ψ h τ k m a x o 10 in this limit we always find pz 1 a less trivial behavior is observed for the ψi case compared to the free slip flow significantly higher values of px associated to lower values of pz are now observed within the wind induced high shear surface layer this is a mean shear effect which explains the non monotonic behavior of px with ψ and becomes more evident when ψ i τ k m a x o 1 namely when the re orientation time of the swimmers is of the same order of the characteristic timescale of the small scale dissipative turbulent eddies near the surface note that once swimmers are able to trespass the high shear region and reach the surface they tend to align in the horizontal flow direction because wall normal turbulent fluctuations decay to zero and swimmers are brought about only by the residual streamwise and spanwise fluid velocities lovecchio et al 2014 in the counter current case panels c and f of fig 6 similar considerations can be made yet observing that the direction of wind produces a negative value of px near the surface this value being maximum p x 0 7 for ψ ψ i in such situation swimmers can move against the mean flow aided by wind forcing we remark here that the non monotonic behavior of px for ψ ψ i is never observed near the wall where both orientation components depend monotonically on the stability number such difference may be explained considering that in this region of the flow the kolmogorov timescale is about one order of magnitude smaller than at the free surface therefore the product ψ τ k is always order one for ψ ψ l or higher for ψ ψi and gravitaxis tends to be more important than the ambient fluid turbulence the main conclusion that can be drawn from the concentration and orientation statistics examined in this section is that wind may have a significant damping effect on the surfacing of motile micro organisms which exhibit a narrower vertical spreading within the flow only organisms with high enough gyrotaxis namely strong enough bottom heaviness can maintain their ability to swim upwards a similar behavior was observed in the presence of temperature induced stable stratification lovecchio et al 2017 which appears to hinder surfacing and damp vertical mixing when temperature gradients are large enough to generate thermoclines and internal gravity waves this effect may have important consequences for environmental processes such as spring phytoplankton bloom and growth which are known to occur when turbulent mixing is sufficiently weak enriquez and taylor 2015 4 conclusions in this study we used direct numerical simulation and lagrangian tracking to investigate the role of wind induced shear on the vertical migration of gyrotactic swimmers in stably stratified free surface turbulent channel flow an extensive campaign of simulations was performed for different wind forcing and different re orientation times of the swimmers representative of common motile phytoplankton species and corresponding to different quickness in responding to external fluctuations in the present physical configuration the flow is driven by a constant pressure gradient simulations were run at shear reynolds number r e τ 171 and stability number ψ 0 0113 0 113 and 1 3 in such flow the flow structure near the free surface is strongly correlated with the active turbulent bursting phenomena that occur near the bottom wall calmet and magnaudet 2003 nagaosa 1999 nagaosa and hadler 2003 flow field modifications due to wind induced shear are found to influence the ability of swimmers to reach the surface in particular we find that wind induced shear modifies the vertical spread of the swimmers and their orientation with respect to the direction of gravity for all gyrotactic re orientation times considered in this study spanning two orders of magnitude of the stability number we observe a reduction of the cell rising speed and temporary confinement under the high shear sub surface layers if re orientation is fast cells make it through the wind induced shear region within the simulated time span and accumulate at the surface where high concentration levels may be reached if re orientation is slow confinement lasts much longer because cells tend to align in the streamwise direction and lose their ability to swim upwards we believe that these findings provide useful indications to parameterize the influence of wind forcing on the migration of motile algae phytoplankton cells in particular and to develop models for predicting their dispersion inside large water bodies a future development of this study is the relative influence of wind driven mixing and thermal stratification due to surface heating this problem has been examined recently by enriquez and taylor 2015 with the aim of understanding how these physical drivers may trigger phytoplankton blooms it would be interesting to examine the role of these drivers on phytoplankton vertical migration and surfacing thermal stratification in water bodies influences the exchange of heat momentum and chemical species across the air water interface by modifying the sub surface turbulence characteristics in particular for strong enough surface heating internal gravity waves ferrari and wunsch 2009 hingsamer et al 2014 zonta et al 2012 may arise due to the instability generated by lumps of denser cold fluid being lifted upwards into regions of lighter warm fluid by turbulence and subsequently driven downwards by buoyancy these waves form near the free surface correlate well with regions of the flow characterized by large temperature gradients and low mixing thermoclines taylor et al 2005 and can act as thermal barrier for organic and inorganic matter lovecchio et al 2017 with possible consequences on biogeochemical cycles climate patterns and marine ecosystems which are strongly sensitive to changes in marine biomass concentration acevedo trejos et al 2015 another interesting situation to investigate would be the motion of gryotactic swimmers in a wind sheared flow subjected to an oscillating pressure gradient which mimics a water layer in a shallow tidal channel or estuary kramer et al 2010 acknowledgments we gratefully acknowledge the cineca supercomputing center bologna

644,we examine the effect of wind induced shear on the orientation and distribution of motile micro swimmers in free surface turbulence winds blowing above the air water interface can influence the distribution and productivity of motile organisms via the shear generated just below the surface swimmer dynamics depend not only on the advection of the fluid but also on external stimuli like nutrient concentration light gravity which are in turn coupled to and influenced by the distribution of the swimmers here we focus on gyrotaxis resulting from the gravitational torque generated by an asymmetric mass distribution within the organism the combination of such torque with the viscous torque due to shear can reorient swimmers reducing their vertical migration and causing entrapment in horizontal fluid layers through dns based euler lagrangian simulations we investigate the effect of wind induced shear on the motion of gyrotactic swimmers in turbulent open channel flow we consider different wind forcing and swimmers with different reorientation time reflecting the ability to react to turbulent fluctuations we show that only stable high gyrotaxis swimmers may reach the surface and form densely concentrated filaments the topology of which depends on the wind direction otherwise swimmers exhibit weaker vertical fluxes and loose segregation at the surface keywords clustering free surface shear flows turbulence gyrotaxis numerical simulation 1 introduction wind induced shear has a profound effect on the transport and mixing processes in the upper layers of large water bodies in oceans wind shear affects the vertical distribution and residence time of phytoplankton species rising and sinking across the near surface region enriquez and taylor 2015 moreno ostos et al 2009 in lakes where water movement is mainly driven by wind field measurements have shown that strong heterogeneities can be induced in the horizontal concentration distribution patchiness of phytoplankton cells mcgillicuddy 2007 verhagen 1994 in the case of shallow productive lakes wind induced currents can also influence phytoplankton biomass and composition carrick et al 1993 motivated by this practical importance wind forced physical biological models that provide statistical estimates of the seasonal phytoplankton cycles in marine ecosystems have been developed macías et al 2012 and simulations aimed at understanding the effect of wind on the physical and or biological triggers of spring phytoplankton blooms have been performed enriquez and taylor 2015 mcgillicuddy 2007 one important source of complexity associated with modeling and simulation of plankton interaction with wind forced fluid turbulence is plankton motility many phytoplankton species are self propelled durham et al 2009 durham and stocker 2012 guasto et al 1992 and even if their swimming speeds are typically smaller than ambient flow speeds there is well documented evidence that the interplay between motility and turbulence can result in complex and ecologically important phenomena durham et al 2011 guasto et al 1992 in particular motility can lead to a striking focusing effect known as gyrotaxis when coupled with shear in the form of vertical gradients in horizontal fluid velocity guasto et al 1992 hoecker martínez and smyth 2012 gyrotaxis is the directed motility of cells arising from the combination of gravitaxis which stabilizes cell orientation in the vertical direction typically through bottom heaviness and destabilization by the ambient fluid shear durham et al 2011 2009 durham and stocker 2012 kessler 1986 pedley and kessler 1990 1992 this results in a balance between the gravitational torque due to the uneven density distribution within the cell which tends to keep the center of mass below the center of buoyancy and the hydrodynamic torque exerted by the fluid that surrounds the cell gyrotaxis was first observed by showing that phytoplankton cells tend to collect along the centerline of a laminar poiseuille flow kessler 1986 subsequent experiments and simulations have demonstrated that gyrotactic plankton can be trapped in horizontal layers in laminar vertical shear durham et al 2009 ghorai 2016 santamaria et al 2014 only recently it was discovered that plankton accumulation due to gyrotaxis can occur also in synthetic or homogeneous isotropic turbulence croze et al 2013 de lillo et al 2013 2014 durham et al 2013 santamaria et al 2014 thorn and bearon 2016 zhan et al 2014 in this situation the resulting spatial distribution is far from uniform and small scale densely concentrated clusters with fractal properties are observed de lillo et al 2014 durham et al 2013 fouxon and leshansky 2015 zhan et al 2014 gradients in plankton concentration typically span a huge range of length scales from regions covering thousands of kilometres to patchiness occuring at the scale of centimetres dekshenieks et al 2001 durham et al 2009 steinbuck et al 2009 experiments have shown that gyrotactic trapping durham et al 2009 durham and stocker 2012 occurs when vertically migrating cells reach localized areas of the flow where the vertical gradient of horizontal velocity exceeds a critical shear threshold this causes cells to tumble end over end disrupting collective upward motions and preventing any equilibrium orientation from being reached to the best of our knowledge the interplay between wind induced shear and gyrotaxis in a three dimensional turbulent flow has never been examined in detail therefore the physical mechanisms that govern the dynamics of motile aquatic micro organisms referred to as swimmers hereinafter in wind sheared turbulence are not fully understood and the possibility of observing trapping phenomena in the presence of strong wind induced shear not yet assessed among the few available numerical studies enriquez and taylor 2015 have examined the competition between wind driven mixing and thermal stratification due to surface heating in triggering spring phytoplankton blooms to this aim an eulerian transport equation with a prescribed depth dependent growth rate model was used to determine the evolution of plankton concentration other processes such as plankton motility and buoyancy were assumed to be too weak to counteract turbulent mixing and therefore were not accounted for other studies see de lillo et al 2014 hoecker martínez and smyth 2012 manela and frankel 2003 thorn and bearon 2016 zhan et al 2014 among others have considered gyrotaxis yet only in idealized or simplified flow configurations and in the absence of stratification for instance hoecker martínez and smyth 2012 considered a two dimensional dynamically unstable stratified shear layer which mimics the surface mixed layer of large water bodies and found that the resulting pre turbulent kelvin helmoltz instability is sufficient to enhance the ability of the shear layer to retain gyrotactic organisms gyrotactic trapping was also observed by manela and frankel 2003 in steady homogeneous shear flow and by thorn and bearon 2016 in synthetic turbulence more recently zhan et al 2014 and de lillo et al 2014 investigated the same phenomena considering three dimensional time dependent homogeneous isotropic turbulence compared to laminar and linear shear flows clustering and patchiness are significantly reduced but still occur in the downwelling regions of the flow zhan et al 2014 when fluid acceleration is of the same order as gravitational acceleration however accumulation phenomena can be enhanced this condition is unlikely in most marine environments yet possible under non homogeneous flow conditions as those encountered in the bottom boundary layer de lillo et al 2014 in an effort to advance current understanding of how gyrotactic swimmers propel themselves through a wind sheared fluid in this paper we investigate their dynamics for the reference case of turbulent open channel flow in particular we want to quantify the effect of wind on the vertical migration of swimmers at varying gyrotaxis covering a wide range of re orientation times and at self propelling speeds that are typical of the most common phytoplankton species to this aim we use direct numerical simulation dns and lagrangian particle tracking lpt modeling swimmers as inertialess pointwise spheres advected by the local fluid velocity while moving with constant self propelling speed in the direction of their orientation vector the same methodology has been recently applied to study the surfacing of floaters and the rising of aquatic micro organisms in free surface turbulence with and without thermal stratification lovecchio et al 2013 2017 2014 in particular lovecchio et al 2013 showed that clusters at the free surface outlive the eulerian turbulent structures that produced them this finding was later confirmed by pratt et al 2017 and indicates that the instantaneous divergence field alone is not sufficient to capture the formation of the cluster fractal structure and that a lagrangian approach is needed to capture this long term clustering we analyze the effect of different wind directions on surfacing and clustering of the swimmers we perform this analysis considering swimmers with different bottom heaviness because this is known to drive different spatial cell distributions and possibly determine the success of different species in processes like the competition for nutrients and sexual reproduction arrieta et al 2015 durham et al 2011 in particular we take into account the competition between the capability of the swimmers to re orient themselves against gravity which favors preferential alignment in the vertical direction and in turn surfacing and the action of the small scale turbulent fluctuations around the swimmer which favors tumbling and may hinder surfacing in the present flow configuration the effect of wind is reproduced imposing a constant shear stress at the free surface the paper is organized as follows the problem statement the governing equations and the numerical methodology used for the simulations are presented in section 2 section 3 is devoted to the analysis and discussion of concentration and orientation statistics which are used to examine the occurrence of temporary confinement regions for both short and long re orientation times finally concluding remarks are made in section 4 2 physical problem and methodology the physical problem considered in this study is the dispersion of gyrotactic swimmers in a wind sheared turbulent flow in an open channel with a flat undeformable surface free surface turbulence the choice of imposing a flat free surface is based on the findings of several previous studies gutiérrez and aumaître 2016 lovecchio et al 2013 2014 2015 which have shown that light particles moving at the deformed free surface of a turbulent flow are subject to clustering mechanisms that come from the horizontal divergence in the surface these mechanisms induce a compressible effect similar to the one observed for flat surface in addition transfer mechanisms across a gas liquid interface like the one considered in this study are controlled mainly by coherent structures on the liquid side for wind driven turbulence under the condition of low wind velocity and no wave breaking takagaki et al 2016 the reference geometry consists of two horizontal infinite flat parallel walls with the x y and z axis of the coordinate system pointing in the streamwise spanwise and wall normal directions indicating with h the channel height the size of the channel is 2πh πh h in x y and z respectively conservation of mass and momentum of the fluid is described by the following set of three dimensional time dependent equations written in dimensionless vector form 1 u 0 2 u t u u p 1 r e τ 2 u δ p where u u x u y u z is the fluid velocity p is the gradient of the fluctuating pressure p δ p is the imposed pressure gradient that drives the flow in the streamwise direction and r e τ u τ h ν is the shear reynolds number based on the shear velocity uτ and on the kinematic fluid viscosity ν μ ρ with μ the fluid kinematic viscosity and ρ the fluid density the shear velocity is defined as u τ τ w ρ with τw the mean shear stress at the bottom wall in the reference case of no wind forcing acting on the free surface based on this definition δ p 2 π ρ u τ 2 in dimensional units for the fluid velocity periodic boundary conditions are applied in x and y whereas no slip boundary conditions are enforced at the bottom wall u x u y u z 0 at the free surface a zero vertical velocity no penetration boundary condition is imposed in combination with a constant stress boundary condition applied to model the wind induced forcing in particular the condition τ x y z h τ w i n d is imposed to simulate the case of wind blowing in the streamwise direction referred to as co current wind hereinafter whereas the condition τ x y z h τ w i n d is imposed to simulate the case of wind blowing against the streamwise direction referred to as counter current wind hereinafter eqs 1 and 2 are discretized using a pseudo spectral method based on transforming the field variables into the wavenumber space through a fourier representation for the periodic homogeneous directions x and y and a chebychev representation for the wall normal non homogeneous direction z a two level explicit adams bashfort scheme for the non linear terms and an implicit crank nicolson method for the viscous terms are employed for the time advancement as commonly done in pseudospectral methods the convective non linear terms are first computed in the physical space and then transformed in the wavenumber space using a de aliasing procedure based on the 2 3 rule derivatives are evaluated directly in the wavenumber space to maintain spectral accuracy further details can be found in lovecchio et al 2013 individual swimmers are modeled as spherical particles whose position x p evolves in time according to the following equation 3 x p t u p x p t v s p where vs is the constant swimming speed u p x p t the velocity of fluid in the position of swimmer and p defines the spatial orientation of the swimmer the orientation vector p evolves in time according to the response of the swimmer to the biasing torques acting upon it the viscous torque on the swimmer body caused by the local shear and the gyrotactic torque arising from bottom heaviness pedley and kessler 1992 see fig 1 for spherical inertialess swimmers the orientation rate is computed from the following equation voth and soldati 2017 4 d p d t 1 2 b k k p p 1 2 ω p p where k 0 0 1 is a unit vector pointing upward in the vertical direction ω p is the fluid vorticity at the swimmer s position and b is the characteristic time a perturbed gyrotactic swimmer takes to return to the vertical orientation when ω p 0 such re orientation time can be computed as b μ α 2 h ρ g where α is the dimensionless resistance coefficient for rotation about an axis perpendicular to p and h is the center of mass offset relative to the center of buoyancy located at point b in fig 1 the first term on the right hand side of eq 4 represents the tendency of a swimmer to remain aligned with the vertical direction due to bottom heaviness while the second term represents the tendency of fluid vorticity to overturn the swimmer through a viscous torque the time evolution of swimmer s position and orientation were computed upon time integration of the non dimensional form of eqs 3 and 4 which read as 5 d x p d t u p x p t φ p 6 d p d t ψ k k p p 1 2 ω p p where superscript represents dimensionless variables in wall units obtained using uτ and ν the key parameters in eqs 5 and 6 are the swimming number φ v s u τ and the stability number ψ 1 2 b ν u τ 2 which parameterises the importance of vortical overturning with respect to directional swimming time integration exploits a fourth order adams bashforth scheme starting from a two dimensional random distribution in both space and orientation of 106 lagrangian swimmers at the centerplane of the channel swimmers are tracked using a point particle approach justified by the sub kolmogorov size typical of aquatic micro organisms and are injected into the flow at a concentration low enough to consider dilute conditions the effect of the swimmers on turbulence is neglected one way coupling as well as collisions between swimmers periodic boundary conditions are imposed on swimmers moving outside the computational domain in the horizontal homogeneous directions in the wall normal direction the swimmers rebound elastically at both boundaries the assumption of fully elastic rebound to describe particle interaction with a free surface might not be obvious indeed the proper numerical modeling of particle rebound at a free surface is an issue that has been little explored in the literature as far as point particle euler lagrange simulations in open channel flow are concerned we are only aware of the study by chidambaran et al 2003 where the free surface was treated as a perfectly absorbing boundary in the present study we have decided to impose an elastic rebound because differently from inelastic rebound or absorbing wall it does not enhance artificially particle trapping at the free surface hence this boundary condition is the most conservative as far as surfacing is concerned in addition it appears reasonable in view of the fact that swimmers see the free surface as a non deformable boundary we also remark that any other choice of boundary condition would have imposed a constraint on particle dynamics a perfectly absorbing free surface would have required re initialization of the absorbed particle to keep the total number of particles constant in time this way however the velocities of the reintroduced particles would have been affected by the imposed initial condition for a certain amount of time an inelastic rebound would have required to select the value of the restitution coefficient which accounts for the amount of energy dissipated during the contact to the best of our knowledge this problem has never been investigated and therefore the only option one is left with is to pick an arbitrary value the fluid velocity and vorticity at the instantaneous location of the swimmer is obtained through interpolation based on 6th order lagrange polynomials a campaign of direct numerical simulations summarized in table 1 was performed to investigate the role of wind induced shear on the motion of the swimmers all simulations were run at reference reynolds number r e τ 171 with spatial grid resolution of 128 128 129 points grid points are uniformly distributed in the horizontal directions x and y and the corresponding grid spacings are δ x 8 4 and δ y 4 2 in the wall normal direction a non uniform distribution of nodes based on chebychev polynomials has been used and the grid spacing varies from δ z 0 025 near the vertical boundaries to δ z 2 12 in the domain center considering that the kolmogorov length scale in the flow ranges from η k 1 6 at the bottom wall to η k 3 6 at the free surface this resolution appears sufficient to solve for all flow scales as shown by nagaosa 1999 nagaosa and hadler 2003 and calmet and magnaudet 2003 the structure of the turbulent flow that characterizes the free surface at reynolds numbers comparable to the one considered in the present study is strongly connected to the bursting phenomena that occur near the bottom wall the imposed wind stress was set equal to τ w i n d 0 006 pa 0 7 in wall units for the counter current wind simulations indicated as s1 in table 1 and to τ w i n d 0 003 pa 0 35 in wall units for the co current wind simulations indicated as s2 in table 1 these values correspond to a mild wind speed of about 1 5 m s at a reference altitude of 10 m yelland and taylor 1996 based on the experimental findings of walker and peirson 2008 such wind speed does not generate any wave motion at an air water interface present results thus apply to gas liquid interfaces that are free of impurities or surfactants and to situations in which surface tension and gravity are sufficiently strong namely the froude and weber numbers are sufficiently small to damp the vertical liquid motions at the surface we also remark that the restriction to a non deformable free surface and a uniform wind stress excludes processes such as wave breaking and langmuir circulations kramer et al 2010 to relate the two forces driving the flow i e the pressure gradient and the free surface stress the ratio r τ τ w i n d τ w a l l between the applied surface stress and the maximum stress observed at the bottom τwall can be used in the present simulations wind forcing yields r τ 0 3 clearly r τ 0 with no forcing to simulate the motion of the micro organisms we considered a fixed value of the swimming number φ 0 048 corresponding to a dimensional swimming velocity v s 100 μ m s typical of chlamydomonas augustae cells croze et al 2013 durham et al 2013 but three different values of the stability number ψ h 1 13 ψ i 0 113 ψ l 0 0113 corresponding to b 0 054 0 54 and 5 4 s respectively these values fall within the typical range of motile phytoplankton species 0 1 s b 10 s we remark here that in the present flow configuration the kolmogorov timescale varies from τ k m i n 2 at the wall to τ k m a x 13 at the free surface lovecchio et al 2013 therefore the selected values of the stability number correspond to three different physical instances with respect to τ k m a x at one extreme ψ l τ k m a x o 10 1 represents the case in which the timescale of gravitaxis is large compared to the timescale of the dissipative surface eddies and so the directional motion of the swimmers is dominated by the destabilizing effect of small scale turbulence throughout the channel at the opposite extreme ψ h τ k m a x o 10 represents the case in which the timescale of gravitaxis is small compared to the timescale of the dissipative surface eddies and so the directional motion of the swimmers is dominated by the stabilizing effect of bottom heaviness the intermediate case ψ i τ k m a x o 1 represents the situation in which the two timescales are comparable and so the motion of the swimmers results from the competition between small scale turbulence around each cell and bottom heaviness 3 results and discussion in this section we discuss first the statistical features of the velocity field in the presence of wind forcing at the surface then we examine the effects of such turbulent flow on plankton surfacing in terms of preferential segregation patchiness vertical concentration and orientation distribution 3 1 statistical characterization of the flow field we start our analysis by considering how the wind induced shear influences the mean flow field in the open channel in fig 2 a the mean streamwise velocity profile u x in wall units is shown for the different wind directions as a function of the wall normal distance from the free surface z z r e τ brackets indicate time and space average the averaging procedure is the same adopted in lovecchio et al 2014 and is based on snapshots of the velocity field separated in time exceeding the correlation time and in space exceeding the integral scale a boundary layer is present at the no slip bottom where the fluid velocity is reduced to zero with different slope depending on the type of wind forcing applied in the free surface layer the velocity adapts to the value at the surface which is u x s u r f 24 8 in the co current wind case and u x s u r f 18 4 in the counter current wind case compared to a value u x s u r f 14 1 in the free surface case in fig 2 b we show the corresponding mean shear d u x d z which reaches its maximum value at the bottom wall note that the value of this maximum changes among the different simulations due to wind forcing the wall shear stress in the co current case increases with respect to the free slip simulation whereas the wall shear stress in the counter current case decreases changes of the wall shear stress correspond to changes of the shear velocity and in turn of the shear reynolds number because the overall force balance on the channel is affected elaborating in the co current resp counter current case the effect of wind on the fluid at r e τ 171 is to generate the same fluid statistics that would be obtained in a simulation without wind forcing at suitably higher resp lower shear reynolds number flow field statistics in the different wind configurations must thus be examined taking this effect into account another important feature of d u x d z is that a local peak of shear is reached at the free surface when wind forcing is applied a similar situation is observed in the case of stably stratified turbulent flow where strong shear is generated below the free surface in regions of large temperature gradients and low mixing thermoclines lovecchio et al 2017 our aim is precisely to quantify the effect of such shear on the vertical migration and surfacing of the swimmers in a situation of competition between gravitaxis which tends to preferentially orient the swimmers in the vertical direction and the ambient fluid shear which tends to randomize cell orientation to observe the influence of wind on mixing and turbulence characteristics in fig 3 we examine the root mean square rms of the fluid velocity fluctuations in each direction when no wind forcing is applied solid lines the velocity fluctuations near the bottom wall where turbulence production is maximum are similar to those observed in standard closed channel simulations indicating that the near wall turbulence is not influenced by the presence of a free slip top boundary lovecchio et al 2014 the most evident difference associated to the presence of the free surface is that r m s u x and r m s u y are not zero at the surface itself where r m s u z is bound to vanish thus making turbulence nearly two dimensional in a tiny sub surface layer when wind forcing is applied along the mean flow direction dashed lines all rms components increase significantly throughout the channel with the exception of the very near wall region confined within a distance z 10 from the bottom where the typical dynamics of the wall turbulence is maintained this behavior is related to the increase of wall shear stress and shear velocity observed in the co current case the increase of velocity fluctuations in the horizontal directions persists up to the free surface where r m s u z is less influenced owing to the strong constraint on u z imposed by the assumption of undeformable free surface when wind forcing is applied against the mean flow direction dotted lines a general decrease of velocity fluctuations is found with a slightly weaker effect observed for r m s u x this behavior is related to the decrease of wall shear stress and shear velocity observed in the counter current case therefore counter current wind forcing reduces agitation due to turbulence and has a stabilizing effect on the flow field because the characteristic timescale of turbulent advection along the vertical direction is much shorter one order of magnitude at least than the timescale of self propelling advection the observed changes of velocity fluctuations have a non negligible impact on the vertical motion of gyrotactic swimmers and on their capability to reach the surface 3 2 characterization of plankton clustering through surface divergence planktonic swimmers are initially positioned midway between the bottom wall and the free surface z h 0 5 with random orientation due to gravitaxis swimmers tend to rise towards the free surface once there helped by the reduction of wall normal velocity fluctuations gravitaxis further acts to keep the cells at the surface in this region of the flow swimmer dynamics is closely related to the local structure of the velocity field lovecchio et al 2013 2014 for the flow reynolds number considered in this study turbulence at the free surface is nearly two dimensional with surface structures generated and sustained by bursting phenomena that are continuously produced by wall shear turbulence inside the buffer layer calmet and magnaudet 2003 nagaosa 1999 nagaosa and hadler 2003 the correlation between free surface structures and bursting phenomena is known to weaken as the flow reynolds number increases calmet and magnaudet 2003 two dimensional turbulence can be characterized by the divergence of the velocity field 7 2 d u x v y w z in the present flow configuration 2d does not vanish at the free surface cressman et al 2004 therefore plankton cells probe a compressible two dimensional system lovecchio et al 2013 where velocity sources are regions of local flow expansion 2d 0 generated by sub surface upwellings and velocity sinks are regions of local compression 2d 0 due to downwellings cressman et al 2004 in fig 4 we provide a qualitative characterization of plankton clustering on the free surface by correlating the instantaneous particle patterns with the colormap of 2d strong velocity sources are visualised in red strong velocity sinks are visualised in blue all flow configurations and all gyrotaxis levels are considered in this figure as shown by lovecchio et al 2013 2017 2014 a general behavior common to all cases we examined is that plankton cells reach the surface mainly through velocity sources and subsequently collect into velocity sinks once trapped in these regions swimmers organize themselves in clusters that are stretched by the fluid forming filamentary structures eventually sharp patches of plankton density distribution are produced which correlate very well with the rapidly changing patches of 2d as shown by fig 4 similar behavior the formation of clusters with fractal mass distribution has been observed for the case of floaters in surface flow turbulence both with lovecchio et al 2014 and without mean shear lovecchio et al 2013 fig 4 demonstrates clearly that the topology of the velocity sources sinks and the fractal dimension of the plankton clusters are both dependent on the wind forcing and on gyrotaxis in the reference case of free surface flow with no wind forcing top panels in fig 4 we observe a clear and rather sharp alternation of sources and sinks flanked by densely populated clusters forming only for high enough gyrotaxis corresponding to stability numbers equal to or larger than ψi in our simulations if gyrotaxis is low as in panel 4 a then only very few cells can reach the surface and no evident cluster is formed in the co current wind case middle row panels in fig 4 we observe a sharper alternation of velocity sources and sinks which appear to be characterized by smaller spatial extent this is in agreement with the increase of velocity fluctuations in the horizontal directions discussed previously clusters form only in the case of very high gyrotaxis fig 4f indicating that plankton cells need strong vertical stability to overcome the wind induced shear barrier and reach the surface compared to the no wind case with ψ ψ h fig 4c clustered filaments appear to be more concentrated and aligned with the mean flow direction in the counter current wind case bottom row panels in fig 4 we observe a strikingly different flow topology surface flow structures more rarely appear in the form of strong sources sinks in agreement with the observed decrease of velocity fluctuations on the surface plane clusters start forming already at intermediate gyrotaxis ψ ψ i fig 4h yet become evident only in the high gyrotaxis case ψ ψ h fig 4i indeed compared to the co current case the counter current wind generates lower shear in the near surface layers which can thus be reached also by cells with intermediate vertical stability compared to the ψh case with no wind forcing fig 4c clustered filaments appear again more aligned with the mean flow direction 3 3 characterization of plankton surfacing the different clustering dynamics discussed in fig 4 provide qualitative evidence of significant wind effects on the capability of motile organisms to migrate vertically and reach the surface to quantify this effect we examine next the instantaneous swimmer concentration c z along the vertical direction the concentration c z represents a volumetric number density and has been obtained by coarse graining the instantaneous vertical position of the swimmers on horizontal fluid slabs this observable is shown in fig 5 at the end of the simulation namely at time t 2000 after injection of the plankton cells into the turbulent flow and for all cases simulated in the r τ ψ parameter space each profile in fig 5 corresponds to a specific level of gyrotaxis the inset in each panel provides a close up view of the different concentration profiles below the free surface for ease of reading symbols have been added to lines in the free slip case fig 5a concentration builds up within a thin layer just below the surface the maximum value of concentration is reached right at the surface and increases monotonically with gyrotaxis in the bulk of the flow the distribution of the swimmers remains uniform whereas the bottom wall is depleted of cells indicating a continuous steady migration towards the free surface in the co current case fig 5b it can be observed that wind induced shear prevents the formation of the concentration peak unless the vertical stability of the swimmers is high as indicated by the black squares in the inset of fig 5b accumulation is prohibited when swimmers react slowly to external fluid velocity fluctuations and gradients similar considerations can be made for the counter current case fig 5c noting that wind induced shear is lower compared to the co current case and therefore a detectable concentration peak can develop also at ψi a general conclusion that can be drawn from fig 5 is that differently from the case of steady shear flows or homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows de lillo et al 2014 durham et al 2009 fouxon and leshansky 2015 ghorai 2016 hoecker martínez and smyth 2012 manela and frankel 2003 santamaria et al 2014 thorn and bearon 2016 zhan et al 2014 no gyrotactic trapping occurs and local peaks of concentration do not develop below the high shear layers below the surface this happens because the characteristic timescale of turbulent advection along the vertical direction is much shorter one order of magnitude at least than the timescale of self propelling advection therefore the concentration profiles in the turbulence dominated region are always smoothed out by turbulent advection mechanisms to conclude our analysis of wind effects on swimmer dynamics we present orientation statistics in particular in fig 6 we show the behavior of px and pz along the wall normal direction for all simulated cases to correlate swimmer orientation with vertical migration and surfacing we focus our attention on the upper portion of the flow domain where the swimmers interact with wind induced shear in the free slip case panels a and d in fig 6 px is always small while pz increases with ψ it is clear that even without wind forcing turbulence can disrupt directional swimming for low gyrotaxis a similar finding has been reported for floaters lovecchio et al 2013 2014 as gyrotaxis increases bottom heaviness becomes predominant and allows swimmers to reach an equilibrium orientation in the direction opposite to gravity in the co current case panels b and e in fig 6 weak resp strong vertical swimming is observed for low resp high gyrotaxis for the ψl case this result indicates that local turbulent fluctuations are still strong enough to destabilize the directional motion of the swimmers being ψ l τ k m a x o 10 1 and wind induced shear seems to bring minor quantitative changes to the statistics for the ψh case it indicates that cell motility is mainly determined by gravitaxis since gravitational acceleration is larger than fluid acceleration and ψ h τ k m a x o 10 in this limit we always find pz 1 a less trivial behavior is observed for the ψi case compared to the free slip flow significantly higher values of px associated to lower values of pz are now observed within the wind induced high shear surface layer this is a mean shear effect which explains the non monotonic behavior of px with ψ and becomes more evident when ψ i τ k m a x o 1 namely when the re orientation time of the swimmers is of the same order of the characteristic timescale of the small scale dissipative turbulent eddies near the surface note that once swimmers are able to trespass the high shear region and reach the surface they tend to align in the horizontal flow direction because wall normal turbulent fluctuations decay to zero and swimmers are brought about only by the residual streamwise and spanwise fluid velocities lovecchio et al 2014 in the counter current case panels c and f of fig 6 similar considerations can be made yet observing that the direction of wind produces a negative value of px near the surface this value being maximum p x 0 7 for ψ ψ i in such situation swimmers can move against the mean flow aided by wind forcing we remark here that the non monotonic behavior of px for ψ ψ i is never observed near the wall where both orientation components depend monotonically on the stability number such difference may be explained considering that in this region of the flow the kolmogorov timescale is about one order of magnitude smaller than at the free surface therefore the product ψ τ k is always order one for ψ ψ l or higher for ψ ψi and gravitaxis tends to be more important than the ambient fluid turbulence the main conclusion that can be drawn from the concentration and orientation statistics examined in this section is that wind may have a significant damping effect on the surfacing of motile micro organisms which exhibit a narrower vertical spreading within the flow only organisms with high enough gyrotaxis namely strong enough bottom heaviness can maintain their ability to swim upwards a similar behavior was observed in the presence of temperature induced stable stratification lovecchio et al 2017 which appears to hinder surfacing and damp vertical mixing when temperature gradients are large enough to generate thermoclines and internal gravity waves this effect may have important consequences for environmental processes such as spring phytoplankton bloom and growth which are known to occur when turbulent mixing is sufficiently weak enriquez and taylor 2015 4 conclusions in this study we used direct numerical simulation and lagrangian tracking to investigate the role of wind induced shear on the vertical migration of gyrotactic swimmers in stably stratified free surface turbulent channel flow an extensive campaign of simulations was performed for different wind forcing and different re orientation times of the swimmers representative of common motile phytoplankton species and corresponding to different quickness in responding to external fluctuations in the present physical configuration the flow is driven by a constant pressure gradient simulations were run at shear reynolds number r e τ 171 and stability number ψ 0 0113 0 113 and 1 3 in such flow the flow structure near the free surface is strongly correlated with the active turbulent bursting phenomena that occur near the bottom wall calmet and magnaudet 2003 nagaosa 1999 nagaosa and hadler 2003 flow field modifications due to wind induced shear are found to influence the ability of swimmers to reach the surface in particular we find that wind induced shear modifies the vertical spread of the swimmers and their orientation with respect to the direction of gravity for all gyrotactic re orientation times considered in this study spanning two orders of magnitude of the stability number we observe a reduction of the cell rising speed and temporary confinement under the high shear sub surface layers if re orientation is fast cells make it through the wind induced shear region within the simulated time span and accumulate at the surface where high concentration levels may be reached if re orientation is slow confinement lasts much longer because cells tend to align in the streamwise direction and lose their ability to swim upwards we believe that these findings provide useful indications to parameterize the influence of wind forcing on the migration of motile algae phytoplankton cells in particular and to develop models for predicting their dispersion inside large water bodies a future development of this study is the relative influence of wind driven mixing and thermal stratification due to surface heating this problem has been examined recently by enriquez and taylor 2015 with the aim of understanding how these physical drivers may trigger phytoplankton blooms it would be interesting to examine the role of these drivers on phytoplankton vertical migration and surfacing thermal stratification in water bodies influences the exchange of heat momentum and chemical species across the air water interface by modifying the sub surface turbulence characteristics in particular for strong enough surface heating internal gravity waves ferrari and wunsch 2009 hingsamer et al 2014 zonta et al 2012 may arise due to the instability generated by lumps of denser cold fluid being lifted upwards into regions of lighter warm fluid by turbulence and subsequently driven downwards by buoyancy these waves form near the free surface correlate well with regions of the flow characterized by large temperature gradients and low mixing thermoclines taylor et al 2005 and can act as thermal barrier for organic and inorganic matter lovecchio et al 2017 with possible consequences on biogeochemical cycles climate patterns and marine ecosystems which are strongly sensitive to changes in marine biomass concentration acevedo trejos et al 2015 another interesting situation to investigate would be the motion of gryotactic swimmers in a wind sheared flow subjected to an oscillating pressure gradient which mimics a water layer in a shallow tidal channel or estuary kramer et al 2010 acknowledgments we gratefully acknowledge the cineca supercomputing center bologna
