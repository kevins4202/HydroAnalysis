10485,mapping the spatial variability of actual evapotranspiration eta across vineyards is useful for optimizing irrigation scheduling and efficiency leading to conservation of water resources and more sustainable wine grape production to support efficient irrigation strategies we investigate the utility of thermal infrared based eta maps over a range of vineyards located throughout california each representing a unique local climate trellis design grape variety row orientation and management practice eta maps are derived by combining the disaggregated atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi disalexi surface energy balance model and the spatial temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm to generate eta estimates at high spatial 30 m and temporal daily resolution model output is evaluated for years 2017 and 2018 over vineyard sites located in sonoma sacramento and madera counties in california that are being monitored as part of the grape remote sensing atmospheric profile and evapotranspiration experiment grapex overall modeled daily et estimates compare well with flux tower observations with average root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean bias error mbe of 0 88 mm day 1 0 70 mm day 1 and 0 17 mm day 1 respectively over all four individual vineyard locations aligning with past grapex studies despite general agreement record wildfires in northern california during 2018 likely resulted in positive model bias while misrepresentation of leaf area index within a double trellis designed canopy at the southern most vineyard resulted in negative model bias spatial analysis of monthly total et highlights the advantages of utilizing a satellite based approach to characterize the variability in water use within and surrounding the targeted vineyards a reliable spatial et product at scale has the potential to improve water allocation and conservation efforts by identifying areas of uneven water use due to variations in soil texture and composition and other environmental or anthropogenic factors keywords satellite remote sensing evapotranspiration viticulture irrigation 1 introduction water resources in california are becoming increasingly scarce as industry municipalities and agriculture compete for limited water supplies in regions with limited groundwater resources such as the central valley the economic and environmental impacts have been severe prompting regulatory constraints on consumptive water use sustainable groundwater management act of 2014 sgma growers of high valued perennial crops such as wine grapes are increasingly relying on groundwater extraction raising concerns about the long term sustainability of groundwater resources this trend is anticipated to continue as the effects of population growth and climate change evolve to address these challenges there is a need to provide the agricultural sector with information on crop water use which will improve their ability to effectively manage available irrigation water supplies accurate estimates of evapotranspiration et have shown to be a critical part of improving the management of water resources by providing quantifiable values of water use and stress senay et al 2007 anderson et al 2018 knipper et al 2019a b in viticulture accurate estimation of crop et is especially important as it is an indicator of vine stress which may be manipulated through the growing season to influence grape quality and yield heilman et al 1996 yunusa et al 2000 campos et al 2010 galleguillos et al 2011a intrigliolo and castel 2008 shellie 2006 sivilotti et al 2005 excess irrigation can cause reductions in color and sugar content while also producing acidity imbalances in the wine bravdo et al 1985 esteban et al 2001 conversely insufficient irrigation amounts can reduce potential grape yield reynolds and naylor 1994 dos santos et al 2003 therefore reliable et estimates are critical in the viticulture industry to both increase water management efficiency and to determine appropriate vine water stress levels for specific production goals many methods and techniques have been applied to determine vineyard et ground based solutions include the use of lysimeters johnson et al 2005 azevedo et al 2008 netzer et al 2009 eddy covariance spano et al 2000 ortega farias et al 2010 rodriquez et al 2010 bowen ratio energy balance yunusa et al 2004 teixeira et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 soil water balance singleton and maudsley 1996 foodladmand and sepaskhah 2009 cancela et al 2012 heat pulse or heat balance trambouze and voltz 2001 yunusa et al 1997 intrigliolo et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 surface renewal energy balance castellvi and snyder 2010 moratiel and martinez cob 2012 and the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 despite successful results in terms of et estimation these methods simply provide canopy level or at best sub field estimates that are difficult to upscale to vineyard scale and to surrounding vineyards satellite remote sensing solutions however offer operational capabilities by providing routine spatial information useful for determining regional to field scale heterogeneity in vine conditions and water use several satellite based et mapping approaches typically based on surface reflectances or land surface energy balance have been applied specifically to vineyards carrasco benavides et al 2012 2014 galleguillos et al 2011a b vanino et al 2015 campos et al 2010 semmens et al 2016 xia et al 2016 knipper et al 2019a b reflectance based methods include the use of vegetative indices vi such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to estimate the temporal evolution of a crop coefficient kc required for calculating et as described by the fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 alternatively land surface energy balance methods estimate et as the residual component of the surface energy balance equation mainly relying on thermal infrared tir imagery to approximate land surface temperature lst characteristics according to moran 2003 satellite retrievals of lst are particularly useful when deriving et because of the sensitivity of canopy and soil temperatures to variable soil moisture availability numerous tir based et mapping approaches have been developed over the past few decades allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 su 2002 anderson et al 1997 due to significant uncertainties in determining absolute lst most of these approaches use relative measures of lst variability to parameterize et estimates for example end member pixel scaling spatial variability or time differential scaling temporal variability anderson et al 1997 2012 an example of the end member pixel scaling method is the mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 model which is derived from the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 model and uses tir end member pixels within a satellite image to represent limiting hot pixel and non limiting cold pixel moisture conditions the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi anderson et al 1997 2007a 2007b model uses time differential scaling to estimate et relating surface temperature rise in the morning acquired from geostationary satellites to surface moisture availability and latent heat flux alexi et can be downscaled to subfield scales using an associated flux disaggregation technique disalexi norman et al 2003 applied to higher resolution thermal imagery from airborne or polar orbiting platforms in combination the models provide consistent estimates of actual et from sub field scales up to continental and global scales anderson et al 2011a and have been used for drought monitoring anderson et al 2013 2011b 2007b yield estimation anderson et al 2016 yang et al 2018 and water use accounting anderson et al 2018 alexi and disalexi are based on the two source energy balance tseb model that was first described in norman et al 1995 with improvements presented in kustas et al 1996 1999 the tseb model partitions observed directional radiometric temperature and modeled evaporative fluxes between the canopy and soil substrate components of the scene this partitioning capability is beneficial for structured canopies such as vineyards where wide row spacing results in two distinct management zones the vine and the interrow recent refinements to the tseb have addressed the impact of the unique architecture of vineyards on canopy radiation transmission kustas et al 2019 perry et al 2019 and on the in canopy wind profile nieto et al 2018 both of which effect turbulent exchanges of heat and water with the atmosphere architectural characteristics considered include vegetation clumping on the trellis vertical vegetation distribution and row orientation with respect to sun altitude and azimuth and wind direction these refinements have been tested at the local scale using high spatial resolution imagery and regionally with the alexi disalexi model as part of the grape remote sensing atmospheric profile and evapotranspiration experiment grapex kustas et al 2018 one objective of grapex is to develop a generalized parameterization of the multi scale et mapping approach for vineyards with the goal of providing regional operational irrigation management decision support initial studies were conducted over two pinot noir vineyards located near lodi ca sacramento county semmens et al 2016 applied the alexi disalexi model integrated with a data fusion methodology to estimate daily et at 30 m spatial resolution during the first grapex growing season 2013 results indicated good agreement between modeled and ground based flux measurements with root mean square errors rmse just under 1 mm day 1 in comparison with observations semmens et al 2016 a follow on study by knipper et al 2019a extended the lodi analysis from 2013 through 2016 to promote a more comprehensive understanding of seasonal et dynamics comparisons with micrometeorological data indicated reasonable model performance with an rmse of 0 8 mm day 1 at the daily time step and minimal bias anderson et al 2019 investigated impacts of the quality of insolation data used to drive alexi disalexi and obtained average rmse values of 0 74 mm day 1 and 0 68 mm day 1 for the lodi vineyards when using two different satellite based insolation products for water years 2015 and 2016 spatiotemporal analysis for all studies illustrated the ability of alexi disalexi to characterize heterogeneity in et within the vineyards and over the surrounding landscape but were limited in scope both in climate and vine variety and architecture in may of 2017 the grapex project extended data collection to the north sonoma county ca and south madera county ca of these original vineyards to better sample a broader range in climate trellis architectures vine varieties soil properties terrain and irrigation strategies characteristic of california viticulture in 2018 knipper et al 2019b conducted an experiment in real time data production over a variable rate drip irrigation vrdi equipped merlot vineyard west of fresno ca the purpose of the study was to investigate and accommodate the impacts of input data latency in weekly data production and to determine if the satellite based model could detect timely signals of prescribed stress the results of the study were promising indicating a thermal based approach could both be completed in near real time with good fidelity and could decipher stress signals within the vineyard knipper et al 2019b the study also revealed advection as a potential factor at the more southern and arid site neighboring barren fields caused horizontal advection of hot dry air across the vineyard increasing the evaporative demand and causing latent heat fluxes to exceed the available energy to date these studies have typically focused on individual vineyards where characteristics such as grape variety trellis design vine row spacing and orientation and climate are the same the current study expands on this applying the alexi disalexi modeling system to all grapex sites that have been in operation since 2017 the expansion provides a significant climate gradient with degree day accumulations dd and yearly total precipitation ranging from 2500 dd 1000 mm at the northern vineyard to 4200 dd 200 mm at the southern vineyard each individual site is characterized by different grape varieties and trellis designs sampling a range in canopy structure and vine physiology along with varying soil texture type irrigation management practices and climate conditions moreover the inclusion of the northern sonoma county vineyard will test the impacts of topography and early morning clouds caused by cool maritime air this paper discusses the application of the alexi disalexi modeling scheme over four individual vineyard sites during 2017 and 2018 to determine the portability of the multi scale et fusion model to dissimilar vineyards and to identify limitations in critical model inputs and parameterizations for generalized operation ultimately the goal is to provide a simple modeling scheme that does not require site specific information but is robust enough for widespread applications at vineyard management scales 2 study area and instrumentation the analyses presented here use data collected during the years 2017 and 2018 over three wine grape growing regions in california spanning a north south gradient in climatic conditions these sites have been primary targets of micrometeorological and biophysical field measurement as part of the usda ars grape remote sensing atmospheric profile and evapotranspiration experiment grapex kustas et al 2018 fig 1 2 1 experimental vineyards the barrelli site is located north of the san francisco bay area near cloverdale ca in sonoma county fig 1 here we use data from instrumented vineyard block bar012 which is a 10 ha plot composed of cabernet sauvignon grapes trained on a split trellis and drip irrigated table 1 vines were planted in 2010 with 1 8 m vine spacing and 3 35 m row spacing and have a southwest northeast row orientation the sierra loma site is located near the town of lodi ca in sacramento county and contains two instrumented vineyards slm001 and slm002 fig 1 both vineyards are planted with pinot noir vines trained on quadrilateral cordons with 3 35 m row spacing 1 5 m vine spacing and drip irrigated table 1 slm001 has an area of 35 ha with vines planted in 2009 while slm002 has an area of 21 ha and vines planted in 2011 the southern most site referred to as ripperdan rip760 is located in the central valley 30 km west of fresno ca in madera county fig 1 rip760 is a 31 ha block composed of chardonnay grapes trained on double vertical trellis and drip irrigated table 1 vines were planted in 2009 with 1 83 m vine spacing and 2 74 m row spacing and have an east west row orientation both rip760 and slm001 slm002 are relatively flat while bar012 is in hilly terrain 2 2 climate together these vineyards sample a significant climate gradient along with variations in grape variety soil physical properties and vine row orientation fig 2 depicts annual trends in micrometeorological measurements for each region showing daily medians solid line and interquartile ranges iqr shaded area over a 10 year period micrometeorological measurements include grass reference et etref vapor pressure deficit vpd air temperature tair solar radiation solar rad and precipitation precip all measurements were obtained from cimis california irrigation management information system stations located nearest each vineyard stations include sanel valley 38 9825 123 0893 for barrelli fair oaks 38 6499 121 2189 for sierra loma and fresno state 36 8208 119 7423 for ripperdan cimis was developed by the california department of water resources dwr and the university of california davis uc davis to assist irrigators in managing their water resources more efficiently with more than 140 automated weather stations located throughout california the barrelli vineyard and surrounding area are heavily influenced by their proximity to the pacific coast shoreline which provides cool maritime air that draws in layers of oceanic fog and cools the warm interior valleys this characteristically cool and moist air is made apparent in the vpd and air temperature trends fig 2 left column where both remain lower than trends reported over the sierra loma and ripperdan regions during the entire year the cool nights and temperate days characteristic of barrelli and the surrounding area create prime grape growing conditions accordingly grapes in this region are typically grown for quality rather than yield precipitation amounts are highest at barrelli with a majority occurring between november and march although precipitation falls during the same period for all regions trends in amount decrease when transitioning from north to south barrelli to ripperdan sierra loma and ripperdan vineyards experience a warm mediterranean climate characterized by abundant sunshine and large day to night temperature differences these conditions are also excellent for grape production however because of a combination of warm daytime temperatures and sandier soils yield is a greater priority in these regions transitioning from the north coastal region to the southern central valley there is an increase in air temperature and vpd and therefore reference et or atmospheric demand while precipitation amounts decrease significantly daily solar radiation is relatively consistent between sites although the barrelli region is more impacted by cloud cover and early morning clouds fog early in the year indicated by the lower iqr 2 3 field measurements data collected at each location as part of grapex are used to evaluate and refine the et modeling framework detect vine stress and monitor biomass development and root zone soil water availability micrometeorological and biophysical measurements began in april of 2013 at both sierra loma sites and continue through the present similar monitoring began on may 11th and may 9th of 2017 for bar012 and rip760 respectively and continues through the present measurements at all sites include surface energy balance flux estimates turbulence and mean profile measurements of wind temperature and water vapor as well as periodic ground based biophysical measurements such as leaf water potential leaf area index lai and gas exchange the eddy covariance ec systems include a campbell scientific1 inc ec150 water vapor carbon dioxide sensor and a csat3 three dimensional sonic anemometer ec systems at slm001 slm002 and rip760 are mounted 5 m above local ground level a g l facing due west while at bar012 they are mounted at 4 5 m a g l and face southwest all ec systems are collecting data at 20 hz producing 15 min averages additional instrumentation includes a cnr 1 four component radiometer kipp and zonen delft netherlands mounted 6 m a g l at slm001 slm002 and a nr 01 four component radiometer kipp and zonen delft netherlands mounted 6 7 m and 6 3 m a g l at bar012 and rip760 respectively also included is a combined humidity and temperature sensor hmp45c vaisala helkinki finland at slm001 slm002 and hc253 at bar012 and rip760 mounted 5 m 4 4 m and 5 5 m a g l at slm001 slm002 bar012 and rip760 respectively a thermal infrared thermometer si 111 is used to measure both surface and canopy temperature at slm001 slm002 and is mounted 2 5 m a g l at bar012 and rip760 we use a second aspirated temperature sensor si 110 mounted 4 2 m a g l to measure surface and canopy temperature tipping bucket rain gauges te525 texas electronics dallas texas were installed at all sites along with five soil heat flux plates hft 3 radiation energy balance systems bellevue washington buried at a depth of 8 cm across the vine row each heat flux plate includes two thermocouples buried at depths of 2 and 6 cm and a soil moisture sensor hydraprobe stevens water monitoring system portland oregon buried at 5 cm depth tower installation locations within field were predicated on wind direction such that the dominant fetch for all towers lay within the target field boundaries bar012 the northern most site experienced winds either from the northwest predominantly during the evening hours or the southeast predominantly during the daytime there were no correlations between wind direction and time of year although wind directions prior to the middle of may were exclusively from the northwest consequently the flux tower was located near the center of the vineyard allowing the local flux measurement footprint to extend to both the northwest and southeast the centrally located vineyards at sierra loma encounter winds almost exclusively from the west during the daytime northeast wind contributions are exclusively found during the evening and are at speeds consistently lower than those found during the day slm001 and slm002 towers are located on the eastern edge of the fields near the center in the north south direction wind patterns and their contributions to flux estimates at sierra loma will be addressed in the following section the tower in the southernmost vineyard rip760 was placed on the southeastern edge of the field due to predominantly northwest winds both day and night 2 4 representative ec tower flux footprint and energy balance closure to conduct a reliable comparison between daily modeled flux estimates and observed measurements model flux estimates were extracted and averaged over a 3 3 pixel area 90 90 m shifted in the direction of mean incoming wind to approximate the typical tower upwind fetch flux footprint for sites with tower locations near field boundaries slm001 slm002 rip760 additional care was required to select representative pixels that did not overlay the adjacent road combining upwind fetch flux footprint and tower location information led to a shift of three pixels west of tower center at slm001 and slm002 at rip760 we shifted model extraction points three pixels west and two pixels north of tower center the bar012 model extraction point was not shifted the ec technique used at all towers is known to produce turbulent flux estimates that do not fully close the observed energy budget average daily closure errors at bar012 slm001 slm002 and rip760 were 0 82 0 90 0 86 and 0 86 respectively aligning with daily closure ratio values reported in the literature that are typically on the order of 0 80 to 0 90 twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2002 to avoid extraneous data points not representative of surface conditions flux information on days when daily closure ratios are less than or equal to 0 70 are omitted from analysis for comparison with model estimates which assume closure on a daily scale observed latent heat fluxes at bar012 and rip760 were corrected for closure errors by assigning the residual to the observed latent heat flux because of nighttime flux contributions from a non representative surface at slm001 and slm002 daily latent heat observations cannot be closed using the 24 hr residual method as applied at bar012 and rip760 instead we correct for closure by taking the difference between daily and daytime latent heat observations and adding it to the daytime residual this allows us to provide daily closed values while still accounting for nighttime contributions 3 et remote sensing framework the current study utilizes the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi surface energy balance model anderson et al 1997 and the associated disaggregation algorithm disalexi norman et al 2003 anderson et al 2004 in combination with the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm gao et al 2006 to generate high spatiotemporal resolution et time series maps alexi is driven by time differential land surface temperature lst observations acquired from geostationary satellites daily coarse scale 4 km et fluxes from alexi are then spatially downscaled disalexi to finer scales using higher resolution lst information from polar orbiting systems modis 500 m and landsat 60 120 m sharpened to 30 m see sec 3 3 starfm then combines the spatial resolution of landsat with the temporal frequency of modis to produce high spatiotemporal resolution et time series components of this system are described below 3 1 alexi disalexi alexi is based on the two source energy balance tseb model established by norman et al 1995 with improved parameterizations made by kustas and norman 1999 the tseb model partitions the radiometric temperature and the energy balance between the vegetation and soil components based on fractional vegetation cover apparent at the sensor view angle and the available energy and convective heat exchanges from both sources details of the tseb formulations are provided in appendix a in brief the component temperatures are used to solve the surface energy budget for the soil canopy and combined system associated with the mixed scene 1 r n s r n c g h s h c λ e s λ e c where rn is net radiation w m2 h is sensible heat flux w m2 g is the soil heat flux w m2 and λ e is the latent heat flux w m2 subscripts s and c represent fluxes from the soil and canopy components respectively soil heat flux g is derived as a fraction of the net radiation at the soil surface rns canopy transpiration λ e c is initially estimated using a modified priestley taylor approach with the initial assumption that vegetation is under unstressed conditions in case of canopy stress as indicated by elevated tc ryu et al 2012 holmes et al 2018 λec is down regulated from the non stressed rate by reducing the priestley taylor default coefficient 1 3 thus increasing tc and reducing ts stress conditions are trapped under the governing assumption that condensation onto the soil λes 0 at midday is not physically realistic kustas and anderson 2009 soil evapotranspiration λes is computed as the residual to eq 1 the tseb model is applied twice during the morning atmospheric boundary layer abl growth phase 1 h after sunrise and before local noon using radiometric temperature data obtained from the geostationary operational environmental satellites goes platform energy closure during this time interval is provided by a simple slab model of abl development mcnaughton and spriggs 1986 which relates the rise in air temperature in the mixed layer to the time integrated influx of h from the surface anderson et al 1997 this approach internally simulates land atmosphere feedback on near surface air temperature eliminating the need for specifying air temperature boundary conditions to the sensible heat flux computation a priori in addition the use of time differential temperature signals minimizes flux errors due to absolute sensor calibration and atmospheric and emissivity corrections kustas et al 2001 the associated spatial disaggregation technique known as disalexi norman et al 2003 anderson et al 2004 2012 is used to map flux distributions at higher spatial resolution than can be provided by geostationary imagery disalexi uses higher spatial resolution thermal infrared tir imagery from polar orbiting instruments modis landsat or airborne sensors to spatially disaggregate the coarser resolution alexi flux estimates the tseb model is individually run over each alexi pixel within a user defined modeling domain using higher spatial resolution remote sensing information acquired at the time of the landsat modis aircraft overpass time the air temperature boundary condition set at a nominal blending height of 50 m is iteratively adjusted at the alexi pixel scale until the disalexi daily et fluxes spatially averaged over the alexi pixel converge to the alexi value ensuring consistency between the alexi and disalexi flux fields the reader is referred to anderson et al 2012 and cammalleri et al 2013 2014a for further description 3 2 upscaling and gap filling alexi and disalexi fluxes are upscaled from instantaneous values at the sensor overpass time disalexi or the end of the temperature rise interval alexi near noon to daily total estimates in units of mm d 1 using the ratio of instantaneous to daily insolation 2 e t d a y λ e t 2 r s t 2 r s 24 λ ρ w where λ e t 2 is the latent heat at t2 r s t 2 is the insolation rate at t2 r s 24 is the time integrated daily insolation rate λ is the latent heat of vaporization and ρw is the density of water this insolation technique has shown lower bias and sensitivity to errors in retrieval estimates when compared to other techniques cammalleri et al 2014a spatiotemporal gaps in the alexi and modis based et retrievals due to cloud cover or missing or low quality input data are gap filled to provide a time continuous backbone for disaggregation and data fusion respectively alexi and modis disalexi et maps are filled by conserving the ratio of alexi or modis daily et to a prescribed scaling flux this ratio time series is then filtered smoothed and gap filled at each pixel using a savitzky golay filter designed to reduce noise while preserving signals associated with changes in surface moisture conditions gap filled daily et is then computed by multiplying the et ratio with daily maps of the prescribed scaling flux in the current study we use daily insolation as the prescribed scaling flux for alexi and gap filled alexi et for modis disalexi see sun et al 2017 for more details to maximize spatial extent in the fused 30 m daily time series landsat based et retrievals are also gap filled to the extent possible in the current study we utilize both landsat 8 oli tirs and landsat 7 etm meaning we must account for both cloud cover and striped gaps in the landsat 7 etm imagery due to a failure in the scan line corrector slc to account for both we apply a method that runs the starfm data fusion program for the partly cloudy striped prediction dates using landsat and modis retrieved et from surrounding clear dates the cloudy pixels or striped gaps in the landsat retrieved et are then filled as a weighted function of the starfm estimated landsat like et see yang et al 2017 note that images with data missing from approximately 30 or more of the target modeling domain are omitted from the fusion process 3 3 et data fusion the current study uses disalexi to generate et maps at both moderate 500 m and high 30 m resolution moderate resolution maps were produced at near daily time steps using thermal and reflectance data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis high resolution maps were created using thermal band data sharpened from 100 m native resolution to 30 m resolution reflectance band resolution on clear landsat overpass dates using the data mining sharpener tool gao et al 2012a the periodic 30 m resolution landsat et maps were then fused with the daily 500 m modis et maps using the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm gao et al 2006 to create daily et maps at 30 m spatial resolution starfm works by developing spatially distributed weighting factors that describe the spatial and spectral relationship between a landsat modis image pair once created optimal weighting factors are applied to the modis imagery on dates where landsat is not available resulting in the disaggregation of the image to landsat scale for more information the reader is referred to gao et al 2006 cammalleri et al 2013 2014a and semmens et al 2016 3 4 model inputs daily 4 km resolution alexi simulations over conus were obtained using lst inputs computed from 11 μm brightness temperature observations from the goes east at 75 w and goes west at 105 w imager instruments raw brightness temperature observations were atmospherically corrected using atmospheric profiles of temperature following the procedure in french et al 2003 leaf area index lai used to partition lst between soil and canopy components and to compute within canopy radiation and wind transmission was obtained from the modis leaf area lai product see below aggregated to 4 km and interpolated to daily timesteps landsat 8 l8 and landsat 7 l7 data for 2017 and 2018 were collected over each study domain which includes three separate landsat scenes landsat wrs 2 path 45 and row 33 path 44 and row 33 path 43 and row 34 a total of 49 51 and 54 mostly clear scenes were processed for path row 45 33 path row 44 33 and path row 43 34 respectively landsat thermal band data were atmospherically corrected using modtran berk et al 1989 and sharpened from 100 m resolution to 30 m resolution using the data mining sharpener dms approach gao et al 2012a maps of 30 m resolution lai were derived using atmospherically corrected landsat shortwave reflectance data and regression tree analysis trained by modis 500 m lai data following gao et al 2012b modis daily lai maps were created using modis 4 day composite mcd15a3h collection 6 products and a procedure described in gao et al 2008 composite images were smoothed and gapfilled to daily timesteps using the timesat algorithm jönsson and eklundh 2004 input modis albedo maps were generated from the modis daily composite bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf 500 m spatial resolution mcd43a3 collection 6 product modis lst maps were created using terra instantaneous swath data mod11 l2 georeferenced using the modis geolocation product mod03 bowtie effects due to off nadir pixel smearing were reduced by applying the dms procedure gao et al 2012a using the modis 500 m composite ndvi product as input cammalleri et al 2014b semmens et al 2016 alexi and disalexi require landcover class to determine surface roughness parameters and vegetation optical properties anderson et al 2007a the alexi model uses the university of maryland umd global land cover dataset at 1 km resolution based on observations from the avhrr hansen et al 2000 land cover classification for higher resolution modis and landsat disaggregation was determined from the 30 m national land cover dataset nlcd fry et al 2011 for modis the nlcd map was upscaled to 1 km resolution using the majority class within each modis pixel in addition alexi and disalexi require meteorological input obtained from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr data set dee et al 2013 input includes hourly wind speed air temperature solar radiation and vapor pressure all of which are mapped to the 4 km alexi grid and converted to each sensor s projection for ingestion into disalexi 4 results 4 1 model evaluation at flux tower sites scatter plots comparing daytime fluxes from disalexi at all four sites on landsat overpass dates with ec observations are shown in fig 4 with statistical metrics of agreement provided in table 2 metrics include number of days included n mean observed and predicted values mean o and mean p respectively mean bias error mbe root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and coefficient of variation r2 model estimates of latent heat flux λe are compared to measured fluxes both as observed and closed using the residual method to enable an evaluation of closure on our assessment of model performance see sec 2 4 for details it is worth noting that using the bowen ratio method of energy balance closure twine et al 2000 yielded similar statistical results overall simulated fluxes at all sites generally align along the one to one line indicating reasonable partitioning by the tseb model fig 3 simulated net radiation agrees well with in situ measurements while insolation indicates a small positive bias at all sites mbe 0 73 mj m 2 d 1 on average a smaller positive bias in insolation mbe 0 38 mj m 2 d 1 is reported in anderson et al 2019 where the same insolation dataset cfsr see section 3 4 model inputs is compared to other insolation datasets at flux towers within the sacramento san joaquin delta region of california despite the larger errors associated with the reanalysis radiation fluxes anderson et al 2019 reported little resulting difference in the et retrieval accuracy using cfsr vs satellite derived insolation datasets attributed in part to the relatively clear sky conditions characteristic of california estimated latent heat flux on landsat overpass dates show comparable mean absolute errors mae between vineyard sites ranging from 1 46 to 4 47 mj m 2 day 1 evaluation of daily fused et retrievals compared to closed observations yields rmse 0 78 mm day 1 0 78 mm day 1 0 92 mm day 1 and 1 02 mm day 1 for bar012 slm001 slm002 and rip760 respectively table 2 fig 4 biases in et are more pronounced at slm001 and slm002 and correlate in time with insolation biases see sec 4 2 for further discussion these errors align with past studies where satellite based land surface energy balance methods have been applied to vineyards previous studies of alexi disalexi implementation over the sierra loma sites reported rmse ranging from 0 77 mm day 1 to 0 94 mm day 1 knipper et al 2019a semmens et al 2016 more broadly these reported errors are consistent with those reported in carrasco benavides et al 2012 rmse 0 62 mm day 1 where the metric modeling system was applied over a drip irrigated merlot vineyard in chile for 13 cloud free landsat images between 2007 and 2009 in galleguillas et al 2011b rmse values are 0 80 mm day 1 for the simplified surface energy balance index s sebi model and 1 1 mm day 1 for the water deficit index wdi model when applied over a mediterranean vineyard watershed using 11 clear sky images from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflectance radiometer aster sensor between 2007 and 2008 it is worth noting that these studies applying other remote sensing based approaches did not evaluate model output on a continuous daily basis over multiple yearly cycles fig 5 moreover the modeled observed differences in the current study fall within the uncertainty in the measurements where differences between closed and unclosed daily et observations ranged between 0 6 1 35 mm table 2 4 2 cross site time series intercomparison time series of modeled daily et both fused and on landsat overpass dates and observed daily et closed and unclosed for 2017 and 2018 for bar012 slm001 slm002 and rip760 are shown in fig 5 also included is the daily amount of applied irrigation within each vineyard and daily precipitation totals note that flux irrigation and precipitation observations at rip760 and bar012 began in early may of 2017 fig 5 highlights the general agreement between modeled daily et and observed daily et over the different vineyards indicating the utility and portability of this physically based retrieval methodology as seen in fig 5 irrigation strategy differs significantly between the sites both in amount and in timing duration at bar012 where temperatures are milder and vpd is lower there is less atmospheric demand and lower amounts of irrigation it is also important to note that grapes cultivated at bar012 cabernet sauvignon are grown to maximize fruit quality i e measure of sugar content and berry composition and irrigation is carefully managed to achieve this goal this is reflected in the irrigation data where irrigation amounts are kept fairly consistent throughout the growing season 8 10 gal vine 1 day 1 although the amount of irrigation applied 8 10 gal vine 1 day 1 was consistent between the sites not including 2018 at rip760 the number of applications is higher at rip760 in comparison with slm001 slm002 and bar012 at rip760 irrigation is required almost daily during the growing season due to high atmospheric demands sandier soils and grape variety chardonnay additionally vines at rip760 are trained on a double trellis cordon creating more leaf area biomass and higher water requirement per vine these factors lead to higher et rates both observed and modeled at rip760 than at the more northern sites operational irrigation management relies on weekly total et estimates to prescribe irrigation amounts for the subsequent week to replenish water lost according to seguin et al 1999 a target error of 0 80 mm day 1 is suggested for operational agricultural water use in vineyards specifically target accuracies for useful irrigation management should be around 10 from budbreak to harvest m m alsina personal communication 2019 the target error of 0 80 mm day 1 aligns with reported weekly mae which are 0 50 0 49 0 67 and 0 63 mm day 1 at bar012 slm001 slm002 and rip760 respectively table 2 when accounting for predicted and observed mean weekly total et percent errors are 11 9 12 and 9 at bar012 slm001 slm002 and rip760 respectively all close to target accuracy for reference to applied irrigation 8 10 gal vine 1 day 1 translates to between roughly 5 5 mm day 1 at bar012 where vine row distances are largest to 6 8 mm day 1 at rip760 where vine row distances are smallest comparison to et rates during the growing season fig 5 indicates applied irrigation to be on the upper end of both modeled and observed et at each site suggesting vines regardless of location are being irrigated at equal to or slightly more than the amount of water lost via et during peak growing season 4 3 extended time series analysis at sierra loma slm001 and slm002 were the first established grapex sites facilitating an extended time series of flux analysis at this location fig 6 time series for 2015 2018 reveals that most of the bias at slm001 and slm002 reported in table 1 occurred during the 2018 growing season evaporative fluxes for 2015 2017 were better reproduced by the remote sensing model with biases of 0 01 and 0 16 mm day 1 for slm001 and slm002 respectively see also knipper et al 2019a observed et at both sierra loma sites was significantly lower in 2018 than in prior years while modeled et follows the general declining trend in 2018 it is unable to match the magnitude of the decline this trend may be the result of the unprecedented wildfire season of 2018 where roughly 8500 fires burned from mid july to august across the state of california analysis of insolation rates not shown indicates a positive bias between incoming solar radiation from cfsr and tower measurements between july and august this bias is not present during the preceding or subsequent months suggesting that aerosols in the expansive smoke plumes and resulting hazy skies were not accurately captured in csfr leading to an overestimation of insolation and net radiation inputs to the energy balance modeling scheme appendix a and resulting in a positive bias in et gaps in data acquisition via landsat are most pronounced during the non growing season which include the months of november december january february and march this is the result of lower frequency clear sky retrievals of landsat 7 and 8 imagery due to cloud cover present in a mediterranean climate during this timeframe to improve temporal sampling during cloudy conditions steps are being taken to produce routine high spatiotemporal resolution et by fusing multiple sensors including landsat sentinel 2 ecostress ecosystem spaceborne thermal radiometer experiment on space station and other landsat like sensors anderson et al 2020 multi source land imaging project to better understand the vineyard moisture dynamics at sierra loma we looked at trends and relationships in water budget components describing water inputs precipitation irrigation and water loss predominantly et fig 7 shows cumulative modeled et red observed et blue reference et a measure of atmospheric demand green irrigation black solid line precipitation black dashed line and combined cumulative irrigation and precipitation grey due to unreliable irrigation data cumulative sums for 2015 are omitted note that the storage component is not represented and therefore fig 7 should not be interpreted as a true water balance cumulative precipitation increased from 2016 to 2017 in response cumulative irrigation decreased over this period in both blocks because the initiation of irrigation during the spring time was delayed due to sufficiently wet soils in 2018 precipitation rates were lower while irrigation amounts remained roughly the same or slightly less than 2017 this caused water into the system to decrease by roughly 100 mm on average in 2018 between the two sites this decrease of water into the system is not as drastic as the decrease seen in total observed et 248 mm at slm001 261 mm at slm002 in addition reference et used as a metric of atmospheric demand is larger than the previous two years which should promote higher et rates provided water availability in the soil cimis reference et defaults to historical averages between july 26th and august 20th because of interference caused by the wildfires which in contrast to fig 7 led to similar total reference et values to 2016 and 2017 when compared between july 26th and august 20th the overall larger cumulative reference et in 2018 is likely simply due to elevated reference et values during the latter part of the year specifically between mid october and mid november reference et values are on average 1 mm day 1 more than those reported in 2016 and 2017 given that this difference is reported post harvest the higher atmospheric demand is likely not resulting in elevated et rates because of decreased plant biomass and the halting of irrigation soil moisture trends at three depths 0 3 m 0 6 m 0 9 m not shown indicate lower peak values at all depths in 2018 when compared to previous years when irrigation begins in july trends in volumetric water content increase at slm002 although delayed to values comparable to previous years values remain low at slm001 with average volumetric water content estimates 0 75 m3 m 3 lower than previous years in addition to slightly lower available water within the soil column particularly at slm001 the vineyards experienced in varying degrees and extent grapevine red blotch associated virus m alsina personal comm 2019 pockets of diseased vines inhibited the vines ability to efficiently transpire regardless of water availability and atmospheric demand causing observed rates to decrease to values much lower than previous years analysis of ndvi and tir imagery over the sites indicate decreased biomass and increased temperatures respectively when compared to previous years likely contributing to the lower modeled estimates however the satellite imagery is unable to capture the magnitude of the decline caused by the grapevine red blotch associated virus causing in part the reported biases information from other spectral bands indicating chlorophyll content or greenness might indicate a green fraction 1 which can reduce transpiration in the priestley taylor algorithm guzinski et al 2013 4 4 lai and vegetation clumping the retrieval of lai using satellite imagery is difficult for vineyards especially those with seasonal cover crops because relative foliage density and vertical distribution changes dramatically in time and space regional differences in lai linked to different varietals trellis architectures management styles i e pruning and row spacing are unique to vineyards additionally temporal differences in foliage density can be misleading because of the prominent cover crop growing in the interrow before and partly during the growing season lai is a key input to the tseb land surface representation in alexi disalexi used to partition radiometric surface temperature and fluxes into canopy and soil components sec 3 1 given the heterogeneousness nature of vineyards distinct row and interrow zones accurate characterization of lai and derived fractional canopy and soil cover is required for successful et modeling in vineyards the current study domain which spans three distinct regions over two years showcases these differences in space and time see fig 1 and fig 8 fig 8 depicts a time series of modeled lai yellow area plot and measured lai red diamond for 2017 and 2018 at bar012 slm001 slm002 and rip760 ground based indirect measurements of canopy lai were taken using the licor 2200 and a measurement protocol validated with destructive sampling by white et al 2019 also included in fig 8 are the ratio of transpiration t to et t et green and snapshots of each vineyard at the beginning of april july and october for 2018 modeled lai estimates compare well to measured estimates during the growing season at bar012 and to a lesser extent at slm001 and slm002 where modeled values are slightly lower than measurements at both locations we find modeled lai estimates to be substantially larger than measurements at the beginning of the year this is attributed to fundamental differences in modeled and measured values measurements taken on the ground represent only the canopy while satellite derived estimates represent an entire pixel 30m 30m which includes both interrow cover crop and canopy during the early portion of the year the satellite signal is dominated by the cover crop which explains the major differences between modeled and measured values it is also during this time that we see major differences between vineyard locations at bar012 where the interrow and cover crop are more substantial lai estimates remain elevated in comparison slm001 slm002 and rip760 have characteristically narrower interrow spacing and subsequently less substantial cover crop consequently modeled lai estimates are small during the non growing season because lai is used to partition the soil and canopy components trends in t et generally follow the same pattern as the modeled lai at slm001 and slm002 where large differences in spring and mid summer lai estimates are observed we find the portion of et contributing to transpiration increases from 25 in february to nearly 100 by june and remains there until fall conversely at bar012 the portion of et contributing to transpiration is consistently above 50 and remains at nearly 100 for a large portion of the year at rip760 trends in t et are slightly more scattered with values between 70 80 during the non growing season despite lai estimates of nearly zero rip760 show the largest underestimation of modeled lai with values during the peak growing season at nearly half of measured estimates this is likely due to the double trellis design of the vine which contributes a large amount of plant biomass underneath the top vine canopy seen by the satellite this underestimation of lai leads to large modeled substrate evaporation values during the peak growing season that are not representative of actual surface conditions see phenocam on july 2 2018 fig 8 transpiration is underestimated contributing the negative bias in et at rip760 mid season a test using the tseb modeling approach in local mode e g kustas et al 2019 with thermal ir measurements from the upwelling longwave sensor on the flux tower and lai inputs enhanced by a factor of 2 5 i e the overall ratio of observed and predicted lai leads to an increase in overall et by 0 28 mm day 1 on average better matching the closed fluxes therefore improvements in the landsat scale retrieval of lai over strongly clumped sites such as rip760 are likely to improve remote sensing performances at these sites 4 5 spatial analysis routine satellite derived daily et estimates at 30 m resolution can facilitate identification of variability in water use within a given vineyard and between vineyards in the surrounding landscapes maps of monthly total et centered at all three grapex measurement sites for 2017 fig 9 and 2018 fig 10 highlight the model s ability to capture spatiotemporal variability in moisture dynamics in the landscape around the target experimental blocks this spatial variability could not be captured using isolated in situ measurements within vineyard spatial variability between april and september is 1 7 2 1 2 7 and 2 0 mm day 1 at bar012 slm001 slm002 and rip760 respectively comparison to rmse values at each site table 2 demonstrate within vineyard variability is considerably larger than reported errors between modeled and observed values when comparing to neighboring vineyards spatial variability increases for example at bar012 vineyard block to vineyard block variations can be up to 3 0 mm day 1 during the peak growing season suggesting the importance of capturing spatiotemporal variability in consumptive water use rates in each vineyard domain monthly total et peaks in june july with higher values in the central valley slm001 slm002 rip760 when compared to sonoma county bar012 bar012 shows little spatial variability within the study vineyard between years but significant variability across surrounding area with very high et in the forest land located south of bar012 slm001 shows the largest amount of within vineyard spatial variability related to variations in soil texture and vine vigor knipper et al 2019a a notable change in water use patterns from 2017 to 2018 can be found in the two fields located south and southwest of slm002 irrigation in the alfalfa field directly to the south of slm002 appears to have been curtailed in june of 2017 a similar conclusion was found in 2016 by anderson et al 2018 where et rates over the same field were lower in relation to surrounding fields in 2018 a different pattern emerges with et rates remaining elevated albeit lower than neighboring fields throughout the growing season differences in patterns over this alfalfa field are likely attributed to variability in irrigation cutting cycles throughout the years conversely the field to the southwest of slm002 appears fallowed during the 2018 growing season with monthly total et rates of nearly half those reported in 2017 despite large spatial variability in monthly total et over the rip760 scene most discernable fields are classified as vineyards those bordering the western edge of the scene are classified as deciduous fruits and nuts by the california department of water resources land use map but show no major differences in monthly total et there is an interesting pattern in spring and fall monthly et totals between slm001 slm002 and rip760 slm001 and slm002 and the surrounding area show elevated et totals during the month of april when compared to rip760 and its surrounding area this difference is reversed in september where higher rates of et linger from the growing season at rip760 while et totals at slm001 and slm002 represent vines that have undergone some level of senescence this pattern of what appears to be a shift in growing season is present in both 2017 and 2018 a possible explanation is the difference in soil types and irrigation practices rip760 has sandier soils than slm001 slm002 causing less soil moisture and lower et from the vine interrow system in april as vines are just beginning to develop in september shortly after both vineyards have been harvested a large amount of irrigation is applied at rip760 to flush salts from the soil and replenish groundwater reservoirs m alsina personal comm 2019 the amount of water applied at rip760 is roughly 100 gal vine more than the amount applied at slm001 slm002 for september of 2018 likely resulting in elevated evaporation estimates 5 conclusion and discussion mapping et at spatial and temporal scales suitable for irrigation management has the potential to lead efforts in the conservation of agricultural water resources and create more sustainable wine grape production this study investigated the application of the alexi disalexi modeling scheme over four individual vineyard sites during 2017 and 2018 with the goal of providing a robust and portable et model for widespread applications at the vineyard management scale sites have been primary targets of micrometeorological and biophysical field measurements as part of the usda ars grape remote sensing atmospheric profile and evapotranspiration experiment grapex overall the alexi disalexi modeling scheme in conjunction with starfm produced daily et estimates at 30 m spatial resolution with good fidelity across multiple vineyards characteristic of having different grape varieties trellis designs canopy structure irrigation management and climate conditions modeled et had an average rmse and mae of 0 88 mm day 1 and 0 70 mm day 1 respectively between vineyard locations these errors align with those reported in knipper et al 2019a 2019b where the model was applied at individual grapex locations are within the uncertainty in the et observations and are on par with a target mae of 0 80 mm day 1 suggested by seguin et al 1999 despite general agreement with tower estimates modeled values report positive biases at slm001 and slm002 during the 2018 growing season while also producing a consistently negative bias at rip760 throughout the study period positive biases at slm001 and slm002 are exclusive to 2018 when the vineyard experienced grapevine red blotch associated virus and wildfires caused smoke filled skies that led to an overestimation of insolation the virus caused loses in transpiration and lower observed et rates and subsequently larger gaps between observed and modeled estimates which were unable to meet the magnitude of the declining trend in et during 2018 additional remote sensing information providing a reduction in green fraction due to unhealthy vine leaves caused by the virus could help remedy this bias issue at slm sites moreover negative biases in et reported at rip760 are the result of the misrepresentation of lai within a double trellis designed canopy where values were nearly half of the ground based measurements ongoing work is addressing this issue of partitioning between canopy and cover crop from a satellite perspective as part of the continued effort of the grapex project kustas et al 2018 spatial analysis of monthly total et highlights the advantages of utilizing a satellite based approach by showing the large variability in moisture dynamics within and surrounding the targeted vineyards providing a spatial et product at a scale useful for irrigation managers daily 30 m has the potential to improve water allocation and conservation efforts by identifying areas of uneven water use due to variations in soil texture and composition and other environmental or anthropogenic factors additionally a reliable and portable

overestimate of λec which causes λes to become negative as it is computed as a residual to the energy balance condensation at the soil surface i e λes 0 during midday on clear days is unrealistic therefore when this condition is encountered the priestley taylor coefficient is iteratively reduced until λes 0 which is expected for an extremely dry soil surface 
10485,mapping the spatial variability of actual evapotranspiration eta across vineyards is useful for optimizing irrigation scheduling and efficiency leading to conservation of water resources and more sustainable wine grape production to support efficient irrigation strategies we investigate the utility of thermal infrared based eta maps over a range of vineyards located throughout california each representing a unique local climate trellis design grape variety row orientation and management practice eta maps are derived by combining the disaggregated atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi disalexi surface energy balance model and the spatial temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm to generate eta estimates at high spatial 30 m and temporal daily resolution model output is evaluated for years 2017 and 2018 over vineyard sites located in sonoma sacramento and madera counties in california that are being monitored as part of the grape remote sensing atmospheric profile

error mbe of 0 88 mm day 1 0 70 mm day 1 and 0 17 mm day 1 respectively over all four individual vineyard locations aligning with past grapex studies despite general agreement record wildfires in northern california during 2018 likely resulted in positive model bias while misrepresentation of leaf area index within a double trellis designed canopy at the southern most vineyard resulted in negative model bias spatial analysis of monthly total et highlights the advantages of utilizing a satellite based approach to characterize the variability in water use within and surrounding the targeted vineyards a reliable spatial et product at scale has the potential to improve water allocation and conservation efforts by identifying areas of uneven water use due to variations in soil texture and composition and other environmental or anthropogenic factors keywords satellite remote sensing evapotranspiration viticulture irrigation 1 introduction water resources in california are becoming increasingly scarce as industry municipalities and agriculture compete for limited water supplies in regions with limited groundwater resources such as the central valley the economic and environmental impacts have been severe prompting regulatory constraints on consumptive water use sustainable groundwater management act of 2014 sgma growers of high valued perennial crops such as wine grapes are increasingly relying on groundwater extraction raising concerns about the long term sustainability of groundwater resources this trend is anticipated to continue as the effects of population growth and climate change evolve to address these challenges there is a need to provide the agricultural sector with information on crop water use which will improve their ability to effectively manage available irrigation water supplies accurate estimates of evapotranspiration et have shown to be a critical part of improving the management of water resources by providing quantifiable values of water use and stress senay et al 2007 anderson et al 2018 knipper et al 2019a b in viticulture accurate estimation of crop et is especially important as it is an indicator of vine stress which may be manipulated through the growing season to influence grape quality and yield heilman et al 1996 yunusa et al 2000 campos et al 2010 galleguillos et al 2011a intrigliolo and castel 2008 shellie 2006 sivilotti et al 2005 excess irrigation can cause reductions in color and sugar content while also producing acidity imbalances in the wine bravdo et al 1985 esteban et al 2001 conversely insufficient irrigation amounts can reduce potential grape yield reynolds and naylor 1994 dos santos et al 2003 therefore reliable et estimates are critical in the viticulture industry to both increase water management efficiency and to determine appropriate vine water stress levels for specific production goals many methods and techniques have been applied to determine vineyard et ground based solutions include the use of lysimeters johnson et al 2005 azevedo et al 2008 netzer et al 2009 eddy covariance spano et al 2000 ortega farias et al 2010 rodriquez et al 2010 bowen ratio

et al 1998 despite successful results in terms of et estimation these methods simply provide canopy level or at best sub field estimates that are difficult to upscale to vineyard scale and to surrounding vineyards satellite remote sensing solutions however offer operational capabilities by providing routine spatial information useful for determining regional to field scale heterogeneity in vine conditions and water use several satellite based et mapping approaches typically based on surface reflectances or land surface energy balance have been applied specifically to vineyards carrasco benavides et al 2012 2014 galleguillos et al 2011a b vanino et al 2015 campos et al 2010 semmens et al 2016 xia et al 2016 knipper et al 2019a b reflectance based methods include the use of vegetative indices vi such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to estimate the temporal evolution of a crop coefficient kc required for calculating et as described by the fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 alternatively land surface energy balance methods estimate et as the residual component of the surface energy balance equation mainly relying on thermal infrared tir imagery to approximate land surface temperature lst characteristics according to moran 2003 satellite retrievals of lst are particularly useful when deriving et because of the sensitivity of canopy and soil temperatures to variable soil moisture availability numerous tir based et mapping approaches have been developed over the past few decades allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 su 2002 anderson et al 1997 due to significant uncertainties in determining absolute lst most of these approaches use relative measures of lst variability to parameterize et estimates for example end member pixel scaling spatial variability or time differential scaling temporal variability anderson et al 1997 2012 an example of the end member pixel scaling method is the mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 model which is derived from the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 model and uses tir end member pixels within a satellite image to represent limiting hot pixel and non limiting cold pixel moisture conditions the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi anderson et al 1997 2007a 2007b model uses time differential scaling to estimate et relating surface temperature rise in the morning acquired from geostationary satellites to surface moisture availability and latent heat flux alexi et can be downscaled to subfield scales using an associated flux disaggregation technique disalexi norman et al 2003 applied to higher resolution thermal imagery from airborne or polar orbiting platforms in combination the models provide consistent estimates of actual et from sub field scales up to continental and global scales anderson et al 2011a and have been used for drought monitoring anderson et al 2013 2011b 2007b yield estimation anderson et al 2016 yang et al 2018 and water use accounting anderson et al 2018 alexi and disalexi are based on the two source energy balance tseb model that was first described in norman et al 1995 with improvements presented in kustas et al 1996 1999 the tseb model partitions observed directional radiometric temperature and modeled evaporative fluxes between the canopy and soil substrate components of the scene this partitioning capability is beneficial for structured canopies such as vineyards where wide row spacing results in two distinct management zones the vine and the interrow recent refinements to the tseb have addressed the impact of the unique architecture of vineyards on canopy radiation transmission kustas et al 2019 perry et al 2019 and on the in canopy wind profile nieto et al 2018 both of which effect turbulent exchanges of heat and water with the atmosphere architectural characteristics considered include vegetation clumping on the trellis vertical vegetation distribution and row orientation with respect to sun altitude and azimuth and wind direction these refinements have been tested at the local scale using high spatial resolution imagery and regionally with the alexi disalexi model as part of the grape remote sensing atmospheric profile and evapotranspiration experiment grapex kustas et al 2018 one objective of grapex is to develop a generalized parameterization of the multi scale et mapping approach for vineyards with the goal of providing regional operational irrigation management decision support initial studies were conducted over two pinot noir vineyards located near lodi ca sacramento county semmens et al 2016 applied the alexi disalexi model integrated with a data fusion methodology to estimate daily et at 30 m spatial resolution during the first grapex growing season 2013 results indicated good agreement between modeled and ground based flux measurements with root mean square errors rmse just under 1 mm day 1 in comparison with observations semmens et al 2016 a follow on study by knipper et al 2019a extended the lodi analysis from 2013 through 2016 to promote a more comprehensive understanding of seasonal et dynamics comparisons with micrometeorological data indicated reasonable model performance with an rmse of 0 8 mm day 1 at the daily time step and minimal bias anderson et al 2019 investigated impacts of the quality of insolation data used to drive alexi disalexi and obtained average rmse values of 0 74 mm day 1 and 0 68 mm day 1 for the lodi vineyards when using two different satellite based insolation products for water years 2015 and 2016 spatiotemporal analysis for all studies illustrated the ability of alexi disalexi to characterize heterogeneity in et within the vineyards and over the surrounding landscape but were limited in scope both in climate and vine variety and architecture in may of 2017 the grapex project extended data collection to the north sonoma county ca and south

california viticulture in 2018 knipper et al 2019b conducted an experiment in real time data production over a variable rate drip irrigation vrdi equipped merlot vineyard west of fresno ca the purpose of the study was to investigate and accommodate the impacts of input data latency in weekly data production and to determine if the satellite based model could detect timely signals of prescribed stress the results of the study were promising indicating a thermal based approach could both be completed in near real time with good fidelity and could decipher stress signals within the vineyard knipper et al 2019b the study also revealed advection as a potential factor at the more southern and arid site neighboring barren fields caused horizontal advection of hot dry air across the vineyard increasing the evaporative demand and causing latent heat fluxes to exceed the available energy to date these studies have typically focused on individual vineyards where characteristics such as grape variety trellis design vine row spacing and orientation and climate are the same the current study expands on this applying the alexi disalexi modeling system to all grapex sites that have been in operation since 2017 the expansion provides a significant climate gradient with degree day accumulations dd and yearly total precipitation ranging from 2500 dd 1000 mm at the northern vineyard to 4200 dd 200 mm at the southern vineyard each individual site is characterized by different grape varieties and trellis designs sampling a range in canopy structure and vine physiology along with varying soil texture type irrigation management practices and climate conditions moreover the inclusion of the northern sonoma county vineyard will test the impacts of topography and early morning clouds caused by cool maritime air this paper discusses the application of the alexi disalexi modeling scheme over four individual vineyard sites during 2017 and 2018 to determine the portability of the multi scale et fusion model to dissimilar vineyards and to identify limitations in critical model inputs and parameterizations for generalized operation ultimately the goal is to provide a simple modeling scheme that does not require site specific information but is robust enough for widespread applications at vineyard management scales 2 study area and instrumentation the analyses presented here use data collected during the years 2017 and 2018 over three wine grape growing regions in california spanning a north south gradient in climatic conditions these sites have been primary targets of micrometeorological and biophysical field measurement as part of the usda ars grape remote sensing atmospheric profile and evapotranspiration experiment grapex kustas et al 2018 fig 1 2 1 experimental vineyards the barrelli site is located north of the san francisco bay area near cloverdale ca in sonoma county fig 1 here we use data from instrumented vineyard block bar012 which is a 10 ha plot composed of cabernet sauvignon grapes trained on a split trellis and drip irrigated table 1 vines were planted in 2010 with 1 8 m vine spacing and 3 35 m row spacing and have a southwest northeast row orientation the sierra loma site is located near the town of lodi ca in sacramento county and contains two instrumented vineyards slm001 and slm002 fig 1 both vineyards are planted with pinot noir vines trained on quadrilateral cordons with 3 35 m row spacing 1 5 m vine spacing and drip irrigated table 1 slm001 has an area of 35 ha with vines planted in 2009 while slm002 has an area of 21 ha and vines planted in 2011 the southern most site referred to as ripperdan rip760 is located in the central valley 30 km west of fresno ca in madera county fig 1 rip760 is a 31 ha block composed of chardonnay grapes trained on double vertical trellis and drip irrigated table 1 vines were planted in 2009 with 1 83 m vine spacing and 2 74 m row spacing and have an east west row orientation both rip760 and slm001 slm002 are relatively flat while bar012 is in hilly terrain 2 2 climate together these vineyards sample a significant climate gradient along with variations in grape

davis to assist irrigators in managing their water resources more efficiently with more than 140 automated weather stations located throughout california the barrelli vineyard and surrounding area are heavily influenced by their proximity to the pacific coast shoreline which provides cool maritime air that draws in layers of oceanic fog and cools the warm interior valleys this characteristically cool and moist air is made apparent in the vpd and air temperature trends fig 2 left column where both remain lower than trends reported over the sierra loma and ripperdan regions during the entire year the cool nights and temperate days characteristic of barrelli and the surrounding area create prime grape growing conditions accordingly grapes in this region are typically grown for quality rather than yield precipitation amounts are highest at barrelli with a majority occurring between november and march although precipitation falls during the same period for all regions trends in amount decrease when transitioning from north to south barrelli to ripperdan sierra loma and ripperdan vineyards experience a warm mediterranean climate characterized by abundant sunshine and large day to night temperature differences these conditions are also excellent for grape production however because of a combination of warm daytime temperatures and sandier soils yield is a greater priority in these regions transitioning from the north coastal region to the southern central valley there is an increase in air temperature and vpd and therefore reference et or atmospheric demand while precipitation amounts decrease significantly daily solar radiation is relatively consistent between sites although the barrelli region is more impacted by cloud cover and early morning clouds fog early in the year indicated by the lower iqr 2 3 field measurements data collected at each location as part of grapex are used to evaluate and refine the et modeling framework detect vine stress and monitor biomass development and root zone soil water availability micrometeorological and biophysical measurements began in april of 2013 at both sierra loma sites and continue through the present similar monitoring began on may 11th and may 9th of 2017 for bar012 and rip760 respectively and continues through the present measurements at all sites include surface energy balance flux estimates turbulence and mean profile measurements of wind temperature and water vapor as well as periodic ground based biophysical measurements such as leaf water potential leaf area index lai and gas exchange the eddy covariance ec systems include a campbell scientific1 inc ec150 water vapor carbon dioxide sensor and a csat3 three dimensional sonic anemometer ec systems at slm001 slm002 and rip760 are mounted 5 m above local ground level a g l facing due west while at bar012 they are mounted at 4 5 m a g l and face southwest all ec systems are collecting data at 20 hz producing 15 min averages additional instrumentation includes a cnr 1 four component radiometer kipp and zonen delft netherlands mounted 6 m a g l at slm001 slm002 and a nr 01 four component radiometer kipp and zonen delft

slm001 slm002 and is mounted 2 5 m a g l at bar012 and rip760 we use a second aspirated temperature sensor si 110 mounted 4 2 m a g l to measure surface and canopy temperature tipping bucket rain gauges te525 texas electronics dallas texas were installed at all sites along with five soil heat flux plates hft 3 radiation energy balance systems bellevue washington buried at a depth of 8 cm across the vine row each heat flux plate includes two thermocouples buried at depths of 2 and 6 cm and a soil moisture sensor hydraprobe stevens water monitoring system portland oregon buried at 5 cm depth tower installation locations within field were predicated on wind direction such that the dominant fetch for all towers lay within the target field boundaries bar012 the northern most site experienced winds either from the northwest predominantly during the evening hours or the southeast predominantly during the daytime there were no correlations between wind direction and time of year although wind directions prior to the middle of may were exclusively from the northwest consequently the flux tower was located near the center of the vineyard allowing the local flux measurement footprint to extend to both the northwest and southeast the centrally located vineyards at sierra loma encounter winds almost exclusively from the west during the daytime northeast wind contributions are exclusively found during the evening and are at speeds consistently lower than those found during the day slm001 and slm002 towers are located on the eastern edge of the fields near the center in the north south direction wind patterns and their contributions to flux estimates at sierra loma will be addressed in the following section the tower in the southernmost vineyard rip760 was placed on the southeastern edge of the field due to predominantly northwest winds both day and night 2 4 representative ec tower flux footprint and energy balance closure to conduct a reliable comparison between daily modeled flux estimates and observed measurements model flux estimates were extracted and averaged over a 3 3 pixel area 90 90 m shifted in the direction of mean incoming wind to approximate the typical tower upwind fetch flux footprint for sites with tower locations near field boundaries slm001 slm002 rip760 additional care was required to select representative pixels that did not overlay the adjacent road combining upwind fetch flux footprint and tower location information led to a shift of three pixels west of tower center at slm001 and slm002 at rip760 we shifted model extraction points three pixels west and two pixels north of tower center the bar012 model extraction point was not shifted the ec technique used at all towers is known to produce turbulent flux estimates that do not fully close the observed energy budget average daily closure errors at bar012 slm001 slm002 and rip760 were 0 82 0 90 0 86 and 0 86 respectively aligning with daily closure ratio values reported in the literature that are typically on the order of 0 80 to 0 90 twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2002 to avoid extraneous data points not representative of surface conditions flux information on days when daily closure ratios are less than or equal to 0 70 are omitted from analysis for comparison with model estimates which assume closure on a daily scale observed latent heat fluxes at bar012 and rip760 were corrected for closure errors by assigning the residual to the observed latent heat flux because of nighttime flux contributions from a non representative surface at slm001 and slm002 daily latent heat observations cannot be closed using the 24 hr residual method as applied at bar012 and rip760 instead we correct for closure by taking the difference between daily and daytime latent heat observations and adding it to the daytime residual this allows us to provide daily closed values while still accounting for nighttime contributions 3 et remote sensing framework the current study utilizes the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi surface energy balance model anderson et al 1997 and the associated disaggregation algorithm disalexi norman et al 2003 anderson et al 2004 in combination with the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm gao et al 2006 to generate high spatiotemporal resolution et time series maps alexi is driven by time differential land surface temperature lst observations acquired from geostationary satellites daily coarse scale 4 km et fluxes from alexi are then spatially downscaled disalexi to finer scales using higher resolution lst information from polar orbiting systems modis 500 m and landsat 60 120 m sharpened to 30 m see sec 3 3 starfm then combines the spatial resolution of landsat with the temporal frequency of modis to produce high spatiotemporal resolution et time series components of this system are described below 3 1 alexi disalexi alexi is based on the two source energy balance tseb model established by norman et al 1995 with improved parameterizations made by kustas and norman 1999 the tseb model partitions the radiometric temperature and the energy balance between the vegetation and soil components based on fractional vegetation cover apparent at the sensor view angle and the available energy and convective heat exchanges from both sources details of the tseb formulations are provided in appendix a in brief the component temperatures are used to solve the surface energy budget for the soil canopy and combined system associated with the mixed scene 1 r n s r n c g h s h c λ e s λ e c where rn is net radiation w m2 h is sensible heat flux w m2 g is the soil heat flux w m2 and λ e is the latent heat flux w m2 subscripts s and c represent fluxes from the soil and canopy components respectively soil heat flux g is derived as a fraction of the net radiation at the soil surface rns canopy transpiration λ e c is initially estimated using a modified priestley taylor approach with the initial assumption that vegetation is under unstressed conditions in case of canopy stress as indicated by elevated tc ryu et al 2012 holmes et al 2018 λec is down regulated from the non stressed rate by reducing the priestley taylor default coefficient 1 3 thus increasing tc and reducing ts stress conditions are trapped under the governing assumption that condensation onto the soil λes 0 at midday is not physically realistic kustas and anderson 2009 soil evapotranspiration λes is computed as the residual to eq 1 the tseb model is applied twice during the morning atmospheric boundary layer abl growth phase 1 h after sunrise and before local noon using radiometric temperature data obtained from the geostationary operational environmental satellites goes platform energy closure during this time interval is provided by a simple slab model of abl development mcnaughton and spriggs 1986 which relates the rise in air temperature in the mixed layer to the time integrated influx of h from the surface anderson et al 1997 this approach internally simulates land atmosphere feedback on near surface air temperature eliminating the need for specifying air temperature boundary conditions to the sensible heat flux computation a priori in addition the use of time differential temperature signals minimizes flux errors due to absolute sensor calibration and atmospheric and emissivity corrections kustas et al 2001 the associated spatial disaggregation technique known as disalexi norman et al 2003 anderson et al 2004 2012 is used to map flux distributions at higher spatial resolution than can be provided by geostationary imagery disalexi uses higher spatial resolution thermal infrared tir imagery from polar orbiting instruments modis landsat or airborne sensors to spatially disaggregate the coarser resolution alexi flux estimates the tseb model is individually run over each alexi pixel within a user defined modeling domain using higher spatial resolution remote sensing information acquired at the time of the landsat modis aircraft overpass time the air temperature boundary condition set at a nominal blending height of 50 m is iteratively adjusted at the alexi pixel scale until the disalexi daily et fluxes spatially averaged over the alexi pixel converge to the alexi value ensuring consistency between the alexi and disalexi flux fields the reader is referred to anderson et al 2012 and cammalleri et al 2013 2014a for further description 3 2 upscaling and gap filling alexi and disalexi fluxes are upscaled from instantaneous values at the sensor overpass time disalexi or the end of the temperature rise interval alexi near noon to daily total estimates in units of mm d 1 using the ratio of instantaneous to daily insolation 2 e t d a y λ e t 2 r s t 2 r s 24 λ ρ w where λ e t 2 is the latent heat at t2 r s t 2 is the insolation rate at t2 r s 24 is the time integrated daily insolation rate λ is the latent heat of vaporization and ρw is the density of water this insolation technique has shown lower bias and sensitivity to errors in retrieval estimates when compared to other techniques cammalleri et al 2014a spatiotemporal gaps in the alexi and modis based et retrievals due to cloud cover or missing or low quality input data are gap filled to provide a time continuous backbone for disaggregation and data fusion respectively alexi and modis disalexi et maps are filled by conserving the ratio of alexi or modis daily et to a prescribed scaling flux this ratio time series is then filtered smoothed and gap filled at each pixel using a savitzky golay filter designed to reduce noise while preserving signals associated with changes in surface moisture conditions gap filled daily et is then computed by multiplying the et ratio with daily maps of the prescribed scaling flux in the current study we use daily insolation as the prescribed scaling flux for alexi and gap filled alexi et for modis disalexi see sun et al 2017 for more details to maximize spatial extent in the fused 30 m daily time series landsat based et retrievals are also gap filled to the extent possible in the current study we utilize both landsat 8 oli tirs and landsat 7 etm meaning we must account for both cloud cover and striped gaps in the landsat 7 etm imagery due to a failure in the scan line corrector slc to account for both we apply a method that runs the starfm data fusion program for the partly cloudy striped prediction dates using landsat and modis retrieved et from surrounding clear dates the cloudy pixels or striped gaps in the landsat retrieved et are then filled as a weighted function of the starfm estimated landsat like et see yang et al 2017 note that images with data missing from approximately 30 or more of the target modeling domain are omitted from the fusion process 3 3 et data fusion the current study uses disalexi to generate et maps at both moderate 500 m and high 30 m resolution moderate resolution maps were produced at near daily time steps using thermal and reflectance data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis high resolution maps were created using thermal band data sharpened from 100 m native resolution to 30 m resolution reflectance band resolution on clear landsat overpass dates using the data mining sharpener tool gao et al 2012a the periodic 30 m resolution landsat et maps were then fused with the daily 500 m modis et maps using the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm gao et al 2006 to create daily et maps at 30 m spatial resolution starfm works by developing spatially distributed weighting factors that describe the spatial and spectral relationship between a landsat modis image pair once created optimal weighting factors are applied to the modis imagery on dates where landsat is not available resulting in the disaggregation of the image to landsat scale for more information the reader is referred to gao et al 2006 cammalleri et al 2013 2014a and semmens et al 2016 3 4 model inputs daily 4 km resolution alexi simulations over conus were obtained using lst inputs computed from 11 μm brightness temperature observations from the goes east at 75 w and goes west at 105 w imager instruments raw brightness temperature observations were atmospherically corrected using atmospheric profiles of temperature following the procedure in french et al 2003 leaf area index lai used to partition lst between soil and canopy components and to compute within canopy radiation and wind transmission was obtained from the modis leaf area lai product see below aggregated to 4 km and interpolated to daily timesteps landsat 8 l8 and landsat 7 l7 data for 2017 and 2018 were collected over each study domain which includes three separate landsat scenes landsat wrs 2 path 45 and row 33 path 44 and row 33 path 43 and row 34 a total of 49 51 and 54 mostly clear scenes were processed for path row 45 33 path row 44 33 and path row 43 34 respectively landsat thermal band data were atmospherically corrected using modtran berk et al 1989 and sharpened from 100 m resolution to 30 m resolution using the data mining sharpener dms approach gao et al 2012a maps of 30 m resolution lai were derived using atmospherically corrected landsat shortwave reflectance data and regression tree analysis trained by modis 500 m lai data following gao et al 2012b modis daily lai maps were created using modis 4 day composite mcd15a3h collection 6 products and a procedure described in gao et al 2008 composite images were smoothed and gapfilled to daily timesteps using the timesat algorithm jönsson and eklundh 2004 input modis albedo maps were generated from the modis daily composite bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf 500 m spatial resolution mcd43a3 collection 6 product modis lst maps were created using terra instantaneous swath data mod11 l2 georeferenced using the modis geolocation product mod03 bowtie effects due to off nadir pixel smearing were reduced by applying the dms procedure gao et al 2012a using the modis 500 m composite ndvi product as input cammalleri et al 2014b semmens et al 2016 alexi and disalexi require landcover class to determine surface roughness parameters and vegetation optical properties anderson et al 2007a the alexi model uses the university of maryland umd global land cover dataset at 1 km resolution based on observations from the avhrr hansen et al 2000 land cover classification for higher resolution modis and landsat disaggregation was determined from the 30 m national land cover dataset nlcd fry et al 2011 for modis the nlcd map was upscaled to 1 km resolution using the majority class within each modis pixel in addition alexi and disalexi require meteorological input obtained from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr data set dee et al 2013 input includes hourly wind speed air temperature solar radiation and vapor pressure all of which are mapped to the 4 km alexi grid and converted to each sensor s projection for ingestion into disalexi 4 results 4 1 model evaluation at flux tower sites scatter plots comparing daytime fluxes from disalexi at all four sites on landsat overpass dates with ec observations are shown in fig 4 with statistical metrics of agreement provided in table 2 metrics include number of days included n mean observed and predicted values mean o and mean p respectively mean bias error mbe root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and coefficient of variation r2 model estimates of latent heat flux λe are compared to measured fluxes both as observed and closed using the residual method to enable an evaluation of closure on our assessment of model performance see sec 2 4 for details it is worth noting that using the bowen ratio method of energy balance closure twine et al 2000 yielded similar statistical results overall simulated fluxes at all sites generally align along the one to one line indicating reasonable partitioning by the tseb model fig 3 simulated net radiation agrees well with in situ measurements while insolation indicates a small positive bias at all sites mbe 0 73 mj m 2 d 1 on average a smaller positive bias in insolation mbe 0 38 mj m 2 d 1 is reported in anderson et al 2019 where the same insolation dataset cfsr see section 3 4 model inputs is compared to other insolation datasets at flux towers within the sacramento san joaquin delta region of california despite the larger errors associated with the reanalysis radiation fluxes anderson et al 2019 reported little resulting difference in the et retrieval accuracy using cfsr vs satellite derived insolation datasets attributed in part to the relatively clear sky conditions characteristic of california estimated latent heat flux on landsat overpass dates show comparable mean absolute errors mae between vineyard sites ranging from 1 46 to 4 47 mj m 2 day 1 evaluation of daily fused et retrievals compared to closed observations yields rmse 0 78 mm day 1 0 78 mm day 1 0 92 mm day 1 and 1 02 mm day 1 for bar012 slm001 slm002 and rip760 respectively table 2 fig 4 biases in et are more pronounced at slm001 and slm002 and correlate in time with insolation biases see sec 4 2 for further discussion these errors align with past studies where satellite based land surface energy balance methods have been applied to vineyards previous studies of alexi disalexi implementation over the sierra loma sites reported rmse ranging from 0 77 mm day 1 to 0 94 mm day 1 knipper et al 2019a semmens et al 2016 more broadly these reported errors are consistent with those reported in carrasco benavides et al 2012 rmse 0 62 mm day 1 where the metric modeling system was applied over a drip irrigated merlot vineyard in chile for 13 cloud free landsat images between 2007 and 2009 in galleguillas et al 2011b rmse values are 0 80 mm day 1 for the simplified surface energy balance index s sebi model and 1 1 mm day 1 for the water deficit index wdi model when applied over a mediterranean vineyard watershed using 11 clear sky images from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflectance radiometer aster sensor between 2007 and 2008 it is worth noting that these studies applying other remote sensing based approaches did not evaluate model output on a continuous daily basis over multiple yearly cycles fig 5 moreover the modeled observed differences in the current study fall within the uncertainty in the measurements where differences between closed and unclosed daily et observations ranged between 0 6 1 35 mm table 2 4 2 cross site time series intercomparison time series of modeled daily et both fused and on landsat overpass dates and observed daily et closed and unclosed for 2017 and 2018 for bar012 slm001 slm002 and rip760 are shown in fig 5 also included is the daily amount of applied irrigation within each vineyard and daily precipitation totals note that flux irrigation and precipitation observations at rip760 and bar012 began in early may of 2017 fig 5 highlights the general agreement between modeled daily et and observed daily et over the different vineyards indicating the utility and portability of this physically based retrieval methodology as seen in fig 5 irrigation strategy differs significantly between the sites both in amount and in timing duration at bar012 where temperatures are milder and vpd is lower there is less atmospheric demand and lower amounts of irrigation it is also important to note that grapes cultivated at bar012 cabernet sauvignon are grown to maximize fruit quality i e measure of sugar content and berry composition and irrigation is carefully managed to achieve this goal this is reflected in the irrigation data where irrigation amounts are kept fairly consistent throughout the growing season 8 10 gal vine 1 day 1 although the amount of irrigation applied 8 10 gal vine 1 day 1 was consistent between the sites not including 2018 at rip760 the number of applications is higher at rip760 in comparison with slm001 slm002 and bar012 at rip760 irrigation is required almost daily during the growing season due to high atmospheric demands sandier soils and grape variety chardonnay additionally vines at rip760 are trained on a double trellis cordon creating more leaf area biomass and higher water requirement per vine these factors lead to higher et rates both observed and modeled at rip760 than at the more northern sites operational irrigation management relies on weekly total et estimates to prescribe irrigation amounts for the subsequent week to replenish water lost according to seguin et al 1999 a target error of 0 80 mm day 1 is suggested for operational agricultural water use in vineyards specifically target accuracies for useful irrigation management should be around 10 from budbreak to harvest m m alsina personal communication 2019 the target error of 0 80 mm day 1 aligns with reported weekly mae which are 0 50 0 49 0 67 and 0 63 mm day 1 at bar012 slm001 slm002 and rip760 respectively table 2 when accounting for predicted and observed mean weekly total et percent errors are 11 9 12 and 9 at bar012 slm001 slm002 and rip760 respectively all close to target accuracy for reference to applied irrigation 8 10 gal vine 1 day 1 translates to between roughly 5 5 mm day 1 at bar012 where vine row distances are largest to 6 8 mm day 1 at rip760 where vine row distances are smallest comparison to et rates during the growing season fig 5 indicates applied irrigation to be on the upper end of both modeled and observed et at each site suggesting vines regardless of location are being irrigated at equal to or slightly more than the amount of water lost via et during peak growing season 4 3 extended time series analysis at sierra loma slm001 and slm002 were the first established grapex sites facilitating an extended time series of flux analysis at this location fig 6 time series for 2015 2018 reveals that most of the bias at slm001 and slm002 reported in table 1 occurred during the 2018 growing season evaporative fluxes for 2015 2017 were better reproduced by the remote sensing model with biases of 0 01 and 0 16 mm day 1 for slm001 and slm002 respectively see also knipper et al 2019a observed et at both sierra loma sites was significantly lower in 2018 than in prior years while modeled et follows the general declining trend in 2018 it is unable to match the magnitude of the decline this trend may be the result of the unprecedented wildfire season of 2018 where roughly 8500 fires burned from mid july to august across the state of california analysis of insolation rates not shown indicates a positive bias between incoming solar radiation from cfsr and tower measurements between july and august this bias is not present during the preceding or subsequent months suggesting that aerosols in the expansive smoke plumes and resulting hazy skies were not accurately captured in csfr leading to an overestimation of insolation and net radiation inputs to the energy balance modeling scheme appendix a and resulting in a positive bias in et gaps in data acquisition via landsat are most pronounced during the non growing season which include the months of november december january february and march this is the result of lower frequency clear sky retrievals of landsat 7 and 8 imagery due to cloud cover present in a mediterranean climate during this timeframe to improve temporal sampling during cloudy conditions steps are being taken to produce routine high spatiotemporal resolution et by fusing multiple sensors including landsat sentinel 2 ecostress ecosystem spaceborne thermal radiometer experiment on space station and other landsat like sensors anderson et al 2020 multi source land imaging project to better understand the vineyard moisture dynamics at sierra loma we looked at trends and relationships in water budget components describing water inputs precipitation irrigation and water loss predominantly et fig 7 shows cumulative modeled et red observed et blue reference et a measure of atmospheric demand green irrigation black solid line precipitation black dashed line and combined cumulative irrigation and precipitation grey due to unreliable irrigation data cumulative sums for 2015 are omitted note that the storage component is not represented and therefore fig 7 should not be interpreted as a true water balance cumulative precipitation increased from 2016 to 2017 in response cumulative irrigation decreased over this period in both blocks because the initiation of irrigation during the spring time was delayed due to sufficiently wet soils in 2018 precipitation rates were lower while irrigation amounts remained roughly the same or slightly less than 2017 this caused water into the system to decrease by roughly 100 mm on average in 2018 between the two sites this decrease of water into the system is not as drastic as the decrease seen in total observed et 248 mm at slm001 261 mm at slm002 in addition reference et used as a metric of atmospheric demand is larger than the previous two years which should promote higher et rates provided water availability in the soil cimis reference et defaults to historical averages between july 26th and august 20th because of interference caused by the wildfires which in contrast to fig 7 led to similar total reference et values to 2016 and 2017 when compared between july 26th and august 20th the overall larger cumulative reference et in 2018 is likely simply due to elevated reference et values during the latter part of the year specifically between mid october and mid november reference et values are on average 1 mm day 1 more than those reported in 2016 and 2017 given that this difference is reported post harvest the higher atmospheric demand is likely not resulting in elevated et rates because of decreased plant biomass and the halting of irrigation soil moisture trends at three depths 0 3 m 0 6 m 0 9 m not shown indicate lower peak values at all depths in 2018 when compared to previous years when irrigation begins in july trends in volumetric water content increase at slm002 although delayed to values comparable to previous years values remain low at slm001 with average volumetric water content estimates 0 75 m3 m 3 lower than previous years in addition to slightly lower available water within the soil column particularly at slm001 the vineyards experienced in varying degrees and extent grapevine red blotch associated virus m alsina personal comm 2019 pockets of diseased vines inhibited the vines ability to efficiently transpire regardless of water availability and atmospheric demand causing observed rates to decrease to values much lower than previous years analysis of ndvi and tir imagery over the sites indicate decreased biomass and increased temperatures respectively when compared to previous years likely contributing to the lower modeled estimates however the satellite imagery is unable to capture the magnitude of the decline caused by the grapevine red blotch associated virus causing in part the reported biases information from other spectral bands indicating chlorophyll content or greenness might indicate a green fraction 1 which can reduce transpiration in the priestley taylor algorithm guzinski et al 2013 4 4 lai and vegetation clumping the retrieval of lai using satellite imagery is difficult for vineyards especially those with seasonal cover crops because relative foliage density and vertical distribution changes dramatically in time and space regional differences in lai linked to different varietals trellis architectures management styles i e pruning and row spacing are unique to vineyards additionally temporal differences in foliage density can be misleading because of the prominent cover crop growing in the interrow before and partly during the growing season lai is a key input to the tseb land surface representation in alexi disalexi used to partition radiometric surface temperature and fluxes into canopy and soil components sec 3 1 given the heterogeneousness nature of vineyards distinct row and interrow zones accurate characterization of lai and derived fractional canopy and soil cover is required for successful et modeling in vineyards the current study domain which spans three distinct regions over two years showcases these differences in space and time see fig 1 and fig 8 fig 8 depicts a time series of modeled lai yellow area plot and measured lai red diamond for 2017 and 2018 at bar012 slm001 slm002 and rip760 ground based indirect measurements of canopy lai were taken using the licor 2200 and a measurement protocol validated with destructive sampling by white et al 2019 also included in fig 8 are the ratio of transpiration t to et t et green and snapshots of each vineyard at the beginning of april july and october for 2018 modeled lai estimates compare well to measured estimates during the growing season at bar012 and to a lesser extent at slm001 and slm002 where modeled values are slightly lower than measurements at both locations we find modeled lai estimates to be substantially larger than measurements at the beginning of the year this is attributed to fundamental differences in modeled and measured values measurements taken on the ground represent only the canopy while satellite derived estimates represent an entire pixel 30m 30m which includes both interrow cover crop and canopy during the early portion of the year the satellite signal is dominated by the cover crop which explains the major differences between modeled and measured values it is also during this time that we see major differences between vineyard locations at bar012 where the interrow and cover crop are more substantial lai estimates remain elevated in comparison slm001 slm002 and rip760 have characteristically narrower interrow spacing and subsequently less substantial cover crop consequently modeled lai estimates are small during the non growing season because lai is used to partition the soil and canopy components trends in t et generally follow the same pattern as the modeled lai at slm001 and slm002 where large differences in spring and mid summer lai estimates are observed we find the portion of et contributing to transpiration increases from 25 in february to nearly 100 by june and remains there until fall conversely at bar012 the portion of et contributing to transpiration is consistently above 50 and remains at nearly 100 for a large portion of the year at rip760 trends in t et are slightly more scattered with values between 70 80 during the non growing season despite lai estimates of nearly zero rip760 show the largest underestimation of modeled lai with values during the peak growing season at nearly half of measured estimates this is likely due to the double trellis design of the vine which contributes a large amount of plant biomass underneath the top vine canopy seen by the satellite this underestimation of lai leads to large modeled substrate evaporation values during the peak growing season that are not representative of actual surface conditions see phenocam on july 2 2018 fig 8 transpiration is underestimated contributing the negative bias in et at rip760 mid season a test using the tseb modeling approach in local mode e g kustas et al 2019 with thermal ir measurements from the upwelling longwave sensor on the flux tower and lai inputs enhanced by a factor of 2 5 i e the overall ratio of observed and predicted lai leads to an increase in overall et by 0 28 mm day 1 on average better matching the closed fluxes therefore improvements in the landsat scale retrieval of lai over strongly clumped sites such as rip760 are likely to improve remote sensing performances at these sites 4 5 spatial analysis routine satellite derived daily et estimates at 30 m resolution can facilitate identification of variability in water use within a given vineyard and between vineyards in the surrounding landscapes maps of monthly total et centered at all three grapex measurement sites for 2017 fig 9 and 2018 fig 10 highlight the model s ability to capture spatiotemporal variability in moisture dynamics in the landscape around the target experimental blocks this spatial variability could not be captured using isolated in situ measurements within vineyard spatial variability between april and september is 1 7 2 1 2 7 and 2 0 mm day 1 at bar012 slm001 slm002 and rip760 respectively comparison to rmse values at each site table 2 demonstrate within vineyard variability is considerably larger than reported errors between modeled and observed values when comparing to neighboring vineyards spatial variability increases for example at bar012 vineyard block to vineyard block variations can be up to 3 0 mm day 1 during the peak growing season suggesting the importance of capturing spatiotemporal variability in consumptive water use rates in each vineyard domain monthly total et peaks in june july with higher values in the central valley slm001 slm002 rip760 when compared to sonoma county bar012 bar012 shows little spatial variability within the study vineyard between years but significant variability across surrounding area with very high et in the forest land located south of bar012 slm001 shows the largest amount of within vineyard spatial variability related to variations in soil texture and vine vigor knipper et al 2019a a notable change in water use patterns from 2017 to 2018 can be found in the two fields located south and southwest of slm002 irrigation in the alfalfa field directly to the south of slm002 appears to have been curtailed in june of 2017 a similar conclusion was found in 2016 by anderson et al 2018 where et rates over the same field were lower in relation to surrounding fields in 2018 a different pattern emerges with et rates remaining elevated albeit lower than neighboring fields throughout the growing season differences in patterns over this alfalfa field are likely attributed to variability in irrigation cutting cycles throughout the years conversely the field to the southwest of slm002 appears fallowed during the 2018 growing season with monthly total et rates of nearly half those reported in 2017 despite large spatial variability in monthly total et over the rip760 scene most discernable fields are classified as vineyards those bordering the western edge of the scene are classified as deciduous fruits and nuts by the california department of water resources land use map but show no major differences in monthly total et there is an interesting pattern in spring and fall monthly et totals between slm001 slm002 and rip760 slm001 and slm002 and the surrounding area show elevated et totals during the month of april when compared to rip760 and its surrounding area this difference is reversed in september where higher rates of et linger from the growing season at rip760 while et totals at slm001 and slm002 represent vines that have undergone some level of senescence this pattern of what appears to be a shift in growing season is present in both 2017 and 2018 a possible explanation is the difference in soil types and irrigation practices rip760 has sandier soils than slm001 slm002 causing less soil moisture and lower et from the vine interrow system in april as vines are just beginning to develop in september shortly after both vineyards have been harvested a large amount of irrigation is applied at rip760 to flush salts from the soil and replenish groundwater reservoirs m alsina personal comm 2019 the amount of water applied at rip760 is roughly 100 gal vine more than the amount applied at slm001 slm002 for september of 2018 likely resulting in elevated evaporation estimates 5 conclusion and discussion mapping et at spatial and temporal scales suitable for irrigation management has the potential to lead efforts in the conservation of agricultural water resources and create more sustainable wine grape production this study investigated the application of the alexi disalexi modeling scheme over four individual vineyard sites during 2017 and 2018 with the goal of providing a robust and portable et model for widespread applications at the vineyard management scale sites have been primary targets of micrometeorological and biophysical field measurements as part of the usda ars grape remote sensing atmospheric profile and evapotranspiration experiment grapex overall the alexi disalexi modeling scheme in conjunction with starfm produced daily et estimates at 30 m spatial resolution with good fidelity across multiple vineyards characteristic of having different grape varieties trellis designs canopy structure irrigation management and climate conditions modeled et had an average rmse and mae of 0 88 mm day 1 and 0 70 mm day 1 respectively between vineyard locations these errors align with those reported in knipper et al 2019a 2019b where the model was applied at individual grapex locations are within the uncertainty in the et observations and are on par with a target mae of 0 80 mm day 1 suggested by seguin et al 1999 despite general agreement with tower estimates modeled values report positive biases at slm001 and slm002 during the 2018 growing season while also producing a consistently negative bias at rip760 throughout the study period positive biases at slm001 and slm002 are exclusive to 2018 when the vineyard experienced grapevine red blotch associated virus and wildfires caused smoke filled skies that led to an overestimation of insolation the virus caused loses in transpiration and lower observed et rates and subsequently larger gaps between observed and modeled estimates which were unable to meet the magnitude of the declining trend in et during 2018 additional remote sensing information providing a reduction in green fraction due to unhealthy vine leaves caused by the virus could help remedy this bias issue at slm sites moreover negative biases in et reported at rip760 are the result of the misrepresentation of lai within a double trellis designed canopy where values were nearly half of the ground based measurements ongoing work is addressing this issue of partitioning between canopy and cover crop from a satellite perspective as part of the continued effort of the grapex project kustas et al 2018 spatial analysis of monthly total et highlights the advantages of utilizing a satellite based approach by showing the large variability in moisture dynamics within and surrounding the targeted vineyards providing a spatial et product at a scale useful for irrigation managers daily 30 m has the potential to improve water allocation and conservation efforts by identifying areas of uneven water use due to variations in soil texture and composition and other environmental or anthropogenic factors additionally a reliable and portable satellite based et model allows growers and irrigation managers to make use of variable rate drip irrigation systems that can apply appropriate amounts of water and nutrients to specific areas within a vineyard to achieve more uniform grape quality and yield goals declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

class anderson et al 2005 these components are used to solve the surface energy budget for the soil canopy and combined system fig a1 a4 r n s h s λ e s g a5 r n c h c λ e c where rns and rnc are the soil and canopy net radiation respectively hc and hs are canopy and soil sensible heat flux respectively and λes and λec are the soil evaporation and canopy transpiration rates respectively assuming an interaction between canopy and soil fluxes due to heating of in canopy air by heat transport from the soil the resistance network is considered in series and hc and hs can be defined as a6 h c ρ c

versus temperature curve and γ is the psychrometric constant 0 066 kpa c 1 under stressed conditions when vegetation is transpiring at a rate much less than potential eqn a9 will result in an overestimate of λec which causes λes to become negative as it is computed as a residual to the energy balance condensation at the soil surface i e λes 0 during midday on clear days is unrealistic therefore when this condition is encountered the priestley taylor coefficient is iteratively reduced until λes 0 which is expected for an extremely dry soil surface 
10486,land use and land cover lulc change is critical to hydrologic study as it affects surface runoff sediment yield and nutrient load from watersheds change in lulc is a continuous process in agricultural watersheds as per the growing and harvesting seasons in this study monthly lulc data layers were generated for the big sunflower river watershed bsrw mississippi by classifying cloud free landsat images from 2014 to 2018 and combining them according to the season in order to obtain dominant lulc data layers for spring summer and fall about 60 of the total land area in summer was cultivated land whereas only 20 and 5 of the total land area were cultivated land during fall and spring respectively the rest of the total land area was constantly covered with urban forest and water for the three seasons the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient ranging from of 87 to 92 and 0 8 to 0 90 was obtained during accuracy assessment of the seasonal lulc data layers this suggested that the seasonal data layers can reasonably be used in the soil and water assessment tool swat to analyze the effects of lulc data variation on hydrology and water quality of bsrw swat was calibrated and validated for streamflow sediment yield and nutrient concentration using the summer lulc data layer and those parameters were applied to the models using the spring and fall lulc data layers swat output for runoff sediment yield and nutrient load was found to be very sensitive to the change in lulc data layers the average amount of runoff and sediment yield was higher during the summer while total nitrogen and total phosphorous yields were higher during the fall and spring respectively agricultural operations are usually conducted during the summer and fields are mostly barren during the spring and fall the use of seasonal lulc data layers is very beneficial to the scientific community as they can better explain the seasonal variation in hydrology and water quality as compared to the annual cropland data layer that is available for a single season of a year keywords lulc seasonal variation hydrology water quality swat 1 introduction the modification of the earth s surface caused by anthropogenic activities such as urbanization deforestation and agricultural practices or by natural phenomena such as floods soil erosion landslides and climate change are referred as land use and land cover lulc change abdulkareem et al 2019 hassan et al 2016 imran 2019 change in lulc is responsible for alterations in ecosystems and environmental processes at local regional and global levels gebremicael et al 2019 gyamfi et al 2016 changes in lulc have led to global warming loss of agricultural land degradation of soil and water quality expansion of urban areas etc hassan et al 2016 thus lulc change is a very important topic of study as they relate to climate change and changes in urbanization agriculture forestry geology hydrology and other ecosystem services assessment of the effects of lulc change on hydrology and water quality can provide critical inputs to the decision making during development of watershed management and ecological restoration strategies gyamfi et al 2016 hassan et al 2016 nie et al 2011 to date most of the research on how lulc change affects hydrology and water quality has been focused on evaluating changes in channel discharge in response to lulc change over a period of more than a decade dinka and klik 2019 ghaffari et al 2010 hernandez et al 2000 however characteristics of agricultural land also vary seasonally according to cropping and harvesting operations conducted in the watershed each year lulc change for an agricultural watershed like the big sunflower river watershed bsrw is a continuous process and the hydrological behavior of the watershed varies significantly for different seasons within a year thus there is a need to study the changes in hydrology and water quality within the watershed as a response to the seasonal variations in the lulc data spring summer and fall seasons were considered for the analysis of seasonal variation in the study area while winter was not been considered in this study as the climate of bsrw is characterized by very short duration of severe cold weather noaa ncei 2020 lulc change analysis is usually performed using remote sensing data obtained using satellite imagery or aerial photographs with the development of remote sensing technologies and the availability of satellite data such as land remote sensing satellite system landsat moderate resolution imaging spectral radiometer modis and other spaceborne high resolution hr and very high resolution vhr sensors effective methods have been developed for the analysis of land cover change goldblatt et al 2018 patel et al 2015 much research has been conducted to quantify how climate and land use change impact the hydrologic cycle and water quality for example climate and land use change impacts on streamflow nitrogen and phosphorus were examined for a canadian river basin where a change in streamflow was due to climatic variability whereas the change in nutrient concentration was due to alteration in land use el khoury et al 2015 the hydrologic model soil and water assessment tool swat incorporating spatial and temporal dynamics of land use and land cover was effective in simulating streamflow sediment and nutrient yield for bagmati river basin located in kathmandu nepal pokhrel 2018 impacts of lulc change in surface runoff percolation baseflow and evapotranspiration et were evaluated for the upper san pedro watershed located in sonora mexico and southeastern arizona usa providing quantitative information to the stakeholders for better watershed management plan nie et al 2011 a study conducted at lake tahoe a sub alpine lake located in the state of california and nevada usa found that nutrients concentration varied according to the seasonal alterations in groundwater recharge naranjo et al 2019 although there are numerous studies related to hydrology and water quality in response to long term lulc change there is limited literature to date that evaluates watershed processes based on dominant seasonal lulc data dinka and klik 2019 ghaffari et al 2010 hernandez et al 2000 the objectives of this study are to a develop a lulc data layers for spring summer and fall b perform accuracy assessment of those data layers and c use them in the swat model to analyze sensitivity of change in seasonal lulc data layers to streamflow sediment yield and nutrient load 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the area selected for this study is the bsrw a major sub watershed of the yazoo river basin located within the lower part of mississippi river alluvial plain also known as mississippi delta it lies in the northwestern part of mississippi between the latitude of 32 30 n to 34 25 n and longitude of 91 10 e to 90 13 e it covers an area of 10 500 km2 and falls within ten different counties in mississippi elevation of the bsrw watershed ranges from nearly flat to undulating gentle slopes from around 15 60 meters above mean sea level it is an agricultural watershed with agricultural fields covering about 70 of the total land in bsrw the major types of soil include sharkey dowling forestdale alligator and dundee all of which have higher percentages of clay and silt the location map of bsrw is shown in fig 1 2 2 landsat image landsat images from 2014 to 2018 were used to obtain seasonal lulc data layers landsat satellites have been continuously providing images of the earth s land surface since 1972 goldblatt et al 2018 the temporal resolution of the landsat is 16 days the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps a national aeronautics and space administration nasa project have processed the landsat thematic mapper tm and enhanced thematic mapper plus etm imagery into surface reflectance scenes for north america using atmospheric correction procedures that was originally developed for the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis instruments masek et al 2012 2006 these surface reflectance scenes are very helpful for the research on lulc since it does not have atmospheric scattering or absorption and is measured at ground level cloud free landsat 8 oli level 2 images having higher image quality were used in this study they are generated using the land surface reflectance code lasrc algorithm version 1 4 1 which makes use of the coastal aerosol band to perform aerosol inversion tests auxiliary climate data from modis and a radiative transfer model vermote et al 2016 landsat level 2 surface reflectance image produced by usgs landsat science team are corrected for atmospheric errors such as aerosol scattering and thin clouds and can be used directly for research purpose usgs landsat missions 2020 as the landsat 8 data are available from 2013 till date the images from 2014 to 2018 for each month were downloaded from usgs global visualization viewer https glovis usgs gov glovis 2020 the landsat 8 oli has nine spectral bands including a panchromatic band band 1 to band 7 have a resolution of 30 m while band 8 a panchromatic band has a resolution on 15 m and band 9 a cirrus band has a resolution of 30 m bands 1 7 of the downloaded image were selected for this study those bands were layer stacked using arcgis after which the two scenes of the image for our watershed area were mosaicked and clipped using the watershed boundary 2 3 lulc classification several parametric and non parametric classification methods are available for lulc classification maximum likelihood ml method is one the extensively used parametric methods it is based on bayes theorem and assumes a single normal distribution of the samples per class in the feature space variances and covariances of the signatures classes are used to assign each raster cell a pre defined class ritchie et al 2018 different classes are characterized by the mean vector and the covariance matrix with the assumption that the distribution of a class sample is normal non parametric classification methods like support vector machine svm and random forest rf do not make any assumptions regarding data distribution and they do not require any statistical parameters to identify classes svm is based on concept of maximization and can be used for data with heterogeneous classes and limited numbers of training samples melgani and bruzzone 2004 decision tree dt classification methods on the other hand divide a dataset into smaller subsets through tests defined at each part in the tree friedl and brodley 1997 dts are further broken down into roots nodes and leafs dts are open source software and thus can be helpful in lowering the cost of classification random forest classifier rf develops multiple decision trees in classifying images welch 2019 and each decision tree is generated from different subsets of the training data this method is comparatively accurate and can handle several input variables at a time peng et al 2019 the maximum likelihood ml classification algorithm available in arcgis was applied to classify landsat images to develop lulc data layers for each month in this study because of its robust abilities and its availability in almost every image processing software lu and weng 2007 these data layers were then combined to produce seasonal lulc data layers this method is one of the widely used supervised classification techniques multiple lulc data layers of bsrw for each month from 2014 to 2018 were developed by classifying cloud free landsat images the images were classified to water forested wetlands cultivated barren and urban the year was divided into three seasons january to april as spring may to august as summer and september to december as fall 2 4 development of seasonal lulc data layer the numerical values were given to each class in the monthly lulc data layers the data layers from 2014 to 2018 were then added together according to the months in spring summer and fall using raster calculator tool in arcgis the resulting data layers were then reclassified again as water forest cultivated barren and urban according to resultant pixel value to produce dominant lulc data layers representing each season those seasonal lulc data layers were used in swat to analyze differences in runoff sediment yield and nutrient concentration due to changes in seasonal lulc data layers 2 5 accuracy assessment the accuracy of the classification describes the agreement of classified image with reference to ground truth data and is performed generally using confusion or error matrix foody 2002 the error matrix provides a cross tabulation of a mapped classes against the ground truth reference data and helps to characterize accuracy metrices the accuracy of the lulc data layers for each season was assessed by comparing the classified seasonal data layer with landsat images of the respective seasons a set of random points for ground truth data or reference data were created for the accuracy assessment using error matrix some of these points were also validated by visiting the study area about 50 points for each class including water forest cultivated land barren land and urban areas were considered for accuracy assessment 2 5 1 error matrix and the accuracy metrices an error matrix is one of the quantitative methods for characterizing the accuracy of classified images it is a square array denoting the correspondence between a classified data layer and the ground truth data the rows in the matrix indicate the class of classified data layer while the columns indicate the ground truth data or reference data a sample error matrix for five classes is shown in table 1 the diagonal values indicate the accuracy of the classification while non diagonal values indicate the error between the classified data and its corresponding reference data producer s accuracy pa user s accuracy ua overall accuracy oa and kappa coefficient were computed using an error matrix pa or the omission error oe gives the indication of accuracy of each class where pixels of a known class are classified as something other than that class similarly ua or the commission error ce indicates the accuracy of each class where pixels are incorrectly classified as a known class when they should have been classified as something else 2 5 1 1 overall accuracy the overall accuracy oa indicates the accuracy of all the classes included in image classification and informs what proportion of the entire area is classified correctly the diagonal cells of the error matrix contain the number of correctly classified pixels the overall accuracy oa of the classification is obtained by dividing the sum of correctly classified pixels by the total number of reference pixels it is usually expressed as a percent from a similar error matrix generated in this study as shown in table 1 the oa was calculated by summing the pixels in the diagonal and dividing them by total number of pixels in the error matrix as o a c 11 c 22 c 33 c 44 c 55 n where c11 c22 c33 c44 and c55 are the correctly assigned pixels for each class and n is the total number of pixels for all the classes considered in the accuracy assessment 2 5 1 2 kappa coefficient the kappa coefficient is a measure of the difference between actual agreement and the agreement expected by chance it is one of the standard measures used in accuracy assessment and has been recommended by several studies as it resolves the issue of correct allocation of a class by coincident foody 2002 rosenfield and fitzpatrick lins 1986 smits et al 1999 the kappa coefficient is generated using a statistical test and its value can vary from 1 to 1 a value less than 0 indicates that the classification is no better than a classification obtained by chance and a value near 1 indicates that the classification is significantly better than a classification obtained by chance a k a p p a c o e f f i c i e n t 0 80 represents strong agreement and good accuracy while a k a p p a c o e f f i c i e n t 0 40 is considered poor rwanga and ndambuki 2017 from a similar error matrix generated in this study as shown in table 1 the kappa coefficient was computed by k a p p a c o e f f i c i e n t n i 1 k c i i i 1 k c i c i n 2 i 1 k c i c i where cii is the correctly assigned pixel for ith class ci marginal total of row for class i c i is the marginal total of column for class i k is the total number of classes and n is the total number of pixels considered in accuracy assessment 2 6 swat swat is an extensively applied watershed scale model that can simulate hydrology and water quality and predict the impacts of different land use change and best management practices bmps at a watershed scale neitsch et al 2002 the modelling tool delineates the watershed using digital elevation model dem and divides it into sub basins sub basins are further divided into hydrologic response units hrus a unique combination of land use soil and slope after incorporation of land use and soil data in the model the time series data of precipitation temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed along with management operation are provided to the model which helps in determination of quantities such as surface runoff evapotranspiration infiltration sediment yield groundwater recharge water quality outputs etc at each hru sub basins and reach segments of the watershed neitsch et al 2005 2002 the swat model has been successfully implemented in simulating streamflow sediment yield and the nutrient load from a watershed dakhlalla et al 2016 ni and parajuli 2018 parajuli et al 2013 risal and parajuli 2019 streamflow is the discharge of water in streams or any water body and is one of the main components of runoff generated from the land surface in swat streamflow is estimated using scs curve number method neitsch et al 2005 the sediment eroded by sheet rill gully and streambank erosion are transported through the streams and are estimated in swat using the modified universal soil loss equation musle neitsch et al 2005 similarly nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous are the essential micro nutrients required for crop growth the excess amount of these nutrients transported to the water body severely deteriorates the water quality of streams rivers lakes and shallow groundwater lory 2018 they are estimated in swat considering their supply and demand neitsch et al 2005 in the current study three seasonal lulc data layers were individually applied to the swat with other inputs being same in order to analyze difference in streamflow sediment yield and nutrient concentration as response to the seasonal lulc change 2 6 1 swat input swat input requirements include digital elevation model dem lulc data layer soil fata layer and daily time series of meteorological data such as precipitation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed a 30 m resolution dem of 3d elevation program 3dep series provided by united

natural resource conservation service nrcs https www nrcs usda gov nrcs 2020 meteorological data was derived from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa https www ncdc noaa gov noaa ncei 2020 2 6 2 swat calibration and validation multisite swat calibration and validation was performed for streamflow sediment yield total nitrogen and total phosphorous at the outlets of sub basin 5 sub basin 10 and sub basin 17 of bsrw situated at the usgs gauges 728 820 marigold 7 288 500 sunflower and 788 650 leland respectively as shown in fig 1 streamflow was calibrated from january 2013 to december 2015 and validated from january 2016 to december 2019 using observed monthly discharge obtained from the three usgs gauges similarly sediment yield total nitrogen and total phosphorous were calibrated from november 2013 to december 2014 and validated from january 2015 to december 2016 at the outlets of sub basin 5 sub basin 10 and sub basin calibration and validation were based on measured daily total suspended solid tss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp these data were obtained every fifteen days from 2013 to 2016 the calibration and validation period for sediment yield total nitrogen and total phosphorous was shorter than that for streamflow because of the limitation of observed data automatic calibration of streamflow sediment yield total nitrogen and total phosphorous was performed using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm within swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup package abbaspour 2013 the r factor and p factor which were computed by sufi 2 were used to predict model uncertainty t statistics and p value were used to perform sensitivity analysis the model performance during calibration and validation was analyzed using the coefficient of determination r2 draper and smith 1966 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 these two statistics are widely used and reliable measures for comparing observed and simulated data the value of nse ranges from to 1 and r2 ranges from 0 to 1 values of 1 for both statistics are considered perfect krause et al 2005 nash and sutcliffe 1970 in general if nse is greater than 0 50 model simulation can be considered as satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 the parameters used their range and the calibrated values for streamflow sediment yield total nitrogen and total phosphorous are shown in table 2 3 results 3 1 seasonal lulc data layer the lulc data layer from summer showed that about 60 of the total land was cultivated whereas the percentage of cultivated land during fall and spring were just 20 and 5 respectively the majority of the agricultural lands during spring and fall were barren the percentage of urban forest and water for all three seasons was almost constant with around 21 12 and 1 respectively the seasonal lulc data layers for spring fall and summer are shown in fig 2 3 2 accuracy of seasonal data layer the seasonal lulc data layer for all three seasons were characterized by higher precision with overall accuracy ranging from of 87 to 92 and kappa coefficient ranging from 0 84 to 0 90 the producer s accuracy and user s accuracy for different classes ranged from 68 to 100 and 75 to 100 respectively the different accuracy matrices for summer fall and spring are summarized in table 3 3 3 model performance 3 3 1 streamflow for the calibration of streamflow nine parameters were used among them four parameters namely initial scs runoff curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 available water capacity of first

are presented in table 7 and the graph showing time series of observed and simulated total phosphorous load during its calibration and validation at sub basin 5 is presented in fig 6 3 4 effect of seasonal lulc data layers 3 4 1 streamflow the average streamflow was slightly higher during summer for all the four sub watersheds than that during spring and fall the average streamflow at the watershed outlet was observed to be 185 75 m3 sec in summer while that for spring and fall were 164 82 m3 sec and 181 12 m3 sec respectively average streamflow at the outlet of sub watersheds 5 10 17 and 30 of bsrw for spring summer and fall seasons are shown in fig 7 the average precipitation in the bsrw was highest in spring 636 mm while rainfall during summer and fall were 439 mm and 455 mm respectively the average monthly precipitation was highest during march and april 182 mm and 176 mm respectively and lowest during september and august 84 mm and 93 mm respectively 3 4 2 sediment yield the average sediment concentration was higher in summer for all the sub watersheds in comparison to that in spring and fall despite the reduced average rainfall during summer the average sediment concentration at the watershed outlet was observed to be 10 92 mg l in summer while that for spring and fall were 3 10 mg l and 3 27 mg l respectively average sediment concentration at the outlet of sub basin 5 10 17 and 30 for spring summer and fall are shown in fig 8 although average precipitation was lower during the summer than spring or fall average sediment concentration was higher during the summer this is due to tillage during late spring and early summer before planting in addition increased flow from irrigation is responsible for higher soil erosion and sediment yield in the bsrw although conservation tillage practices such as no till strip till and mulch till are encouraged to reduce soil erosion more than 75 farmers in mississippi delta still use conventional tillage prior to planting corn and soybean to create uniform seedbed and eliminate competition from weeds snipes et al 2005 tillage induces soil erosion and is one of the responsible factors for the increase in sediment yield from agricultural watersheds zhao et al 2018 this watershed scale study was conducted to assess the impact of tillage practices on stream flow crop and sediment yields at the bsrw mississippi results show that conventional tillage produced higher sediment yield than reduced tillage parajuli et al 2016 3 4 3 total nitrogen the average total nitrogen concentration during fall was higher compared to the spring and summer for all four sub watersheds the average total nitrogen concentration at the watershed outlet was 136 mg in the fall while that for spring and summer were 54 mg and 92 mg respectively average total nitrogen concentration at the outlets of sub basins 5 10 17 and 30 for spring summer and fall are shown in fig 9 3 4 4 total phosphorous the average amount of total phosphorous concentration was higher in spring compared to summer and fall the average total phosphorous yield at the watershed outlet was 325 mg in spring while that for summer and fall were 245 mg and 285 mg respectively average total phosphorous concentrations at the outlet of sub basins 5 10 17 and 30 for spring summer and fall are shown in fig 10 4 discussion and conclusions this study investigated the variation in surface runoff sediment and nutrient yield due to seasonal changes in land use and land cover for an agricultural watershed this was accomplished by using multiple lulc data layers for three different seasons in the swat model these kinds of seasonal variations cannot be observed using a single lulc data layer such as the cropland data layer cdl or the national land cover dataset nlcd as they use the lulc data layer created mostly from the images taken in summer the seasonal lulc data layers for spring summer and fall were obtained by combining monthly lulc data layers whose overall accuracy ranged between 87 and 92 and the kappa coefficient ranged between 0 84 to 0 90 these statistics suggest that the classified data layers generated represented respective seasons well three seasonal lulc data layers were used in swat and three separate models were developed the swat model was calibrated and validated for streamflow sediment yield total nitrogen and total phosphorous the statistical values of r2 and nse obtained during the calibration and validation of streamflow was in accordance to the results of previous modelling studies conducted in the bsrw dakhlalla et al 2016 ni and parajuli 2018 parajuli et al 2016 risal and parajuli 2019 calibration and validation statistics were not much affected by the change in seasonal lulc data layer and were reasonable according to the standard set in a comprehensive review article based on more than 250 worldwide swat application studies gassman et al 2007 similarly the statistics during simulation of sediment yield were also reasonable as sediment loading is driven by surface runoff and streamflow qi et al 2020 the calibration and validation of sediment concentration at the three usgs gauging stations within bsrw were also found to be consistent with the previous swat calibration and validation results dakhlalla et al 2016 ni and parajuli 2018 risal and parajuli 2019 likewise the calibration and validation of tn and tp were found satisfactory except for few exceptions caused by limitation of observed data moriasi et al 2007 the observed data at certain periods were abnormally high and were responsible for lower value of statistics the tn and tp simulations were consistent with previous calibration and validation results for bsrw risal and parajuli 2019 even though it is desirable to calibrate the major constituents of nitrogen and phosphorous loading such as organic nitrogen phosphorous and mineral nitrogen phosphorous rather than tn and tp the individual constituents could not be calibrated due to the unavailability of monitoring data for each constituent arnold et al 2012 the average streamflow at the watershed outlet during summer 185 m3 sec was highest than the average streamflow during spring 164 m3 sec and fall 181 m3 sec even though the average rainfall received during summer 439 mm was lower than the average rainfall received during spring 636 mm and fall 455 mm this is due to the additional irrigation supplied to the fields through groundwater pumping due to the seasonal distribution of rainfall in bsrw region supplemental irrigation is required to maximize crop yield the crops in bsrw were planted in late april harvested in early september and irrigated periodically during july to early august the application of irrigation in the field was simulated using the auto irrigation function of swat similarly a study conducted in 18 indian sub continental river basins showed that irrigation is responsible for increases in surface runoff and streamflow in an agricultural watershed shah et al 2019 the observed flow data also suggests greater flows in summer compared to fall or spring apart from increased crop productivity through required water supply during the dry period of the year irrigation may also lead to increase in surface runoff and sediment transport if the method of irrigation is not appropriate peddi and kumar 2019 raeisi vanani et al 2017 like streamflow average sediment concentration at the watershed outlet was highest during summer 10 92 mg l than during spring 3 10 mg l and fall 3 27 mg l this is due to the tillage operation conducted during late spring and early summer before planting in addition increased flow from irrigation is responsible for higher soil erosion and sediment yield in the bsrw although conservation tillage practices such as no till strip till and mulch till are encouraged to reduce soil erosion more that 75 of farmers in the mississippi delta still use conventional tillage prior to planting corn and soybean to create uniform a seedbed and eliminate competition from weeds snipes et al 2005 tillage induces soil erosion and is one of the responsible factors for the increase in sediment yield from an agricultural watershed zhao et al 2018 a previous watershed scale study conducted to assess the impact of tillage practices on stream flow crop and sediment yields at the bsrw mississippi showed that conventional tillage produced higher sediment yield than reduced tillage parajuli et al 2016 on the other hand average total nitrogen yield was lowest during spring 54 mg and highest during fall 136 mg due to the inability of plants to uptake all of the nitrogen fertilizer and washing off of unused nitrogen after runoff events nitrogen is added to the soil by different means such as fertilizer application manure and plant residue application rainfall or fixation by symbiotic and non symbiotic bacteria nitrogen is removed from the soil through plant uptake leaching denitrification volatilization and erosion neitsch et al 2005 mineral nitrogen applied to corn and cotton during the last week of april and the crop residues left in the field after harvest in early september are responsible for high level of total nitrogen during the fall as only a small portion of applied fertilizer is up taken by crops moreno et al 2018 moreover crop residue left on the field in the fall after harvest also contributes total nitrogen washoff during runoff caused by rainfall likewise the average total phosphorous at the watershed outlet was highest in spring 325 mg and lowest in summer 245 mg due to the soluble nature of phosphorous which becomes readily available for transport in surface runoff and the ability of crops like soybean to accumulate phosphorous in the soil phosphorous is applied to soil through fertilizer manure and residue and removed by soil through plant uptake and erosion the average amount of precipitation during the spring was higher than that in summer and fall the total phosphorous concentration was also highest in spring phosphorous is highly soluble in water and is readily available for transport with surface runoff neitsch et al 2005 unlike nitrogen which is usually considered mobile phosphorous is capable of easily combining with other ions to form insoluble compounds and precipitate out of soil and wash off with rainwater the phosphorous present in the soil was mostly discharged by surface runoff during heavy rainfall events in the spring neitsch et al 2005 sharpley and syers 1979 as the major crop grown in the bsrw is soybeans which is capable of accumulating soil phosphorous reddy et al 1999 the total phosphorous concentration was lowest throughout summer during which the fields were planted with soybean this study is very valuable to the scientific community as it explains the variability of hydrologic and water quality

10486,land use and land cover lulc change is critical to hydrologic study as it affects surface runoff sediment yield and nutrient load from watersheds change in lulc is a continuous process in agricultural watersheds as per the growing and harvesting seasons in this study monthly lulc data layers were generated for the big sunflower river watershed bsrw mississippi by classifying cloud free landsat images from 2014 to 2018 and combining them according to the season in order to obtain dominant lulc data layers for spring summer and fall about 60 of the total land area in summer was cultivated land whereas only 20 and 5 of the total land area were cultivated land during fall and spring respectively the rest of the total land area was constantly covered with urban forest and water for the three seasons the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient ranging from of 87 to 92 and 0 8 to 0 90 was obtained during accuracy assessment of the seasonal lulc data layers this suggested that the seasonal data layers can reasonably be used in the soil and water assessment tool swat to analyze the effects of lulc data variation on hydrology and water quality of bsrw swat was calibrated and validated for streamflow sediment yield and nutrient concentration using the summer lulc data layer and those parameters were applied to the models using the spring and fall lulc data layers swat output for runoff sediment yield and nutrient load was found to be very sensitive to the change in lulc data layers the average amount of runoff and sediment yield was higher during the summer while total nitrogen and total phosphorous yields were higher during the fall and spring respectively agricultural operations are usually conducted during the summer and fields are mostly barren during the spring and fall the use of seasonal lulc data layers is very beneficial to the scientific community as they can better explain the seasonal variation in hydrology and water quality as compared to the annual cropland data layer that is available for a single season of a year keywords lulc seasonal variation hydrology water quality swat 1 introduction the modification of the earth s surface caused by anthropogenic activities such as urbanization deforestation and agricultural practices or by natural phenomena such as floods soil erosion landslides and climate change are referred as land use and land cover lulc change abdulkareem et al 2019 hassan et al 2016 imran 2019 change in lulc is responsible for alterations in ecosystems and environmental processes at local regional and global levels gebremicael et al 2019 gyamfi et al 2016 changes in lulc have led to global warming loss of agricultural land degradation of soil and water quality expansion of urban areas etc hassan et al 2016 thus lulc change is a very important topic of study as they relate to climate change and changes in urbanization agriculture forestry geology hydrology and other ecosystem services assessment of the effects of lulc change on hydrology and water quality can provide critical inputs to the decision making during development of watershed management and ecological restoration strategies gyamfi et al 2016 hassan et al 2016 nie et al 2011 to date most of the research on how lulc change affects hydrology and water quality has been focused on evaluating changes in channel discharge in response to lulc change over a period of more than a decade dinka and klik 2019 ghaffari et al 2010 hernandez et al 2000 however characteristics of agricultural land also vary seasonally according to cropping and harvesting operations conducted in the watershed each year lulc change for an agricultural watershed like the big sunflower river watershed bsrw is a continuous process and the hydrological behavior of the watershed varies significantly for different seasons within a year thus there is a need to study the changes in hydrology and water quality within the watershed as a response to the seasonal variations in the lulc data spring summer and fall seasons were considered for the analysis of seasonal variation in the study area while winter was not been considered in this study as the climate of bsrw is characterized by very short duration of severe cold weather noaa ncei 2020 lulc change analysis is usually performed using remote sensing data obtained using satellite imagery or aerial photographs with the development of remote sensing technologies and the availability of satellite data such as land remote sensing satellite system landsat moderate resolution imaging spectral radiometer modis and other spaceborne high resolution hr and very high resolution vhr sensors effective methods have been developed for the analysis of land cover change goldblatt et al 2018 patel et al 2015 much research has been conducted to quantify how climate and land use change impact the hydrologic cycle and water quality for example climate and land use change impacts on streamflow nitrogen and phosphorus were examined for a canadian river basin where a change in streamflow was due to climatic variability whereas the change in nutrient concentration was due to alteration in land use el khoury et al 2015 the hydrologic model soil and water assessment tool swat incorporating spatial and temporal dynamics of land use and land cover was effective in simulating streamflow sediment and nutrient yield for bagmati river basin located in kathmandu nepal pokhrel 2018 impacts of lulc change in surface runoff percolation baseflow and evapotranspiration et were evaluated for the upper san pedro watershed located in sonora mexico and southeastern arizona usa providing quantitative information to the stakeholders for better watershed management plan nie et al 2011 a study conducted at lake tahoe a sub alpine lake located in the state of california and nevada usa found that nutrients concentration varied according to the seasonal alterations in groundwater recharge naranjo et al 2019 although there are numerous studies related to hydrology and water quality in response to long term lulc change there is limited literature to date that evaluates watershed processes based on dominant seasonal lulc data dinka and klik 2019 ghaffari et al 2010 hernandez et al 2000 the objectives of this study are to a develop a lulc data layers for spring summer and fall b perform accuracy assessment of those data layers and c use them in the swat model to analyze sensitivity of change in seasonal lulc data layers to streamflow sediment yield and nutrient load 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the area selected for this study is the bsrw a major sub watershed of the yazoo river basin located within the lower part of mississippi river alluvial plain also known as mississippi delta it lies in the northwestern part of mississippi between the latitude of 32 30 n to 34 25 n and longitude of 91 10 e to 90 13 e it covers an area of 10 500 km2 and falls within ten different counties in mississippi elevation of the bsrw watershed ranges from nearly flat to undulating gentle slopes from around 15 60 meters above mean sea level it is an agricultural watershed with agricultural fields covering about 70 of the total land in bsrw the major types of soil include sharkey dowling forestdale alligator and dundee all of which have higher percentages of clay and silt the location map of bsrw is shown in fig 1 2 2 landsat image landsat images from 2014 to 2018 were used to obtain seasonal lulc data layers landsat satellites have been continuously providing images of the earth s land surface since 1972 goldblatt et al 2018 the temporal resolution of the landsat is 16 days the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps a national aeronautics and space administration nasa project have processed the landsat thematic mapper tm and enhanced thematic mapper plus etm imagery into surface reflectance scenes for north america using atmospheric correction procedures that was originally developed for the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis instruments masek et al 2012 2006 these surface reflectance scenes are very helpful for the research on lulc since it does not have atmospheric scattering or absorption and is measured at ground level cloud free landsat 8 oli level 2 images having higher image quality were used in this study they are generated using the land surface reflectance code lasrc algorithm version 1 4 1 which makes use of the coastal aerosol band to perform aerosol inversion tests auxiliary climate data from modis and a radiative transfer model vermote et al 2016 landsat level 2 surface reflectance image produced by usgs landsat science team are corrected for atmospheric errors such as aerosol scattering and thin clouds and can be used directly for research purpose usgs landsat missions 2020 as the landsat 8 data are available from 2013 till date the images from 2014 to 2018 for each month were downloaded from usgs global visualization viewer https glovis usgs gov glovis 2020 the landsat 8 oli has nine spectral bands including a panchromatic band band 1 to band 7 have a resolution of 30 m while band 8 a panchromatic band has a resolution on 15 m and band 9 a cirrus band has a resolution of 30 m bands 1 7 of the downloaded image were selected for this study those bands were layer stacked using arcgis after which the two scenes of the image for our watershed area were mosaicked and clipped using the watershed boundary 2 3 lulc classification several parametric and non parametric classification methods are available for lulc classification maximum likelihood ml method is one the extensively used parametric methods it is based on bayes theorem and assumes a single normal distribution of the samples per class in the feature space variances and covariances of the signatures classes are used to assign each raster cell a pre defined class ritchie et al 2018 different classes are characterized by the mean vector and the covariance matrix with the assumption that the distribution of a class sample is normal non parametric classification methods like support vector machine svm and random forest rf do not make any assumptions regarding data distribution and they do not require any statistical parameters to identify classes svm is based on concept of maximization and can be used for data with heterogeneous classes and limited numbers of training samples melgani and bruzzone 2004 decision tree dt classification methods on the other hand divide a dataset into smaller subsets through tests defined at each part in the tree friedl and brodley 1997 dts are further broken down into roots nodes and leafs dts are open source software and thus can be helpful in lowering the cost of classification random forest classifier rf develops multiple decision trees in classifying images welch 2019 and each decision tree is generated from different subsets of the training data this method is comparatively accurate and can handle several input variables at a time peng et al 2019 the maximum likelihood ml classification algorithm available in arcgis was applied to classify landsat images to develop lulc data layers for each month in this study because of its robust abilities and its availability in almost every image processing software lu and weng 2007 these data layers were then combined to produce seasonal lulc data layers this method is one of the widely used supervised classification techniques multiple lulc data layers of bsrw for each month from 2014 to 2018 were developed by classifying cloud free landsat images the images were classified to water forested wetlands cultivated barren and urban the year was divided into three seasons january to april as spring may to august as summer and september to december as fall 2 4 development of seasonal lulc data layer the numerical values were given to each class in the monthly lulc data layers the data layers from 2014 to 2018 were then added together according to the months in spring summer and fall using raster calculator tool in arcgis the resulting data layers were then reclassified again as water forest cultivated barren and urban according to resultant pixel value to produce dominant lulc data layers representing each season those seasonal lulc data layers were used in swat to analyze differences in runoff sediment yield and nutrient concentration due to changes in seasonal lulc data layers 2 5 accuracy assessment the accuracy of the classification describes the agreement of classified image with reference to ground truth data and is performed generally using confusion or error matrix foody 2002 the error matrix provides a cross tabulation of a mapped classes against the ground truth reference data and helps to characterize accuracy metrices the accuracy of the lulc data layers for each season was assessed by comparing the classified seasonal data layer with landsat images of the respective seasons a set of random points for ground truth data or reference data were created for the accuracy assessment using error matrix some of these points were also validated by visiting the study area about 50 points for each class including water forest cultivated land barren land and urban areas were considered for accuracy assessment 2 5 1 error matrix and the accuracy metrices an error matrix is one of the quantitative methods for characterizing the accuracy of classified images it is a square array denoting the correspondence between a classified data layer and the ground truth data the rows in the matrix indicate the class of classified data layer while the columns indicate the ground truth data or reference data a sample error matrix for five classes is shown in table 1 the diagonal values indicate the accuracy of the classification while non diagonal values indicate the error between the classified data and its corresponding reference data producer s accuracy pa user s accuracy ua overall accuracy oa and kappa coefficient were computed using an error matrix pa or the omission error oe gives the indication of accuracy of each class where pixels of a known class are classified as something other than that class similarly ua or the commission error ce indicates the accuracy of each class where pixels are incorrectly classified as a known class when they should have been classified as something else 2 5 1 1 overall accuracy the overall accuracy oa indicates the accuracy of all the classes included in image classification and informs what proportion of the entire area is classified correctly the diagonal cells of the error matrix contain the number of correctly classified pixels the overall accuracy oa of the classification is obtained by dividing the sum of correctly classified pixels by the total number of reference pixels it is usually expressed as a percent from a similar error matrix generated in this study as shown in table 1 the oa was calculated by summing the pixels in the diagonal and dividing them by total number of pixels in the error matrix as o a c 11 c 22 c 33 c 44 c 55 n where c11 c22 c33 c44 and c55 are the correctly assigned pixels for each class and n is the total number of pixels for all the classes considered in the accuracy assessment 2 5 1 2 kappa coefficient the kappa coefficient is a measure of the difference between actual agreement and the agreement expected by chance it is one of the standard measures used in accuracy assessment and has been recommended by several studies as it resolves the issue of correct allocation of a class by coincident foody 2002 rosenfield and fitzpatrick lins 1986 smits et al 1999 the kappa coefficient is generated using a statistical test and its value can vary from 1 to 1 a value less than 0 indicates that the classification is no better than a classification obtained by chance and a value near 1 indicates that the classification is significantly better than a classification obtained by chance a k a p p a c o e f f i c i e n t 0 80 represents strong agreement and good accuracy while a k a p p a c o e f f i c i e n t 0 40 is considered poor rwanga and ndambuki 2017 from a similar error matrix generated in this study as shown in table 1 the kappa coefficient was computed by k a p p a c o e f f i c i e n t n i 1 k c i i i 1 k c i c i n 2 i 1 k c i c i where cii is the correctly assigned pixel for ith class ci marginal total of row for class i c i is the marginal total of column for class i k is the total number of classes and n is the total number of pixels considered in accuracy assessment 2 6 swat swat is an extensively applied watershed scale model that can simulate hydrology and water quality and predict the impacts of different land use change and best management practices bmps at a watershed scale neitsch et al 2002 the modelling tool delineates the watershed using digital elevation model dem and divides it into sub basins sub basins are further divided into hydrologic response units hrus a unique combination of land use soil and slope after incorporation of land use and soil data in the model the time series data of precipitation temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed along with management operation are provided to the model which helps in determination of quantities such as surface runoff evapotranspiration infiltration sediment yield groundwater recharge water quality outputs etc at each hru sub basins and reach segments of the watershed neitsch et al 2005 2002 the swat model has been successfully implemented in simulating streamflow sediment yield and the nutrient load from a watershed dakhlalla et al 2016 ni and parajuli 2018 parajuli et al 2013 risal and parajuli 2019 streamflow is the discharge of water in streams or any water body and is one of the main components of runoff generated from the land surface in swat streamflow is estimated using scs curve number method neitsch et al 2005 the sediment eroded by sheet rill gully and streambank erosion are transported through the streams and are estimated in swat using the modified universal soil loss equation musle neitsch et al 2005 similarly nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous are the essential micro nutrients required for crop growth the excess amount of these nutrients transported to the water body severely deteriorates the water quality of streams rivers lakes and shallow groundwater lory 2018 they are estimated in swat considering their supply and demand neitsch et al 2005 in the current study three seasonal lulc data layers were individually applied to the swat with other inputs being same in order to analyze difference in streamflow sediment yield and nutrient concentration as response to the seasonal lulc change 2 6 1 swat input swat input requirements include digital elevation model dem lulc data layer soil fata layer and daily time series of meteorological data such as precipitation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed a 30 m resolution dem of 3d elevation program 3dep series provided by united

2020 2 6 2 swat calibration and validation multisite swat calibration and validation was performed for streamflow sediment yield total nitrogen and total phosphorous at the outlets of sub basin 5 sub basin 10 and sub basin 17 of bsrw situated at the usgs gauges 728 820 marigold 7 288 500 sunflower and 788 650 leland respectively as shown in fig 1 streamflow was calibrated from january 2013 to december 2015 and validated from january 2016 to december 2019 using observed monthly discharge obtained from the three usgs gauges similarly sediment yield total nitrogen and total phosphorous were calibrated from november 2013 to december 2014 and validated from january 2015 to december 2016 at the outlets of sub basin 5 sub basin 10 and sub basin calibration and validation were based on measured daily total suspended solid tss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp these data were obtained every fifteen days from 2013 to 2016 the calibration and validation period for sediment yield total nitrogen and total phosphorous was shorter than that for streamflow because of the limitation of observed data automatic calibration of streamflow sediment yield total nitrogen and total phosphorous was performed using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm within swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup package abbaspour 2013 the r factor and p factor which were computed by sufi 2 were used to predict model uncertainty t statistics and p value were used to perform sensitivity analysis the model performance during calibration and validation was analyzed using the coefficient of determination r2 draper and smith 1966 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 these two statistics are widely used and reliable measures for comparing observed and simulated data the value of nse ranges from to 1 and r2 ranges from 0 to 1 values of 1 for both statistics are considered perfect krause et al 2005 nash and sutcliffe 1970 in general if nse is greater than 0 50 model simulation can be considered as satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 the parameters used their range and the calibrated values for streamflow sediment yield total nitrogen and total phosphorous are shown in table 2 3 results 3 1 seasonal lulc data layer the lulc data layer from summer showed that about 60 of the total land was cultivated whereas the percentage of cultivated land during fall and spring were just 20 and 5 respectively the majority of the agricultural lands during spring and fall were barren the percentage of urban forest and water for all three

p value of 0 9 the statistics obtained during the calibration and validation of sediment yield were satisfactory with an r2 ranging from 0 59 to 0 75 and an nse ranging from 0 30 to 0 48 the

are presented in table 7 and the graph showing time series of observed and simulated total phosphorous load during its calibration and validation at sub basin 5 is presented in fig 6 3 4 effect of seasonal lulc data layers 3 4 1 streamflow the average streamflow was slightly higher during summer for all the four sub watersheds than that during spring and fall the average streamflow at the watershed outlet was observed to be 185 75 m3 sec in summer while that for spring and fall were 164 82 m3 sec and 181 12 m3 sec respectively average streamflow at the outlet of sub watersheds 5 10 17 and 30 of bsrw for spring summer and fall seasons are shown in fig 7 the average precipitation in the bsrw was highest in spring 636 mm while rainfall during summer and fall were 439 mm and 455 mm respectively the average monthly precipitation was highest during march and april 182 mm and 176 mm respectively and lowest during september and august 84 mm and 93 mm respectively 3 4 2 sediment yield the average sediment concentration was higher in summer for all the sub watersheds in comparison to that in spring and fall despite the reduced average rainfall during summer the average sediment concentration at the watershed outlet was observed to be 10 92 mg l in summer while that for spring and fall were 3 10 mg l and 3 27 mg l respectively average sediment concentration at the outlet of sub basin 5 10 17 and 30 for spring summer and fall are shown in fig 8 although average precipitation was lower during the summer than spring or fall average sediment concentration was higher during the summer this is due to tillage during late spring and early summer before planting in addition increased flow from irrigation is responsible for higher soil erosion and sediment yield in the bsrw although conservation tillage practices such as no till strip till and mulch till are encouraged to reduce soil erosion more than 75 farmers in mississippi delta still use conventional tillage prior to planting corn and soybean to create uniform seedbed and eliminate competition from weeds snipes et al 2005 tillage induces soil erosion and is one of the responsible factors for the increase in sediment yield from agricultural watersheds zhao et al 2018 this watershed scale study was conducted to assess the impact of tillage practices on stream flow crop and sediment yields at the bsrw mississippi results show that conventional tillage produced higher sediment yield than reduced tillage parajuli et al 2016 3 4 3 total nitrogen the average total nitrogen concentration during fall was higher compared to the spring and summer for all four sub watersheds the average total nitrogen concentration at the watershed outlet was 136 mg in the fall while that for spring and summer were 54 mg and 92 mg respectively average total nitrogen concentration at the outlets of sub basins 5 10 17 and 30 for spring summer and fall are shown in fig 9 3 4 4 total phosphorous the average amount of total phosphorous concentration was higher in spring compared to summer and fall the average total phosphorous yield at the watershed outlet was 325 mg in spring while that for summer and fall were 245 mg and 285 mg respectively average total phosphorous concentrations at the outlet of sub basins 5 10 17 and 30 for spring summer and fall are shown in fig 10 4 discussion and conclusions this study investigated the variation in surface runoff sediment and nutrient yield due to seasonal changes in land use and land cover for an agricultural watershed this was accomplished by using multiple lulc data layers for three different seasons in the swat model these kinds of seasonal variations cannot be observed using a single lulc data layer such as the cropland data layer cdl or the national land cover dataset nlcd as they use the lulc data layer created mostly from the images taken in summer the seasonal lulc data layers for spring summer and fall were obtained by combining monthly lulc data layers whose overall accuracy ranged between 87 and 92 and the kappa coefficient ranged between 0 84 to 0 90 these statistics suggest that the classified data layers generated represented respective seasons well three seasonal lulc data layers were used in swat and three separate models were developed the swat model was calibrated and validated for streamflow sediment yield total nitrogen and total phosphorous the statistical values of r2 and nse obtained during the calibration and validation of streamflow was in accordance to the results of previous modelling studies conducted in the bsrw dakhlalla et al 2016 ni and parajuli 2018 parajuli et al 2016 risal and parajuli 2019 calibration and validation statistics were not much affected by the change in seasonal lulc data layer and were reasonable according to the standard set in a comprehensive review article based on more than 250 worldwide swat application studies gassman et al 2007 similarly the statistics during simulation of sediment yield were also reasonable as sediment loading is driven by surface runoff and streamflow qi et al 2020 the calibration and validation of sediment concentration at the three usgs gauging stations within bsrw were also found to be consistent with the previous swat calibration and validation results dakhlalla et al 2016 ni and parajuli 2018 risal and parajuli 2019 likewise the calibration and validation of tn and tp were found satisfactory except for few exceptions caused by limitation of observed data moriasi et al 2007 the observed data at certain periods were abnormally high and were responsible for lower value of statistics the tn and tp simulations were consistent with previous calibration and validation results for bsrw risal and parajuli 2019 even though it is desirable to calibrate the major constituents of nitrogen and phosphorous loading such as organic nitrogen phosphorous and mineral nitrogen phosphorous rather than tn and tp the individual constituents could not be calibrated due to the unavailability of monitoring data for each constituent arnold et al 2012 the average streamflow at the watershed outlet during summer 185 m3 sec was highest than the average streamflow during spring 164 m3 sec and fall 181 m3 sec even though the average rainfall received during summer 439 mm was lower than the average rainfall received during spring 636 mm and fall 455 mm this is due to the additional irrigation supplied to the fields through groundwater pumping due to the seasonal distribution of rainfall in bsrw region supplemental irrigation is required to maximize crop yield the crops in bsrw were planted in late april harvested in early september and irrigated periodically during july to early august the application of irrigation in the field was simulated using the auto irrigation function of swat similarly a study conducted in 18 indian sub continental river basins showed that irrigation is responsible for increases in surface runoff and streamflow in an agricultural watershed shah et al 2019 the observed flow data also suggests greater flows in summer compared to fall or spring apart from increased crop productivity through required water supply during the dry period of the year irrigation may also lead to increase in surface runoff and sediment transport if the method of irrigation is not appropriate peddi and kumar 2019 raeisi vanani et al 2017 like streamflow average sediment concentration at the watershed outlet was highest during summer 10 92 mg l than during spring 3 10 mg l and fall 3 27 mg l this is due to the tillage operation conducted during late spring and early summer before planting in addition increased flow from irrigation is responsible for higher soil erosion and sediment yield in the bsrw although conservation tillage practices such as no till strip till and mulch till are encouraged to reduce soil erosion more that 75 of farmers in the mississippi delta still use conventional tillage prior to planting corn and soybean to create uniform a seedbed and eliminate competition from weeds snipes et al 2005 tillage induces soil erosion and is one of the responsible factors for the increase in sediment yield from an agricultural watershed zhao et al 2018 a previous watershed scale study conducted to assess the impact of tillage practices on stream flow crop and sediment yields at the bsrw mississippi showed that conventional tillage produced higher sediment yield than reduced tillage parajuli et al 2016 on the other hand average total nitrogen yield was lowest during spring 54 mg and highest during fall 136 mg due to the inability of plants to uptake all of the nitrogen fertilizer and washing off of unused nitrogen after runoff events nitrogen is added to the soil by different means such as fertilizer application manure and plant residue application rainfall or fixation by symbiotic and non symbiotic bacteria nitrogen is removed from the soil through plant uptake leaching denitrification volatilization and erosion neitsch et al 2005 mineral nitrogen applied to corn and cotton during the last week of april and the crop residues left in the field after harvest in early september are responsible for high level of total nitrogen during the fall as only a small portion of applied fertilizer is up taken by crops moreno et al 2018 moreover crop residue left on the field in the fall after harvest also contributes total nitrogen washoff during runoff caused by rainfall likewise the average total phosphorous at the watershed outlet was highest in spring 325 mg and lowest in summer 245 mg due to the soluble nature of phosphorous which becomes readily available for transport in surface runoff and the ability of crops like soybean to accumulate phosphorous in the soil phosphorous is applied to soil through fertilizer manure and residue and removed by soil through plant uptake and erosion the average amount of precipitation during the spring was higher than that in summer and fall the total phosphorous concentration was also highest in spring phosphorous is highly soluble in water and is readily available for transport with surface runoff neitsch et al 2005 unlike nitrogen which is usually considered mobile phosphorous is capable of easily combining with other ions to form insoluble compounds and precipitate out of soil and wash off with rainwater the phosphorous present in the soil was mostly discharged by surface runoff during heavy rainfall events in the spring neitsch et al 2005 sharpley and syers 1979 as the major crop grown in the bsrw is soybeans which is capable of accumulating soil phosphorous reddy et al 1999 the total phosphorous concentration was lowest throughout summer during which the fields were planted with soybean this study is very valuable to the scientific community as it explains the variability of hydrologic and water quality

10487,the large diversity of irrigated agricultural areas hinders the development of social consensus and complicates decision making about the allocation of investments for irrigation modernization a classification of irrigated areas permits the identification and mapping of different categories and reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each category regarding specific criteria this paper proposes a binomial genus and species classification methodology of irrigated areas which was designed based on a participatory approach four internal properties determine the genus type of water source type of water energy on farm irrigation method and water availability four external properties classify the variability within each genus into species land tenure crop type existence of an environmental protection figure and socio economic level the words used for the genus and specific name arise from the concatenation of syllables representing the state or level of each property the method was applied to the irrigated area of the ebro river basin in the aragón region of spain erb aragón a total of 435 851 ha were classified a large part of the irrigated land uses surface water 94 does not have water availability problems 80 is not affected by environmental protection figures 97 is devoted to field crops 86 and manifests a low 45 or moderate 41 socio economic level a total of 24 genera and 126 species were identified the two most representative genera are surgraflove 31 and surpumpreve 27 and the two main species are surgraflove discenolo 19 and surpumpreve concenomo 19 these species received the local names of ribera del ebro and alto aragonés to facilitate policy discussions the application of the method to the erb aragón provides a privileged insight that can support policy analyses and guide institutional intervention the proposed methodology can be adapted to other areas of the world by adjusting criteria and categories to local conditions keywords

as the systematic arrangement in groups or categories according to established criteria merriam webster 2020 classification can provide quick understanding of the diversity and of the properties present in the complete set when applied to irrigated areas classification can help to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each group of irrigated plots in the context of their assessment organization rehabilitation or modernization a number of authors have attempted to classify irrigated areas for different purposes focusing on technical aspects khatibi 2003 proposed a classification of irrigation supply systems based on modeling approaches and management factors these modelling approaches are mathematically expressed as shallow water kinematic characteristic hydrodynamic flow conditions inertial governed flow upstream downstream control and composite commands such a classification provides useful information for the management of irrigation infrastructure but does not provide insight on aspects related to the territory such as land organization agronomy social and economic issues using multiple satellite sensors an earth mapping platform and ground truth data thenkabail et al 2009 proposed a comprehensive methodology to classify irrigated areas in 28 classes classes 1 10 used surface water classes 11 15 used groundwater and classes 16 28 conjunctively used both water sources the final map labelled classes based on water source crop intensity single double or continuous crop and crop type based on the spectral signature results were obtained with low resolution information and proved useful to gain insight on very large irrigated areas such as countries or major river basins however this approach lacks the detail required to address the characteristics of the basic units of agricultural water management gómez limón et al 2013 stated that in order to provide useful information to policy makers categories need to be based on a full array of variables covering the different dimensions of irrigated agriculture they defined aggregated area units aau the basic decision making unit regarding agricultural water management for public policy in their approach each aau was characterized by 32 variables including structural managerial and cropping aspects structural variables included water source irrigation technology and farm and plot dimensions managerial variables included water use and water pricing finally cropping variables included crop distribution and acreage the authors performed a principal component analysis on the 32 variables of a set of aaus a cluster analysis was finally used to obtain homogeneous groups of aaus altamirano aguilar et al 2017 proposed a classification of irrigation districts in mexico these authors used principal components analysis to cluster the districts based on their climatic characteristics finally clusters were evaluated based on performance indicators related to management water productivity economical productivity and environmental issues previous efforts reported in the literature to classify irrigated areas are very well suited to specific purposes and adapt to the available information and the goal of the classification the research reported in this paper aims at developing an easy to implement methodology that can be applied at regional scale to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different geographical units of agricultural water management our goal was to determine through consensus of stakeholders a set of variables that qualify an irrigated area and that have qualitative levels or states the need to classify irrigation systems emerged at the meetings of the ebro river water partnership erwp a cooperation group of the rural development programme of the government of aragón spain this initiative is part of the european innovation partnership on sustainable and productive agriculture eip agri erwp set out to develop an integrative socially and technology rich vision of water use in the ebro valley the initiative focuses on the geographic domain of the region of aragón located in the central ebro valley and on the main regional water use irrigated agriculture erwp is a multi stakeholder platform composed among others by farmers associations water users associations wuas agricultural and irrigation specialists policy makers and researchers a key step in the development of the erwp vision is to set up an inventory of irrigated land the inventory requires a classification method that can organize the irrigated farmland into categories that can be easily assessed and compared to other local or distant portions of farmland in terms of their natural resources technology productive orientation or socioeconomic traits the required classification method included aspects that could not be found in the literature a two step method was devised with simple qualitative properties associated to the first step defining the intrinsic properties of a piece of irrigated farmland and more analytical properties associated to the second step focusing on external properties associated to farmland discussions at erwp permitted to determine the properties that would be used in each step of the classification and to establish their qualitative levels based on observations existing cartography or numerical analyses of geo referenced data the classification needed to use key hydrological structural socio economic and environmental features of the irrigated areas since erwp set out to facilitate the identification of strategic needs and opportunities of the territory while the goal was to address the needs of a target region steps were taken from the beginning to ensure that the proposed classification also represented progress towards a general classification methodology of irrigated farmland the two step process facilitates rapid progress in the first step and requires detailed analyses in the second a general classification can provide a standard nomenclature of irrigated areas facilitating the sharing of knowledge and experiences between the different irrigated regions of the world 2 material and methods 2 1 a classification method for irrigated areas the first step was to define the geographic units that constitute the subject of the classification irrigation cartographic units icu were used for this purpose and were defined as a polygon containing those irrigated plots with uniformity in terms of administrative hydrological and farming parameters we decided to use a binomial genus and species classification this is the system used in biology to classify living things and generally applied to other purposes for instance the soil survey staff 1999 used the categories used in biology to classify soils from the order to the family and the series the current version of the soil taxonomy system is very rich in categorization but it does not reach the genus level the purpose of this research is much simpler in scope and only uses genus and species to implement a two step process in our classification of irrigated areas the generic name identifies the genus to which an icu belongs four internal properties were used in this work to determine the genus 1 water source 2 energy for pumping irrigation water 3 on farm irrigation method 4 irrigation water scarcity these variables are related to the physical aspects of the icu related to water strong structural modifications of the icu are required to modify them such as building new water abstraction pumping and storage facilities or irrigation rehabilitation modernization activities a genus can contain plenty of variability in additional variables the specific name defines a type of individual a species within the genus in this work the features separating the variability present in each genus thus taking the classification to the species level are four external properties 1 structure of the irrigation plots 2 crop productive orientation 3 environmental protection figure 4 socio economic level these variables represent key features of the farming activities performed on the icu the structure of the land for irrigated agricultural production the type of crops being cultivated the existence of environmental laws affecting irrigation and a compound assessment of the socioeconomic status of the local communities for each of the eight properties used to establish the binomial classification two or three qualitative levels or states were defined the choice for two or three was dictated by the possibility of clearly differentiating them table 1 in binomial classification systems genus and species names are often derived from latin or greek words however for irrigated areas names were created by concatenation of selected syllables representing the levels of each of the properties these syllables are marked in bold type in table 1 regarding the properties defining the genus the source of the water contributes with the first syllable this property can present three states irrigation with surface water sur irrigation with groundwater gro and conjunctive water use jun the source of energy moving water to the farms was divided in three states gravity gra when the water is gravity feed and no external energy is applied pumping pum when water is pressurized in closed piping systems to lift water from the source and a combination of both var for variable three states of on farm irrigation methods have been considered for the third genus property flood irrigation flo representing traditional flood irrigation methods pressurized irrigation pre representing methods such as sprinkler microsprinkler and drip and a combination of the both met for methods in this work we use the term flood to refer to surface irrigation methods we adopted this name to avoid confusion with surface water combination states jun var and met are only used if each of the first two states of the property represents more than 30 of the icu area the last property defining the genus is the water scarcity or the water availability level two stages were envisaged for this property eventual ve and permanent pe permanent water scarcity is associated with continuous or almost continuous problems of water availability for irrigation the first external property that defines the species refers to the size of the irrigated plots this property presents two states disaggregated dis or concentrated con an icu is classified as disaggregated when more than 60 of its area is occupied by plots smaller than 5 ha the 5 ha plot size threshold was proposed in the literature as the minimum size to be accepted in publicly subsidized irrigation modernization projects in the ebro valley of spain esquiroz and puig 2001 application of this methodology to other areas of the world would require an adjustment of this criterion with additional and or different categories two categories were defined for the crop productive orientation of an icu extensive crops ce or intensive crops ci the category extensive crops corresponds to field crops such as cereals and fodders the category intensive crops corresponds to horticultural crops fruit orchards olives and vineyards an icu has an extensive productive orientation when more than 50 of its area corresponds to field crops the affection of an environmental protection figure on the icu is the third internal property in europe the natura 2000 network eea 2012 is a special environmental protection strategy commonly affecting irrigated areas natura 2000 delineates areas being protected by the habitats directive and the birds directive the protection of nature 2000 does not exclude human economic activity but any activity needs to integrate with nature conservation an icu classifies as environmentally protected na when more than 10 of its irrigated area is located within one of these protected areas it also classifies as na if the complete protected area is included within the icu otherwise the icu is classified as not affected by nature preservation figures no the fourth and last property describing the species is the socio economic level we used three states for this property high hi moderate mo and low lo in this classification methodology socio economic integrates and expands the restrictive concept of per capita income taking into account other elements or variables that contribute to the quality of life of farmers in the icu the socio economic level has been adapted to the particular conditions of the irrigated areas by using three types of indicators economic characteristics of the farming population and land and characteristics of the total population of irrigated areas the selected economic indicator was defined as the average net farm income expressed in ha 1 estimated by subtracting production expenses from the gross income this indicator reflects differences between icus derived from the choice of crops the interaction between natural resources and production technology the economic objectives and the economic possibilities the variables involved in the characterization of the farming population and land include the age of farmers the percentage of unemployed farmers derived from social security databases the educational level of farmers farm size and value of farmland the variables used to characterize the demography of an icu include age time evolution of population migration rate natural growth rate percentage of young people less than 15 years old and population density the variables used to characterize socio economy are numerically diverse and use different units the first step to reconcile them was to normalize them the normalization process results in non dimensional variables and restricts their values to the 0 1 range eq 1 therefore all normalized variables have the same weight giving exactly the same importance to each of them in the case of variables where a low value is good e g age the computation applied an inverse rule of three so that a value of 1 was assigned to the lowest value of the series 1 x n e w x i x m i n x m a x x m i n 2 2 the study area the ebro river basin in aragón the ebro river basin erb is located in the north west of spain has a total area of 85 362 km2 and is drained by the 910 km long ebro river fig 1 ebro is the largest watershed in spain representing 17 3 of the spanish mainland and is one of the key european mediterranean basins around 5 3 of the active population is devoted to agriculture slightly above the spanish average che 2015 the basin has an important agricultural and livestock activity with around 30 of the national meat production and about 30 of the national production of sweet fruits fodder and vineyards the irrigated area in the ebro basin is 900 623 ha i e 9 of its total area as previously discussed the application of the proposed methodology is restricted to the erb in aragón erb aragón roughly occupying 50 of the total watershed territory the spanish geographic information system of agricultural plots for use in the application of the common agricultural policy of the european union sig pac attributes 477 811 ha of irrigated land according to the cadaster cartography of the ministry of the treasure the area is 488 943 ha finally the 2004 geodatabase of the ebro river basin authority erba describes 518 628 ha of irrigated land part of the differences in irrigated area between information sources seem associated to the difficulty in keeping the database updated sig pac is a recent database 2015 and is updated periodically while the cadaster and the erba seem to be only partially updated changes in declared irrigated plots and infrequently the geographical delimitation of the icus requires overlapping the cartography of irrigated land with the cartography of administrative concessions of the erba the erba has a census of water rights with a thousand records related to irrigation data include the location municipality of the administrative bureau of the concessionaire attending to its organization some icus represent water user associations while others represent individual irrigation developments individual water users wuis the latter correspond to holdings in which a wua has not been created but which are legally registered as farms belonging to individual water users the erba provides cartography of the delimitation of wuas wuis and a census of water use rights the overlap of these two databases shows important differences due to the lack of effective updating differences were also found when combining erba information with the sig pac geodatabase the final delimitation of icus required and intensive labor of validation with different data sources and ground truth data 2 3 classifying the genus different procedures were used to obtain the data required to determine the values of the four properties defining the genus the water source was obtained from the erba database where the origin of water is classified as surface groundwater and mixed areas water source for icus not available at the erba database was obtained using other public data sources cartography of soil geomorphology the source of energy to pump the water was also available at the erba geodatabase this information was completed using the expertise of erwp members for instance all recent irrigation developments at the central ebro basin are water supplied from the mequinenza reservoir using pump stations the on farm irrigation system was obtained from the anonymized database of applications to the cap subsidies every year farmers submit an application detailing for each plot if it is irrigated or not the on farm irrigation method flood sprinkler drip and others and the type of crop among other data these records were not complete for each plot for instance the on farm irrigation method was not declared in 14 of the plots missing information was extrapolated from existing data cap applications present the information in tables without geographical representation plots were georeferenced using a common field in the application and in the sig pac geographic information system the plot identification code further it was necessary to identify the icu where the plot is included this was done by overlapping the georeferenced plots with the icus geodatabase leading to the determination of the on farm irrigation methods present in each icu differences in water availability between the left and right banks of the river basin in aragón are important the main tributaries in the left bank of the river ebro flow from the central pyrenees and discharge large amounts of water to ebro particularly in spring the tributaries in the right bank flow from the iberian system and are characterized by variable flow with frequent shortages particularly during the summer season this information was combined with the experience of erwp members to establish the water availability problems of each icu 2 4 classifying the species plot size was determined from the sig pac 2015 map of the irrigated plots the percentage of icu area corresponding to plots smaller than 5 ha was defined for each icu the crop productive orientation was obtained in the same way as the on farm irrigation method by combining the sig pac map with the cap application database which includes the crop type in the last step results were overlaid with the icu map the cartography of the areas belonging to the natura 2000 network was used to determine the icus with environmental protection figures this information was downloaded from the government of aragon webpage and overlaid with the icu map the socio economic level of the icu was described through net income the characteristics of the farming population and farm land and the characteristics of the general population of the irrigated areas the net income ni was calculated discounting the production expenses from the gross crop income gi the acreage the crop and its average yield and market price are required for gross income determination the acreage and the crop were obtained from the sig pac 2015 geodatabase crop yields were obtained from the public databases of the government of aragon and the spanish ministry of agriculture fisheries and food esyrce 2015 in these databases crop yields depend on the agroclimatic zones and on the water regime dryland or irrigated land however yield estimates were not provided for different on farm irrigation methods numerous research and technical works have highlighted the increase in field crop yield following modernization from flood to sprinkler irrigation playán and mateo 2006 faci et al 2000 and from flood to drip irrigation in fruit orchards olives and vineyards assaf et al 1984 rzekanowski and rolbiecki 2000 liu et al 2019 modernization has also intensified farming by promoting double cropping of field crops in the same season stambouli et al 2014 jiménez aguirre and isidoro 2018 the increase and stabilization in crop yield have been attributed to the reduction of abiotic stresses we resorted to scientific literature to introduce crop yield differences between on farm irrigation methods crop prices were obtained from local markets of agricultural products lonja del ebro 2019 the average of all plots integrating an icu provided the value of gi although income data change slightly from year to year crop area market price and average yield the averaging and normalization processes provide stability to the socio economic classification of the icus production expenses included direct costs and the payback of the investment on irrigation modernization direct costs were obtained from a public local database ecrea 2015 which provides cost estimates for different crops and cropping conditions such as dryland and irrigated since the available data did not reflect differences in costs between the different irrigation methods specific costs were added for pressurized methods with pumping requirements estimates of seasonal electricity costs were incorporated for flood irrigation estimates of the labor costs of the irrigation activity were included a distinction was made between the electricity costs of pressurizing surface water and groundwater four levels were established depending on the elevation to be overcome from 0 25 kw h m 3 for the surface water stambouli et al 2014 to 1 15 kw h m 3 for the deeper watertable narvarte 2018 the unit electricity cost was assumed constant at 0 09 kwh 1 electricity cost was applied to the total area of the icus classified as pumping pum and to the pumping area of icus classified as variety of energy sources var the seasonal volume of irrigation water applied to each plot was estimated from crop water requirements and the irrigation system efficiency crop water requirements were obtained from the public local database of the irrigation advisory service in aragón siar 2019 which provides data from different agrometeorological stations located throughout the study area irrigation efficiency estimates for the different on farm irrigation methods were obtained from the literature 60 for flood irrigation playán et al 2000 80 for sprinkler irrigation hanson et al 1996 and 90 for drip irrigation burt 2004 the labor cost of irrigation activity was only applied to flood irrigation owing to the usual automation of pressurized irrigation methods costs differed with plot size for disaggregate land tenure a value of 4 h ha 1 and irrigation event was used for concentrated land tenure a value of 3 h ha 1 and irrigation event was applied further an approximate water application of 1000 m3 ha 1 per flood irrigation event and a labor cost of 6 h 1 were used to estimate seasonal costs the last step was to estimate the annual payback of irrigation modernization investments modernization plans were implemented in the target area at the national and regional levels mapa 2002 and mapa 2010 the total investment cost and the part supported by the farmers was obtained for each wua zapata and lorenzo 2020 the following economic conditions were used for the loans subscribed by the wuas fixed annual payment 25 year payback period and a fixed annual interest rate of 5 25 total costs direct costs irrigation costs and irrigation modernization payback were deducted from gi to estimate seasonal ni ha 1 for each icu the limits differencing the socio economic level were established based on the local minimum and maximum values the farming characteristics and population specific variables were available from public sources at the municipal level farming land and farming population characteristics were obtained from the department of agriculture livestock and environment of the government of aragón dagma ga 2019 general population variables were obtained from the synthetic index of territorial development of aragón isdt boa 2019 providing normalized values of the selected variable per municipality since an icu can belong to one or several municipalities the indicators values were determined as a weighted average using the influence area of each municipality 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation cartographic units in the erb aragón the processing of the different data sources sig pac cadaster and erba in different formats resulted in the delimitation of 729 icus 641 wuas and 88 wuis as seen in fig 1 the area classified in icus amounts to 435 851 ha 95 414 841 ha of which is organized in wuas while the remaining 5 21 010 ha belongs to wuis according to the analyses 8 of the total irrigated area is not delimited in icus the small size and dispersion of the plots or the lack of a legal registration at the erba census made it impossible to assign an administrative figure to these plots and to group them in icus one of the characteristics of the erb aragón is that a large part of the wuas belong to a higher organization figure called general water users association gwua this is the case of riegos del alto aragón raa bardenas system bs aragón and cataluña canal cayc aragón imperial canal tauste canal and lodosa canal fig 2 gwuas derive from large irrigation projects usually developed by the spanish government and representing 67 of the target irrigated area the first three gwuas raa bardenas and cayc were built in the first half of the 20th century have strong capacities in collective infrastructure management and enforce water conservation practices the wua and gwua organizations also predispose to cooperation and mutual assistance boosting economic growth and development gómez limón et al 2014 miao et al 2018 the aragón imperial canal tauste canal and lodosa canal are ancient gwuas established before the 20th century are located in the axis of the ebro river and are not as active as the first three gwuas provide legal support to farmers and establish direct communication with the erba small irrigation projects 33 of the irrigated area generally correspond to wuas irrigated by ancient riparian canals located on the alluvial terraces of the ebro river and its tributaries these are characterized by relatively low water and infrastructure management standards the average size of the wuas is 602 ha showing an important variability the coefficient of variation was 47 the number of small wuas less than 500 ha is very high 471 although they only represent 14 of the total icu area the 76 wuis below 500 ha are also the most numerous but they only represent 2 of the total icu area as the size of the icus increases their number decreases the 61 wuas with an area between 1500 and 5000 ha represent 38 of the total area the 14 icus with an area exceeding 5000 ha are only of the wua type and represent 23 of the total area 3 2 analysis of genus in the erb aragón table 2 presents the number and area of icus wuas and wuis classified on the levels defining the four fixed properties of the genus for the erb aragón irrigated area due to the characteristics of the erb aragón it was necessary to consider the three levels for the properties energy source and on farm irrigation method table 1 most of the irrigated land in the erb aragón uses surface water 94 while groundwater use 6 is limited to very specific areas of the right bank of the river fig 3 a about half of the irrigated area uses gravity fed water 52 or 228 484 ha about one third uses pumped water 36 or 155 127 ha and the remaining 12 12 239 ha uses a mixture of gravity fed and pumping water table 2 and fig 3b regarding the on farm irrigation method 47 of the area 205 818 ha uses flood irrigation 46 198 240 ha uses a pressurized method and 7 31 793 ha uses a variety of methods table 2 and fig 3c in general flood irrigation uses gravity fed water while pressurized irrigation methods use pumped water as a relevant exception to this rule some icus using pressurized irrigation methods do not require pumping since pressure due to elevation difference is sufficient to operate the irrigation systems this represents approximately 9 of the area at the end of the 20th century 70 of the irrigated land of the erb aragón was flood irrigated after the intense modernization process of the first two decades of the 21st century this area was reduced to 47 in any case flood irrigation is more used in erb aragón than in spain 24 esyrce 2018 the flood irrigated area is commonly located on the alluvial terraces of the ebro river and its tributaries small irrigation projects and ancient gwuas fig 2 flood irrigation can also be found in areas located far from the riverbanks such as in some wuas of the gwua of raa and bs the degree of water availability problems for irrigation is eventual in 80 of the area 350 402 ha while the remaining 20 85 448 ha has permanent water availability problems fig 3d the icus located on the left bank of the basin and in the ebro river alluvial terraces were assigned eventual irrigation water availability problems since water shortages are not frequent in these areas the icus located on the right bank were assigned permanent water scarcity since they frequently present problems of water availability this simplification does not take into consideration structural aspects such as low storage capacity conveyance problems or low on farm application efficiency a more detailed analysis would be required to characterize how the structural traits of each icu interact with local irrigation water availability fig 4 presents the icus of the erb aragón classified at the genus level only the eight genera with irrigated area representation larger than 2 are individually presented on the map the rest of genera up to a total of 24 in the erb aragon were grouped and presented as other genera in the map legend the main traits of the first two genera in the figure legend are as follows the main genus surgraflove 136 569 ha 148 icus or 31 3 of the irrigated area is characterized by using surface water pressurized by gravity to perform flood irrigation in areas with eventual water availability problems this genus is located on the alluvial terraces of the ebro river and some tributaries a large part of the ancient gwuas aragón imperial canal tauste canal and lodosa canal and also in some wuas of the gwua of raa 26 076 ha and bs 50 374 ha the second genus by area is surpumpreve 118 891 ha 104 icus 27 3 of the irrigated area this genus uses surface water requires pumping to use pressurized on farm irrigation methods and only has eventual water availability problems this genus is located in raa and cayc gwuas and in irrigation developments at the central ebro basin surpumpreve genus has been the main beneficiary of the modernization projects of the 21st century 3 3 analysis of species in the erb aragón land structure is the first property defining the specificity of a genus in the erb aragón 59 4 of the land is disaggregated while 40 6 is concentrated table 3 the average area of a concentrated icu 1 295 ha is more than three times that of a disaggregated icu the icus classified as concentrated are located in the raa and bs wuas and to a lesser extent in cayc fig 5 a disaggregated icus are located on the riverbanks of the ebro and some of its tributaries gállego jalón and aragón and correspond to the oldest local irrigation systems fig 5a field crops ce are grown in 86 of the total irrigated area the remaining 14 is occupied with intensive crops horticulture orchards olives and vineyards table 3 the icus with intensive crops are on average smaller than the icus with extensive crops 309 ha vs 710 ha intensive crops are mainly located in cayc in the jalón river valley and in the recent irrigation developments at the central ebro basin around the mequinenza reservoir fig 5b the total irrigated area with environmental protection is 11 131 ha 2 6 however given the small percentage needed to have an icu classified as protected 140 icus fall in this category fig 5c presents the spatial distribution of icus with na and without no environmental protection protected icus are generally small average area of 216 ha and are either located on the boundaries of protected areas such as the axes of the ebro cinca and alcanadre rivers or contain protected lagoons sariñena or playa lakes gallocanta the first step to characterize the socio economic level was to compute the gross income the values of gi were arranged in three levels lower than 1500 ha 1 between 1500 and 2500 ha 1 and larger than 2500 ha 1 fig 5c the icus with lower gi are all flood irrigated and grow extensive crops the icus with intermediate gi are in general wuas with pressurized irrigation methods and with extensive crop orientation and some flood irrigated icus located on the banks of the ebro and gállego rivers with extensive crop orientation and a considerable area devoted to horticultural crops fig 5c the icus with the largest gross income correspond to areas with intensive crop and some wuas with extensive orientation and on farm pressurized methods that have a considerable area cropped with intensive crops intensive crops imply certain direct costs particularly labor but also provide potentially large incomes among the icus with extensive crop productive orientation those using pressurized irrigation methods had larger gross income than those irrigated by flooding irrigation technology resulted in reduced abiotic stresses fig 6 b presents the results of the net margin per icu organized in three levels low lower than 700 ha 1 moderate between 700 and 1500 ha 1 and high larger than 1500 ha 1 in general flood irrigation is associated with the lowest net margin while pressurized irrigation for extensive crops shows moderate net margin while pressurized irrigation for intensive crops particularly fruit orchards shows the highest net margin icus with high net margin represent 15 of the erb aragón irrigated area 65 188 ha 108 ucrs moderate net margin 40 173 219 ha 214 icus and low income icus account for 45 of the total irrigated area 197 063 ha 407 ucrs the economic indicator only considers the income of the agricultural irrigation production omitting other economic activities taking place in or around irrigated areas such as livestock farming or agribusiness modern irrigated areas typically have a dependable water supply and adequate rural roads this is fostering the installation of intensive livestock farms and agro industrial plants these effects have not been evaluated in this research but their consideration will reinforce the traits observed in the socio economic classification the second indicator that integrates the definition of the socio economic property describes characteristics of the farming land and the farming population municipalities close to large urban areas i e zaragoza huesca barbastro and fraga have very high farmland prices compared with neighborhood municipalities this is due to land speculation for activities other than farming this variable should therefore be cautiously analyzed to avoid disturbances in the classification only nine icus have a percentage of young farmers less than 35 years old larger than 20 in the rest of icus young farmers have a lower representation highlighting the significant ageing of the local farming population the educational level of the farmers is in general low only 8 having completed professional training or university education icus with the highest share of young farmers least farming unemployment below 5 and highest educational level from 10 to 25 of the farmers are located in raa and cayc systems these areas have the highest irrigation technology levels improving farmers quality of life and facilitating generational replacement the most aged farmers can be found in areas with high farming unemployment above 15 and the lowest educational level less than 5 of the farmers these areas are located in icus located in the riverbanks of the ebro and other tributaries the farming land and population indicator integrates the abovementioned variables and is organized in three levels low moderate and high fig 6b the demographic indicator was available at municipal level and integrates data from the different economic sectors of the municipality isdt 2019 fig 6c presents the distribution of the population indicator arranged in three levels low moderate and high high values of the indicator could be found around large urban areas zaragoza huesca fraga and monzón presenting the largest increments in population positive migration rates youngest population and the highest population density this pattern is associated with the provision of social services health and education and with the presence of industrial sites hospitals universities and other social services are mainly found in urban areas the lowest values of the population indicator are located in some wuas of raa and the wuas of the right side of the ebro river basin consideration of the maps of the three indicators led the erwp to use an equation giving different weights to the three variables stakeholders gave the largest weigh to the economic indicator an intermediate weight to the farming indicator and a low weight to the demographic indicator for example an icu with high economic indicator net income but with very low farming and population indicators resulted in a moderate socio economic level an icu with low economic indicator but very high farming and population indicators resulted in a moderate socio economic level fig 6d presents the spatial distribution of the socio economic indicator three levels for the different icus of the erb aragón the icus with low socio economic level 197 970 ha 412 icus and 359 wuas table 3 mostly correspond to flood irrigated areas located in the alluvial riverbanks of the ebro and other tributaries the high socio economic level 57 661 ha 60 icus and 52 wuas table 3 corresponds to icus with a productive orientation of intensive crops mostly fruit trees the moderate socio economic level 180 219 ha 257 ucrs and 230 wuas corresponds to pressurized irrigated areas with a productive orientation of extensive crops the application of the abovementioned properties to the erb aragón icus resulted in 23 specific names the seven specific names with the highest surface representativeness occupied 87 of the total area concenomo 27 7 discenolo 26 9 concenolo 13 7 discenomo 7 4 concenohi 5 discinohi 4 3 and discinolo 2 6 fig 7 the remaining 16 specific names had individual areas below 2 and together represented 13 of the area see other specific in fig 7 the most extended specific name had concentrated plot structure concenomo while the second in importance had disaggregated plot structure discenolo together both specific names represent more than 50 of the total irrigated area in erb aragon the concentrated specific name has a moderate socio economic level while the disaggregated specific name has a low socio economic level both have a productive orientation based on extensive crops ce and are not affected by environmental protection figures no the combination of genera and specific names resulted in 126 different species only eight of them have a representation above 2 in area and jointly represent 63 of the total area fig 8 presents the most important species of the seven important genera of the erb aragón representing 89 of the total irrigated area the main traits of the first two species in the figure legend are as follows the most extended genus surgraflove has two key specific names discenolo 19 and concenolo 9 6 the first species surgraflove discenolo corresponds to the oldest traditional irrigated icus of the ebro and tributaries riverbanks the second species only differs in the plot structure and corresponds to systems developed by governmental initiative national colonization institute in the first half of the 20th century so it was assigned the local name colonización equivalent to surgraflove concenore the second genus surpumpreve has three principal specific names concenomo 18 7 concenolo 2 1 and concenamo 1 3 the first and third species correspond to recently modernized areas located in wuas of raa the first species was assigned the local name alto aragonés equivament to surpumpreve concenomo while the specific cocennamo including an environmental protection figure such as the areas surrounding the sariñena lagoon was assigned the local name sariñena equivament to surpumpreve concenamo the second species in importance within this genus corresponds to pressurized irrigations that abstract water directly from the ebro river and pump to high areas with a predominance of extensive crops a characteristic wua of this type is loma de quinto leading to the local name of this species loma de quinto equivalent to surpumpreve concenolo 3 4 from classification to strategic needs and opportunities key features of the different species of the erb aragón were revealed by the classification process these provide nuanced insight on the irrigated systems that can support policy analyses and guide institutional intervention species ribera del ebro 84 086 ha 19 and tarazona 16 033 ha 3 7 are threatened by farmers ageing and low educational level a decline in wuas organization obsolete infrastructure low income production model fragmentation of property and proximity to large urban areas in the second species the situation is more complex due to permanent water availability problems these species have been the basis of local food security for centuries and have environmental and heritage importance they provide a number of ecosystem services and nature based solutions such as protection against flooding support to biodiversity interface with aquatic ecosystems and spaces of social recreation although these services increase the positive externalities in different rural socio ecological contexts masseroni et al 2017 it is difficult for farmers to take advantage of them when the economic model is not profitable the eventual valuation of the ecosystem services externalities could boost societal interest of maintaining these irrigated areas and guide the allocation of public subsidies for irrigation modernization that are compatible with the positive externalities solutions that have been successful for other species such as colonización based on replacing traditional flooding by pressurized methods may not be adequate for these species masseroni et al 2017 proposed technical solutions such as targeted rehabilitation measures based on the integrated use of decision support services gate automation remote and feedback controls and real time flow optimization although a technical solution is required the major challenge is to integrate the environmental issues and the social dimension farmers and other stakeholders otherwise a solution will not present itself additionally the species affected by permanent water availability problems should have a strong wua organization with very active water management measures the objective is to harmonize water availability with water consumption controls on maximum crop evapotranspiration and water allocation to plots and farmers seem to be required additionally these wuas need to focus on crops that can lead to moderate to high income with low water requirements or to crops in which income is not critically affected by water availability the dominance of extensive crops wheat barley corn and alfalfa of the erb aragón icus is a significant weakness in the current context of decreasing water availability the strong dependence on volatile cereal markets commodities with a track record of low prices result in irrigated areas with low biodiversity and compromised economic balance introducing new crops in icus with extensive crops will improve the sustainability of irrigation this is not an easy solution because the economic technical and social requirements for extensive cropping are completely different from those of intensive crops the on going automation of tedious and time consuming farming tasks such as pruning or planting is providing opportunities for crop restructuring 4 conclusions the methodology proposed in this research to classify irrigated areas uses a binomial structure genus and species the properties defining the genus and species and its levels were supported and validated by a multi stakeholder platform the first challenge of the classification was to define the geographic units icu that constitute the subject of the classification the icu definition was adapted to local conditions data availability and target of the classification data limitations arose when applying the methodology to the irrigated area of the ebro river basin in aragón erb aragón the total classified area 435 851 ha is organized in 729 icus 641 water users associations wuas 95 of the total area and

total of 24 genera and 126 species were identified in the study area eight genera covered 91 4 of the erb aragón irrigated area and eight species covered 63 of the erb aragón among them the two most representative genera are surgraflove 31 3 and surpumpreve 27 3 the two most common species are surgraflove discenolo 19 0 and surpumpreve concenomo 18 7 the method applied to the erb aragón

10487,the large diversity of irrigated agricultural areas hinders the development of social consensus and complicates decision making about the allocation of investments for irrigation modernization a classification of irrigated areas permits the identification and mapping of different categories and reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each category regarding specific criteria this paper proposes a binomial genus and species classification methodology of irrigated areas which was designed based on a participatory approach four internal properties determine the genus type of water source type of water energy on farm irrigation method and water availability four external properties classify the variability within each genus into species land tenure crop type existence of an environmental protection figure and socio economic level the words used for the genus and specific name arise from the concatenation of syllables representing the state or level of each property the method was applied to the irrigated area of the ebro river basin in the aragón region of spain erb aragón a total of 435 851 ha were classified a large part of the irrigated land uses surface water 94 does not have water availability problems 80 is not affected by environmental protection figures 97 is devoted to field crops 86 and manifests a low 45 or moderate 41 socio economic level a total of 24 genera and 126 species were identified the two most representative genera are surgraflove 31 and surpumpreve 27 and the two main species are surgraflove discenolo 19 and surpumpreve concenomo 19 these species received the local names of ribera del ebro and alto aragonés to facilitate policy discussions the application of the method to the erb aragón provides a privileged insight that can

as the systematic arrangement in groups or categories according to established criteria merriam webster 2020 classification can provide quick understanding of the diversity and of the properties present in the complete set when applied to irrigated areas classification can help to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each group of irrigated plots in the context of their assessment organization rehabilitation or modernization a number of authors have attempted to classify irrigated areas for different purposes focusing on technical aspects khatibi 2003 proposed a classification of irrigation supply systems based on modeling approaches and management factors these modelling approaches are mathematically expressed as shallow water kinematic characteristic hydrodynamic flow conditions inertial governed flow upstream downstream control and composite commands such a classification provides useful information for the management of irrigation infrastructure but does not provide insight on aspects related to the territory such as land organization agronomy social and economic issues using multiple satellite sensors an earth mapping platform and ground truth data thenkabail et al 2009 proposed a comprehensive methodology to classify irrigated areas in 28 classes classes 1 10 used surface water classes 11 15 used groundwater and classes 16 28 conjunctively used both water sources the final map labelled classes based on water source crop intensity single double or continuous crop and crop type based on the spectral signature results were obtained with low resolution information and proved useful to gain insight on very large irrigated areas such as countries or major river basins however this approach lacks the detail required to address the characteristics of the basic units of agricultural water management gómez limón et al 2013 stated that in order to provide useful information to policy makers categories need to be based on a full array of variables covering the different dimensions of irrigated agriculture they defined aggregated area units aau the basic decision making unit regarding agricultural water management for public policy in their approach each aau was characterized by 32 variables including structural managerial and cropping aspects structural variables included water source irrigation technology and farm and plot dimensions managerial variables included water use and water pricing finally cropping variables included crop distribution and acreage the authors performed a principal component analysis on the 32 variables of a set of aaus a cluster analysis was finally used to obtain homogeneous groups of aaus altamirano aguilar et al 2017 proposed a classification of irrigation districts in mexico these authors used principal components analysis to cluster the districts based on their climatic characteristics finally clusters were evaluated based on performance indicators related to management water productivity economical productivity and environmental issues previous efforts reported in the literature to classify irrigated areas are very well suited to specific purposes and adapt to the available information and the goal of the classification the research reported in this paper aims at developing an easy to implement methodology that can be applied at regional scale to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different geographical units of agricultural water management our goal was to determine through consensus of stakeholders a set of variables that qualify an irrigated area and that have qualitative levels or states the need to classify irrigation systems emerged at the meetings of the ebro river water partnership erwp a cooperation group of the rural development programme of the government of aragón spain this initiative is part of the european innovation partnership on sustainable and productive agriculture eip agri erwp set out to develop an integrative socially and technology rich vision of water use in the ebro valley the initiative focuses on the geographic domain of the region of aragón located in the central ebro valley and on the main regional water use irrigated agriculture erwp is a multi stakeholder platform composed among others by farmers associations water users associations wuas agricultural and irrigation specialists policy makers and researchers a key step in the development of the erwp vision is to set up an inventory of irrigated land the inventory requires a classification method that can organize the irrigated farmland into categories that can be easily assessed and compared to other local or distant portions of farmland in terms of their natural resources technology productive orientation or socioeconomic traits the required classification method included aspects that could not be found in the literature a two step method was devised with simple qualitative properties associated to the first step defining the intrinsic properties of a piece of irrigated farmland and more analytical properties associated to the second step focusing on external properties associated to farmland discussions at erwp permitted to determine the properties that would be used in each step of the classification and to establish their qualitative levels based on observations existing cartography or numerical analyses of geo referenced data the classification needed to use key hydrological structural socio economic and environmental features of the irrigated areas since erwp set out to facilitate the identification of strategic needs and opportunities of the territory while the goal was to address the needs of a target region steps were taken from the beginning to ensure that the proposed classification also represented progress towards a general classification methodology of irrigated farmland the two step process facilitates rapid progress in the first step and requires detailed analyses in the second a general classification can provide a standard nomenclature of irrigated areas facilitating the sharing of knowledge and experiences between the different irrigated regions of the world 2 material and methods 2 1 a classification method for irrigated areas the first step was to define the geographic units that constitute the subject of the classification irrigation cartographic units icu were used for this purpose and were defined as a polygon containing those irrigated plots with uniformity in terms of administrative hydrological and farming parameters we decided to use a binomial genus and species classification this is the system used in biology to classify living things and generally applied to other purposes for instance the soil survey staff 1999 used the categories used in biology to classify soils from the order to the family and the series the current version of the soil taxonomy system is very rich in categorization but it does not reach the genus level the purpose of this research is much simpler in scope and only uses genus and species to implement a two step process in our classification of irrigated areas the generic name identifies the genus to which an icu belongs four internal properties were used in this work to determine the genus 1 water source 2 energy for pumping irrigation water 3 on farm irrigation method 4 irrigation water scarcity these variables are related to the physical aspects of the icu related to water strong structural modifications of the icu are required to modify them such as building new water abstraction pumping and storage facilities or irrigation rehabilitation modernization activities a genus can contain plenty of variability in additional variables the specific name defines a type of individual a species within the genus in this work the features separating the variability present in each genus thus taking the classification to the species level are four external properties 1 structure of the irrigation plots 2 crop productive orientation 3 environmental protection figure 4 socio economic level these variables represent key features of the farming activities performed on the icu the structure of the land for irrigated agricultural production the type of crops being cultivated the existence of environmental laws affecting irrigation and a compound assessment of the socioeconomic status of the local communities for each of the eight properties used to establish the binomial classification two or three qualitative levels or states were defined the choice for two or three was dictated by the possibility of clearly differentiating them table 1 in binomial classification systems genus and species names are often derived from latin or greek words however for irrigated areas names were created by concatenation of selected syllables representing the levels of each of the properties these syllables are marked in bold type in table 1 regarding the properties defining the genus the source of the water contributes with the first syllable this property can present three states irrigation with surface water sur irrigation with groundwater gro and conjunctive water use jun the source of energy moving water to the farms was divided in three states gravity gra when the water is gravity feed and no external energy is applied pumping pum when water is pressurized in closed piping systems to lift water from the source and a combination of both var for variable three states of on farm irrigation methods have been considered for the third genus property flood irrigation flo representing traditional flood irrigation methods pressurized irrigation pre representing methods such as sprinkler microsprinkler and drip and a combination of the both met for methods in this work we use the term flood to refer to surface irrigation methods we adopted this name to avoid confusion with surface water combination states jun var and met are only used if each of the first two states of the property represents more than 30 of the icu area the last property defining the genus is the water scarcity or the water availability level two stages were envisaged for this property eventual ve and permanent pe permanent water scarcity is associated with continuous or almost continuous problems of water availability for irrigation the first external property that defines the species refers to the size of the irrigated plots this property presents two states disaggregated dis or concentrated con an icu is classified as disaggregated when more than 60 of its area is occupied by plots smaller than 5 ha the 5 ha plot size threshold was proposed in the literature as the minimum size to be accepted in publicly subsidized irrigation modernization projects in the ebro valley of spain esquiroz and puig 2001 application of this methodology to other areas of the world would require an adjustment of this criterion with additional and or different categories two categories were defined for the crop productive orientation of an icu extensive crops ce or intensive crops ci the category extensive crops corresponds to field crops such as cereals and fodders the category intensive crops corresponds to horticultural crops fruit orchards olives and vineyards an icu has an extensive productive orientation when more than 50 of its area corresponds to field crops the affection of an environmental protection figure on the icu is the third internal property in europe the natura 2000 network eea 2012 is a special environmental protection strategy commonly affecting irrigated areas natura 2000 delineates areas being protected by the habitats directive and the birds directive the protection of nature 2000 does not exclude human economic activity but any activity needs to integrate with nature conservation an icu classifies as environmentally protected na when more than 10 of its irrigated area is located within one of these protected areas it also classifies as na if the complete protected area is included within the icu otherwise the icu is classified as not affected by nature preservation figures no the fourth and last property describing the species is the socio economic level we used three states for this property high hi moderate mo and low lo in this classification methodology socio economic integrates and expands the restrictive concept of per capita income taking into account other elements or variables that contribute to the quality of life of farmers in the icu the socio economic level has been adapted to the particular conditions of the irrigated areas by using three types of indicators economic characteristics of the farming population and land and characteristics of the total population of irrigated areas the selected economic indicator was defined as the average net farm income expressed in ha 1 estimated by subtracting production expenses from the gross income this indicator reflects differences between icus derived from the choice of crops the interaction between natural resources and production technology the economic objectives and the economic possibilities the variables involved in the characterization of the farming population and land include the age of farmers the percentage of unemployed farmers derived from social security databases the educational level of farmers farm size and value of farmland the variables used to characterize the demography of an icu include age time evolution of population migration rate natural growth rate percentage of young people less than 15 years old and population density the variables used to characterize socio economy are numerically diverse and use different units the first step to reconcile them was to normalize them the normalization process results in non dimensional variables and restricts their values to the 0 1 range eq 1 therefore all normalized variables have the same weight giving exactly the same importance to each of them in the case of variables where a low value is good e g age the computation applied an inverse rule of three so that a value of 1 was assigned to the lowest value of the series 1 x n e w x i x m i n x m a x x m i n 2 2 the study area the ebro river basin in aragón the ebro river basin erb is located in the north west of spain has a total area of 85 362 km2 and is drained by the 910 km long ebro river fig 1 ebro is the largest watershed in spain representing 17 3 of the spanish mainland and is one of the key european mediterranean basins around 5 3 of the active population is devoted to agriculture slightly above the spanish average che 2015 the basin has an important agricultural and livestock activity with around 30 of the national meat production and about 30 of the national production of sweet fruits fodder and vineyards the irrigated area in the ebro basin is 900 623 ha i e 9 of its total area as previously discussed the application of the proposed methodology is restricted to the erb in aragón erb aragón roughly occupying 50 of the total watershed territory the spanish geographic information system of agricultural plots for use in the application of the common agricultural policy of the european union sig pac attributes 477 811 ha of irrigated land according to the cadaster cartography of the ministry of the treasure the area is 488 943 ha finally the 2004 geodatabase of the ebro river basin authority erba describes 518 628 ha of irrigated land part of the differences in irrigated area between information sources seem associated to the difficulty in keeping the database updated sig pac is a recent database 2015 and is updated periodically while the cadaster and the erba seem to be only partially updated changes in declared irrigated plots and infrequently the geographical delimitation of the icus requires overlapping the cartography of irrigated land with the cartography of administrative concessions of the erba the erba has a census of water rights with a thousand records related to irrigation data include the location municipality of the administrative bureau of the concessionaire attending to its organization some icus represent water user associations while others represent individual irrigation developments individual water users wuis the latter correspond to holdings in which a wua has not been created but which are legally registered as farms belonging to individual water users the erba provides cartography of the delimitation of wuas wuis and a census of water use rights the overlap of these two databases shows important differences due to the lack of effective updating differences were also found when combining erba information with the sig pac geodatabase the final delimitation of icus required and intensive labor of validation with different data sources and ground truth data 2 3 classifying the genus different procedures were used to obtain the data required to determine the values of the four properties defining the genus the water source was obtained from the erba database where the origin of water is classified as surface groundwater and mixed areas water source for icus not available at the erba database was obtained using other public data sources cartography of soil geomorphology the source of energy to pump the water was also available at the erba geodatabase this information was completed using the expertise of erwp members for instance all recent irrigation developments at the central ebro basin are water supplied from the mequinenza reservoir using pump stations the on farm irrigation system was obtained from the anonymized database of applications to the cap subsidies every year farmers submit an application detailing for each plot if it is irrigated or not the on farm irrigation method flood sprinkler drip and others and the type of crop among other data these records were not complete for each plot for instance the on farm irrigation method was not declared in 14 of the plots missing information was extrapolated from existing data cap applications present the information in tables without geographical representation plots were georeferenced using a common field in the application and in the sig pac geographic information system the plot identification code further it was necessary to identify the icu where the plot is included this was done by overlapping the georeferenced plots with the icus geodatabase leading to the determination of the on farm irrigation methods present in each icu differences in water availability between the left and right banks of the river basin in aragón are important the main tributaries in the left bank of the river ebro flow from the central pyrenees and discharge large amounts of water to ebro particularly in spring the tributaries in the right bank flow from the iberian system and are characterized by variable flow with frequent shortages particularly during the summer season this information was combined with the experience of erwp members to establish the water availability problems of each icu 2 4 classifying the species plot size was determined from the sig pac 2015 map of the irrigated plots the percentage of icu area corresponding to plots smaller than 5 ha was defined for each icu the crop productive orientation was obtained in the same way as the on farm irrigation method by combining the sig pac map with the cap application database which includes the crop type in the last step results were overlaid with the icu map the cartography of the areas belonging to the natura 2000 network was used to determine the icus with environmental protection figures this information was downloaded from the government of aragon webpage and overlaid with the icu map the socio economic level of the icu was described through net income the characteristics of the farming population and farm land and the characteristics of the general population of the irrigated areas the net income ni was calculated discounting the production expenses from the gross crop income gi the acreage the crop and its average yield and market price are required for gross income determination the acreage and the crop were obtained from the sig pac 2015 geodatabase crop yields were obtained from the public databases of the government of aragon and the spanish ministry of agriculture fisheries and food esyrce 2015 in these databases crop yields depend on the agroclimatic zones and on the water regime dryland or irrigated land however yield estimates were not provided for different on farm irrigation methods numerous research and technical works have highlighted the increase in field crop yield following modernization from flood to sprinkler irrigation playán and mateo 2006 faci et al 2000 and from flood to drip irrigation in fruit orchards olives and vineyards assaf et al 1984 rzekanowski and rolbiecki 2000 liu et al 2019 modernization has also intensified farming by promoting double cropping of field crops in the same season stambouli et al 2014 jiménez aguirre and isidoro 2018 the increase and stabilization in crop yield have been attributed to the reduction of abiotic stresses we resorted to scientific literature to introduce crop yield differences between on farm irrigation methods crop prices were obtained from local markets of agricultural products lonja del ebro 2019 the average of all plots integrating an icu provided the value of gi although income data change slightly from year to year crop area market price and average yield the averaging and normalization processes provide stability to the socio economic classification of the icus production expenses included direct costs and the payback of the investment on irrigation modernization direct costs were obtained from a public local database ecrea 2015 which provides cost estimates for different crops and cropping conditions such as dryland and irrigated since the available data did not reflect differences in costs between the different irrigation methods specific costs were added for pressurized methods with pumping requirements estimates of seasonal electricity costs were incorporated for flood irrigation estimates of the labor costs of the irrigation activity were included a distinction was made between the electricity costs of pressurizing surface water and groundwater four levels were established depending on the elevation to be overcome from 0 25 kw h m 3 for the surface water stambouli et al 2014 to 1 15 kw h m 3 for the deeper watertable narvarte 2018 the unit electricity cost was assumed constant at 0 09 kwh 1 electricity cost was applied to the total area of the icus classified as pumping pum and to the pumping area of icus classified as variety of energy sources var the seasonal volume of irrigation water applied to each plot was estimated from crop water requirements and the irrigation system efficiency crop water requirements were obtained from the public local database of the irrigation advisory service in aragón siar 2019 which provides data from different agrometeorological stations located throughout the study area irrigation efficiency estimates for the different on farm irrigation methods were obtained from the literature 60 for flood irrigation playán et al 2000 80 for sprinkler irrigation hanson et al 1996 and 90 for drip irrigation burt 2004 the labor cost of irrigation activity was only applied to flood irrigation owing to the usual automation of pressurized irrigation methods costs differed with plot size for disaggregate land tenure a value of 4 h ha 1 and irrigation event was used for concentrated land tenure a value of 3 h ha 1 and irrigation event was applied further an approximate water application of 1000 m3 ha 1 per flood irrigation event and a labor cost of 6 h 1 were used to estimate seasonal costs the last step was to estimate the annual payback of irrigation modernization investments modernization plans were implemented in the target area at the national and regional levels mapa 2002 and mapa 2010 the total investment cost and the part supported by the farmers was obtained for each wua zapata and lorenzo 2020 the following economic conditions were used for the loans subscribed by the wuas fixed annual payment 25 year payback period and a fixed annual interest rate of 5 25 total costs direct costs irrigation costs and irrigation modernization payback were deducted from gi to estimate seasonal ni ha 1 for each icu the limits differencing the socio economic level were established based on the local minimum and maximum values the farming characteristics and population specific variables were available from public sources at the municipal level farming land and farming population characteristics were obtained from the department of agriculture livestock and environment of the government of aragón dagma ga 2019 general population variables were obtained from the synthetic index of territorial development of aragón isdt boa 2019 providing normalized values of the selected variable per municipality since an icu can belong to one or several municipalities the indicators values were determined as a weighted average using the influence area of each municipality 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation cartographic units in the erb aragón the processing of the different data sources sig pac cadaster and erba in different formats resulted in the delimitation of 729 icus 641 wuas and 88 wuis as seen in fig 1 the area classified in icus amounts to 435 851 ha 95 414 841 ha of which is organized in wuas while the remaining 5 21 010 ha belongs to wuis according to the analyses 8 of the total irrigated area is not delimited in icus the small size and dispersion of the plots or the lack of a legal registration at the erba census made it impossible to assign an administrative figure to these plots and to group them in icus one of the characteristics of the erb aragón is that a large part of the wuas belong to a higher organization figure called general water users association gwua this is the case of riegos del alto aragón raa bardenas system bs aragón and cataluña canal cayc aragón imperial canal tauste canal and lodosa canal fig 2 gwuas derive from large irrigation projects usually developed by the spanish government and representing 67 of the target irrigated area the first three gwuas raa bardenas and cayc were built in the first half of the 20th century have strong capacities in collective infrastructure management and enforce water conservation practices the wua and gwua organizations also predispose to cooperation and mutual assistance boosting economic growth and development gómez limón et al 2014 miao et al 2018 the aragón imperial canal tauste canal and lodosa canal are ancient gwuas established before the 20th century are located in the axis of the ebro river and are not as active as the first three gwuas provide legal support to farmers and establish direct communication with the erba small irrigation projects 33 of the irrigated area generally correspond to wuas irrigated by ancient riparian canals located on the alluvial terraces of the ebro river and its tributaries these are characterized by relatively low water and infrastructure management standards the average size of the wuas is 602 ha showing an important variability the coefficient of variation was 47 the number of small wuas less than 500 ha is very high 471 although they only represent 14 of the total icu area the 76 wuis below 500 ha are also the most numerous but they only represent 2 of the total icu area as the size of the icus increases their number decreases the 61 wuas with an area between 1500 and 5000 ha represent 38 of the total area the 14 icus with an area exceeding 5000 ha are only of the wua type and represent 23 of the total area 3 2 analysis of genus in the erb aragón table 2 presents the number and area of icus wuas and wuis classified on the levels defining the four fixed properties of the genus for the erb aragón irrigated area due to the characteristics of the erb aragón it was necessary to consider the three levels for the properties energy source and on farm irrigation method table 1 most of the irrigated land in the erb aragón uses surface water 94 while groundwater use 6 is limited to very specific areas of the right bank of the river fig 3 a about half of the irrigated area uses gravity fed water 52 or 228 484 ha about one third uses pumped water 36 or 155 127 ha and the remaining 12 12 239 ha uses a mixture of gravity fed and pumping water table 2 and fig 3b regarding the on farm irrigation method 47 of the area 205 818 ha uses flood irrigation 46 198 240 ha uses a pressurized method and 7 31 793 ha uses a variety of methods table 2 and fig 3c in general flood irrigation uses gravity fed water while pressurized irrigation methods use pumped water as a relevant exception to this rule some icus using pressurized irrigation methods do not require pumping since pressure due to elevation difference is sufficient to operate the irrigation systems this represents approximately 9 of the area at the end of the 20th century 70 of the irrigated land of the erb aragón was flood irrigated after the intense modernization process of the first two decades of the 21st century this area was reduced to 47 in any case flood irrigation is more used in erb aragón than in spain 24 esyrce 2018 the flood irrigated area is commonly located on the alluvial terraces of the ebro river and its tributaries small irrigation projects and ancient gwuas fig 2 flood irrigation can also be found in areas located far from the riverbanks such as in some wuas of the gwua of raa and bs the degree of water availability problems for irrigation is eventual in 80 of the area 350 402 ha while the remaining 20 85 448 ha has permanent water availability problems fig 3d the icus located on the left bank of the basin and in the ebro river alluvial terraces were assigned eventual irrigation water availability problems since water shortages are not frequent in these areas the icus located on the right bank were assigned permanent water scarcity since they frequently present problems of water availability this simplification does not take into consideration structural aspects such as low storage capacity conveyance problems or low on farm application efficiency a more detailed analysis would be required to characterize how the structural traits of each icu interact with local irrigation water availability fig 4 presents the icus of the erb aragón classified at the genus level only the eight genera with irrigated area representation larger than 2 are individually presented on the map the rest of genera up to a total of 24 in the erb aragon were grouped and presented as other genera in the map legend the main traits of the first two genera in the figure legend are as follows the main genus surgraflove 136 569 ha 148 icus or 31 3 of the irrigated area is characterized by using surface water pressurized by gravity to perform flood irrigation in areas with eventual water availability problems this genus is located on the alluvial terraces of the ebro river and some tributaries a large part of the ancient gwuas aragón imperial canal tauste canal and lodosa canal and also in some wuas of the gwua of raa 26 076 ha and bs 50 374 ha the second genus by area is surpumpreve 118 891 ha 104 icus 27 3 of the irrigated area this genus uses surface water requires pumping to use pressurized on farm irrigation methods and only has eventual water availability problems this genus is located in raa and cayc gwuas and in irrigation developments at the central ebro basin surpumpreve genus has been the main beneficiary of the modernization projects of the 21st century 3 3 analysis of species in the erb aragón land structure is the first property defining the specificity of a genus in the erb aragón 59 4 of the land is disaggregated while 40 6 is concentrated table 3 the average area of a concentrated icu 1 295 ha is more than three times that of a disaggregated icu the icus classified as concentrated are located in the raa and bs wuas and to a lesser extent in cayc fig 5 a disaggregated icus are located on the riverbanks of the ebro and some of its tributaries gállego jalón and aragón and correspond to the oldest local irrigation systems fig 5a field crops ce are grown in 86 of the total irrigated area the remaining 14 is occupied with intensive crops horticulture orchards olives and vineyards table 3 the icus with intensive crops are on average smaller than the icus with extensive crops 309 ha vs 710 ha intensive crops are mainly located in cayc in the jalón river valley and in the recent irrigation developments at the central ebro basin around the mequinenza reservoir fig 5b the total irrigated area with environmental protection is 11 131 ha 2 6 however given the small percentage needed to have an icu classified as protected 140 icus fall in this category fig 5c presents the spatial distribution of icus with na and without no environmental protection protected icus are generally small average area of 216 ha and are either located on the boundaries of protected areas such as the axes of the ebro cinca and alcanadre rivers or contain protected lagoons sariñena or playa lakes gallocanta the first step to characterize the socio economic level was to compute the gross income the values of gi were arranged in three levels lower than 1500 ha 1 between 1500 and 2500 ha 1 and larger than 2500 ha 1 fig 5c the icus with lower gi are all flood irrigated and grow extensive crops the icus with intermediate gi are in general wuas with pressurized irrigation methods and with extensive crop orientation and some flood irrigated icus located on the banks of the ebro and gállego rivers with extensive crop orientation and a considerable area devoted to horticultural crops fig 5c the icus with the largest gross income correspond to areas with intensive crop and some wuas with extensive orientation and on farm pressurized methods that have a considerable area cropped with intensive crops intensive crops imply certain direct costs particularly labor but also provide potentially large incomes among the icus with extensive crop productive orientation those using pressurized irrigation methods had larger gross income than those irrigated by flooding irrigation technology resulted in reduced abiotic stresses fig 6 b presents the results of the net margin per icu organized in three levels low lower than 700 ha 1 moderate between 700 and 1500 ha 1 and high larger than 1500 ha 1 in general flood irrigation is associated with the lowest net margin while pressurized irrigation for extensive crops shows moderate net margin while pressurized irrigation for intensive crops particularly fruit orchards shows the highest net margin icus with high net margin represent 15 of the erb aragón irrigated area 65 188 ha 108 ucrs moderate net margin 40 173 219 ha 214 icus and low income icus account for 45 of the total irrigated area 197 063 ha 407 ucrs the economic indicator only considers the income of the agricultural irrigation production omitting other economic activities taking place in or around irrigated areas such as livestock farming or agribusiness modern irrigated areas typically have a dependable water supply and adequate rural roads this is fostering the installation of intensive livestock farms and agro industrial plants these effects have not been evaluated in this research but their consideration will reinforce the traits observed in the socio economic classification the second indicator that integrates the definition of the socio economic property describes characteristics of the farming land and the farming population municipalities close to large urban areas i e zaragoza huesca barbastro and fraga have very high farmland prices compared with neighborhood municipalities this is due to land speculation for activities other than farming this variable should therefore be cautiously analyzed to avoid disturbances in the classification only nine icus have a percentage of young farmers less than 35 years old larger than 20 in the rest of icus young farmers have a lower representation highlighting the significant ageing of the local farming population the educational level of the farmers is in general low only 8 having completed professional training or university education icus with the highest share of young farmers least farming unemployment below 5 and highest educational level from 10 to 25 of the farmers are located in raa and cayc systems these areas have the highest irrigation technology levels improving farmers quality of life and facilitating generational replacement the most aged farmers can be found in areas with high farming unemployment above 15 and the lowest educational level less than 5 of the farmers these areas are located in icus located in the riverbanks of the ebro and other tributaries the farming land and population indicator integrates the abovementioned variables and is organized in three levels low moderate and high fig 6b the demographic indicator was available at municipal level and integrates data from the different economic sectors of the municipality isdt 2019 fig 6c presents the distribution of the population indicator arranged in three levels low moderate and high high values of the indicator could be found around large urban areas zaragoza huesca fraga and monzón presenting the largest increments in population positive migration rates youngest population and the highest population density this pattern is associated with the provision of social services health and education and with the presence of industrial sites hospitals universities and other social services are mainly found in urban areas the lowest values of the population indicator are located in some wuas of raa and the wuas of the right side of the ebro river basin consideration of the maps of the three indicators led the erwp to use an equation giving different weights to the three variables stakeholders gave the largest weigh to the economic indicator an intermediate weight to the farming indicator and a low weight to the demographic indicator for example an icu with high economic indicator net income but with very low farming and population indicators resulted in a moderate socio economic level an icu with low economic indicator but very high farming and population indicators resulted in a moderate socio economic level fig 6d presents the spatial distribution of the socio economic indicator three levels for the different icus of the erb aragón the icus with low socio economic level 197 970 ha 412 icus and 359 wuas table 3 mostly correspond to flood irrigated areas located in the alluvial riverbanks of the ebro and other tributaries the high socio economic level 57 661 ha 60 icus and 52 wuas table 3 corresponds to icus with a productive orientation of intensive crops mostly fruit trees the moderate socio economic level 180 219 ha 257 ucrs and 230 wuas corresponds to pressurized irrigated areas with a productive orientation of extensive crops the application of the abovementioned properties to the erb aragón icus resulted in 23 specific names the seven specific names with the highest surface representativeness occupied 87 of the total area concenomo 27 7 discenolo 26 9 concenolo 13 7 discenomo 7 4 concenohi 5 discinohi 4 3 and discinolo 2 6 fig 7 the remaining 16 specific names had individual areas below 2 and together represented 13 of the area see other specific in fig 7 the most extended specific name had concentrated plot structure concenomo while the second in importance had disaggregated plot structure discenolo together both specific names represent more than 50 of the total irrigated area in erb aragon the concentrated specific name has a moderate socio economic level while the disaggregated specific name has a low socio economic level both have a productive orientation based on extensive crops ce and are not affected by environmental protection figures no the combination of genera and specific names resulted in 126 different species only eight of them have a representation above 2 in area and jointly represent 63 of the total area fig 8 presents the most important species of the seven important genera of the erb aragón representing 89 of the total irrigated area the main traits of the first two species in the figure legend are as follows the most extended genus surgraflove has two key specific names discenolo 19 and concenolo 9 6 the first species surgraflove discenolo corresponds to the oldest traditional irrigated icus of the ebro and tributaries riverbanks the second species only differs in the plot structure and corresponds to systems developed by governmental initiative national colonization institute in the first half of the 20th century so it was assigned the local name colonización equivalent to surgraflove concenore the second genus surpumpreve has three principal specific names concenomo 18 7 concenolo 2 1 and concenamo 1 3 the first and third species correspond to recently modernized areas located in wuas of raa the first species was assigned the local name alto aragonés equivament to surpumpreve concenomo while the specific cocennamo including an environmental protection figure such as the areas surrounding the sariñena lagoon was assigned the local name sariñena equivament to surpumpreve concenamo the second species in importance within this genus corresponds to pressurized irrigations that abstract water directly from the ebro river and pump to high areas with a predominance of extensive crops a characteristic wua of this type is loma de quinto leading to the local name of this species loma de quinto equivalent to surpumpreve concenolo 3 4 from classification to strategic needs and opportunities key features of the different species of the erb aragón were revealed by the classification process these provide nuanced insight on the irrigated systems that can support policy analyses and guide institutional intervention species ribera del ebro 84 086 ha 19 and tarazona 16 033 ha 3 7 are threatened by farmers ageing and low educational level a decline in wuas organization obsolete infrastructure low income production model fragmentation of property and proximity to large urban areas in the second species the situation is more complex due to permanent water availability problems these species have been the basis of local food security for centuries and have environmental and heritage importance they provide a number of ecosystem services and nature based solutions such as protection against flooding support to biodiversity interface with aquatic ecosystems and spaces of social recreation although these services increase the positive externalities in different rural socio ecological contexts masseroni et al 2017 it is difficult for farmers to take advantage of them when the economic model is not profitable the eventual valuation of the ecosystem services externalities could boost societal interest of maintaining these irrigated areas and guide the allocation of public subsidies for irrigation modernization that are compatible with the positive externalities solutions that have been successful for other species such as colonización based on replacing traditional flooding by pressurized methods may not be adequate for these species masseroni et al 2017 proposed technical solutions such as targeted rehabilitation measures based on the integrated use of decision support services gate automation remote and feedback controls and real time flow optimization although a technical solution is required the major challenge is to integrate the environmental issues and the social dimension farmers and other stakeholders otherwise a solution will not present itself additionally the species affected by permanent water availability problems should have a strong wua organization with very active water management measures the objective is to harmonize water availability with water consumption controls on maximum crop evapotranspiration and water allocation to plots and farmers seem to be required additionally these wuas need to focus on crops that can lead to moderate to high income with low water requirements or to crops in which income is not critically affected by water availability the dominance of extensive crops wheat barley corn and alfalfa of the erb aragón icus is a significant weakness in the current context of decreasing water availability the strong dependence on volatile cereal markets commodities with a track record of low prices result in irrigated areas with low biodiversity and compromised economic balance introducing new crops in icus with extensive crops will improve the sustainability of irrigation this is not an easy solution because the economic technical and social requirements for extensive cropping are completely different from those of intensive crops the on going automation of tedious and time consuming farming tasks such as pruning or planting is providing opportunities for crop restructuring 4 conclusions the methodology proposed in this research to classify irrigated areas uses a binomial structure genus and species the properties defining the genus and species and its levels were supported and validated by a multi stakeholder platform the first challenge of the classification was to define the geographic units icu that constitute the subject of the classification the icu definition was adapted to local conditions data availability and target of the classification data limitations arose when applying the methodology to the irrigated area of the ebro river basin in aragón erb aragón the total classified area 435 851 ha is organized in 729 icus 641 water users associations wuas 95 of the total area and 88 private irrigators wuis 5 among the strengths of the erb aragón irrigated areas 1 sufficient surface water resources to irrigate 94 of the area 2 few problems of water availability for irrigation 20 of the area 3 only 2 6 of the area is affected by environmental protection figures and 4 strong leadership of the wuas providing solid capacities in collective infrastructure and water management 66 of the irrigated area is organized in general wuas among the weaknesses of the erb aragón irrigated areas 1 moderate energetic dependence more than 36 of the irrigated area requires water pumping 2 moderate irrigation technological development only 45 have pressurized and automated on farm methods 3 disaggregated land structure 59 6 of the irrigated land is in plots smaller than 5 ha 4 low crop

10488,deficit irrigation practices and utilization of rootstocks that are tolerant to water stress are critical strategies for the protection of water resources and sustainable irrigation management especially in arid and semi arid areas therefore this study was carried out to investigate the yield and quality of watermelon grafted onto different rootstocks under deficit irrigation conditions during 2017 and 2018 in the konya plain of turkey where the semi arid climate is prevalent in this study five different plant materials such as citroides1 a1 citroides2 a2 gourd a3 hybrid tz148 a4 rootstocks grafted with the crimson tide variety and non grafted crimson tide as control k1 were used as the main plots five different irrigation levels calculated by taking into account the amounts of cumulative water ep that evaporated at 7 day intervals from class a pan i100 1 00ep i75 0 75ep i50 0 50ep i35 0 35ep and i0 rain fed were used as the sub plots when the average of experimental years was considered the highest rate of evapotranspiration et was found in the plot a4i100 615 mm the highest fruit yield was obtained from the a4i100 93 4 t ha and an increase in yield of up to 35 was achieved in the a4i100 compared to non grafted plants applied i100 irrigation level k1i100 the analysis of data by both separate evaluation and principal component analysis pca revealed that the yield values obtained from plants grafted onto a4 a1 and a2 rootstocks applied i75 irrigation level were higher than non grafted plants applied i100 irrigation level the water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp ranged between 7 1 17 4 kg m3 and 11 7 25 0 kg m3 respectively and a significant increase in the values of wp and iwp was achieved by grafting this two year study revealed that the performances of citron watermelon rootstocks were found close to the tz148 rootstock in terms of fruit yield certain yield components wp and iwp thus it has also been demonstrated that the citron watermelons could be used commercially as watermelon rootstocks and citron watermelon rootstocks could be used as watermelon rootstocks in breeding programs in order to save water especially in arid and semi arid regions keywords citron watermelon deficit irrigation grafting pca water productivity 1 introduction watermelon citrullus lanatus thun matsum and nakai which belongs to the family cucurbitaceae is cultivated economically with a production of 118 million tons in an area of 3 5 million hectares globally turkey with watermelon production of 4 million tons is presently the second highest watermelon producing country after china faostat 2019 in turkey watermelon accounts for 13 of the total vegetable production of about 31 million tons and is the second most produced vegetable after tomato tui̇k 2019 it is known that irrigation is required to achieve a high yield in watermelon cultivation due to its high growth rate short growing period and water content of 90 92 in the fruits miller 2002 in addition frequent irrigation is essential due to high rates of evaporation and low precipitation during the development period of watermelon in arid and semi arid areas doorenbos and kassam 1979 the konya plain constitutes about 8 of turkey s total agricultural area and has a semi arid climate with an annual rainfall of 323 mm yavuz et al 2015 since only 100 mm of the total precipitation occurs during the vegetation period may october and the rate of evaporation is extremely high during this period irrigation is essential in order to increase the yield and quality of crop production in the konya plains fig 1 although a large area of the konya plain is used for agriculture its water resources are limited due to the lack of water rain fed farming is carried out in an area of approximately 1 3 million hectares therefore the effective use of limited water is crucial for sustainable agriculture and water management in the konya plains in recent years especially in arid and semi arid areas drought has become one of the most important abiotic stress factors affecting watermelon production one of the primary water saving strategies in agriculture under arid and semi arid conditions is deficit irrigation the yield response factor ky which expresses the relationship between the decrease in water consumption and the decrease in yield is an important indicator in the evaluation of different irrigation programs implemented under conditions of limited irrigation in studies on deficit irrigation the ky of watermelon was reported to be 1 27 by erdem and yuksel 2003 1 33 by camoğlu et al 2010 and 1 15 by simsek et al 2004 plants with a ky value 1 are susceptible to water deficit doorenbos and kassam 1979 thus deficit irrigation may result in significant losses in watermelon yield several previous studies have reported that the highest yield was obtained under full irrigation conditions and that watermelon showed a decrease in yield with deficit irrigation erdem and yuksel 2003 orta et al 2003 wang et al 2004 erdem et al 2005 rouphael et al 2008 kirnak and dogan 2009 kuscu et al 2015 in order to reduce yield losses under conditions of limited irrigation high yielding cultivars should be grafted onto rootstocks that are capable of reducing the effect of water stress on the roots garcia sanchez et al 2007 satisha et al 2007 recent years have witnessed a better understanding of the role of rootstocks in reducing the effect of water stress on plants faced with water constraints opazo et al 2020 the grafting of rootstocks has been applied to protect against fusarium wilt tolerance to extreme temperatures removal of iron deficiency in high ph soils resistance to salty soil conditions and increasing intake of plant nutrients and water jang 1992 oda 1995 some researchers have reported that some watermelon rootstocks are tolerant to drought erismann et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 increase yields under limited irrigation conditions rouphael et al 2008 improve water productivity in vegetables oztekin et al 2007 and improve the water uptake and tolerance of plants under saline conditions tuzel and oztekin 2009 today the most widely used rootstocks in watermelon production are cucurbita maxima x cucurbita moschata hybrid rootstocks followed by lagenaria siceraria citron watermelons citrullus lanatus var citroides provide a wide genetic variation dane and lang 2004 levi and thomas 2005 and stand out as an important genetic resource in rootstock breeding studies levi et al 2001 several researchers have reported that the use of this genetic resource in watermelon cultivation increases tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress hwang et al 2011 levi et al 2017 kurum et al 2017 balkaya et al 2018 citron watermelon has been reported to be more tolerant than normal watermelon under arid conditions zhang et al 2011 mo et al 2016 and is an ideal agricultural product in arid and semi arid areas ngwepe et al 2019 on the other hand this rootstock can be used commercially to induce tolerance to drought and increase the efficiency of water use in watermelon ngwepe et al 2019 the effect of rootstocks on the yield and quality in grafted seedling production has also been discussed although the effect of the use of grafted seedlings on abiotic stress factors except drought has been demonstrated in several studies none of the studies have comprehensively investigated the effect of rootstock use on plant water consumption and yield of watermelon under deficit irrigation conditions therefore this study investigates the changes in water use yield and quality parameters of watermelon grafted onto different rootstocks under deficit irrigation conditions in the konya plain which has a semi arid climate in addition the rootstock performances of two citron watermelon genotypes which were not used as watermelon rootstocks before but were included in our gene pool for the watermelon rootstock breeding program were examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the present study was conducted during the years 2017 and 2018 at the saricalar research and application farm of the faculty of agriculture selcuk university konya turkey the research area latitude n 38o 05 longitude e 32o 36 is in the konya province and located approximately 20 km away from the campus area of selcuk university the average altitude of the research area is approximately 1006 m the view of the research area is presented in fig 2 according to the long term climate data the annual precipitation of the region was 323 mm and it had a semi arid climate data on the climate during the period from the planting of the watermelon seedling to fruit harvest were obtained from a portable meteorology station davis vantage pro2 located within the experimental area during the experimental period while the long term climate data were obtained from konya meteorology regional directorate the meteorological data are presented in table 1 examination of table 1 indicates that the climate data measured during the experimental period are in accordance with the long term climate data of the region 56 year average between the years 1960 and 2016 during 2017 and 2018 the total rainfall during the vegetation period was 87 1 and 63 2 mm respectively climatic parameters such as average temperature wind speed and relative humidity of the experimental period were consistent with those of the long term period chemical ph organic matter and physical properties texture class bulk density field capacity wilting point and available soil water content of the experimental area are presented in table 2 as evident from table 2 the top to bottom soil texture of the layers in the experimental area varied from silty clayey loam to clay the bulk densities varied between 1 24 and 1 32 g cm3 the moisture content at the field capacity ranged from 37 4 39 4 by volume and the total available water content of the soil was 138 6 mm at the 0 90 cm soil layer the range of ph and organic matter content was 7 75 7 86 and 0 84 1 84 respectively in the 0 90 cm soil layer of the experimental area the soil of the area did not restrict the cultivation of watermelon in terms of both physical and chemical properties 2 2 supply of irrigation water and irrigation system irrigation water was provided from a deep well in the research area the quality of irrigation water was determined to be c2s1 irrigation water was supplied to the plots using a drip irrigation system which consisted of lateral pipes of a diameter of 16 mm and the dripper flow rate was 4 l h at an operating pressure of 100 kpa the main and manifold lines were constituted by pe pipes having a diameter of 63 and 32 mm respectively the quantity of irrigation water applied to the plot was controlled by ¾ inch water meters that were placed at the plot inlet 2 3 design of the drip irrigation system and plot dimensions in order to determine the dripper spacing and percentage of wetted area irrigation tests were carried out with a lateral line and drippers with a flow rate of 4 l h at an operating pressure of 100 kpa by taking into account the soil characteristics from the tests the wetted diameter of the soil at a depth of 30 cm was measured as 70 cm the percentage of the wetted area was determined by dividing the wetted diameter at approximately 30 cm soil depth under the dripper to the lateral spacing cetin et al 2006 keller and bliesner 1990 in our experiment the wetted area percentage was calculated as 35 by dividing the wet diameter 70 cm to the lateral line spacing 200 cm the dripper spacing was selected as 40 cm considering soil characteristics and dripper flow rate the drip irrigation system was installed in the plots before the watermelon seedlings were planted in the field in both the experimental years the plots were 5 m in length and contained four plant rows spaced 2 m apart lateral pipes were placed in each plant row the watermelon seedlings were planted with 1 m spacing on rows so each plot contained twenty watermelon seedlings a space of 3 m was left between the block and the plots fig 3 2 4 plant material and treatments in this study five different plant materials citroides1 a1 citroides2 a2 bottle gourd a3 hybrid tz148 a4 rootstock grafted with crimson tide variety and non grafted control crimson tide k1 were used two rootstocks belonged to citrullus lanatus var citroides group a1 and a2 also known as citron watermelon the citroides were collected from turkmenistan both citroides have vigorous plant growth habit and the fruit flesh is hard a1 rootstocks have large round fruits while a2 rootstocks have oval fruits of medium size the fruits of the a1 have slightly mottled white red seeds in color while the fruits of a2 have smooth seeds of light green color the morphological and genetic diversities were determined between a1 and a2 previously citroides rootstocks at the s3 stage were selected from the gene pool at the vegetable growing and breeding department faculty of agriculture selcuk university the other two rootstocks were open pollinated bottle gourd lagenaria siceraria rootstock a3 and commercial hybrid rootstock tz148 a4 cucurbita maxima duchesne x cucurbita moschata duchesne which is widely used in watermelon cultivation crimson tide which is widely used as a commercial watermelon cultivar was used as the scion for rootstocks a total of 25 experimental treatments including five different plant materials a1 a2 a3 a4 rootstock grafted with crimson tide variety and non grafted control crimson tide k1 as the main plots and five different plant pan coefficients kcp1 1 00 kcp2 0 75 kcp3 0 50 kcp4 0 35 measured wetted area percentage and kcp5 0 00 rain fed as sub plots were carried out according to the factorial experimental design in randomized blocks with three replications all the plots except kcp5 rain fed were irrigated at a 7 day interval the experimental treatments and abbreviations are presented in table 3 2 5 agricultural practices about 2 3 days before planting the seedlings 200 kg ha dap diammonium phosphate fertilizer was applied and mixed into the soil using a rotary tiller in addition pure nitrogen fertilizer 50 kg ha was applied with a drip irrigation system the seed sowing of watermelon rootstocks and the scion crimson tide cultivar and the grafting process were carried out by a commercial company fide san antalya turkey grafted and non grafted watermelon seedlings were planted on 12th may 2017 and 14th may 2018 during the vegetation period disease and pest management was carried out as required the fruits were harvested thrice in 2017 16th and 22nd august and 6th september and twice in 2018 13th and 28th august 2 6 calculation of irrigation water and plant water consumption the amount of irrigation water applied to the experimental treatments was determined using eq 1 1 i e p k c p a where i amount of irrigation water liters a plot area m2 ep cumulative amount of water that evaporated in seven days from the class a pan mm kcp plant pan coefficient kcp1 1 00 kcp2 0 75 kcp3 0 50 kcp4 0 35 measured wetted area percentage kcp5 0 00 the consumption of water by plants was determined using eq 2 james 1988 2 e t i r d p c p r f δ s where et evapotranspiration mm i amount of irrigation water mm r effective rainfall mm dp deep percolation mm cp capillary rise mm rf runoff mm δs changes in water content mm in this equation the values of i r and dp were calculated from the amount of irrigation water applied from the portable climate station that was placed in the experimental area and by gravimetric method from soil samples taken with an auger at depths of 90 and 120 cm before and after irrigation respectively the soil of the experimental site was deep and there was no problem related to drainage and salinity at the site therefore as there was no capillary rise due to groundwater the cp value was not taken into account in the calculations the value of δs was obtained from measurements of soil moisture that were determined by the gravimetric method at soil depths of 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm since the drip irrigation system was planned and operated accurately no losses occurred due to surface flow and thus the rf value was excluded from the calculations 2 7 yield response factor ky wp and iwp the relationships between the reduction of relative et and relative fruit yield were determined using eq 3 doorenbos and kassam 1979 3 3 1 y a y m k y 1 e t a e t m where ya actual yield kg ha ym maximum yield kg ha ky yield response factor eta actual et mm etm maximum et mm the water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp were calculated as fruit yield kg ha divided by seasonal et and total seasonal irrigation water applied to a unit area m3 ha respectively 2 8 evaluation of data the test of homogeneity f test was used to determine whether the combined analysis of variance could be applied to the yield and quality parameters for both the trial years 2017 and 2018 the results of this test indicated that the error variances of the yield and quality parameters were not homogeneous across the trial years due to which both the trial years were evaluated separately in order to determine the differences in yield and quality parameters the data obtained from the treatments were subjected to the statistical tests analysis of variance anova and duncan s multiple comparison test the results of the characteristics were recorded as statistically significant at the 5 significance level the statistical tests were performed using the statistical program spss version 22 0 the results of the yield and yield components were evaluated collectively by the principal component analysis pca using the statistical program jmp version 10 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation et and fruit yield the total amounts of irrigation water applied and evapotranspiration values obtained from the treatments are presented in table 4 the total amounts of irrigation water applied to the plots were in the range of 20 552 mm in 2017 and 25 564 mm in 2018 for the development of seedling 20 0 and 25 0 mm water was applied to all the plots during planting in 2017 and 2018 respectively the irrigation programs were started on 26th june in 2017 and 28th june in 2018 after starting the scheduled irrigation all the treatments except i0 rain fed were irrigated nine times each year irrigation was completed on 22nd august in 2017 and 21st august in 2018 the amount of precipitation during the vegetative period of watermelon may september was 87 1 and 63 2 mm in 2017 and 2018 respectively most of the precipitation during the vegetative period occurred between the dates of seedling planting 12th and 14th may and scheduled irrigation 26th and 28th june in both the trial years et values varied between 155 and 636 mm in 2017 and between 125 and 596 mm in 2018 in 2017 the highest et value was observed in the a1 rootstock and in the a1i100 treatment where the plant pan coefficient was 1 00 on the other hand in 2018 the highest et values were observed in plants grafted onto a4 rootstock and in the a4i100 treatments where the plant pan coefficient was 1 00 table 4 in previous studies the highest et value of watermelon was reported to be 764 mm simsek et al 2004 677 mm kirnak and dogan 2009 475 mm camoğlu et al 2010 521 mm özmen et al 2014 506 mm kuscu et al 2015 and 449 mm duraktekin et al 2018 in the present study the highest observed et values were similar to some of the previous studies but higher or lower than the others it is hypothesized that these differences may be caused by factors such as climate soil characteristics irrigation management watermelon variety and cultivation techniques the analysis of variance of the fruit yields indicated that rootstocks and irrigation levels significantly influenced the yield with 95 reliability during both the years although no significant interactions between rootstock x irrigation level and yield were observed in 2017 statistically significant interactions p 0 05 were observed in 2018 the total variance could be largely explained by irrigation levels during both the experimental years fig 4 no statistically significant difference was observed between the plants grafted onto the a1 a2 and a4 where the highest yield was obtained in 2017 a significant increase in the yields up to 30 was achieved in grafted plants compared to the non grafted control plant except for plants that were grafted onto the a3 rootstocks table 5 huitron et al 2007 while studying the effects of different watermelon rootstocks on the yield observed that citrullus lanatus var cidroides produced a higher yield 79 7 t ha than the other rootstocks they suggested that citroides could be used as a rootstock for watermelon cultivation in the second year of the experiment the highest yield was obtained from plants that were grafted onto the a4 rootstock 60 6 t ha which was statistically different from the other treatments with 95 reliability the yield increased by 25 40 in plants grafted onto a4 a1 and a2 rootstocks compared to the control watermelons table 6 özmen et al 2014 and mohamed et al 2012 reported that the use of rootstock increased the yield in watermelon and that grafted plants produced higher yields compared to the non grafted plants no significant differences were observed between the plants that were grafted onto the a3 rootstock and control group during both the trial years this result indicates that grafting of the crimson tide cultivar onto bottle gourd rootstock did not have any effect on the yield under arid and semi arid climatic conditions and that this grafting combination was not suitable for such areas contrary to our findings some researchers have reported that watermelon plants grafted onto bottle gourd rootstocks produced higher yield khankahdani et al 2012 yetisir and sari 2018 this discrepancy in results may be attributed to factors such as climatic conditions cultivation techniques and particularly rootstock scion compatibility the bottle gourds had become the preferred rootstock for watermelon because of some advantages such as diseases resistance besides bottle gourds have some advantages and several disadvantages such as bottle gourds tend to have an extensive but shallow root system interspecific cucurbita hybrids tend to have a deep root system this along with their drought tolerance explains why they have recently gained favor over bottle gourd as a rootstock for watermelon king et al 2010 similarly in our study the plants grafted on hybrids cucurbita a4 produced better performance than the plants grafted on bottle gourds under both drought stressed and non stressed conditions according to results of duncan s multiple comparison test the treatments a4i100 with the highest fruit yield of 93 9 t ha a1i100 and a4i75 were classified in the same group considering the interaction between rootstock and irrigation level and were statistically significantly different from the other treatments p 0 05 table 6 different irrigation levels revealed varying effects on yield the highest yield was obtained at the i100 irrigation level and yield decreased with increasing water stress however when tables 5 and 6 were evaluated together considering the average of both the trial years the yield loss at the i75 irrigation level compared to i100 was only 10 thus 25 of water saving was achieved at the i75 irrigation level compared to the i100 at the cost of only a 10 loss in yield several researchers working on water yield relationships have reported that water stress causes significant yield losses in watermelon wang et al 2004 proietti et al 2008 rouphael et al 2008 kirnak and dogan 2009 the graphic that was prepared considering the average of experimental years to demonstrate the effects of different rootstocks and application of different irrigation levels are presented in fig 5 as seen from this figure fruit yield also decreased in plants grafted onto either different rootstocks or control groups in parallel to the decrease in irrigation level the yield values obtained from the i75 and i50 irrigation levels in plants grafted onto the a4 rootstock and i75 irrigation levels in plants grafted onto a1 and a2 rootstocks were higher than those observed at the i100 irrigation level in the non grafted control group fig 5 this result indicates that comparable yield can be obtained even in water stress conditions by using appropriate rootstock it is evident that the effect of water stress can be reduced by grafting and that higher yields can be obtained in grafted plants of watermelon than non grafted plants under full irrigation conditions when the average yield of plants grafted on a1 and a2 which included statistically the same group in both years was compared a1 produced more yield with 62 7 and 55 4 t ha than a2 for both years respectively when irrigation levels in the non stressed i100 and slightly stressed i75 were considered a1 produced more yield than a2 for both years when it comes to stressed treatments such as i50 and i35 a2 produced more yield than a1 it can be concluded that a2 rootstocks have potential to produce more yield under severe water stress conditions than a1 or even hybrid a4 rootstock these findings are important for the management and sustainability of water resources in agriculture for arid and semi arid regions which have limited water resources therefore some researchers have recommended that fecund cultivars should be grown by grafting onto drought tolerant rootstocks having a substantial root system in order to reduce losses in production under drought conditions and increase the efficiency of water use garcia sanchez et al 2007 satisha et al 2007 3 2 yield components analysis of the variance of the number of fruits per plant mean fruit weight fruit height fruit width wp and iwp rootstocks and irrigation levels showed a statistically significant variance table 7 and irrigation levels accounted for most of the total variance during both the trial years fig 4 considering the different applications of rootstocks the highest number of fruits per plant was observed in plants that were grafted onto a2 rootstock 2 40 fruits plant in the first year and 1 97 fruits plant in the second year there was no statistically significant difference between a1 a2 and a4 rootstocks yetisir and sari 2003 grafted the crimson tide cultivar onto different rootstocks and reported that some rootstocks had a positive effect on the number of fruits in this study the application of different irrigation levels significantly influenced the number of fruits and although the highest number of fruits per plant was obtained from the i100 plot it was not statistically different from that obtained using the i75 irrigation level rouphael et al 2008 obtained 1 82 watermelon fruits per plant under full irrigation conditions but the number of fruits decreased in parallel with an increase in water stress statistically significant differences were observed between the treatments in terms of mean fruit weight fruit width and fruit length and watermelons grafted onto the a4 rootstock produced the best performance table 7 there were no statistically significant differences in mean fruit weight fruit length and fruit width between the i100 i75 and i50 irrigation levels in 2017 in 2018 the highest fruit weight and fruit width were obtained from the i100 plots which were statistically different from the other irrigation levels the fruit sizes across the i100 i75 and i50 irrigation levels were statistically similar in 2017 when the values of wp and iwp were analyzed together with the treatments and the years they ranged from 8 0 to 15 5 kg m3 and 13 6 to 25 4 kg m3 for wp and iwp respectively the wp of watermelon ranged from 12 68 to 15 66 kg m3 according to the treatments kuscu et al 2015 in a study conducted in italy the wp of watermelon was between 9 3 and 10 1 kg m3 in non grafted plants and between 13 2 and 14 5 kg m3 in grafted plants depending on the treatments and higher values of wp were obtained in both deficit irrigated and grafted plots rouphael et al 2008 abdelkhalik et al 2019 examined the water yield relationships in watermelon under deficit irrigation conditions and reported that iwp values of watermelon varied between 11 86 and 21 28 kg m3 alkhader et al 2019 studied the effect of different nitrogen applications on the yield and quality of watermelon in jordan and reported that iwp values varied between 12 65 and 28 83 kg m3 depending on the experimental years and plots in our study the control group and a3 rootstock showed lower iwp values than a1 a2 and a4 rootstocks according to these results in order to achieve high iwp values a1 a2 and a4 rootstocks can help producers to save water in watermelon production under arid and semi arid conditions such as in konya when iwp values were examined in terms of irrigation levels they were observed to generally increase with a decrease in the amount of irrigation water applied the highest values of iwp were obtained at the i50 and i35 irrigation levels despite variation between rootstocks this study aimed to obtain the highest yield from low water in arid and semi arid areas with limited water resources therefore if watermelon is grafted onto a1 a2 and a4 rootstocks and irrigation water is applied at the i50 level considerable savings in irrigation water could be achieved in arid and semi arid areas and the resultant reduction in pressure on water resources could facilitate the irrigation of more areas using the available water when the experimental years rootstocks and irrigation levels were evaluated together the ranges of fruit rind thickness ssc and ph of fruit juice were 8 6 18 2 mm 7 8 10 8 brix and 5 08 5 38 respectively table 8 in general the fruit rind thickness decreased in plants that were grafted onto citron watermelon rootstocks and in the rain fed treatments leskovar et al 2004 reported that different irrigation levels had significant effects on fruit rind thickness and the highest rind thickness in watermelon 11 2 mm was obtained under conditions of full irrigation conditions on the other hand the rind thickness of fruits cultivated under deficit irrigation in different conditions was between 12 and 17 mm and the use of irrigation had significant effects on the fruit rind thickness in watermelon erdem and yuksel 2003 ssc values increased in fruits harvested from grafted plants during both the years the lowest ssc values were obtained at i100 irrigation levels with an increase in treatments with limited irrigation table 8 different gourd rootstocks had a significant effect on ssc with higher ssc values being observed with the use of gourd rootstocks karaca et al 2012 two different varieties of watermelon were grafted onto different rootstocks and the highest ssc values were obtained from non grafted plots davis and perkins veazie 2005 it is thought that the difference observed in the different studies could be due to the use of different rootstocks the ph values of the fruits obtained from the grafted plants were observed to be higher than the non grafted ones on the other hand while the ph values remained statistically similar across irrigation levels in 2017 significant differences in the ph values were observed in 2018 p 0 01 and higher ph values were observed in treatments with severe water stress pinto et al 2017 reported that the highest ph value in watermelon was 6 23 in addition kyriacou et al 2016 while examining the effects of grafting harvest maturity and post harvest storage in watermelon reported a ph of 5 55 the effects of irrigation regimes on fruit quality were investigated by proietti et al in 2008 and no significant differences in the ph values were reported in mini watermelons turhan et al 2012 analyzed the effect of different rootstocks on fruit quality fruit characteristics and yield in watermelon and reported that the ph values varied between 5 31 and 5 51 with statistically significant differences between the applications at the 5 significance level when the present study was compared with previous studies it was observed that the ph values of watermelon generally varied between 5 and 6 and that watermelon juice showed acidic properties ssc and ph values of the fruits obtained in the study were higher for the grafted plant in our study the reason for this is that grafted plants have a stronger root system and accordingly intakes water and nutrients better this contributes positively in the accumulation of ssc and dry mater in fruits accordingly the sugar content of the fruits increases also in grafted plants increasing the sugar content in the grafted plants decreases the acidity so ph increases accordingly increased ph and ssc in watermelon tissue are generally considered as indicators of fruit ripening corey and schlimme 1988 in our study higher ph values were obtained in severe stressed treatment i35 and rain fed treatment i0 thus it can be said water stress caused early fruit ripening accordingly higher ph values in grafted plants may be associated with early ripening in fruits the effect of decreased ph on sweetness might be perceived by consumers as the loss of quality due to elevated acidity soteriou et al 2014 therefore the lower ph values in fruits may negatively affects consumer perception of the taste in our study lowest ph values were obtained in non grafted treatments the fruits obtained from grafted plants may be preferred by consumers in terms of higher ph and ssc values l chroma c and hue ho values showed significant differences in both rootstock and irrigation levels in terms of fruit flesh color the parameter l expresses the amount of lightness or darkness in color ranging from 0 black to 100 white therefore it can be said that fruits obtained from a1 a2 and a3 rootstocks had lighter fruit flesh color than those obtained from the a4 rootstock table 8 the c value in the color sphere indicates the intensity of the color in other words the lightness of the chroma color is an indicator of how much the saturation of color changes without changing the darkness in general the color becomes brighter with an increase in chroma value from these findings it can be said that the fruits obtained from a1 a2 and a4 rootstocks had brighter pulp than a3 rootstock and non grafted control group fruits the hue value which is an expression of the angle of the color varies according to the point where the color is located in red green and blue a hue value of 0 indicates the red color while a value of 90 indicates the yellow color 180 indicates the green color and 270 indicates blue color as the hue value increases numerically the color turns yellow accordingly it could be suggested that the fruit flesh obtained from a1 a3 and non grafted control groups had a darker red color than fruits obtained from the a4 rootstock table 8 3 3 water yield relationships the et measured according to different rootstock applications and different irrigation levels and fruit yields obtained from the treatments is graphically presented in fig 6 as the average of both the experimental years a logarithmic relationship was observed between the water consumption and fruit yield in the control group plants and those grafted onto a2 rootstock with 99 reliability fig 6a c in plants that were grafted onto a1 a3 and a4 rootstocks strong linear relationships were observed between the yield and water consumption p 0 01 fig 6b d e in all the applications the equations and determination coefficients that define the relationship between water consumption and fruit yield are mentioned in the corresponding figure generally studies on water yield relationships in watermelon reported linear relationships between water consumption and yield kirnak and dogan 2009 camoğlu et al 2010 kuscu et al 2015 in order to determine the effect of a proportional decrease in the seasonal water consumption of watermelon on the proportional decrease in fruit yield yield response factors ky were calculated considering the averages of the two experimental years the ky values varied between 0 91 and 1 11 depending on different rootstocks fig 7 the value of ky was less than 1 0 in the control group and a2 rootstock fig 7a c and greater than 1 0 in the other treatments fig 7b d e as plants with ky values greater than 1 0 are considered to be sensitive to water stress doorenbos and kassam 1979 a4 a1 and a3 rootstocks were found to be sensitive to deficit irrigation although the value of ky was less than 1 0 in treatments grafted onto rootstock a2 and the control group seasonal ky was calculated as 1 12 when all the trial treatments were evaluated together fig 7 f this result indicates that watermelon is sensitive to deficit irrigation under arid and semi arid conditions 3 4 principal component analyses as this study aimed to interpret the yield and quality parameters together the data obtained were subjected to the principal component analysis pca from the pca the first two components pc1 and pc2 with an eigenvalue greater than 1 0 accounted for 82 5 of the total variance table 9 in order to obtain accurate results and good interpretation of the pca the first two components need to account for at least 25 of the total variance mohammadi and prasanna 2003 seymen et al 2019 therefore the significant contribution of the first two components toward the total variance observed in this study indicates that the yield and quality parameters can be explained strongly by pca pc1 which accounted for 58 3 of the total variance showed a significant positive correlation with fruit yield a number of fruits per plant mean fruit weight fruit length fruit width and fruit rind thickness on the other hand pc2 which accounted for 24 2 of the total variance displayed a significant positive correlation with ssc ph and c and negative correlation with ho angle in the loading plot chart fig 8 a which was drawn using pc1 and pc2 and showed the relationship between yield and quality characteristics an angle between the two vectors of less than 90 showed a positive correlation while an angle greater than 90 showed a negative correlation and an angle equal to 90 indicated no significant relationship based on these findings strong positive correlations were observed between physical parameters such as fruit yield fruit number fruit weight fruit height fruit width and rind thickness likewise while there was a significant positive correlation between ssc ph and chroma values in fruit flesh a negative correlation was observed between these parameters with l and hue angle in the fruit flesh several researchers have used pca loading plot graphs in genetic classification and for the evaluation of fruit yield and quality parameters and have reported valuable results di vaio et al 2015 kyriacou et al 2016 seymen et al 2019 in our study the loading plot chart produced meaningful results while evaluating the yield and quality parameters similarly the score plot chart also made considerable contributions in evaluating the experimental subjects in terms of yield and yield components fig 8b four different areas appeared in the score plot chart that was drawn using pc1 and pc2 generally treatments such as non stressed i100 moderately stressed i75 and severely stressed i50 were included in the positive area of pc1 extremely stressed i35 treatment and non irrigated i0 treatment were included in the negative region of pc1 and did not perform well in terms of the yield components when the positive regions of both pc1 and pc2 right upper region of pc1 were evaluated i100 and i75 irrigation levels in plants grafted onto a4 and a1 rootstocks as well as i100 irrigation levels in plants grafted onto a3 rootstock showed high fruit yield fruit number and fruit features such as weight size width and rind thickness it was evident that the i75 irrigation level was a crucial application for saving water in arid and semi arid areas with limited water resources especially in plants grafted onto a1 and a4 rootstock when investigating the area where pc1 was negative and pc2 was positive experimental subjects of the i35 irrigation level where severe water stress was applied stood out with high ssc and ph values 4 conclusion this two year study demonstrated that the highest yield was achieved at i100 and that the yield decreased with an increase in water stress considering the average of both trial years the loss in yield at the irrigation level of i75 where 25 deficit irrigation was applied was only 10 compared to the i100 irrigation level in other words 136 mm of water was saved with the application of the i75 irrigation level this finding is significant for the protection of water resources and sustainable water management in agriculture in arid and semi arid areas that have limited water resources in terms of different rootstock applications tz148 and citron watermelon rootstocks had higher fruit yield than gourd rootstock and non grafted control group in this context the use of the correct rootstock is a crucial factor in order to obtain high fruit yield in watermelon according to the pca analysis where the data obtained from experimental subjects were evaluated both separately and collectively while considering fruit yield and other yield components tz148 was identified as the superior rootstock on the other hand the performance of citron watermelon rootstocks was observed to be close to the tz148 rootstock in terms of fruit yield some yield components water and irrigation water productivity in our study citroides1 performed better in non stress water regimes while citroides2 performed better in severe water stress conditions therefore considering the environmental conditions such as water availability it can be concluded that the use of suitable citron watermelon rootstocks for these conditions provides advantages over other rootstocks it is predicted that citron watermelons will perform better as watermelon rootstocks than commercial varieties in case of ongoing self breeding programs on citron watermelon rootstocks and obtain the heterosis effect in the hybrid rootstock breeding stage in the future therefore it is obvious that the use of citron watermelons in rootstock breeding programs and the use of a watermelon rootstock will provide great advantages for both producers and consumers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10488,deficit irrigation practices and utilization of rootstocks that are tolerant to water stress are critical strategies for the protection of water resources and sustainable irrigation management especially in arid and semi arid areas therefore this study was carried out to investigate the yield and quality of watermelon grafted onto different rootstocks under deficit irrigation conditions during 2017 and 2018 in the konya plain of turkey where the semi arid climate is prevalent in this study five different plant materials such as citroides1 a1 citroides2 a2 gourd a3 hybrid tz148 a4 rootstocks grafted with the crimson tide variety and non grafted crimson tide as control k1 were used as the main plots five different irrigation levels calculated by taking into account the amounts of cumulative water ep that evaporated at 7 day intervals from class a pan i100 1 00ep i75 0 75ep i50 0 50ep i35 0 35ep and i0 rain fed were used as the sub plots when the average of experimental years was considered the highest rate of evapotranspiration et was found in the plot a4i100 615 mm the highest fruit yield was obtained from the a4i100 93 4 t ha and an increase in yield of up to 35 was achieved in the a4i100 compared to non grafted plants applied i100 irrigation level k1i100 the analysis of data by both separate evaluation and principal component analysis pca revealed that the yield values obtained from plants grafted onto a4 a1 and a2 rootstocks applied i75 irrigation level were higher than non grafted plants applied i100 irrigation level the water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp ranged between 7 1 17 4 kg m3 and 11 7 25 0 kg m3 respectively and a significant increase in the values of wp and iwp was achieved by grafting this two year study revealed that the performances of citron watermelon rootstocks were found close to the tz148 rootstock in terms of fruit yield certain yield components wp and iwp thus it has also been demonstrated that the citron watermelons could be used commercially as watermelon rootstocks and citron watermelon rootstocks could be used as watermelon rootstocks in breeding programs in order to save water especially in arid and semi arid regions keywords citron watermelon deficit irrigation grafting pca water productivity 1 introduction watermelon citrullus lanatus thun matsum and nakai which belongs to the family cucurbitaceae is cultivated economically with a production of 118 million tons in an area of 3 5 million hectares globally turkey with watermelon production of 4 million tons is presently the second highest watermelon producing country after china faostat 2019 in turkey watermelon accounts for 13 of the total vegetable production of about 31 million tons and is the second most produced vegetable after tomato tui̇k 2019 it is known that irrigation is required to achieve a high yield in watermelon cultivation due to its high growth rate short growing period and water content of 90 92 in the fruits miller 2002 in addition frequent irrigation is essential due to high rates of evaporation and low precipitation during the development period of watermelon in arid and semi arid areas doorenbos and kassam 1979 the konya plain constitutes about 8 of turkey s total agricultural area and has a semi arid climate with an annual rainfall of 323 mm yavuz et al 2015 since only 100 mm of the total precipitation occurs during the vegetation period may october and the rate of evaporation is extremely high during this period irrigation is essential in order to increase the yield and quality of crop production in the konya plains fig 1 although a large area of the konya plain is used for agriculture its water resources are limited due to the lack of water rain fed farming is carried out in an area of approximately 1 3 million hectares therefore the effective use of limited water is crucial for sustainable agriculture and water management in the konya plains in recent years especially in arid and semi arid areas drought has become one of the most important abiotic stress factors affecting watermelon production one of the primary water saving strategies in agriculture under arid and semi arid conditions is deficit irrigation the yield response factor ky which expresses the relationship between the decrease in water consumption and the decrease in yield is an important indicator in the evaluation of different irrigation programs implemented under conditions of limited irrigation in studies on deficit irrigation the ky of watermelon was reported to be 1 27 by erdem and yuksel 2003 1 33 by camoğlu et al 2010 and 1 15 by simsek et al 2004 plants with a ky value 1 are susceptible to water deficit doorenbos and kassam 1979 thus deficit irrigation may result in significant losses in watermelon yield several previous studies have reported that the highest yield was obtained under full irrigation conditions and that watermelon showed a decrease in yield with deficit irrigation erdem and yuksel 2003 orta et al 2003 wang et al 2004 erdem et al 2005 rouphael et al 2008 kirnak and dogan 2009 kuscu et al 2015 in order to reduce yield losses under conditions of limited irrigation high yielding cultivars should be grafted onto rootstocks that are capable of reducing the effect of water stress on the roots garcia sanchez et al 2007 satisha et al 2007 recent years have witnessed a better understanding of the role of rootstocks in reducing the effect of water stress on plants faced with water constraints opazo et al 2020 the grafting of rootstocks has been applied to protect against fusarium wilt tolerance to extreme temperatures removal of iron deficiency in high ph soils resistance to salty soil conditions and increasing intake of plant nutrients and water jang 1992 oda 1995 some researchers have reported that some watermelon rootstocks are tolerant to drought erismann et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 increase yields under limited irrigation conditions rouphael et al 2008 improve water productivity in vegetables oztekin et al 2007 and improve the water uptake and tolerance of plants under saline conditions tuzel and oztekin 2009 today the most widely used rootstocks in watermelon production are cucurbita maxima x cucurbita moschata hybrid rootstocks followed by lagenaria siceraria citron watermelons citrullus lanatus var citroides provide a wide genetic variation dane and lang 2004 levi and thomas 2005 and stand out as an important genetic resource in rootstock breeding studies levi et al 2001 several researchers have reported that the use of this genetic resource in watermelon cultivation increases tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress hwang et al 2011 levi et al 2017 kurum et al 2017 balkaya et al 2018 citron watermelon has been reported to be more tolerant than normal watermelon under arid conditions zhang et al 2011 mo et al 2016 and is an ideal agricultural product in arid and semi arid areas ngwepe et al 2019 on the other hand this rootstock can be used commercially to induce tolerance to drought and increase the efficiency of water use in watermelon ngwepe et al 2019 the effect of rootstocks on the yield and quality in grafted seedling production has also been discussed although the effect of the use of grafted seedlings on abiotic stress factors except drought has been demonstrated in several studies none of the studies have comprehensively investigated the effect of rootstock use on plant water consumption and yield of watermelon under deficit irrigation conditions therefore this study investigates the changes in water use yield and quality parameters of watermelon grafted onto different rootstocks under deficit irrigation conditions in the konya plain which has a semi arid climate in addition the rootstock performances of two citron watermelon genotypes which were not used as watermelon rootstocks before but were included in our gene pool for the watermelon rootstock breeding program were examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the present study was conducted during the years 2017 and 2018 at the saricalar research and application farm of the faculty of agriculture selcuk university konya turkey the research area latitude n 38o 05 longitude e 32o 36 is in the konya province and located approximately 20 km away from the campus area of selcuk university the average altitude of the research area is approximately 1006 m the view of the research area is presented in fig 2 according to the long term climate data the annual precipitation of the region was 323 mm and it had a semi arid climate data on the climate during the period from the planting of the watermelon seedling to fruit harvest were obtained from a portable meteorology station davis vantage pro2 located within the experimental area during the experimental period while the long term climate data were obtained from konya meteorology regional directorate the meteorological data are presented in table 1 examination of table 1 indicates that the climate data measured during the experimental period are in accordance with the long term climate data of the region 56 year average between the years 1960 and 2016 during 2017 and 2018 the total rainfall during the vegetation period was 87 1 and 63 2 mm respectively climatic parameters such as average temperature wind speed and relative humidity of the experimental period were consistent with those of the long term period chemical ph organic matter and physical properties texture class bulk density field capacity wilting point and available soil water content of the experimental area are presented in table 2 as evident from table 2 the top to bottom soil texture of the layers in the experimental area varied from silty clayey loam to clay the bulk densities varied between 1 24 and 1 32 g cm3 the moisture content at the field capacity ranged from 37 4 39 4 by volume and the total available water content of the soil was 138 6 mm at the 0 90 cm soil layer the range of ph and organic matter content was 7 75 7 86 and 0 84 1 84 respectively in the 0 90 cm soil layer of the experimental area the soil of the area did not restrict the cultivation of watermelon in terms of both physical and chemical properties 2 2 supply of irrigation water and irrigation system irrigation water was provided from a deep well in the research area the quality of irrigation water was determined to be c2s1 irrigation water was supplied to the plots using a drip irrigation system which consisted of lateral pipes of a diameter of 16 mm and the dripper flow rate was 4 l h at an operating pressure of 100 kpa the main and manifold lines were constituted by pe pipes having a diameter of 63 and 32 mm respectively the quantity of irrigation water applied to the plot was controlled by ¾ inch water meters that were placed at the plot inlet 2 3 design of the drip irrigation system and plot dimensions in order to determine the dripper spacing and percentage of wetted area irrigation tests were carried out with a lateral line and drippers with a flow rate of 4 l h at an operating pressure of 100 kpa by taking into account the soil characteristics from the tests the wetted diameter of the soil at a depth of 30 cm was measured as 70 cm the percentage of the wetted area was determined by dividing the wetted diameter at approximately 30 cm soil depth under the dripper to the lateral spacing cetin et al 2006 keller and bliesner 1990 in our experiment the wetted area percentage was calculated as 35 by dividing the wet diameter 70 cm to the lateral line spacing 200 cm the dripper spacing was selected as 40 cm considering soil characteristics and dripper flow rate the drip irrigation system was installed in the plots before the watermelon seedlings were planted in the field in both the experimental years the plots were 5 m in length and contained four plant rows spaced 2 m apart lateral pipes were placed in each plant row the watermelon seedlings were planted with 1 m spacing on rows so each plot contained twenty watermelon seedlings a space of 3 m was left between the block and the plots fig 3 2 4 plant material and treatments in this study five different plant materials citroides1 a1 citroides2 a2 bottle gourd a3 hybrid tz148 a4 rootstock grafted with crimson tide variety and non grafted control crimson tide k1 were used two rootstocks belonged to citrullus lanatus var citroides group a1 and a2 also known as citron watermelon the citroides were collected from turkmenistan both citroides have vigorous plant growth habit and the fruit flesh is hard a1 rootstocks have large round fruits while a2 rootstocks have oval fruits of medium size the fruits of the a1 have slightly mottled white red seeds in color while the fruits of a2 have smooth seeds of light green color the morphological and genetic diversities were determined between a1 and a2 previously citroides rootstocks at the s3 stage were selected from the gene pool at the vegetable growing and breeding department faculty of agriculture selcuk university the other two rootstocks were open pollinated bottle gourd lagenaria siceraria rootstock a3 and commercial hybrid rootstock tz148 a4 cucurbita maxima duchesne x cucurbita moschata duchesne which is widely used in watermelon cultivation crimson tide which is widely used as a commercial watermelon cultivar was used as the scion for rootstocks a total of 25 experimental treatments including five different plant materials a1 a2 a3 a4 rootstock grafted with crimson tide variety and non grafted control crimson tide k1 as the main plots and five different plant pan coefficients kcp1 1 00 kcp2 0 75 kcp3 0 50 kcp4 0 35 measured wetted area percentage and kcp5 0 00 rain fed as sub plots were carried out according to the factorial experimental design in randomized blocks with three replications all the plots except kcp5 rain fed were irrigated at a 7 day interval the experimental treatments and abbreviations are presented in table 3 2 5 agricultural practices about 2 3 days before planting the seedlings 200 kg ha dap diammonium phosphate fertilizer was applied and mixed into the soil using a rotary tiller in addition pure nitrogen fertilizer 50 kg ha was applied with a drip irrigation system the seed sowing of watermelon rootstocks and the scion crimson tide cultivar and the grafting process were carried out by a commercial company fide san antalya turkey grafted and non grafted watermelon seedlings were planted on 12th may 2017 and 14th may 2018 during the vegetation period disease and pest management was carried out as required the fruits were harvested thrice in 2017 16th and 22nd august and 6th september and twice in 2018 13th and 28th august 2 6 calculation of irrigation water and plant water consumption the amount of irrigation water applied to the experimental treatments was determined using eq 1 1 i e p k c p a where i amount of irrigation water liters a plot area m2 ep cumulative amount of water that evaporated in seven days from the class a pan mm kcp plant pan coefficient kcp1 1 00 kcp2 0 75 kcp3 0 50 kcp4 0 35 measured wetted area percentage kcp5 0 00 the consumption of water by plants was determined using eq 2 james 1988 2 e t i r d p c p r f δ s where et evapotranspiration mm i amount of irrigation water mm r effective rainfall mm dp deep percolation mm cp capillary rise mm rf runoff mm δs changes in water content mm in this equation the values of i r and dp were calculated from the amount of irrigation water applied from the portable climate station that was placed in the experimental area and by gravimetric method from soil samples taken with an auger at depths of 90 and 120 cm before and after irrigation respectively the soil of the experimental site was deep and there was no problem related to drainage and salinity at the site therefore as there was no capillary rise due to groundwater the cp value was not taken into account in the calculations the value of δs was obtained from measurements of soil moisture that were determined by the gravimetric method at soil depths of 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm since the drip irrigation system was planned and operated accurately no losses occurred due to surface flow and thus the rf value was excluded from the calculations 2 7 yield response factor ky wp and iwp the relationships between the reduction of relative et and relative fruit yield were determined using eq 3 doorenbos and kassam 1979 3 3 1 y a y m k y 1 e t a e t m where ya actual yield kg ha ym maximum yield kg ha ky yield response factor eta actual et mm etm maximum et mm the water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp were calculated as fruit yield kg ha divided by seasonal et and total seasonal irrigation water applied to a unit area m3 ha respectively 2 8 evaluation of data the test of homogeneity f test was used to determine whether the combined analysis of variance could be applied to the yield and quality parameters for both the trial years 2017 and 2018 the results of this test indicated that the error variances of the yield and quality parameters were not homogeneous across the trial years due to which both the trial years were evaluated separately in order to determine the differences in yield and quality parameters the data obtained from the treatments were subjected to the statistical tests analysis of variance anova and duncan s multiple comparison test the results of the characteristics were recorded as statistically significant at the 5 significance level the statistical tests were performed using the statistical program spss version 22 0 the results of the yield and yield components were evaluated collectively by the principal component analysis pca using the statistical program jmp version 10 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation et and fruit yield the total amounts of irrigation water applied and evapotranspiration values obtained from the treatments are presented in table 4 the total amounts of irrigation water applied to the plots were in the range of 20 552 mm in 2017 and 25 564 mm in 2018 for the development of seedling 20 0 and 25 0 mm water was applied to all the plots during planting in 2017 and 2018 respectively the irrigation programs were started on 26th june in 2017 and 28th june in 2018 after starting the scheduled irrigation all the treatments except i0 rain fed were irrigated nine times each year irrigation was completed on 22nd august in 2017 and 21st august in 2018 the amount of precipitation during the vegetative period of watermelon may september was 87 1 and 63 2 mm in 2017 and 2018 respectively most of the precipitation during the vegetative period occurred between the dates of seedling planting 12th and 14th may and scheduled irrigation 26th and 28th june in both the trial years et values varied between 155 and 636 mm in 2017 and between 125 and 596 mm in 2018 in 2017 the highest et value was observed in the a1 rootstock and in the a1i100 treatment where the plant pan coefficient was 1 00 on the other hand in 2018 the highest et values were observed in plants grafted onto a4 rootstock and in the a4i100 treatments where the plant pan coefficient was 1 00 table 4 in previous studies the highest et value of watermelon was reported to be 764 mm simsek et al 2004 677 mm kirnak and dogan 2009 475 mm camoğlu et al 2010 521 mm özmen et al 2014 506 mm kuscu et al 2015 and 449 mm duraktekin et al 2018 in the present study the highest observed et values were similar to some of the previous studies but higher or lower than the others it is hypothesized that these differences may be caused by factors such as climate soil characteristics irrigation management watermelon variety and cultivation techniques the analysis of variance of the fruit yields indicated that rootstocks and irrigation levels significantly influenced the yield with 95 reliability during both the years although no significant interactions between rootstock x irrigation level and yield were observed in 2017 statistically significant interactions p 0 05 were observed in 2018 the total variance could be largely explained by irrigation levels during both the experimental years fig 4 no statistically significant difference was observed between the plants grafted onto the a1 a2 and a4 where the highest yield was obtained in 2017 a significant increase in the yields up to 30 was achieved in grafted plants compared to the non grafted control plant except for plants that were grafted onto the a3 rootstocks table 5 huitron et al 2007 while studying the effects of different watermelon rootstocks on the yield observed that citrullus lanatus var cidroides produced a higher yield 79 7 t ha than the other rootstocks they suggested that citroides could be used as a rootstock for watermelon cultivation in the second year of the experiment the highest yield was obtained from plants that were grafted onto the a4 rootstock 60 6 t ha which was statistically different from the other treatments with 95 reliability the yield increased by 25 40 in plants grafted onto a4 a1 and a2 rootstocks compared to the control watermelons table 6 özmen et al 2014 and mohamed et al 2012 reported that the use of rootstock increased the yield in watermelon and that grafted plants produced higher yields compared to the non grafted plants no significant differences were observed between the plants that were grafted onto the a3 rootstock and control group during both the trial years this result indicates that grafting of the crimson tide cultivar onto bottle gourd rootstock did not have any effect on the yield under arid and semi arid climatic conditions and that this grafting combination was not suitable for such areas contrary to our findings some researchers have reported that watermelon plants grafted onto bottle gourd rootstocks produced higher yield khankahdani et al 2012 yetisir and sari 2018 this discrepancy in results may be attributed to factors such as climatic conditions cultivation techniques and particularly rootstock scion compatibility the bottle gourds had become the preferred rootstock for watermelon because of some advantages such as diseases resistance besides bottle gourds have some advantages and several disadvantages such as bottle gourds tend to have an extensive but shallow root system interspecific cucurbita hybrids tend to have a deep root system this along with their drought tolerance explains why they have recently gained favor over bottle gourd as a rootstock for watermelon king et al 2010 similarly in our study the plants grafted on hybrids cucurbita a4 produced better performance than the plants grafted on bottle gourds under both drought stressed and non stressed conditions according to results of duncan s multiple comparison test the treatments a4i100 with the highest fruit yield of 93 9 t ha a1i100 and a4i75 were classified in the same group considering the interaction between rootstock and irrigation level and were statistically significantly different from the other treatments p 0 05 table 6 different irrigation levels revealed varying effects on yield the highest yield was obtained at the i100 irrigation level and yield decreased with increasing water stress however when tables 5 and 6 were evaluated together considering the average of both the trial years the yield loss at the i75 irrigation level compared to i100 was only 10 thus 25 of water saving was achieved at the i75 irrigation level compared to the i100 at the cost of only a 10 loss in yield several researchers working on water yield relationships have reported that water stress causes significant yield losses in watermelon wang et al 2004 proietti et al 2008 rouphael et al 2008 kirnak and dogan 2009 the graphic that was prepared considering the average of experimental years to demonstrate the effects of different rootstocks and application of different irrigation levels are presented in fig 5 as seen from this figure fruit yield also decreased in plants grafted onto either different rootstocks or control groups in parallel to the decrease in irrigation level the yield values obtained from the i75 and i50 irrigation levels in plants grafted onto the a4 rootstock and i75 irrigation levels in plants grafted onto a1 and a2 rootstocks were higher than those observed at the i100 irrigation level in the non grafted control group fig 5 this result indicates that comparable yield can be obtained even in water stress conditions by using appropriate rootstock it is evident that the effect of water stress can be reduced by grafting and that higher yields can be obtained in grafted plants of watermelon than non grafted plants under full irrigation conditions when the average yield of plants grafted on a1 and a2 which included statistically the same group in both years was compared a1 produced more yield with 62 7 and 55 4 t ha than a2 for both years respectively when irrigation levels in the non stressed i100 and slightly stressed i75 were considered a1 produced more yield than a2 for both years when it comes to stressed treatments such as i50 and i35 a2 produced more yield than a1 it can be concluded that a2 rootstocks have potential to produce more yield under severe water stress conditions than a1 or even hybrid a4 rootstock these findings are important for the management and sustainability of water resources in agriculture for arid and semi arid regions which have limited water resources therefore some researchers have recommended that fecund cultivars should be grown by grafting onto drought tolerant rootstocks having a substantial root system in order to reduce losses in production under drought conditions and increase the efficiency of water use garcia sanchez et al 2007 satisha et al 2007 3 2 yield components analysis of the variance of the number of fruits per plant mean fruit weight fruit height fruit width wp and iwp rootstocks and irrigation levels showed a statistically significant variance table 7 and irrigation levels accounted for most of the total variance during both the trial years fig 4 considering the different applications of rootstocks the highest number of fruits per plant was observed in plants that were grafted onto a2 rootstock 2 40 fruits plant in the first year and 1 97 fruits plant in the second year there was no statistically significant difference between a1 a2 and a4 rootstocks yetisir and sari 2003 grafted the crimson tide cultivar onto different rootstocks and reported that some rootstocks had a positive effect on the number of fruits in this study the application of different irrigation levels significantly influenced the number of fruits and although the highest number of fruits per plant was obtained from the i100 plot it was not statistically different from that obtained using the i75 irrigation level rouphael et al 2008 obtained 1 82 watermelon fruits per plant under full irrigation conditions but the number of fruits decreased in parallel with an increase in water stress statistically significant differences were observed between the treatments in terms of mean fruit weight fruit width and fruit length and watermelons grafted onto the a4 rootstock produced the best performance table 7 there were no statistically significant differences in mean fruit weight fruit length and fruit width between the i100 i75 and i50 irrigation levels in 2017 in 2018 the highest fruit weight and fruit width were obtained from the i100 plots which were statistically different from the other irrigation levels the fruit sizes across the i100 i75 and i50 irrigation levels were statistically similar in 2017 when the values of wp and iwp were analyzed together with the treatments and the years they ranged from 8 0 to 15 5 kg m3 and 13 6 to 25 4 kg m3 for wp and iwp respectively the wp of watermelon ranged from 12 68 to 15 66 kg m3 according to the treatments kuscu et al 2015 in a study conducted in italy the wp of watermelon was between 9 3 and 10 1 kg m3 in non grafted plants and between 13 2 and 14 5 kg m3 in grafted plants depending on the treatments and higher values of wp were obtained in both deficit irrigated and grafted plots rouphael et al 2008 abdelkhalik et al 2019 examined the water yield relationships in watermelon under deficit irrigation conditions and reported that iwp values of watermelon varied between 11 86 and 21 28 kg m3 alkhader et al 2019 studied the effect of different nitrogen applications on the yield and quality of watermelon in jordan and reported that iwp values varied between 12 65 and 28 83 kg m3 depending on the experimental years and plots in our study the control group and a3 rootstock showed lower iwp values than a1 a2 and a4 rootstocks according to these results in order to achieve high iwp values a1 a2 and a4 rootstocks can help producers to save water in watermelon production under arid and semi arid conditions such as in konya when iwp values were examined in terms of irrigation levels they were observed to generally increase with a decrease in the amount of irrigation water applied the highest values of iwp were obtained at the i50 and i35 irrigation levels despite variation between rootstocks this study aimed to obtain the highest yield from low water in arid and semi arid areas with limited water resources therefore if watermelon is grafted onto a1 a2 and a4 rootstocks and irrigation water is applied at the i50 level considerable savings in irrigation water could be achieved in arid and semi arid areas and the resultant reduction in pressure on water resources could facilitate the irrigation of more areas using the available water when the experimental years rootstocks and irrigation levels were evaluated together the ranges of fruit rind thickness ssc and ph of fruit juice were 8 6 18 2 mm 7 8 10 8 brix and 5 08 5 38 respectively table 8 in general the fruit rind thickness decreased in plants that were grafted onto citron watermelon rootstocks and in the rain fed treatments leskovar et al 2004 reported that different irrigation levels had significant effects on fruit rind thickness and the highest rind thickness in watermelon 11 2 mm was obtained under conditions of full irrigation conditions on the other hand the rind thickness of fruits cultivated under deficit irrigation in different conditions was between 12 and 17 mm and the use of irrigation had significant effects on the fruit rind thickness in watermelon erdem and yuksel 2003 ssc values increased in fruits harvested from grafted plants during both the years the lowest ssc values were obtained at i100 irrigation levels with an increase in treatments with limited irrigation table 8 different gourd rootstocks had a significant effect on ssc with higher ssc values being observed with the use of gourd rootstocks karaca et al 2012 two different varieties of watermelon were grafted onto different rootstocks and the highest ssc values were obtained from non grafted plots davis and perkins veazie 2005 it is thought that the difference observed in the different studies could be due to the use of different rootstocks the ph values of the fruits obtained from the grafted plants were observed to be higher than the non grafted ones on the other hand while the ph values remained statistically similar across irrigation levels in 2017 significant differences in the ph values were observed in 2018 p 0 01 and higher ph values were observed in treatments with severe water stress pinto et al 2017 reported that the highest ph value in watermelon was 6 23 in addition kyriacou et al 2016 while examining the effects of grafting harvest maturity and post harvest storage in watermelon reported a ph of 5 55 the effects of irrigation regimes on fruit quality were investigated by proietti et al in 2008 and no significant differences in the ph values were reported in mini watermelons turhan et al 2012 analyzed the effect of different rootstocks on fruit quality fruit characteristics and yield in watermelon and reported that the ph values varied between 5 31 and 5 51 with statistically significant differences between the applications at the 5 significance level when the present study was compared with previous studies it was observed that the ph values of watermelon generally varied between 5 and 6 and that watermelon juice showed acidic properties ssc and ph values of the fruits obtained in the study were higher for the grafted plant in our study the reason for this is that grafted plants have a stronger root system and accordingly intakes water and nutrients better this contributes positively in the accumulation of ssc and dry mater in fruits accordingly the sugar content of the fruits increases also in grafted plants increasing the sugar content in the grafted plants decreases the acidity so ph increases accordingly increased ph and ssc in watermelon tissue are generally considered as indicators of fruit ripening corey and schlimme 1988 in our study higher ph values were obtained in severe stressed treatment i35 and rain fed treatment i0 thus it can be said water stress caused early fruit ripening accordingly higher ph values in grafted plants may be associated with early ripening in fruits the effect of decreased ph on sweetness might be perceived by consumers as the loss of quality due to elevated acidity soteriou et al 2014 therefore the lower ph values in fruits may negatively affects consumer perception of the taste in our study lowest ph values were obtained in non grafted treatments the fruits obtained from grafted plants may be preferred by consumers in terms of higher ph and ssc values l chroma c and hue ho values showed significant differences in both rootstock and irrigation levels in terms of fruit flesh color the parameter l expresses the amount of lightness or darkness in color ranging from 0 black to 100 white therefore it can be said that fruits obtained from a1 a2 and a3 rootstocks had lighter fruit flesh color than those obtained from the a4 rootstock table 8 the c value in the color sphere indicates the intensity of the color in other words the lightness of the chroma color is an indicator of how much the saturation of color changes without changing the darkness in general the color becomes brighter with an increase in chroma value from these findings it can be said that the fruits obtained from a1 a2 and a4 rootstocks had brighter pulp than a3 rootstock and non grafted control group fruits the hue value which is an expression of the angle of the color varies according to the point where the color is located in red green and blue a hue value of 0 indicates the red color while a value of 90 indicates the yellow color 180 indicates the green color and 270 indicates blue color as the hue value increases numerically the color turns yellow accordingly it could be suggested that the fruit flesh obtained from a1 a3 and non grafted control groups had a darker red color than fruits obtained from the a4 rootstock table 8 3 3 water yield relationships the et measured according to different rootstock applications and different irrigation levels and fruit yields obtained from the treatments is graphically presented in fig 6 as the average of both the experimental years a logarithmic relationship was observed between the water consumption and fruit yield in the control group plants and those grafted onto a2 rootstock with 99 reliability fig 6a c in plants that were grafted onto a1 a3 and a4 rootstocks strong linear relationships were observed between the yield and water consumption p 0 01 fig 6b d e in all the applications the equations and determination coefficients that define the relationship between water consumption and fruit yield are mentioned in the corresponding figure generally studies on water yield relationships in watermelon reported linear relationships between water consumption and yield kirnak and dogan 2009 camoğlu et al 2010 kuscu et al 2015 in order to determine the effect of a proportional decrease in the seasonal water consumption of watermelon on the proportional decrease in fruit yield yield response factors ky were calculated considering the averages of the two experimental years the ky values varied between 0 91 and 1 11 depending on different rootstocks fig 7 the value of ky was less than 1 0 in the control group and a2 rootstock fig 7a c and greater than 1 0 in the other treatments fig 7b d e as plants with ky values greater than 1 0 are considered to be sensitive to water stress doorenbos and kassam 1979 a4 a1 and a3 rootstocks were found to be sensitive to deficit irrigation although the value of ky was less than 1 0 in treatments grafted onto rootstock a2 and the control group seasonal ky was calculated as 1 12 when all the trial treatments were evaluated together fig 7 f this result indicates that watermelon is sensitive to deficit irrigation under arid and semi arid conditions 3 4 principal component analyses as this study aimed to interpret the yield and quality parameters together the data obtained were subjected to the principal component analysis pca from the pca the first two components pc1 and pc2 with an eigenvalue greater than 1 0 accounted for 82 5 of the total variance table 9 in order to obtain accurate results and good interpretation of the pca the first two components need to account for at least 25 of the total variance mohammadi and prasanna 2003 seymen et al 2019 therefore the significant contribution of the first two components toward the total variance observed in this study indicates that the yield and quality parameters can be explained strongly by pca pc1 which accounted for 58 3 of the total variance showed a significant positive correlation with fruit yield a number of fruits per plant mean fruit weight fruit length fruit width and fruit rind thickness on the other hand pc2 which accounted for 24 2 of the total variance displayed a significant positive correlation with ssc ph and c and negative correlation with ho angle in the loading plot chart fig 8 a which was drawn using pc1 and pc2 and showed the relationship between yield and quality characteristics an angle between the two vectors of less than 90 showed a positive correlation while an angle greater than 90 showed a negative correlation and an angle equal to 90 indicated no significant relationship based on these findings strong positive correlations were observed between physical parameters such as fruit yield fruit number fruit weight fruit height fruit width and rind thickness likewise while there was a significant positive correlation between ssc ph and chroma values in fruit flesh a negative correlation was observed between these parameters with l and hue angle in the fruit flesh several researchers have used pca loading plot graphs in genetic classification and for the evaluation of fruit yield and quality parameters and have reported valuable results di vaio et al 2015 kyriacou et al 2016 seymen et al 2019 in our study the loading plot chart produced meaningful results while evaluating the yield and quality parameters similarly the score plot chart also made considerable contributions in evaluating the experimental subjects in terms of yield and yield components fig 8b four different areas appeared in the score plot chart that was drawn using pc1 and pc2 generally treatments such as non stressed i100 moderately stressed i75 and severely stressed i50 were included in the positive area of pc1 extremely stressed i35 treatment and non irrigated i0 treatment were included in the negative region of pc1 and did not perform well in terms of the yield components when the positive regions of both pc1 and pc2 right upper region of pc1 were evaluated i100 and i75 irrigation levels in plants grafted onto a4 and a1 rootstocks as well as i100 irrigation levels in plants grafted onto a3 rootstock showed high fruit yield fruit number and fruit features such as weight size width and rind thickness it was evident that the i75 irrigation level was a crucial application for saving water in arid and semi arid areas with limited water resources especially in plants grafted onto a1 and a4 rootstock when investigating the area where pc1 was negative and pc2 was positive experimental subjects of the i35 irrigation level where severe water stress was applied stood out with high ssc and ph values 4 conclusion this two year study demonstrated that the highest yield was achieved at i100 and that the yield decreased with an increase in water stress considering the average of both trial years the loss in yield at the irrigation level of i75 where 25 deficit irrigation was applied was only 10 compared to the i100 irrigation level in other words 136 mm of water was saved with the application of the i75 irrigation level this finding is significant for the protection of water resources and sustainable water management in agriculture in arid and semi arid areas that have limited water resources in terms of different rootstock applications tz148 and citron watermelon rootstocks had higher fruit yield than gourd rootstock and non grafted control group in this context the use of the correct rootstock is a crucial factor in order to obtain high fruit yield in watermelon according to the pca analysis where the data obtained from experimental subjects were evaluated both separately and collectively while considering fruit yield and other yield components tz148 was identified as the superior rootstock on the other hand the performance of citron watermelon rootstocks was observed to be close to the tz148 rootstock in terms of fruit yield some yield components water and irrigation water productivity in our study citroides1 performed better in non stress water regimes while citroides2 performed better in severe water stress conditions therefore considering the environmental conditions such as water availability it can be concluded that the use of suitable citron watermelon rootstocks for these conditions provides advantages over other rootstocks it is predicted that citron watermelons will perform better as watermelon rootstocks than commercial varieties in case of ongoing self breeding programs on citron watermelon rootstocks and obtain the heterosis effect in the hybrid rootstock breeding stage in the future therefore it is obvious that the use of citron watermelons in rootstock breeding programs and the use of a watermelon rootstock will provide great advantages for both producers and consumers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10489,fertilizer along with water drip irrigation is the process of fertilizer entering to the field with water a new technology of combination with irrigation and fertilizer product of the combination with a precise and accurate irrigation and fertilizer the filed experiments were conducted at two sites in hei longjiang province respectively in 2015 and 2016 to compare the effect of precision fertilization management and traditional management on maize plant height aboveground biomass leaf area index and yields for two years the precision fertilization management reduce the nutrient supply and did not affect maize growth and reduce grain yield in 2015 the precision fertilization management reduce the nitrogen and phosphorus supply by 8 and 10 but increase potassium supply by 15 in 2016 the precision fertilization management reduce the nitrogen phosphorus and potassium supply by 9 25 and 17 the maize plant height leaf area index aboveground biomass and yield did not significantly decrease due to the decrease in fertilizer application as a result precision fertilization management increased the nutrients and rainfall use efficiency and net profit thus proving fertigation help to increase maize production which is of great significance for increasing food production keywords water drip irrigation fertigation nutrient balance 1 introduction at present irrigation and fertilization have become a routine measure for crop fertilization in some countries taking israel as an example this technology has been adopted in fruit trees flowers greenhouse crops and most field crops in the country which has achieved significant results and has become a world wide israeli agriculture the main supporting technology of recognized achievements with the strengthening of the concept of sustainable development in people s consciousness the prominent role of water drip irrigation and fertilization in resource utilization and environmental protection has attracted more and more scholars attention neilsen et al 2005 ayars et al 2006 sneh 2005 ayars et al 2001 alva and paramasiram 2002 dasberg and bresler 1985 goldberg et al 1976 modern water drip irrigation technology started in israel around 1960 after that the united states australia south africa and other countries have successively carried out research and application in this area and promoted the application in some other parts of the world the water drip irrigation area in the world has increased very rapidly it increased by 63 in the five years from 1981 to 1986 increased by 329 between 1981 and 1991 and is expected to reach 300 million hms in 2000 in israel more than 75 of the irrigated area has adopted this technology in developing countries the development of water drip irrigation is also fast such as india mexico and the area of water drip irrigation has reached more than 60 000hm2 since 1971 five international academic conferences on water drip irrigation have been held the application results were exchanged during water drip irrigation the irrigation water only wets part of the soil due to water restrictions the crop root system is also mainly distributed in this area and nutrients outside this area are difficult for the crop root system to absorb so fertilizer the effect of the application method is limited at this time the effect of fertilizer strip application is better than fertilizer application in israel for annual crops trying to inject fertilizer into irrigation water has achieved significant results for perennial crops under water drip irrigation fertilizers are initially applied during the rainy season and fertilizers are brought into the root zone with the help of rainfall later research has found that for perennial crops irrigation and fertilization can also be used development of facility grown vegetable and flower production the increasing requirements for water and fertilizer regulation technology have provided a market for the application of irrigation and fertilization technology the huge application potential shown by this technology is the driving force for its research shani and sapir 1986 bresler 1977 baroyosef and sheikholsami 1976 baroyosef and sagiv 1985 with the rapid development of the rural economy and the continuous improvement of people s living standards domestic greenhouses and corresponding supporting irrigation and cultivation technologies have developed rapidly greenhouse water and fertilizer coupling technology is a key technology for the development of high yield efficient and high quality agriculture to obtain higher output value of agricultural water in the planting area shandong province has researched the water and fertilizer coupling technology of tomatoes in the modern greenhouse in the demonstration area and achieved significant results in modern greenhouses the cultivation of crops takes soilless cultivation tanks as the root system the main environment for growth is to use the planting point as the crop receiving nutrition point that is to plant the crop at the planting point in the cultivation tank the system will determine the final irrigation amount and the overall impact of the timing system and the environmental control system according to the requirements of the crop irrigation time the system uses a comprehensive index ec value to control its water and fertilizer fertilizer is a vegan chemical fertilizer formulated according to a certain ratio containing 16 major elements and also contains a variety of trace elements fertilizing with tomato water drip irrigation for example under the condition of 2 5 plants m2 25 4 l of nutrient solution can harvest 1 kg of tomatoes and each plant produces an average of 20 kg per year the amount of nutrient solution required per hectare is 12 700 m3 the yield of tomatoes per hectare is 500 000 kg and the nutrient solution per cubic meter contains about 0 8 kg of fertilizer moreover the optimal state of water and fertilizer is achieved hackiey 2001 charles and thomas 1999 moncturro et al 1999 thompson and doerge 1995 neilsen and parchomchuk 1994a baroyosef and imas 1995 neilsen and parchomchuk 1994b baroyosef 1991 in recent years there have been some research reports on water drip irrigation and fertilization technology combining water drip irrigation and fertilization feng shaoyuan and others carried out water and fertilizer coupling effect experiments on cotton and the results showed that it was 23 3 28 7 more water saving than conventional irrigation under the condition of irrigation volume the efficiency of fertilizer can be promoted the results of water drip irrigation fertilization tests on tomatoes and cucumbers by yue bing qiao liwen wu xingbo etc also show that the technology has the advantages of saving water and reducing fertilizer increasing yield and income nitrogen fertilizer utilization rate is 58 9 and nitrogen fertilizer utilization rate is 27 6 when crop yields are similar or the same water drip irrigation and fertilization can save 25 4 of chemical fertilizer compared with flush fertilization generally investment of 130 250 yuan per mu is saved liping lu and others recently carried out research on the application technology of fertilization for greenhouse cucumber water drip irrigation baroyosef et al 1995 merry 2003 li et al 2003 bne and dudley 2003 china is a country with severe water shortage and drought is one of the main factors restricting china s agricultural development the effective utilization rate of water is only 30 40 and the capacity of food production per m3 is only about 1 kg advanced irrigation and water drip irrigation the proportion of water irrigation in china s total irrigated area is still very small and ground irrigation is still used in most areas there is great potential for developing water saving irrigation and improving agricultural productivity in addition to water the lack of nutrients and the unsynchronized supply of water and fertilizer are problems that are often encountered in restricting the development of agricultural production in china water drip irrigation and fertilization can effectively regulate the supply of water and nutrients to crops and have great application prospects in china especially in northwest and north china as this area occupies 52 2 of china s land area and arable land area accounts for about 30 of the country the use of water drip irrigation and fertilization technology can not only save the region s precious water resources but also make some original uses land that is not suitable for planting with conventional irrigation and fertilization methods such as wasteland and even desert planting has become a reality israel s development of the southern negev desert is a successful example in addition in hilly and gully areas with uneven terrain severe soil erosion and low soil fertility conventional irrigation and fertilization measures are difficult to achieve satisfactory results and water drip irrigation fertilization technology can achieve significant results according to a survey by china agricultural university in a vegetable greenhouse in shandong province the fertilizer utilization rate is less than 10 while in israel due to the use of water drip irrigation fertilization technology the utilization rate of n fertilizer can reach more than 80 in the tropical and southern subtropical regions of china due to the needs of many crops the amount of fertilizer needed are larger using fertigation technology will help to increase efficiency of these crops thus fertigation technology in china has a broad application prospects smith 2004 fertilizer intemational group 2004 lamm et al 2004 hatfield and fuchs 2006 kee and kwong 2005 2 irrigation and fertilization technology 2 1 the concept of irrigation and fertilization technology irrigation and fertilization refers to the process of fertilizer entering the field with irrigation water it is a new technology combining fertilization technology and irrigation technology it is the product of the combination of precise fertilization and precision irrigation water drip irrigation fertilization technology is based on the nutrition of nutrients in each stage of crop growth demand and the supply of soil nutrients a fertilization method that accurately adds and uniformly applies fertilizer near the crop root system and is directly absorbed and utilized by the root system the use of irrigation and fertilization technology can easily adjust the amount and concentration of nutrients in irrigation water it can adapt to the needs of plants and climatic conditions it can greatly improve the utilization rate of fertilizers improve the effectiveness of nutrients it can also greatly save time transportation labor and fuel costs and implement precise fertilization the principle of irrigation and fertilization is to provide nutrients according to the absorption law of the crop and how much is needed 2 2 irrigation and fertilization methods according to different control methods irrigation and fertilization can be divided into two categories one is proportional fertilizer which is characterized by supplying fertilizer to the irrigation water with a constant nutrient ratio and the rate of fertilizer supply is proportional to the water drip irrigation rate nutrient concentration of irrigation water such as venturi injection method and fertilizer pump method the other is the quantitative fertilizer supply also known as total control its characteristics are that the nutrient concentration changes during the entire fertilization process the fertilization amount is generally expressed in kilograms per hectare for example the bypass fertilizer tank method is shown in fig 1 the proportional fertilizer supply system is expensive but it can achieve precise fertilization mainly for soils with poor fertilizer retention capacity such as light weight and sandy quality the quantitative fertilizer system requires less investment and simple operation but cannot achieve precise fertilization which is suitable for fertile soil 2 3 distribution characteristics of water and nutrients in soil under water drip irrigation and fertilization the characteristic of water drip irrigation is that water enters the soil from a point water source and then diffuses in all directions soil type water dripper flow and the amount of water per irrigation will affect the distribution of water in the soil for a soil the water dripper flow the increase will cause the vertical depth of the water wet soil to become shallower and the radius with the water dripper as the center of the circle becomes larger given the amount of irrigation water and water dripper flow the moisture wet depth in the sand will be deeper than the loam but the radius will become smaller the frequency of fertilization is high and the soil moisture content does not change much which is beneficial to the crops to absorb water and nutrients and can improve the utilization rate of fertilizers especially phosphorus as the distance from the water dripper to the wet edge increases the concentration of non adsorbed ions such as no3 also increases the wetted area of loam soil has a greater concentration gradient of ions than sandy soil and a larger flowrate of the water dripper has a lower concentration gradient the mobility of adsorbed nutrients in soil is much lower than that of non adsorbed nutrients and nutrients are more easily adsorbed in clay than sandy soil so the mobility of nutrients in soil with fine texture is slower than that with coarse texture according to research the distribution of no3 and water in the soil is similar while the distribution of phosphorus in sand and clay is 11 cm and 6 cm from the water dripper respectively increasing the flow of the water dripper the further away from the water dripper the higher the concentration of no3 which is easy to accumulate at the edge of humid soil but phosphorus does not increase for example when irrigating with saline salt quickly accumulates to the concentration of harmful crops under water drip irrigation conditions despite the high exchangeable potassium in the soil the maximum potassium of the crop during the absorption period potassium must still be supplemented by irrigation water because exchangeable potassium enters the solution from the solid phase of the soil and affects the absorption of potassium by the crop when potassium fertilizer is applied the concentration of potassium in the solution in the soil increases which increases the amount of potassium absorbed 3 practical application 3 1 experimental site thefield experiment was performed in 2015 and 2016 at yi an county heilongjiang province in 2015 the experiment site conducted at yi an provincial agricultural science and technology park astp and in 2016 the experiment site conducted at jianming village jmv shangyou township the region receives annually more than 2714 sunshine hours and 468 mm of precipitation the average annual temperature is 3 2 the effective accumulated temperature 10 is 2687 2 there are 429 and 326 mm of rainfall during the growing season from may through september respectively in 2015 and 2016 fig 2 showed the distribution of monthly rainfall during growing season in 2015 and 2016 maize is the staple crop for the area the primary properties of the soil are presented in table 1 3 2 experimental design and field management according to meteorological data and soil properties of the field plot the precision fertilization management model was used to work out the management scheme the traditional management scheme as the control the two maize management scheme were showed in table 2 urea 46 monoammonium phosphate 60 and potassium chloride 55 are used for nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizer respectively compared with the farmers traditional scheme the system management scheme decreased the n input by 20 kg ha 1 p2o5 input by 11 kg ha 1 and increased k2o input by 11 kg ha 1 in 2015 at astp site and decreased the n input by 19 5 kg ha 1 p2o5 input by 33 kg ha 1and k2o input 18 kg ha 1 3 3 field sampling and laboratory analysis maize growth stages from seedling to maturity were recorded such as seedling stage jointing stage tasseling stage filling stage and maturity at each growth stage plant samples of 1 m2 per plot were collected by hand to measure aboveground biomass and leaf area index leaf area index was calculated according to the total amount of leaf area per sampling area leaf area was calculated using leaf length maximum width 0 75 montgomery 1911 leaf length and maximum width were measured manually with a ruler the plant samples were divided into leaves stems and ears and enzymatically deactivated at 105 for 30 min oven dried at 75 for 72 h and then weighed for aboveground biomass grain yield and yield components were determined by harvesting 20 m2 of plants per plot at maturity nutrients use efficiency were calculated as nue y nfer pue y pfer kue y kfer where nue pue and kue are the nitrogen use efficiency phosphorus use efficiency and potassium use efficiency kg kg 1 y is the maize grain yield kg ha 1 nfer pfer and kfer are the amount of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium applied kg ha 1 the rainfall use efficiency was calculated as rue y r where rue is the rainfall use efficiency kg ha 1 mm 1 y is the grain yield kg ha 1 r is the rainfall fell during the growing season from may to september mm the gross profit due to n fertilizer was calculated according to the following equation gross profit yield grain price fertilizer price fertilizer rate prices of the local market were 1 0 yuan kg 1 grain 2 8 yuan kg 1 urea 3 4 yuan kg 1kcl and 3 2 yuan kg 1 monoammonium phosphate the water electricity and pesticide costs were not considered because the cost of the two scheme was consistent 3 4 the precision nutrient management decision model description 3 4 1 total nutrient requirement calculation nutrient management is based on principle of nutrient balance the total amount of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium applied to achieve the yield target was calculated according to the nutrient demand of maize through the whole growth stage the amount of fertilizer supplied from the soil and the fertilizer use efficiency in the current season the calculation process is as follows tnr n nur n ss n fnue tnr p nur p ss p fpue tnr k nur k ss k fkue where tnr n tnr p tnr k are the total amount of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium required to achieve the yield target respectively nur n nur p nur k are the total amount of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium that plant uptake to achieve the yield target respectively ss n ss p ss k are the supply of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium by soil fnue fpue and fkue are the use efficiency of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium nur n gyt 100 gy n nur p gyt 100 gy p nur k gyt 100 gy k where gy n gy p gy k are the amount of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium required to produce 100 kg grains respectively ss n y0 100 gy n ss p y0 100 gy p ss k y0 100 gy k where y0 is the grain yield without fertilization which is calculated refers to quefts model janssen et al 1990 the first step is develop the relationship between soil properties and nutrition supply nus n 0 25 ph 3 6 8 orgac 15 nus p 1 0 5 ph 6 2 0 35 orgac 0 5 polsen 15 nus k 0 625 3 4 0 4 ph 400 exchk 2 0 9 orgac 15 where orgac is the soil organic carbon content polsen is the soil available phosphorus content exchk is the soil exchangeable potassium content the second step is establish the relationship between the potential fertilizer supply of soil and the actual uptake of crops this consider the interactions between the nutrients the calculation process is shown in table 3 s1 and s2 are the potential supplies of nutrients 1 and 2 u1 2 stands for the actual uptake of nutrient 1 as depending on the potential supply of nutrient 2 the symbols a d and r refer to the constants in the equations of table 4 the third step is establish the relationship between the actual uptake of nutrients and yield ranges the calculation process is as follows yna 30 un 5 ynd 70 un 5 ypa 200 up 4 ypd 600 up 4 yka 30 uk 2 ykd 120 uk 2 where yna and ynd ypa and ypd yka and ykd are yields obtained when nitrogen phosphorus potassium in the crop is maximally accumulated and diluted respectively the forth step is establish the relationship between the yield range corresponding to nutrient parirwise and the final yield y12 y2a 2 y2d y2a u1 r1 y2a d1 y2d a1 y2a d1 y2d y2a u1 r1 y2a d1 2 y2d a1 y2a d1 2 y0 y12 y13 y23 y21 y31 y32 6 where y12 is the maize yield for a combination of two nutrients taking into account the yield range of the third nutrient y0 is the ultimate yield estimate for unfertilized maize on soils table 5 3 4 2 nitrogen base ratio calculation the phosphorus and potassium were supplied as basal fertilizer before sowing the nitrogen was divided into basal fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer the ratio of basal and topdressing nitrogen fertilizers is determined according to soil fertility and yield levels when the soil fertility is poor the calculation equation as follows btr n 4 y3average gyt

calculation equation as follows btr n 6 y3average gyt y3average 6 y3average gyt y3average where btr n is the ratio of basal fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer y3average is the average grain yield of the past three years kg ha 1 4 results 4 1 plant height fig 3 showed the maize plant height at different growth stages for the two treatments the result showed that the plant height in sm and tm treatment had no significant difference in 2015 in 2016 beforetasseling the plant height in sm and tm treatment had no significant difference while the plant height in sm treatment was significantly higher than tm treatment after tasseling the plant nutrition quantity demand was small at the early stage of growth period the difference of nutrition application was not cause the difference of plant height however the higher amount of nitrogen application at jointing stage increased the later plant height grow the plant height in 2016 was higher than 2015 due to the different varieties figs 4 and 5 4 2 leaf area index and aboveground biomass in 2015 and 2016 lai in sm treatment was slight higher than tm treatment after jointing stage however the difference was not significant during whole growth period the aboveground biomass data was obtained only in 2015 during the whole growth stage there was no significant difference in aboveground biomass between sm and tm treatment however at seeding and jointing stage the aboveground biomass in sm treatmentslightly higher than tm treatment because the nitrogen amount applied before sowing in tm treatment is higher than that in sm treatment however the sm treatment increased aboveground biomass during tasseling stage due to the higher nitrogen topdressing amount 4 3 yield fertilizer use efficiency and rainfall use efficiency the yield and yield component were test in 2015 and only yield was test in 2016 in 2015 sm treatment increased the maize yield by 8 and the ears length ears diameter and kernels per ear in sm

is the key point in maize cultivation management and is the main component of cost input there is no doubt that the use of precision fertilization management can increased resource utilization efficiency without reducing grain yield and increase net profit in our study the results showed that the precision fertilization management increased maize yield by 8 although the total nitrogen amount in precision fertilization management is less than traditional management the topdressing amount is larger it improves the maize growth after jointing stage in this study the ratio of basal fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer was calculated based on actual soil fertility and yield target it was more reasonably this also indicated that reducing the nitrogen rate and delaying basal nitrogen application increased the nitrogen uptake and reduced nitrogen surpluses before jointing stage also studies had shown that early nitrogen deficiencies had no impact on yield and grain quality several studies have reported that postponed and reduced basal nitrogen application could improve plant growth and nitrogen use efficiency tian et al 2018 hou et al 2019 indicated that postponing nitrogen application increased maize yield and nitrogen agronomic efficiency by 27 69 4 and 9 4 24 8 peng et al 2006 reported that reducing the total nitrogen by 30 in the crop early growth stage increased nue and increased yield slightly it is more beneficial to the maize growth to apply less fertilizer with properly distribution than to apply more fertilizer blindly inour research the optimal total nitrogen application amount is 220 kg ha 1 and 195 kg ha 1 at 2 experiment sites the soil fertility of jmc is lower than astp while the yield target will lower than astp so the nitrogen

the interaction of nutrients the quefts was a practical model that can be used to estimate nutrient requirement while accounting for the interactions among nitrogen phosphorus and potassium the quefts model was originally developed based on results of rain fed maize field experiments in suriname and kenya the model parameters should be calibrated when used in other ecological conditions however in our study the quefts model with original parameters was used to calculate soil potential supply of the nutrients and estimate the potential yield at the soil basal fertility on this basis the demand of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium were calculated in next step we should calibrated the parameters of quefts modelto improve the model precision with the experiment data for the two years the yield difference is great due to the rainfall difference during growing season the rainfall in 2016 was 24 lower than that in 2015 especially in july and august when the maize in silking and filling stage silking and filling stage is the key periods for yield formation drought in this stage will lead to serious reduced production the rue in sm treatment was higher than that in tm treatment and the rue in 2016 was higher than that in 2015 showed that the sm treatment based on the precision fertilizer management could fully raising rainfall use efficiency and it is helpful to the high efficient

10489,fertilizer along with water drip irrigation is the process of fertilizer entering to the field with water a new technology of combination with irrigation and fertilizer product of the combination with a precise and accurate irrigation and fertilizer the filed experiments were conducted at two sites in hei longjiang province respectively in 2015 and 2016 to compare the effect of precision fertilization management and traditional management on maize plant height aboveground biomass leaf area index and yields for two years the precision fertilization management reduce the nutrient supply and did not affect maize growth and reduce grain yield in 2015 the precision fertilization management reduce the nitrogen and phosphorus supply by 8 and 10 but increase potassium supply by 15 in 2016 the precision fertilization management reduce the nitrogen phosphorus and potassium supply by 9 25 and 17 the maize plant height leaf area index aboveground biomass and yield did not significantly decrease due to the decrease in fertilizer application as a result precision fertilization management increased the nutrients and rainfall use efficiency and net profit thus proving fertigation help to increase maize production which is of great significance for increasing food production keywords water drip irrigation fertigation nutrient balance 1 introduction at present irrigation and fertilization have become a routine measure for crop fertilization in some countries taking israel as an example this technology has been adopted in fruit trees flowers greenhouse crops and most field crops in the country which has achieved significant results and has become a world wide israeli agriculture the main supporting technology of recognized achievements with the strengthening of the concept of sustainable development in people s consciousness the prominent role of water drip irrigation and fertilization in resource utilization and environmental protection has attracted more and more scholars attention neilsen et al 2005 ayars et al 2006 sneh 2005 ayars et al 2001 alva and paramasiram 2002 dasberg and bresler 1985 goldberg et al 1976 modern water drip irrigation technology started in israel around 1960 after that the united states australia south africa and other countries have successively carried out research and application in this area and promoted the application in some other parts of the world the water drip irrigation area in the world has increased very rapidly it increased by 63 in the five years from 1981 to 1986 increased by 329 between 1981 and 1991 and is expected to reach 300 million hms in 2000 in israel more than 75 of the irrigated area has adopted this technology in developing countries the development of water drip irrigation is also fast such as india mexico and the area of water drip irrigation has reached more than 60 000hm2 since 1971 five international academic conferences on water drip irrigation have been held the application results were exchanged during water drip irrigation the irrigation water only wets part of the soil due to water restrictions the crop root system is also mainly distributed in this area and nutrients outside this area are difficult for the crop root system to absorb so fertilizer the effect of the application method is limited at this time the effect of fertilizer strip application is better than fertilizer application in israel for annual crops trying to inject fertilizer into irrigation water has achieved significant results for perennial crops under water drip irrigation fertilizers are initially applied during the rainy season and fertilizers are brought into the root zone with the help of rainfall later research has found that for perennial crops irrigation and fertilization can also be used development of facility grown vegetable and flower production the increasing requirements for water and fertilizer regulation technology have provided a market for the application of irrigation and fertilization technology the huge application potential shown by this technology is the driving force for its research shani and sapir 1986 bresler 1977 baroyosef and sheikholsami 1976 baroyosef and sagiv 1985 with the rapid development of the rural economy and the continuous improvement of people s living standards domestic greenhouses and corresponding supporting irrigation and cultivation technologies have developed rapidly greenhouse water and fertilizer coupling technology is a key technology for the development of high yield efficient and high quality agriculture to obtain higher output value of agricultural water in the planting area shandong province has researched the water and fertilizer coupling technology of tomatoes in the modern greenhouse in the demonstration area and achieved significant results in modern greenhouses the cultivation of crops takes soilless cultivation tanks as the root system the main environment for growth is to use the planting point as the crop receiving nutrition point that is to plant the crop at the planting point in the cultivation tank the system will determine the final irrigation amount and the overall impact of the timing system and the environmental control system according to the requirements of the crop irrigation time the system uses a comprehensive index ec value to control its water and fertilizer fertilizer is a vegan chemical fertilizer formulated according to a certain ratio containing 16 major elements and also contains a variety of trace elements fertilizing with tomato water drip irrigation for example under the condition of 2 5 plants m2 25 4 l of nutrient solution can harvest 1 kg of tomatoes and each plant produces an average of 20 kg per year the amount of nutrient solution required per hectare is 12 700 m3 the yield of tomatoes per hectare is 500 000 kg and the nutrient solution per cubic meter contains about 0 8 kg of fertilizer moreover the optimal state of water and fertilizer is achieved hackiey 2001 charles and thomas 1999 moncturro et al 1999 thompson and doerge 1995 neilsen and parchomchuk 1994a baroyosef and imas 1995 neilsen and parchomchuk 1994b baroyosef 1991 in recent years there have been some research reports on water drip irrigation and fertilization technology combining water drip irrigation and fertilization feng shaoyuan and others carried out water and fertilizer coupling effect experiments on cotton and the results showed that it was 23 3 28 7 more water saving than conventional irrigation under the condition of irrigation volume the efficiency of fertilizer can be promoted the results of water drip irrigation fertilization tests on tomatoes and cucumbers by yue bing qiao liwen wu xingbo etc also show that the technology has the advantages of saving water and reducing fertilizer increasing yield and income nitrogen fertilizer utilization rate is 58 9 and nitrogen fertilizer utilization rate is 27 6 when crop yields are similar or the same water drip irrigation and fertilization can save 25 4 of chemical fertilizer compared with flush fertilization generally investment of 130 250 yuan per mu is saved liping lu and others recently carried out research on the application technology of fertilization for greenhouse cucumber water drip irrigation baroyosef et al 1995 merry 2003 li et al 2003 bne and dudley 2003 china is a country with severe water shortage and drought is one of the main factors restricting china s agricultural development the effective utilization rate of water is only 30 40 and the capacity of food production per m3 is only about 1 kg advanced irrigation and water drip irrigation the proportion of water irrigation in china s total irrigated area is still very small and ground irrigation is still used in most areas there is great potential for developing water saving irrigation and improving agricultural productivity in addition to water the lack of nutrients and the unsynchronized supply of water and fertilizer are problems that are often encountered in restricting the development of agricultural production in china water drip irrigation and fertilization can effectively regulate the supply of water and nutrients to crops and have great application prospects in china especially in northwest and north china as this area occupies 52 2 of china s land area and arable land area accounts for about 30 of the country the use of water drip irrigation and fertilization technology can not only save the region s precious water resources but also make some original uses land that is not suitable for planting with conventional irrigation and fertilization methods such as wasteland and even desert planting has become a reality israel s development of the southern negev desert is a successful example in addition in hilly and gully areas with uneven terrain severe soil erosion and low soil fertility conventional irrigation and fertilization measures are difficult to achieve satisfactory results and water drip irrigation fertilization technology can achieve significant results according to a survey by china agricultural university in a vegetable greenhouse in shandong province the fertilizer utilization rate is less than 10 while in israel due to the use of water drip irrigation fertilization technology the utilization rate of n fertilizer can reach more than 80 in the tropical and southern subtropical regions of china due to the needs of many crops the amount of fertilizer needed are larger using fertigation technology will help to increase efficiency of these crops thus fertigation technology in china has a broad application prospects smith 2004 fertilizer intemational group 2004 lamm et al 2004 hatfield and fuchs 2006 kee and kwong 2005 2 irrigation and fertilization technology 2 1 the concept of irrigation and fertilization technology irrigation and fertilization refers to the process of fertilizer entering the field with irrigation water it is a new technology combining fertilization technology and irrigation technology it is the product of the combination of precise fertilization and precision irrigation water drip irrigation fertilization technology is based on the nutrition of nutrients in each stage of crop growth demand and the supply of soil nutrients a fertilization method that accurately adds and uniformly applies fertilizer near the crop root system and is directly absorbed and utilized by the root system the use of irrigation and fertilization technology can easily adjust the amount and concentration of nutrients in irrigation water it can adapt to the needs of plants and climatic conditions it can greatly improve the utilization rate of fertilizers improve the effectiveness of nutrients it can also greatly save time transportation labor and fuel costs and implement precise fertilization the principle of irrigation and fertilization is to provide nutrients according to the absorption law of the crop and how much is needed 2 2 irrigation and fertilization methods according to different control methods irrigation and fertilization can be divided into two categories one is proportional fertilizer which is characterized by supplying fertilizer to the irrigation water with a constant nutrient ratio and the rate of fertilizer supply is proportional to the water drip irrigation rate nutrient concentration of irrigation water such as venturi injection method and fertilizer pump method the other is the quantitative fertilizer supply also known as total control its characteristics are that the nutrient concentration changes during the entire fertilization process the fertilization amount is generally expressed in kilograms per hectare for example the bypass fertilizer tank method is shown in fig 1 the proportional fertilizer supply system is expensive but it can achieve precise fertilization mainly for soils with poor fertilizer retention capacity such as light weight and sandy quality the quantitative fertilizer system requires less investment and simple operation but cannot achieve precise fertilization which is suitable for fertile soil 2 3 distribution characteristics of water and nutrients in soil under water drip irrigation and fertilization the characteristic of water drip irrigation is that water enters the soil from a point water source and then diffuses in all directions soil type water dripper flow and the amount of water per irrigation will affect the distribution of water in the soil for a soil the water dripper flow the increase will cause the vertical depth of the water wet soil to become shallower and the radius with the water dripper as the center of the circle becomes larger given the amount of irrigation water and water dripper flow the moisture wet depth in the sand will be deeper than the loam but the radius will become smaller the frequency of fertilization is high and the soil moisture content does not change much which is beneficial to the crops to absorb water and nutrients and can improve the utilization rate of fertilizers especially phosphorus as the distance from the water dripper to the wet edge increases the concentration of non adsorbed ions such as no3 also increases the wetted area of loam soil has a greater concentration gradient of ions than sandy soil and a larger flowrate of the water dripper has a lower concentration gradient the mobility of adsorbed nutrients in soil is much lower than that of non adsorbed nutrients and nutrients are more easily adsorbed in clay than sandy soil so the mobility of nutrients in soil with fine texture is slower than that with coarse texture according to research the distribution of no3 and water in the soil is similar while the distribution of phosphorus in sand and clay is 11 cm and 6 cm from the water dripper respectively increasing the flow of the water dripper the further away from the water dripper the higher the concentration of no3 which is easy to accumulate at the edge of humid soil but phosphorus does not increase for example when irrigating with saline salt quickly accumulates to the concentration of harmful crops under water drip irrigation conditions despite the high exchangeable potassium in the soil the maximum potassium of the crop during the absorption period potassium must still be supplemented by irrigation water because exchangeable potassium enters the solution from the solid phase of the soil and affects the absorption of potassium by the crop when potassium fertilizer is applied the concentration of potassium in the solution in the soil increases which increases the amount of potassium absorbed 3 practical application 3 1 experimental site thefield experiment was performed in 2015 and 2016 at yi an county heilongjiang province in 2015 the experiment site conducted at yi an provincial agricultural science and technology park astp and in 2016 the experiment site conducted at jianming village jmv shangyou township the region receives annually more than 2714 sunshine hours and 468 mm of precipitation the average annual temperature is 3 2 the effective accumulated temperature 10 is 2687 2 there are 429 and 326 mm of rainfall during the growing season from may through september respectively in 2015 and 2016 fig 2 showed the distribution of monthly rainfall during growing season in 2015 and 2016 maize is the staple crop for the area the primary properties of the soil are presented in table 1 3 2 experimental design and field management according to meteorological data and soil properties of the field plot the precision fertilization management model was used to work out the management scheme the traditional management scheme as the control the two maize management scheme were showed in table 2 urea 46 monoammonium phosphate 60 and potassium chloride 55 are used for nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizer respectively compared with the farmers traditional scheme the system management scheme decreased the n input by 20 kg ha 1 p2o5 input by 11 kg ha 1 and increased k2o input by 11 kg ha 1 in 2015 at astp site and decreased the n input by 19 5 kg ha 1 p2o5 input by 33 kg ha 1and k2o input 18 kg ha 1 3 3 field sampling and laboratory analysis maize growth stages from seedling to maturity were recorded such as seedling stage jointing stage tasseling stage filling stage and maturity at each growth stage plant samples of 1 m2 per plot were collected by hand to measure aboveground biomass and leaf area index leaf area index was calculated according to the total amount of leaf area per sampling area leaf area was calculated using leaf length maximum width 0 75 montgomery 1911 leaf length and maximum width were measured manually with a ruler the plant samples were divided into leaves stems and ears and enzymatically deactivated at 105 for 30 min oven dried at 75 for 72 h and then weighed for aboveground biomass grain yield and yield components were determined by harvesting 20 m2 of plants per plot at maturity nutrients use efficiency were calculated as nue y nfer pue y pfer kue y kfer where nue pue and kue are the nitrogen use efficiency phosphorus use efficiency and potassium use efficiency kg kg 1 y is the maize grain yield kg ha 1 nfer pfer and kfer are the amount of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium applied kg ha 1 the rainfall use efficiency was calculated as rue y r where rue is the rainfall use efficiency kg ha 1 mm 1 y is the grain yield kg ha 1 r is the rainfall fell during the growing season from may to september mm the gross profit due to n fertilizer was calculated according to the following equation gross profit yield grain price fertilizer price fertilizer rate prices of the local market were 1 0 yuan kg 1 grain 2 8 yuan kg 1 urea 3 4 yuan kg 1kcl and 3 2 yuan kg 1 monoammonium phosphate the water electricity and pesticide costs were not considered because the cost of the two scheme was consistent 3 4 the precision nutrient management decision model description 3 4 1 total nutrient requirement calculation nutrient management is based on principle of nutrient balance the total amount of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium applied to achieve the yield target was calculated according to the nutrient demand of maize through the whole growth stage the amount of fertilizer supplied from the soil and the fertilizer use efficiency in the current season the calculation process is as follows tnr n nur n ss n fnue tnr p nur p ss p fpue tnr k nur k ss k fkue where tnr n tnr p tnr k are the total amount of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium required to achieve the yield target respectively nur n nur p nur k are the total amount of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium that plant uptake to achieve the yield target respectively ss n ss p ss k are the supply of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium by soil fnue fpue and fkue are the use efficiency of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium nur n gyt 100 gy n nur p gyt 100 gy p nur k gyt 100 gy k where gy n gy p gy k are the amount of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium required to produce 100 kg grains respectively ss n y0 100 gy n ss p y0 100 gy p ss k y0 100 gy k where y0 is the grain yield without fertilization which is calculated refers to quefts model janssen et al 1990 the first step is develop the relationship between soil properties and nutrition supply nus n 0 25 ph 3 6 8 orgac 15 nus p 1 0 5 ph 6 2 0 35 orgac 0 5 polsen 15 nus k 0 625 3 4 0 4 ph 400 exchk 2 0 9 orgac 15 where orgac is the soil organic carbon content polsen is the soil available phosphorus content exchk is the soil exchangeable potassium content the second step is establish the relationship between the potential fertilizer supply of soil and the actual uptake of crops this consider the interactions between the nutrients the calculation process is shown in table 3 s1 and s2 are the potential supplies of nutrients 1 and 2 u1 2 stands for the actual uptake of nutrient 1 as depending on the potential supply of nutrient 2 the symbols a d and r refer to the constants in the equations of table 4 the third step is establish the relationship between the actual uptake of nutrients and yield ranges the calculation process is as follows yna 30 un 5 ynd 70 un 5 ypa 200 up 4 ypd 600 up 4 yka 30 uk 2 ykd 120 uk 2 where yna and ynd ypa and ypd yka and ykd are yields obtained when nitrogen phosphorus potassium in the crop is maximally accumulated and diluted respectively the forth step is establish the relationship between the yield range corresponding to nutrient parirwise and the final yield y12 y2a 2 y2d y2a u1 r1 y2a d1 y2d a1 y2a d1 y2d y2a u1 r1 y2a d1 2 y2d a1 y2a d1 2 y0 y12 y13 y23 y21 y31 y32 6 where y12 is the maize yield for a combination of two nutrients taking into account the yield range of the third nutrient y0 is the ultimate yield estimate for unfertilized maize on soils table 5 3 4 2 nitrogen base ratio calculation the phosphorus and potassium were supplied as basal fertilizer before sowing the nitrogen was divided into basal fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer the ratio of basal and topdressing nitrogen fertilizers is determined according to soil fertility and yield levels when the soil fertility is poor the calculation equation as follows btr n 4 y3average gyt

of the past three years kg ha 1 4 results 4 1 plant height fig 3 showed the maize plant height at different growth stages for the two treatments the result showed that the plant height in sm and tm treatment had no significant difference in 2015 in 2016 beforetasseling the plant height in sm and tm treatment had no significant difference while the plant height in sm treatment was significantly higher than tm treatment after tasseling the plant nutrition quantity demand was small at the early stage of growth period the difference of nutrition application was not cause the difference of plant height however the higher amount of nitrogen application at jointing stage increased the later plant height grow the plant height in 2016 was higher than 2015 due to the different varieties figs 4 and 5 4 2 leaf area index and aboveground biomass in 2015 and 2016 lai in sm treatment was slight higher than tm treatment after jointing stage however the difference was not significant during whole growth period the aboveground biomass data was obtained only in 2015 during the whole growth stage there was no significant difference in aboveground biomass between sm and tm treatment however at seeding and jointing stage the aboveground biomass in sm treatmentslightly higher than tm treatment because the nitrogen amount applied before sowing in tm treatment is higher than that in sm treatment however the sm treatment increased aboveground biomass during tasseling stage due to the higher nitrogen topdressing amount 4 3 yield fertilizer use efficiency and rainfall use efficiency the yield and yield component were test in 2015 and only yield was test in 2016 in 2015 sm treatment increased the maize yield by 8 and the ears length ears diameter and kernels per ear in sm treatment were higher than tm treatment sm treatment increased nue and pue by 18 and 21 respectively due to the higher yield and the less nitrogen and phosphorus application the sm treatment decreased kue by 6 due to the higher potassium application the sm treatment resulted in greater rue 8 relative to the tm treatment in 2016 yield in sm is 17 higher than tm treatment sm treatment increased nue pue and kue by 28 57 and 41 compared with tm treatment respectively due to the higher yield and less nitrogen phosphorus and potassium application the sm treatment resulted in greater rue 17 relative to the tm treatment 4 4 cost benefit analysis in this cost benefit analysis the net profit values only considered the fertilizer application and did not include the costs for the else cultivation management measures in 2015 the sm treatment increased the net profit by 12 compared with tm treatment in 2016 the net profit in sm treatment was 33 higher than tm treatment 5 discussion fertilization
