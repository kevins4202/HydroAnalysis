21545,storm surge is a genuine common fiasco coming from the ocean therefore an exact forecast of surges is a vital assignment to dodge property misfortunes and to decrease a chance caused by tropical storm surge genetic programming gp is an evolution based model learning technique that can simultaneously find the functional form and the numeric coefficients for the model therefore gp has been widely applied to build models for predictive problems however gp has seldom been applied to the problem of storm surge forecasting in this paper we propose a new method to use gp for evolving models for storm surge forecasting experimental results on datasets collected from the tottori coast of japan show that gp can evolve accurate storm surge forecasting models moreover gp can automatically select relevant features when evolving storm surge forecasting models and the models evolved by gp are interpretable keywords storm surge genetic programming typhoon surge deviation white box forecasting 1 introduction storm surge a rise in sea level due to low atmospheric pressure and strong winds is a severe natural disaster coming from the sea storm surges are especially harmful when they happen at a high tide combining the impacts of the surge and the tide lee 2008 with over 600 million individuals living in low lying coastal zones coastal surges have devastating societal impacts for example the most remarkable recorded storm surge in the united states was produced by storm katrina in 2005 which created a storm surge 9 m tall within the town of cove st louis mississippi the overall misfortune as a result of katrina is evaluated to surpass 100 billion muis et al 2016 whereas high impact occasions will without a doubt happen within the future the advancement of the forecast of storm surge is able to enormously reduce the misfortune of lives and possibly lessen the sum of property harm kim et al 2016 2018 thuy et al 2016 a conventional approach to storm surge prediction is to utilize process based numerical forecasting models but this approach is often computationally expensive an alternative way is to use data driven machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks anns for predicting surge levels using the features such as sea surface levels winds sea level pressures and tropical cyclone characteristics kim et al 2016 for instance lee 2008 proposed a neural network combined with a consonant examination to forecast storm surges in suao harbor station taiwan the experimental results showed that storm surge is effectively anticipated using neural systems de oliveira at al de oliveira et al 2009 proposed a neural network model to predict ocean level varieties related to meteorological occasions the results showed that the model is able to capture the impacts of the climatic and maritime intuitions you at al you and seo 2009 combined neural networks and clustering algorithms to build a storm surge prediction model the observed results demonstrated that the model can be used for effectively forecasting territorial storm surges kim at al kim et al 2016 demonstrated the impact of using different feature sets on an artificial neural network based after runner surge forecast model the experimental results indicated that the combination of surge level sea level pressure drop of sea level pressure longitude and latitude of typhoon sea surface level wind speed and wind direction comprises the optimal feature sets for predicting the surge level with the lead time of 24 h in the area of sakai minato on the tottori coast japan genetic programming gp is an evolutionary procedure to create solutions in the form of computer programs koza 1992 the ability of gp to learn the definition of a function itself from sample information makes it a great choice for symbolic regression therefore gp has been widely used to build regression models for many real applications for instance based on predictions of stock prices using gp a possibly profitable trading strategy was proposed in kaboudan 2000 gaur and deo 2008 proposed the use of gp to build a model for real time wave forecasting the estimates created by gp shown that it can be respected as a promising tool for future applications to ocean forecasts azamathulla and ghani 2010 utilized gp to anticipate river pipeline scour and the execution of gp was found to be more viable when compared with the results of regression equations and artificial neural systems modeling in anticipating the scour depth around pipelines recently gp has also been applied to forecast storm surge sahoo and bhaskaran 2019 proposed to use gp for predicting storm surge and inundation characteristics resulting from tropical cyclones experiments used datasets collected from the coast of odisha adjoining the bay of bengal experimental results showed that both anns and gp perform very well as evidenced from their validation with actual data however gp has not been investigated to build models for storm surge forecasting with a lead time moreover the ability of gp to automatically select features and build interpretable models for storm surge forecasting has not been studied therefore this paper will investigate the ability of gp to build models for forecasting storm surge levels 1 1 goals this paper aims to develop accurate and interpretable models for storm surge forecasting based on gp approach the proposed method is compared with other common machine learning based storm surge forecasting models to answer the following research questions 1 whether the gp based storm surge forecasting models can be more accurate than machine learning based storm surge forecasting models 2 whether gp can automatically select relevant features when building storm surge forecasting models 3 whether storm surge forecasting models evolved by gp are interpretable the rest of this paper is organized as follow section 2 gives a brief on gp and machine learning methods utilized in this paper the proposed method and experiment design are shown in sections 3 and 4 the results and analyses are displayed and examined in section 5 discussions are given in section 6 section 7 states conclusions and future work 2 backgrounds 2 1 genetic programming genetic programming gp is one of the foremost well known evolutionary algorithm methods motivated by natural selection to evolve solutions as computer programs to problems koza 1992 1994 within the 1990s gp was primarily applied to mainly simple problems since it was rather computationally expensive nowadays with the exponential development in cpu control and the changes of gp frameworks it has broadly been utilized to solve various real world problems the applications of gp cover electronic design diversion playing quantum computing and sorting koza 1992 1994 fig 1 depicts the pseudo code of gp the following components are required for the application of gp poli et al 2008 2 1 1 representation of candidate solutions in spite of the fact that for gp there are a number of ways proposed to represent candidate solutions the most popular one is tree based representation to produce a populace of individuals firstly a gp user selects a function set and a terminal set the function set is regularly chosen from arithmetic operations e g mathematical functions e g sin cos exp log boolean operations e g and or xor not and conditionals such as if then else the terminal set frequently incorporates a number of features and a few constants after that a gp individual is built up recursively from the chosen functions and terminal sets koza 1992 poli et al 2008 2 1 2 initializing a population the reason for the initialization step is to initialize a population of seeding individuals that will be evolved in the later stages of evolution in a tree based gp framework the grow the full and the ramped half and half strategies are the three primary methods for initializing the initial population to produce an individual in the grow initialization firstly a function within the function set is arbitrarily chosen and is considered as the root node of the tree expecting that the arity of the chosen function is n at that point n nodes are randomly generated from the function and terminal sets as the children of the root node in case a function is chosen the recursive process is applied to that function if a terminal is chosen however this branch of the tree is ended the maximal depth of the tree is normally used to control the individual size in full initialization when building a tree rather than choosing nodes from the function and terminal sets only functions are chosen from the function set until it comes to the maximal depth where terminals are finally randomly selected from the terminal set for ramped half and half initialization a half of the population is created by utilizing the grow strategy while the other half is produced by the full strategy this strategy is perhaps the most popular initialization procedure for gp poli et al 2008 2 1 3 genetic operators crossover is the primary operator of gp it produces new children that are created from parts embodied in each parent hence crossover makes variation within the population for the execution of standard crossover firstly two parents are chosen according to a selection strategy and after that one subtree is randomly chosen in each parent if the two chosen subtrees are complied to the requirements depth of the resultant children syntactic closure property etc the crossover operation is done by swapping them at that point the new offspring are included in the next generation koza 1992 mutation is an asexual operator i e it works with only one parent to start a mutation point is randomly chosen after that the subtree rooted at the mutation point is expelled a randomly created subtree is used to replace the outgoing one koza 1992 2 1 4 fitness evaluation each individual within the population is assigned a numerical value called fitness measuring its capacity to solve the problem additionally fitness must also be computational efficiency koza 1994 poli et al 2008 two frequently used fitness measures in gp are raw and standardized fitness raw fitness simply reflects the extent to which an individual can solve the problem standardized fitness is calculated from the raw fitness so that the smaller fitness value the better individual is in solving the problem koza 1994 poli et al 2008 2 1 5 selection mechanism based on its fitness value each individual in the population has a chance to be chosen for the breeding of the new population the three most well known selection methods are tournament fitness proportionate and ranked selection in tournament selection a randomly chosen subset of individuals from the population is compared with each other in terms of fitness at that point the fittest is chosen to go to the mating pool the flexibility of tournament selection lies in the choice for the size of the tournament subset normally tournament selection does not require excessive fitness comparisons of all individuals subsequently it may avoid expensive processing time and is easily subjected to parallelization koza 1994 poli et al 2008 in fitness proportionate selection each individual is selected to the mating pool based on a likelihood that is proportionate to its fitness compared to the fitnesses of all individuals in the population in spite of the fact that proportionate selection has been frequently utilized in gp and genetic algorithms its behavior emphatically depends on the contrast between fitnesses of all individuals in the population koza 1994 poli et al 2008 in ranking selection based on their fitness all individuals are sorted after that based on the arranged order each individual may be selected with a likelihood calculated from its rank higher rank has higher chance to be chosen linear and exponential rankings are regularly utilized to index individuals although ranking selection strategy helps to reduce the shortcoming of proportionate selection in a few cases particularly within the exponential ranking this strategy enlarges the contrasts between individuals with closed fitnesses hence the superior one might be chosen more frequently koza 1994 poli et al 2008 2 2 machine learning methods in this section we will briefly portray four other machine learning methods tried out in our experiments they are the multi layer perceptron k nearest neighbors k nn decision trees dct and support vector regression svr which are ordinarily called data driven models for the capacity to capture the mapping between input and output variables forecast problems without studying directly the natural rules that dominate the mechanism of storm surges these models are completely based on information obtained from the collected data 2 2 1 k nearest neighbor the k nn is a non parametric machine learning method that bases its forecast on the target yielded by the k nearest neighbors of the given inquiry point song et al 2017 in detail given a data point we determine the value of euclidean measure between that point and all points within the training set after that we select its closest k nearest neighbors then we set the prediction value as the average of the target output values produced by these k nearest neighbors in particular the prediction x t is defined as 1 x t f 1 k t s x m x t where s x m expresses the k nearest neighbor index set to the x m attribute vector intuitively speaking the forecast x t f in equation 1 is the sample average of the output surge level of the k nearest neighbors to x m 2 2 2 support vector machines support vector machines can be utilized for both classification and regression problems when applied to a regression problem it is called as support vector regression svr in consideration of a linear model for illustration the forecast is formulated by 2 f x w t x o where w o and x denote the weight vector the bias and the input vector respectively let x m be the m th training input vector and y m is the target output m 1 m the following formula is used for the error function 3 j 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n y m f x m ε in this error function the first term is used to penalizes the complexity of the model the remaining term is called the ε insensitive loss function i e it does not penalize the errors below e p s i l o n for the linear case the learnt function could be obtained by the minimization of eq 4 as follows 4 f x m 1 m α m α m x m t x o where α m and α m are lagrange multipliers the training vectors that provide nonzero lagrange multipliers are referred to as support vectors and that is a key concept in the theory of svr non support vectors indirectly contribute to the solution and the number of support vectors is the degree of the complexity of the model balabin and lomakina 2011 this model can be extended to the non linear case by kernelization with the introduction of the kernel function κ in a reproducing kernel hilbert space rkhs 5 f x m 1 m α m α m κ x m t x o the widely used gaussian kernel is employed in our experiments with svr its width δ κ is the standard deviation of the gaussian function 2 2 3 multi layer perceptron networks the multi layer perception network is by far the most common artificial neural networks ann model which usually uses the error backward propagation technique to train the configuration of the network the ann architecture is made up of a number of hidden layers and a number of neurons in the input layer in the output layer either multiple or single neurons exist anns with one hidden layer are usually utilized in hydrologic modeling dawson and wilby 2001 de vos and rientjes 2005 on account that those networks are taken into consideration to provide sufficient complexity to accurately simulate the nonlinear properties of the hydrologic process the ann model for forecasting is defined as 6 x t f f x t w θ m h θ 0 j 1 h w j o u t φ i 1 m w j i x t θ j where φ indicates the transfer function w j i is the weight of the link between the input layer s i th node and the hidden layer s j th node θ j is bias related to the j th node of the hidden layer w j o u t is the weight associated with the link between the j th node of the hidden layer and the node of the output layer and θ 0 is the bias at the output node a suitable training algorithm is needed to find optimal w and θ in order to apply equation 6 to surge level forecasting 2 2 4 decision tree ref tree reduces error pruning rep tree classifier is a decision making tree learning algorithm based on the rule of splitting the training data using entropy based information gain and minimizing the error emerging from variance mohamed et al 2012 rep tree applies regression tree logic and in altered iterations it produces several trees it chooses the best one of all spawned trees afterward then it uses variance and knowledge gain to construct the regression decision tree the method also prunes the tree using a reduced error pruning process that sorts numeric attribute values once at the start of the model preparation as in the c4 5 algorithm quinlan 2014 this algorithm also tackles the missing values by separating the related instances into parts 3 genetic programming for storm surge forecast 3 1 problem statement in the current research we used the remotely transmitted hourly recorded meteorological and hydrodynamic data from the observation stations on the tottori coast of japan which are exactly the same kim et al 2016 there are three types of features used to predict storm surge level meteorological parameters wind speed ws m s wind direction wd degree sea level pressure slp hpa and drop rate of sea level pressure dslp from average sea level pressure at five sites these parameters were collected from five local weather sites at hamada matsue yonago ama and saigo operated by the japan meteorological agency typhoon featured parameters longitude and latitude lg and lt degree central atmospheric pressure cap hpa and highest wind speed hwp near the typhoon center m s the typhoon featured parameters are gathered from three typhoons of maemi 2003 songda 2004 and megi 2004 hydrodynamic parameters sea surface level ssl m the atmospheric tidal level the surge level and surge level m observed sea surface level atmospheric tidal level sl the parameters mentioned above were taken as the input of the gp forecast model the surge level is also used as the input parameter because the hourly surge level separated from a total sea surface level can be technically obtained from the stations and transferred to the present real time operating system in the output layer the surge levels with the lead times of 5 12 and 24 h are predicted in order to train and test the gp based surge forecast model with the input and output parameter sets mentioned in the previous paragraph a chain of surge level forecasting experiments were performed with the measurement collected during typhoons maemi 2003 songda 2004 and megi 2004 kim et al 2016 data sets were collected at the hourly interval for 168h for each event the parameters obtained during typhoon maemi 2003 and songda 2004 respectively were used for training the data length is appropriate to a relationship between input and output for the training phase the parameters obtained during megi 2004 were used for testing through the phases of training and testing we developed the gp based surge forecast models with 5 12 and 24h lead times at sakai minato it is noticed that all parameters were modified to have dimensional less orders before training resulting in falling within the range of 1 1 after rendering the parameters dimensional less 3 2 gp based surge level forecasting here we outline a gp approach to predict the surge level several modifications have been made to the gp based surge level forecasting which is detailed in the following all variables available within the data are included in the first set of elements in the terminal set the second element is an ephemeral random constant erc that will select a random number that is uniformly distributed in 1 1 we allow our erc to select a random number the set of functions includes add add subtract sub multiply mul divide div square root sqrt natural logarithm base e log and trigonometric functions sin cos log sqrt and div functions are protected since zeroes and negative numbers are included in the results if the input is zero or negative zero will be returned by sqrt and log if zero denominator is the second argument passed to div zero is returned as well protecting these values will prevent the generation of nan s not a number and inf infinity we make sure that the first child is either a function or a variable when initializing the population using the ramped and half whereas the second child can either be a variable an erc or another function this will prevent random numbers from dominating trees table 1 summarizes all the functions and terminals provided in this section the fitness used for assessment will be based on the root mean squared error and the coefficient of correlation cc given by 7 f i t n e s s n r m s e 1 1 c c where n r m s e and c c are calculated by 8 n r m s e 1 n i 1 n y o b s i y p r e i y o b s m a x y o b s m i n 9 c c i 1 n y o b s i y o b s y p r e i y p r e i 1 n y o b s i y o b s 2 i 1 n y p r e i y p r e 2 where n is the size of the training set y p r e i represents the predicted surge level and y o b s i represents the actual surge level for the ith data point time index every search process starts with a random set of trees being generated every tree s objective function shown in equation 7 is then determined trees with better target values are picked using methods such as tournament selection two genetic operators are planning the chosen trees for the next iteration crossover and mutation the new trees that were produced are the input for the next iteration this process continues to the maximum number of iterations or error satisfaction e g equal zero 4 parameter settings in all experiments we used the implementation of gp in the ecj library a java based evolutionary computation research system luke et al 2006 table 1 shows the parameters of our gp systems thirty independent runs of gp were performed for each experiment yielding diverse solutions at each run these independent runs have different seeds generated by the computer pseudo random number generator we also utilized elitism in our evolutionary process which copied the best individual of the current population to the next generation without changes in machine learning regression learning algorithms are frequently categorized into decision trees such as c4 5 quinlan 2014 instance based classifiers such as k nearest neighbor knn weinberger et al 2006 and function based classifiers such as an artificial neural network ann and svm han et al 2011 hence four regression algorithms c4 5 knn ann and svm were utilized in our experiments for the sake of comparison we used the implementations of these regression learning methods in the weka library hall et al 2009 the parameter settings of these algorithms are given in table 2 5 results and analyses 5 1 empirical evaluation of the proposed method in this experiment of storm surge forecast it was found that the difference in performance between gp with the number of generations was significant as seen in fig 2 a and b and 2 c we choose values of the number of generations in 50 500 first the correlation coefficient of surge forecast with 5h lead time is examined in fig 2 a gp achieves the best performance with the maximum number of generations of 200 it seems that in this case the more number of generation number leads to the decrease of the correlation coefficient value next in fig 2 b with 12h lead time the correlation coefficient value increases rapidly to 200 then decreases gradually in the last case with 24h lead time in fig 2 c after reaching the peak at 200 t h generation the difference between the maximum value and the rear values is relatively small experimenting with different maximum number of generations 50 60 to 500 we noticed that patterns of results for gp in general show the best correlation coefficient value in the case of 200 generations for this reason we set this parameter maximum number of generations to 200 in all subsequent experiments 5 2 the comparison between the proposed method and the machine learning methods in this section we look at the predictive error and coefficient correlation value between algorithms four aforementioned machine learning models are chosen to compete with gp in addition we also compare gps to the best ann forecast models in kim et al 2016 on each data set we compare the results of each algorithm on 3 data samples gp and ann is in the form of a stochastic algorithm so we test gp for 30 times before taking the median result from the set of the best individuals on the training set from each run svm k nn and dct are deterministic and only one run was required 5 2 1 accuracy of surge forecasts with the lead time of 5h for 5h lead time the results in kim et al 2016 indicated that the ann based surge model ann b3 which were trained with a combination of storm surge sea level pressure drop rate of sea level pressure longitude latitude sea surface level and wind speed is the best performing model firstly the accuracy of surge estimate with the 5h lead time is assessed by comparing time series of the surge level and perceptions amid tropical storm megi as appeared in fig 3 taking a look at the testing results of the models in fig 3 the surge level outputs by ann b3 gp and ann are fairly good in comparison with the observations however we can find among these models gp and k nn achieved the best performance around the peak 5 2 2 accuracy of surge forecasts with the lead time of 12h in this subsection all forecast models for the lead time of 12h are assessed in kim et al 2016 they found that the ann based surge model ann b1 is the best model trained with features of storm surge sea level pressure drop rate of sea level pressure longitude and latitude as appeared in fig 4 the 12h lead time forecasts of svm svr and ann b1 generally overestimated the surge levels whereas gp and ann predicted the surge levels with thin deviations among them knn and dct appear jutted surge levels close to the greatest surge level 5 2 3 accuracy of surge forecasts with the lead time of 24h lastly we assess the accuracy of the estimate models with the lead time of 24h time series of the surge figures and perceptions for typhoon megi are shown in fig 5 the ann based surge model ann b4 is the best ann model in kim et al 2016 which was trained with storm surge sea level pressure drop rate of sea level pressure longitude latitude wind speed wind direction overall the forecasts of surge levels are rather inaccurate for all models however gp and ann produced better forecasting values and relatively captured the trend of the data by contrast the models built by dct and knn are more fluctuated for svm and ann b4 it can be seen from fig 5 that they produced bad forecasts and failed to capture the data trend 6 discussions 6 1 discussion on accuracy to evaluate our evolved gp models in detail on the 5h lead time forecasts compared to the other five learning methods we calculated two records of the correlation coefficient cc and the normalized root mean square error nrmse in rate as appeared in fig 6 a it is observed that the value of cc in all of the models ranges from 0 93 to 0 99 while that of nrmse is from 5 to 12 among these models the one evolved with gp has smallest error and the largest correlation coefficient similarly in fig 6 b the correlation coefficient cc and the normalized root mean square error nrmse of all models for 12h lead time surge level forecast are depicted the cc values of the models mostly concentrated in the range of 0 94 0 98 these models also have the nrmse values from 8 to 13 among them gp shows the best performance for 12h lead time forecasts finally two records of cc and nrmse are again calculated for all models in 24h lead time forecasts they are shown in fig 6 c the cc values of most of the models are scattered from 0 86 to 0 96 and the nrmse values are from 10 to 20 even though the performance of gp based model deteriorates compared to the 6h and 12h lead time cases it is still the best forecasting model among all with the values of cc and nrmse as 0 96 and 10 8 respectively overall these experiments and comparisons show that gp is the most effective method in building surge level forecasting model to further confirm the superiority of gp evolved models we performed multiple statistical tests by using friendman s test demšar 2006 on nrmse table 3 shows the rank of the algorithms by using friedman s test smaller means better it is obvious from table 3 that gp is the best algorithm followed by ann and others the friedman s test shows that there exits significant differences between the methods therefore we carry out the holm test demšar 2006 to perform pair tests between the two methods with 5h lead time the holm test shows that gp is significantly better than other methods except ann with 12h lead time gp is not significantly better than knn ann b1 and svm with 24h lead time gp is not significantly better than dct ann and svm in summary storm surge forecasting models evolved by gp are generally more accurate than models built by the machine learning algorithms 6 2 discussion on the evolved models the best models evolved by gp are shown in table 4 where variables x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8 x 9 and x 10 stand for the attributes features ssl numeric slp numeric dslp numeric ws numeric wd numeric lt numeric lg numeric cap numeric hws numeric ss numeric respectively it is clear from table 4 that gp can automatically select features to evolve the best models the model for the 5h lead time forecasting uses four features sea surface level sea level pressure drop rate of sea level pressure and storm surge the model for the 12h lead time forecasting uses five features sea level pressure drop rate of sea level pressure wind speed longitude and latitude the model for the 24h lead time forecasting only uses three features sea level pressure longitude and latitude and central atmospheric pressure it can be seen from the best model for the 5h lead time forecasting that the incorporation of the storm feature parameter like the typhoon position is able to improve the accuracy of the forecasting model moreover training the model with the local parameters can forecast the storm surge with the 5h lead time and adding the storm feature parameter can improve the accuracy of the model with the best model for the 12h lead time forecasting the local parameters with the typhoon position are not enough to describe the storm surge with the 12 h lead time furthermore adding the typhoon intensity which is explained by the central atmospheric pressure to the local parameters with the typhoon position the storm surge with the 12h lead time can be accurately predicted it also can be seen from table 4 that the best model for the 24h lead time forecasting combines the meteorological and typhoon feature parameters in the 24h forecast models the hydrodynamic parameters are excluded for the 24h forecasting in contrast to the 5h and 12h forecast models in summary gp can automatically select features when evolving models and the models evolved by gp is explainable 7 conclusions and future work this paper has proposed a method to use genetic programming gp for building storm surge forecasting models meteorological hydrodynamic and typhoon featured parameters were taken into genetic programming to build models forecasting storm surge levels with the lead times of 5h 12h and 24h the proposed method was evaluated on the datasets collected from the observation stations on the tottori coast the experiments compared genetic programming with other common machine learning methods on the normal root mean squared error and the coefficient of correlation the experimental results showed that not only genetic programming can achieve than smaller error but also achieve higher coefficient of correlation than other machine learning methods statistical testing further confirmed that storm surge forecasting models evolved by gp are significantly better than support vector machines k nearest neighbor and decision tree moreover genetic programming can automatically select relevant features when evolving storm surge forecasting models and storm surge forecasting models evolved by genetic programming are interpretable in closed form equations although this paper used genetic programming to build and test models on datasets from tottori coast the proposed method is independent with these datasets from tottori coast therefore the proposed method will be applicable to build storm surge forecasting models for other coasts in order to evolve more accurate models the future work could investigate advanced genetic programming such as semantic genetic programming vanneschi et al 2014 to evolve storm surge forecasting models credit authorship contribution statement nguyen thi hien methodology writing original draft visualization

forecasting 1 introduction storm surge a rise in sea level due to low atmospheric pressure and strong winds is a severe natural disaster coming from the sea storm surges are especially harmful when they happen at a high tide combining the impacts of the surge and the tide lee 2008 with over 600 million individuals living in low lying coastal zones coastal surges have devastating societal impacts

section 7 states conclusions and future work 2 backgrounds 2 1 genetic programming genetic programming gp is one of the foremost well known evolutionary algorithm methods motivated by natural selection to evolve solutions as computer programs to problems koza 1992 1994 within the 1990s gp was primarily applied to mainly simple problems since it was rather computationally expensive nowadays with the exponential development in cpu control and the changes of gp frameworks it has broadly been utilized to solve various real world problems the applications of gp cover electronic design diversion playing quantum computing and sorting koza 1992 1994 fig 1 depicts the pseudo code of gp the following components are required for the application of gp poli et al 2008 2 1 1 representation of candidate solutions in spite of the fact that for gp there are a number of ways proposed to represent candidate solutions the most popular one is tree based representation to produce a populace of individuals firstly a gp user selects a function set and a terminal set the function set is regularly chosen from arithmetic operations e g mathematical functions e g sin cos exp log boolean operations e g and or xor not and conditionals such as if then else the terminal set frequently incorporates a number of features and a few constants after that a gp individual is built up recursively from the chosen functions and terminal sets koza 1992 poli et al 2008 2 1 2 initializing a population the reason for the initialization step is to initialize a population of seeding individuals that will be evolved in the later stages of evolution in a tree based gp framework the grow the full and the ramped half and half strategies are the three primary methods for initializing the initial population to produce an individual in the grow initialization firstly a function within the function set is arbitrarily chosen and is considered as the root node of the tree expecting that the arity of the chosen function is n at that point n nodes are randomly generated from the function and terminal sets as the children of the root node in case a function is chosen the recursive process is applied to that function if a terminal is chosen however this branch of the tree is ended the maximal depth of the tree is normally used to control the individual size in full initialization when building a tree rather than choosing nodes from the function and terminal sets only functions are chosen from the function set until it comes to the maximal depth where terminals are finally randomly selected from the terminal set for ramped half and half initialization a half of the population is created by utilizing the grow strategy while the other half is produced by the full strategy this strategy is perhaps the most popular initialization procedure for gp poli et al 2008 2 1 3 genetic operators crossover is the primary operator of gp it produces new children that are created from parts embodied in each parent hence crossover makes variation within the population for the execution of standard crossover firstly two parents are chosen according to a selection strategy and after that one subtree is randomly chosen in each parent if the two chosen subtrees are complied to the requirements depth of the resultant children syntactic closure property etc the crossover operation is done by swapping them at that point the new offspring are included in the next generation koza 1992 mutation is an asexual operator i e it works with only one parent to start a mutation point is randomly chosen after that the subtree rooted at the mutation point is expelled a randomly created subtree is used to replace the outgoing one koza 1992 2 1 4 fitness evaluation each individual within the population is assigned a numerical value called fitness measuring its capacity to solve the problem additionally fitness must also be computational efficiency koza 1994 poli et al 2008 two frequently used fitness measures in gp are raw and standardized fitness raw fitness simply reflects the extent to which an individual can solve the problem standardized fitness is calculated from the raw fitness so that the smaller fitness value the better individual is in solving the problem koza 1994 poli et al 2008 2 1 5 selection mechanism based on its fitness value each individual in the population has a chance to be chosen for the breeding of the new population the three most well known selection methods are tournament fitness proportionate and ranked selection in tournament selection a randomly chosen subset of individuals from the population is compared with each other in terms of fitness at that point the fittest is chosen to go to the mating pool the flexibility of tournament selection lies in the choice for the size of the tournament subset normally tournament selection does not require excessive fitness comparisons of all individuals subsequently it may avoid expensive processing time and is easily subjected to parallelization koza 1994 poli et al 2008 in fitness proportionate selection each individual is selected to the mating pool based on a likelihood that is proportionate to its fitness compared to the fitnesses of all individuals in the population in spite of the fact that proportionate selection has been frequently utilized in gp and genetic algorithms its behavior emphatically depends on the contrast between fitnesses of all individuals in the population koza 1994 poli et al 2008 in ranking selection based on their fitness all individuals are sorted after that based on the arranged order each individual may be selected with a likelihood calculated from its rank higher rank has higher chance to be chosen linear and exponential rankings are regularly utilized to index individuals although ranking selection strategy helps to reduce the shortcoming of proportionate selection in a few cases particularly within the exponential ranking this strategy enlarges the contrasts between individuals with closed fitnesses hence the superior one might be chosen more frequently koza 1994 poli et al 2008 2 2 machine learning methods in this section we will briefly portray four other machine learning methods tried out in our experiments they are the multi layer perceptron k nearest neighbors k nn decision trees dct and support vector regression svr which are ordinarily called data driven models for the capacity to capture the mapping between input and output variables forecast problems without studying directly the natural rules that dominate the mechanism of storm surges these models are completely based on information obtained from the collected data 2 2 1 k nearest neighbor the k nn is a non parametric machine learning method that bases its forecast on the target yielded by the k nearest neighbors of the given inquiry point song et al 2017 in detail given a data point we determine the value of euclidean measure between that point and all points within the training set after that we select its closest k nearest neighbors then we set the prediction value as the average of the target output values produced by these k nearest neighbors in particular the prediction x t is defined as 1 x t f 1 k t s x m x t where s x m expresses the k nearest neighbor index set to the x m attribute vector intuitively speaking the forecast x t f in equation 1 is the sample average of the output surge level of the k nearest neighbors to x m 2 2 2 support vector machines support vector machines can be utilized for both classification and regression problems when applied to a regression problem it is called as support vector regression svr in consideration of a linear model for illustration the forecast is formulated by 2 f x w t x o where w o and x denote the weight vector the bias and the input vector respectively let x m be the m th training input vector and y m is the target output m 1 m the following formula is used for the error function 3 j 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n y m f x m ε in this error function the first term is used to penalizes the complexity of the model the remaining term is called the ε insensitive loss function i e it does not penalize the errors below e p s i l o n for the linear case the learnt function could be obtained by the minimization of eq 4 as follows 4 f x m 1 m α m α m x m t x o where α m and α m are lagrange multipliers the training vectors that provide nonzero lagrange multipliers are referred to as support vectors and that is a key concept in the theory of svr non support vectors indirectly contribute to the solution and the number of support vectors is the degree of the complexity of the model balabin and lomakina 2011 this model can be extended to the non linear case by kernelization with the introduction of the kernel function κ in a reproducing kernel hilbert space rkhs 5 f x m 1 m α m α m κ x m t x o the widely used gaussian kernel is employed in our experiments with svr its width δ κ is the standard deviation of the gaussian function 2 2 3 multi layer perceptron networks the multi layer perception network is by far the most common artificial neural networks ann model which usually uses the error backward propagation technique to train the configuration of the network the ann architecture is made up of a number of hidden layers and a number of neurons in the input layer in the output layer either multiple or single neurons exist anns with one hidden layer are usually utilized in hydrologic modeling dawson and wilby 2001 de vos and rientjes 2005 on account that those networks are taken into consideration to provide sufficient complexity to accurately simulate the nonlinear properties of the hydrologic process the ann model for forecasting is defined as 6 x t f f x t w θ m h θ 0 j 1 h w j o u t φ i 1 m w j i x t θ j where φ indicates the transfer function w j i is the weight of the link between the input layer s i th node and the hidden layer s j th node θ j is bias related to the j th node of the hidden layer w j o u t is the weight associated with the link between the j th node of the hidden layer and the node of the output layer and θ 0 is the bias at the output node a suitable training algorithm is needed to find optimal w and θ in order to apply equation 6 to surge level forecasting 2 2 4 decision tree ref tree reduces error pruning rep tree classifier is a decision making tree learning algorithm based on the rule of splitting the training data using entropy based information gain and minimizing the error emerging from variance mohamed et al 2012 rep tree applies regression tree logic and in altered iterations it produces several trees it chooses the best one of all spawned trees afterward then it uses variance and knowledge gain to construct the regression decision tree the method also prunes the tree using a reduced error pruning process that sorts numeric attribute values once at the start of the model preparation as in the c4 5 algorithm quinlan 2014 this algorithm also tackles the missing values by separating the related instances into parts 3 genetic programming for storm surge forecast 3 1 problem statement in the current research we used the remotely transmitted hourly recorded meteorological and hydrodynamic data from the observation stations on the tottori coast of japan which are exactly the same kim et al 2016 there are three types of features used to predict storm surge level meteorological parameters wind speed ws m s wind direction wd degree sea level pressure slp hpa and drop rate of sea level pressure dslp from average sea level pressure at five sites these parameters were collected from five local weather sites at hamada matsue yonago ama and saigo operated by the japan meteorological agency typhoon featured parameters longitude and latitude lg and lt degree central atmospheric pressure cap hpa and highest wind speed hwp near the typhoon center m s the typhoon featured parameters are gathered from three typhoons of maemi 2003 songda 2004 and megi 2004 hydrodynamic parameters sea surface level ssl m the atmospheric tidal level the surge level and surge level m observed sea surface level atmospheric tidal level sl the parameters mentioned above were taken as the input of the gp forecast model the surge level is also used as the input parameter because the hourly surge level separated from a total sea surface level can be technically obtained from the stations and transferred to the present real time operating system in the output layer the surge levels with the lead times of 5 12 and 24 h are predicted in order to train and test the gp based surge forecast model with the input and output parameter sets mentioned in the previous paragraph a chain of surge level forecasting experiments were performed with the measurement collected during typhoons maemi 2003 songda 2004 and megi 2004 kim et al 2016 data sets were collected at the hourly interval for 168h for each event the parameters obtained during typhoon maemi 2003 and songda 2004 respectively were used for training the data length is appropriate to a relationship between input and output for the training phase the parameters obtained during megi 2004 were used for testing through the phases of training and testing we developed the gp based surge forecast models with 5 12 and 24h lead times at sakai minato it is noticed that all parameters were modified to have dimensional less orders before training resulting in falling within the range of 1 1 after rendering the parameters dimensional less 3 2 gp based surge level forecasting here we outline a gp approach to predict the surge level several modifications have been made to the gp based surge level forecasting which is detailed in the following all variables available within the data are included in the first set of elements in the terminal set the second element is an ephemeral random constant erc that will select a random number that is uniformly distributed in 1 1 we allow our erc to select a random number the set of functions includes add add subtract sub multiply mul divide div square root sqrt natural logarithm base e log and trigonometric functions sin cos log sqrt and div functions are protected since zeroes and negative numbers are included in the results if the input is zero or negative zero will be returned by sqrt and log if zero denominator is the second argument passed to div zero is returned as well protecting these values will prevent the generation of nan s not a number and inf infinity we make sure that the first child is either a function or a variable when initializing the population using the ramped and half whereas the second child can either be a variable an erc or another function this will prevent random numbers from dominating trees table 1 summarizes all the functions and terminals provided in this section the fitness used for assessment will be based on the root mean squared error and the coefficient of correlation cc given by 7 f i t n e s s n r m s e 1 1 c c where n r m s e and c c are calculated by 8 n r m s e 1 n i 1 n y o b s i y p r e i y o b s m a x y o b s m i n 9 c c i 1 n y o b s i y o b s y p r e i y p r e i 1 n y o b s i y o b s 2 i 1 n y p r e i y p r e 2 where n is the size of the training set y p r e i represents the predicted surge level and y o b s i represents the actual surge level for the ith data point time index every search process starts with a random set of trees being generated every tree s objective function shown in equation 7 is then determined trees with better target values are picked using methods such as tournament selection two genetic operators are planning the chosen trees for the next iteration crossover and mutation the new trees that were produced are the input for the next iteration this process continues to the maximum number of iterations or error satisfaction e g equal zero 4 parameter settings in all experiments we used the implementation of gp in the ecj library a java based evolutionary computation research system luke et al 2006 table 1 shows the parameters of our gp systems thirty independent runs of gp were performed for each experiment yielding diverse solutions at each run these independent runs have different seeds generated by the computer pseudo random number generator we also utilized elitism in our evolutionary process which copied the best individual of the current population to the next generation without changes in machine learning regression learning algorithms are frequently categorized into decision trees such as c4 5 quinlan 2014 instance based classifiers such as k nearest neighbor knn weinberger et al 2006 and function based classifiers such as an artificial neural network ann and svm han et al 2011 hence four regression algorithms c4 5 knn ann and svm were utilized in our experiments for the sake of comparison we used the implementations of these regression learning methods in the weka library hall et al 2009 the parameter settings of these algorithms are given in table 2 5 results and analyses 5 1 empirical evaluation of the proposed method in this experiment of storm surge forecast it was found that the difference in performance between gp with the number of generations was significant as seen in fig 2 a and b and 2 c we choose values of the number of generations in 50 500 first the correlation coefficient of surge forecast with 5h lead time is examined in fig 2 a gp achieves the best performance with the maximum number of generations of 200 it seems that in this case the more number of generation number leads to the decrease of the correlation coefficient value next in fig 2 b with 12h lead time the correlation coefficient value increases rapidly to 200 then decreases gradually in the last case with 24h lead time in fig 2 c after reaching the peak at 200 t h generation the difference between the maximum value and the rear values is relatively small experimenting with different maximum number of generations 50 60 to 500 we noticed that patterns of results for gp in general show the best correlation coefficient value in the case of 200 generations for this reason we set this parameter maximum number of generations to 200 in all subsequent experiments 5 2 the comparison between the proposed method and the machine learning methods in this section we look at the predictive error and coefficient correlation value between algorithms four aforementioned machine learning models are chosen to compete with gp in addition we also compare gps to the best ann forecast models in kim et al 2016 on each data set we compare the results of each algorithm on 3 data samples gp and ann is in the form of a stochastic algorithm so we test gp for 30 times before taking the median result from the set of the best individuals on the training set from each run svm k nn and dct are deterministic and only one run was required 5 2 1 accuracy of surge forecasts with the lead time of 5h for 5h lead time the results in kim et al 2016 indicated that the ann based surge model ann b3 which were trained with a combination of storm surge sea level pressure drop rate of sea level pressure longitude latitude sea surface level and wind speed is the best performing model firstly the accuracy of surge estimate with the 5h lead time is assessed by comparing time series of the surge level and perceptions amid tropical storm megi as appeared in fig 3 taking a look at the testing results of the models in fig 3 the surge level outputs by ann b3 gp and ann are fairly good in comparison with the observations however we can find among these models gp and k nn achieved the best performance around the peak 5 2 2 accuracy of surge forecasts with the lead time of 12h in this subsection all forecast models for the lead time of 12h are assessed in kim et al 2016 they found that the ann based surge model ann b1 is the best model trained with features of storm surge sea level pressure drop rate of sea level pressure longitude and latitude as appeared in fig 4 the 12h lead time forecasts of svm svr and ann b1 generally overestimated the surge levels whereas gp and ann predicted the surge levels with thin deviations among them knn and dct appear jutted surge levels close to the greatest surge level 5 2 3 accuracy of surge forecasts with the lead time of 24h lastly we assess the accuracy of the estimate models with the lead time of 24h time series of the surge figures and perceptions for typhoon megi are shown in fig 5 the ann based surge model ann b4 is the best ann model in kim et al 2016 which was trained with storm surge sea level pressure drop rate of sea level pressure longitude latitude wind speed wind direction overall the forecasts of surge levels are rather inaccurate for all models however gp and ann produced better forecasting values and relatively captured the trend of the data by contrast the models built by dct and knn are more fluctuated for svm and ann b4 it can be seen from fig 5 that they produced bad forecasts and failed to capture the data trend 6 discussions 6 1 discussion on accuracy to evaluate our evolved gp models in detail on the 5h lead time forecasts compared to the other five learning methods we calculated two records of the correlation coefficient cc and the normalized root mean square error nrmse in rate as appeared in fig 6 a it is observed that the value of cc in all of the models ranges from 0 93 to 0 99 while that of nrmse is from 5 to 12 among these models the one evolved with gp has smallest error and the largest correlation coefficient similarly in fig 6 b the correlation coefficient cc and the normalized root mean square error nrmse of all models for 12h lead time surge level forecast are depicted the cc values of the models mostly concentrated in the range of 0 94 0 98 these models also have the nrmse values from 8 to 13 among them gp shows the best performance for 12h lead time forecasts finally two records of cc and nrmse are again calculated for all models in 24h lead time forecasts they are shown in fig 6 c the cc values of most of the models are scattered from 0 86 to 0 96 and the nrmse values are from 10 to 20 even though the performance of gp based model deteriorates compared to the 6h and 12h lead time cases it is still the best forecasting model among all with the values of cc and nrmse as 0 96 and 10 8 respectively overall these experiments and comparisons show that gp is the most effective method in building surge level forecasting model to further confirm the superiority of gp evolved models we performed multiple statistical tests by using friendman s test demšar 2006 on nrmse table 3 shows the rank of the algorithms by using friedman s test smaller means better it is obvious from table 3 that gp is the best algorithm followed by ann and others the friedman s test shows that there exits significant differences between the methods therefore we carry out the holm test demšar 2006 to perform pair tests between the two methods with 5h lead time the holm test shows that gp is significantly better than other methods except ann with 12h lead time gp is not significantly better than knn ann b1 and svm with 24h lead time gp is not significantly better than dct ann and svm in summary storm surge forecasting models evolved by gp are generally more accurate than models built by the machine learning algorithms 6 2 discussion on the evolved models the best models evolved by gp are shown in table 4 where variables x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8 x 9 and x 10 stand for the attributes features ssl numeric slp numeric dslp numeric ws numeric wd numeric lt numeric lg numeric cap numeric hws numeric ss numeric respectively it is clear from table 4 that gp can automatically select features to evolve the best models the model for the 5h lead time forecasting uses four features sea surface level sea level pressure drop rate of sea level pressure and storm surge the model for the 12h lead time forecasting uses five features sea level pressure drop rate of sea level pressure wind speed longitude and latitude the model for the 24h lead time forecasting only uses three features sea level pressure longitude and latitude and central atmospheric pressure it can be seen from the best model for the 5h lead time forecasting that the incorporation of the storm feature parameter like the typhoon position is able to improve the accuracy of the forecasting model moreover training the model with the local parameters can forecast the storm surge with the 5h lead time and adding the storm feature parameter can improve the accuracy of the model with the best model for the 12h lead time forecasting the local parameters with the typhoon position are not enough to describe the storm surge with the 12 h lead time furthermore adding the typhoon intensity which is explained by the central atmospheric pressure to the local parameters with the typhoon position the storm surge with the 12h lead time can be accurately predicted it also can be seen from table 4 that the best model for the 24h lead time forecasting combines the meteorological and typhoon feature parameters in the 24h forecast models the hydrodynamic parameters are excluded for the 24h forecasting in contrast to the 5h and 12h forecast models in summary gp can automatically select features when evolving models and the models evolved by gp is explainable 7 conclusions and future work this paper has proposed a method to use genetic programming gp for building storm surge forecasting models meteorological hydrodynamic and typhoon featured parameters were taken into genetic programming to build models forecasting storm surge levels with the lead times of 5h 12h and 24h the proposed method was evaluated on the datasets collected from the observation stations on the tottori coast the experiments compared genetic programming with other common machine learning methods on the normal root mean squared error and the coefficient of correlation the experimental results showed that not only genetic programming can achieve than smaller error but also achieve higher coefficient of correlation than other machine learning methods statistical testing further confirmed that storm surge forecasting models evolved by gp are significantly better than support vector machines k nearest neighbor and decision tree moreover genetic programming can automatically select relevant features when evolving storm surge forecasting models and storm surge forecasting models evolved by genetic programming are interpretable in closed form equations although this paper used genetic programming to build and test models on datasets from tottori coast the proposed method is independent with these datasets from tottori coast therefore the proposed method will be applicable to build storm surge forecasting models for other coasts in order to evolve more accurate models the future work could investigate advanced genetic programming such as semantic genetic programming vanneschi et al 2014 to evolve storm surge forecasting models credit authorship contribution statement nguyen thi hien methodology writing original draft visualization

21546,the present paper studies the dynamical behavior of the moving viscoelastic plate which is in contact with barotropic compressible viscous fluid with finite depth the time harmonic lineal located forces act on the plate the linearized navier stokes equations are employed for describing the fluid flow however the field equations and relations of the theory of visco elastodynamics are employed for describing the plate motion the analytic numerical method based on the fourier transform is employed for the solution to the related mathematical problems under concrete numerical investigations the viscoelasticity of the plate material is described by rabotnov s fractional exponential operators and dimensionless rheological parameters are introduced which characterize the long term values of the mechanical properties and the characteristic creep time of the plate material the main aim of the numerical investigations is determination of how these dimensionless rheological parameters influence the frequency responses of the stress and velocities on the interface plane between the fluid and viscoelastic plate analyzing these results corresponding conclusions are drawn in particular it is established that the character of the influence of the rheological parameters on the stress and velocities depends significantly on the vibration phase of the external forces keywords

composite materials with a polymer matrix in the various leading branches of industry such as aeronautical nuclear chemical biological mechanical civil and especially marine and sub marine engineering requires detailed study of the dynamic interaction of the elements of constructions made of these materials with fluids as the polymers are time dependent materials it appears necessary to study the problems related to the dynamics of hydro viscoelastic systems one of which is the system consisting of a viscoelastic covering layer compressible viscous fluid and rigid wall the first attempt in this field was made in the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2018 in which the time harmonic forced vibration of the viscoelastic plate contacting the compressible viscous fluid with finite depth was studied another new aspect in the investigations related to the dynamics of hydro elastic systems is the taking into consideration of the moving of the plate which is in contact with the fluids the attempt in this field was made in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 in which the forced vibration of the moving elastic plate in contact with the viscous fluid was studied consequently the results obtained in these papers relate only to the cases where the plate material is purely elastic and cannot be used for the cases where this material is viscoelastic therefore in the present paper the attempt is made to study the forced vibration of the system consisting of the moving viscoelastic plate and of the compressible viscous fluid with finite depth and rigid wall a sketch of which is shown in fig 1 an explanation of the notation in this figure will be given below it is evident that the results of this investigation will further the development of the investigations carried out in the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2018 for the case where the plate moves axially with constant velocity and will also be a development of the investigations carried out in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 for the case where the material of the plate is a viscoelastic one the distinguishing characteristics of the present problem from those considered in the papers by akbarov and ismailov 2018 and akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 will be clearly described at the end of the next section in the historical aspect the dynamics the plate fluid systems was started with the paper by lamb 1921 in which the non dimensional added virtual mass incremental navmi method is employed for the study of the natural vibration of the circular elastic baffled plate in contact with still water after lamb 1921 in the papers by amabili and kwak 1996 and kwak and kim 1991 the aforementioned problem was solved with a more accurate approximation of the vibration mode moreover in the paper by mclachlan 1932 investigation of lamb s problem was developed for the free edge circular plate case however in these papers it was assumed that the plate is in contact with a semi infinite fluid on one side of the plate in the paper by amabili 1996 this semi infinite fluid condition was refused and it was assumed that the baffled circular and annular plates are in contact with the fluid which has a finite depth the same investigation for the free edge circular plate was carried out by kwak and han 2000 it should be noted that in all the foregoing works it is assumed that the fluid is inviscid and incompressible and the plate motion was described within the scope of the kirchhoff hypothesis unlike the foregoing investigations the paper by jeong and kim 2005 takes the compressibility of the inviscid fluid into consideration and the natural frequencies of a circular plate submerged in a bounded fluid were investigated the influence of the incompressible fluid viscosity on the frequency response of the rectangular cantilever plate submerged in an infinite fluid was investigated by atkinson and manrique de lara 2007 moreover kozlovsky 2009 developed lamb s problem for the viscous fluid case and studied the influence of this viscosity on the navmi coefficient the paper by sorokin and chubinskij 2008 investigated the role of fluid viscosity in wave propagation in the plate fluid system consisting of an infinite sandwich plate compressible viscous fluid and rigid wall however in this investigation the equations of motion of the plate are written by employing the approximate plate theories the equations for the motion of the face layers are written within the kirchhoff plate theory but for the motion of the middle layer they are written within the first order refined plate theory therefore this situation decreases significantly the analyzed range of the wave modes and corresponding dispersion curves for instance the results obtained in this paper cannot describe waves the length of which is less than the plate s layers thickness such description however can be made by the use of the exact equations of elastodynamics and linearized elastodynamics under linearized elastodynamics the three dimensional linearized theory of elastic waves in initially stressed bodies is understood the attempts in this field were made in the works by bagno and guz 1997 bagno 2015 and many others listed therein reviewed in the paper by guz et al 2016 and analyzed in the monograph by guz 2009 note that in these works infinite plate compressible viscous or inviscid fluid systems were considered and the plate motion is described by the equations and relations of the linearized elastodynamics obtained for the homogeneous uniaxial pre stressed plate case and the fluid flow is written by employing linearized navier stokes equations for instance in the paper by bagno et al 1994 the influence of the fluid viscosity on the wave propagation in the plate made of highly elastic compressible elastic material was studied and this plate has initial uniaxial homogeneous stress detailed analyses of the wave dispersion spectrum in the initially stressed compressible layer inviscid compressible fluid systems were made in the paper by bagno 2015 until six years ago there had not been any investigations related to the forced vibration of the plate fluid system carried out within the exact equations and relations of elastodynamics linearized elastodynamics or linearized navier stokes equations the first attempts in this field were made in the papers by akbarov and ismailov 2014 2015 2016a 2017 and 2018 akbarov and huseynova 2019 akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 and in others listed therein note that the paper akbarov and ismailov 2014 studied the harmonic forced vibration of the pre strained highly elastic plate under compressible viscous fluid loading in the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2016a b this study is developed for the pre stressed metal elastic plate moreover the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2017 deals with the investigation of the harmonic forced vibration of the system consisting of an elastic plate compressible viscous fluid and rigid wall and it was established that the magnitude of the fluid viscosity on the frequency response of the interface pressure and velocity increases with decreasing of the fluid depth the dynamics of the moving load and dynamics of the harmonically oscillating moving load acting on the free face plane of the plate which is in contact with the compressible viscous fluid with finite depth were investigated in the papers by akbarov and ismailov 2015 and akbarov and ismailov 2016a b respectively in the paper by akbarov and huseynova 2019 the problem considered by akbarov and ismailov 2017 was developed for the case where the plate material is anisotropic orthotropic we recall as noted above that akbarov and ismailov 2018 studied the same problem for the case where the plate material is isotropic viscoelastic at the same time we recall that akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 studied the forced vibration of the system consisting of the moving plate compressible viscous fluid and rigid wall a more detailed review of the foregoing and other related investigations was made in the paper by akbarov 2018 moreover the results obtained in these works can be used as benchmarks for calculation of the interface pressure between the plate and fluid under dynamic loading of the fluid structure systems which were considered in the works by hadzalic et al 2018 kelvani et al 2013 mandal and maity 2015 and in many others indicated therein for illustration of the significance and novelty of the present investigations which relate to the harmonic forced vibration of the axially moving viscoelastic plate compressible viscous fluid rigid wall and according to the foregoing review regarding the investigations carried out within the scope of the exact equations of elastodynamics linearized elastodynamics and linearized navier stokes equations we attempt to distinguish the following types of problems with respect to the forces acting on the plate and with respect to the plate state on which the forces act thus it follows from these investigations that with respect to the force acting on the plate there are cases where the force is time harmonic i moving ii and moving time harmonic iii however with respect to the plate state two cases can be considered where the plate does not move in the absolute rigid body sense a and where the plate moves axially with constant velocity also in the sense of the absolute rigid body b up to now the cases i ii and iii have been considered for the a state in the aforementioned papers by akbarov and ismailov 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 however the state b has only been considered for the case i in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 at the same time it follows from the foregoing review that the investigations mentioned above can also be classified with respect to the plate material such as elastic highly elastic isotropic anisotropic and viscoelastic note that in all the investigations except the investigations carried out in the paper by akbarov and huseynova 2019 the cases were considered the case where the plate material is isotropic moreover in all the investigations except the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2018 it was assumed that the properties of the plate s material is time independent according to the foregoing classification it can be concluded that in the present paper the state b is considered for the case i within the scope of the assumption of the viscoelasticity of the plate material i e the case is considered where the time harmonic force acts on the viscoelastic axially moving plate which is in contact with the compressible viscous fluid with finite depth the plane strain state in the plate and the plane flow of the fluid are considered the motion of the plate is described with the exact linear equations and relations of the visco elastodynamics and the fluid flow is described by the linearized navier stokes equations the significance of the subject of the present investigation also follows from the following experimental results townsend et al 2018 experimented with various composite materials used in hulls of high speed crafts during these experiments they observed that the use of viscoelastic layers caused a significant reduction in the impact damage rate and that the viscoelastic material absorbed the impact energy borges et al 2014 investigated to reducing vibrations in steel catenary risers by the use of viscoelastic sandwich layers in their paper they concluded that the use of viscoelastic layers in steel catenary risers results in a large increase in damping the vibrations creation of the fundamental theoretical base to understand the foregoing experimental results and to predict and prevent catastrophic dangers in hulls of high speed crafts and submarines fabricated using viscoelastic materials necessitates investigation of the problems such as those considered in the present paper 2 formulation of the problem consider the hydro viscoelastic system consisting of the viscoelastic plate which moves with constant velocity v compressible viscous fluid and rigid wall and we associate the cartesian coordinate system o x 1 x 2 x 3 with the plate s free face plane and assume that this system moves with the plate and the direction of this moving coincides with the o x 1 axis direction moreover we introduce the additional cartesian system of coordinates o 0 x 10 x 20 x 30 which is also associated with the plate s free face plane however this coordinate system is a fixed one and does not move with the plate the aforementioned hydro viscoelastic system and associated coordinate systems are illustrated in the sketch in fig 1 in introducing the coordinate systems it is assumed that the directions of the o x 3 and o 0 x 30 axes are perpendicular to the o x 1 x 2 or o 0 x 10 x 20 plane and therefore these axes are not shown in fig 1 and the plane strain state in the plate and the plane flow of the fluid take place in the o x 1 x 2 or o 0 x 10 x 20 plane thus within this framework we can conclude that the plate occupies the region x 1 h x 2 0 and the fluid occupies the region x 1 h d h x 2 h and there exists the following relation between the coordinates x i and x i 0 1 x 1 x 10 v t x 2 x 20 where t is the time the velocities of the fluid flow caused by the plate moving load can be presented as 2 v 1 0 v x 20 h d v h h d 1 v 2 0 0 in the coordinate system o 0 x 10 x 20 we assume that in the system described above the time harmonic linearly located force act with intensity p 0 and this action causes certain perturbations in the fluid flow and plate moving and it is necessary to determine the values of these perturbations and the influence of the problem parameters such as the rheological properties of the plate material and plate moving velocity before perturbation etc on these values for this determination we use the following field equations and relations for describing the motion of the viscoelastic plate in the moving coordinate system o x 1 x 2 these equations and relations are 3 σ 11 x 1 σ 12 x 2 ρ 2 u 1 t 2 σ 12 x 1 σ 22 x 2 ρ 2 u 2 t 2 4 σ 11 λ 2 μ ε 11 λ ε 22 σ 22 λ ε 11 λ 2 μ ε 22 σ 12 2 μ ε 12 5 ε 11 u 1 x 1 ε 22 u 2 x 2 ε 12 1 2 u 1 x 2 u 2 x 1 where λ and μ are viscoelastic operators which are determined as follows 6 λ μ ϕ t λ 0 μ 0 ϕ t 0 t λ 1 μ 1 t τ ϕ τ d τ the equations in 3 are the equations of motion of the plate the equations in 4 are the constitutive relations of the plate material i e the relations which connect the stresses and strains and the equations in 5 are the geometrical relations which illustrate the relations between the strains and displacements in 6 λ 0 and μ 0 are the values of lame s constants at t 0 and λ 1 t and μ 1 t are the corresponding kernel functions of the plate material s hereditary properties note that these functions characterize the viscosity properties of the plate material and are not related to the process of damage in the structure of the material moreover in 3 6 σ 11 σ 12 and σ 22 are components of the stress tensor ε 11 ε 12 and ε 22 are components of the strain tensor and u 1 and u 2 are components of the displacement vector for simplicity we attempt to explain the expression in 6 with respect to the uniaxial stress state in the non ageing viscoelastic material according to the boltzmann superposition principle for this type of viscoelastic material the relation between the stress and deformation can be presented as σ t 0 t j t τ d ε τ where the function j t is called the relaxation function employing partial integration we obtain σ t 0 t j t τ d ε τ 0 t j t τ d ε τ d τ d τ j 0 ε τ 0 t d j t τ d τ ε τ d τ according to the mechanical consideration it must be that j 0 ε 0 where ε 0 is the instantaneous value of the modulus of elasticity at t 0 introducing the notation k t d j t d t the relation σ t 0 t j t τ d ε τ can be rewritten as σ t e 0 ε τ 0 t k t τ ε τ d τ note that the relaxation function j t is determined experimentally for each selected viscoelastic material separately from which the derivative of the relaxation function k t is also determined in a similar manner the relations in 6 are also obtained and the kernel functions λ 1 t and μ 1 t in these relations are determined the meaning of which follows from this determination now according to guz 2009 we write the governing field equations and relations for the fluid flow in the fixed coordinate system o 0 x 10 x 20 7 ρ 0 1 v 1 t ρ 0 1 v 1 0 x 20 v 1 x 10 μ 1 2 v 1 x 10 2 2 v 1 x 20 2 λ 1 μ 1

before perturbation v 1 and v 2 are the components of the velocity vector in the perturbed state p 1 is the perturbation of the pressure t 11 t 12 and t 22 are components of the stress tensor in the fluid e 11 e 12 and e 22 are components of the strain velocity tensor a 0 is the sound speed in the fluid μ 1 is a viscosity coefficient and λ 1 is a second viscosity coefficient upper index 1 in 7 is used for distinguishing the mechanical constants and pressure related to the fluid note that the first two equations in 7 are the linearized navier stokes equations the third equation in 7 is the linearized equation of the continuity the equations in the fourth line in 7 are the constitutive or rheological relations for the fluid and the relations in the fifth line in 7 are the relations between the components of the strain velocity tensor and components of the velocity vector thus within the framework of the foregoing field equations and relations we assume satisfaction of the boundary conditions 8 on the upper face plane of the plate compatibility conditions 9 on the interface plane between the plate and fluid and impermeability conditions 10 on the rigid wall 8 σ 21 t x 1

formulation of the problem under consideration note that this formulation in particular cases coincides with the corresponding formulations made in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 and akbarov and ismailov 2018 namely i if we assume v 0 in equations 1 and 2 and in the compatibility conditions 9 and also assume that v 1 0 x 20 0 which follows from the assumption v 0 in the linearized navier stokes equations in 7 then the present formulation coincides with the formulation made in the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2018 ii if we assume λ c o n s t and μ c o n s t lame constants are the constitutive relations in 4 instead of the operators λ and μ which are determined by equations in 6 respectively then the present formulation coincides with the formulation made in the paper by akbarov and panakhli 2015 3 method of solution according to the time harmonic character of the external forces the sought values related to the plate and the sought values related to the fluid can be represented as follows 11 u k x 1 x 2 t u k x 1 x 2 e i ω t ε k n x 1 x 2 t ε k n x 1 x 2 e i ω t ε x 1 x 2 t ε x 1 x 2 e i ω t v k x 1 x 2 t v k x 1 x 2 e i ω t e k n x 1 x 2 t e k n x 1 x 2 e i ω t e x 1 x 2 t e x 1 x 2 e i ω t k n 1 2 below the over bar will be omitted on the amplitudes of the sought quantities using the expressions in 11 in equations 4 and 6 and doing the corresponding mathematical transformations the following relations instead of 4 and 6 are obtained 12 σ k n λ ω ε x 1 x 2 δ k n 2 m ω ε k n x 1 x 2 e i ω t 13 λ ω λ 0 λ 1 c ω i λ 1 s ω m ω μ 0 μ 1 c ω i μ 1 s ω where 14 λ 1 c ω μ 1 c ω 0 λ 1 s μ 1 s cos ω s d s λ 1 s ω μ 1 s ω 0 λ 1 s μ 1 s sin ω s d s thus in this way we obtain the complete system of field equations and relations 3 12 14 and 5 for determination of the amplitudes of the sought values related to the viscoelastic plate now we consider the transformation of the field equations related to the fluid flow and after this consideration we will again turn to the solution of the equations related to the plate motion as noted above the equations in 7 are written in the fixed coordinate system o 0 x 10 x 20 however the field equations related to the plate motion 3 12 14 are written with respect to the coordinate system o x 1 x 2 which is fixed on the plate s upper plane and moves with the plate with respect to the rigid wall or with respect to the coordinate system o 0 x 10 x 20 using the relations in 1 the equality can be written g x 10 x 20 g x 1 v t x 2 g x 1 x 2 below the over symbol will be omitted according to which we can rewrite the field equations in 7 and the compatibility 9 and impermeability 10 conditions in the moving coordinate system o x 1 x 2 it should be noted that under this rewriting the derivatives t x 10 and x 20 in 7 must be replaced with t v x 1 x 1 and x 2 respectively thus as a result of these transformations we obtain the following equations instead of those written in 7 15 ρ 0 1 v 1 t ρ 0 1 v

at the same time we obtain the following compatibility and impermeability conditions instead of the conditions given in 9 and 10 respectively 16 u 1 t x 1 x 2 t x 2 h v 1 t x 1 x 2 x 2 h u 2 t x 1 x 2

into the equation in 15 and into the conditions in 16 and 17 we obtain the corresponding equations and conditions for determination of the amplitudes related to the fluid in the moving coordinate system o x 1 x 2 thus after the foregoing transformation we employ the exponential fourier transformation 18 f f s x 2 f x 1 x 2 e i s x 1 d x 1 to all the equations and relations obtained for the amplitudes of the sought values related not only to the fluid flow but also to the plate motion as a result we obtain the following equations and relations for the fourier transforms of the amplitudes of the sought values related to the viscoelastic plate 19 i s σ 11 f d σ 12 f d x 2 ρ ω 2 u 1 f 0 i s σ 12 f d σ 22 f d x 2 ρ ω 2 u 2 f 0 σ 11 f λ ω 2 μ ω ε 11 f λ ω ε 22 f σ 22 f λ ω ε 11 f λ ω 2 μ ω

attempt to find the solution to the system of equations in 19 which can be reduced to the following one 23 a u 1 f b d u 2 f d x 2 c d 2 u 1 f d x 2 2 0 d u 2 f b d u 1 f d x 2 g d 2 u 2 f d x 2 2 0 where 24 a x 2 s 2 λ ω 2 μ ω b s λ ω μ ω c μ ω d x 2 s 2 μ ω g λ ω 2 μ ω x 2 ω 2 h 2 c 2 2 c 2 μ 0 ρ where λ ω and μ ω are determined in the expressions in 13 thus after some obvious mathematical manipulations and using the notation 25 a 0 a g b 2 c d c g b 0 b d c g k 1 a 0 2 a 0 2 4 b 0 k 2 a 0 2 a 0 2 4 b 0 the solution to equation 23 can be written as follows 26 u 2 f z 1 e k 1 x 2 z 2 e k

expressions 26 and 19 the fourier transforms of the strains and stresses in the plate are also obtained consider also determination of the fourier transforms of the quantities related to the fluid for which we attempt to solve the equations in 20 however to find the analytical solution to these equations is not so simple because this system contains the variable coefficient v 1 0 x 2 and so we employ the discrete analytical solution method developed and employed in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 akbarov and bagirov 2019a b akbarov et al 2019 and akbarov et al 2018 and also detailed in the monograph by akbarov 2015 according to this method the region s h d h x 2 h occupied by the fluid is divided into the certain m number of sub regions 28 s k k h d m h x 2 k 1 h d m h k 1 2 m s k 1 m s k after this division we assume that within each sub region the fluid moving velocity is constant and the value of this constant is determined through the following expression 29 v 1 0 k v 1 0 x 2 x 2 h 2 k 1 h d 2 m substituting the constant v 1 0 k instead of the function v 1 0 x 2 in the equations and relations in 20 we obtain the corresponding equations and relations with constant coefficients for each aforementioned sub region moreover we write the corresponding contact conditions between these sub regions and in this way the solution to the equations with variable coefficients is reduced to the solution of the series of equations with constant coefficients as obtaining the expression of these equations and contact conditions between the sub regions is evident and as these expressions are given in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 therefore here we do not give explicit expressions of the equations and conditions thus after doing the foregoing procedures according to guz 2009 to solve the equations obtained for each sub region we use the presentation of the velocities and the pressure in the k t h sub region through the fourier transform of the potentials ϕ f k and ψ f k as follows 30 v 1 f k i s ϕ f k d ψ f k d x 2 v 2 k d ϕ f k d x 2 i s ψ f k p f k 1 ρ 0 1 λ 1 2 μ 1 ρ 0 1 δ f i ω s v 1 k ϕ f k where these potentials are determined from the following equations 31 1 λ 1 2 μ 1 a 0 2 ρ 0 1 i ω s v 1 k δ f ω s v 1 k 2 a 0 2 ϕ f k 0 ν 1 δ f i ω s v 1 k ψ f k 0 δ f s 2 2 x 2 2 in 31 ν 1 μ 1 ρ 0 1 is the kinematic viscosity note that in 30 31 and below the k index denotes belonging of the corresponding quantity to the k t h sub region using the notation 32 ϕ f ω s v 1 k h 2 ϕ f ψ f ω s v 1 k h 2 ψ f and assuming that λ 1 2 μ 1 3 we obtain from 31 and 32 the following equations for unknown functions ϕ f x 2 and ψ f x 2 in 32 33 d 2 ϕ f k d x 2 2 ω 1 2 1 i 4 ω 1 2 3 n w 2 s 2 ϕ f k 0 d 2 ψ f k d x 2 2 s 2 i n w 2 ψ f k 0 in 33 the following notation is used 34 ω 1 ω h a 0 h s v 1 k a 0 ω 10 ω 1 s ω 10 ω h a 0 ω 1 s h s v 1 k a 0 n w 2 ω h 2 ν 1 s v 1 k h 2 ν 1 n w 0 2 n w s 2 n w 0 2 ω h 2 ν 1 n w s 2 s v 1 k h 2 ν 1 note that assumption λ 1 2 μ 1 3 follows from the equality t 11 t 22 t 33 3 p where t 33 p 1 θ thus it follows from 7 that t 11 t 22 t 33 3 p 3 λ 1 2 3 μ 1 θ in order to satisfy the equality t 11 t 22 t 33 3 p it must be that λ 1 2 3 μ 1 0 from which it follows that λ 1 2 μ 1 3 employing the equations in 33 and the well known solution procedure for ordinary differential equations the functions ϕ f x 2 and ψ f x 2 are found as below ϕ f k z 5 k e δ 1 x 2 z 7 k e δ 1 x 2 ψ f k z 6 k e γ 1 x 2 z 8 k e γ 1 x 2 35 δ 1 s 2 ω 1 2 1 i 4 ω 1 2 3 n w 2 γ 1 s 2 i n w 2 substituting the expressions in 35 into the expressions in 32 and 30 we determine the fourier transforms of the fluid velocities as follows 36 v 1 f k ω s v 1 k h z 5 k s e δ 1 x 2 z 7 k s e δ 1 x 2 z 6 k e γ 1 x 2 z 8 k e γ 1 x 2 v 2 f k ω s v 1 k h z 5 k δ 1 e δ 1 x 2 z 7 k δ 1 e δ 1 x 2 z 6 k s e γ 1 x 2 z 8 k s e γ 1 x 2 finally using relations 30 and 20 the fourier transforms of all the sought values related to the fluid flow are determined completely the unknown constants z 5 k z 6 k z 7 k and z 8 k which enter into these expressions and the unknown constants z 1 z 2 z 3 and z 4 indicated in the expressions in 26 are determined from the corresponding contact and boundary conditions the fluid flow determined by the expressions 1 and 2 relates to the initial state i e before the action of the time harmonic forces on the upper face plane of the plate therefore the velocity field determined by 1 and 2 as well as the location of the sub regions into which is divided the region occupied by the fluid do not depend on the perturbations of the quantities related to the fluid and plate however the perturbation state depends on the fluid velocity state related to the initial state and is determined by expressions 1 and 2 in this way we completely determine the fourier transforms of the unknown functions related to each constituent of the hydro viscoelastic system under consideration after these procedures the steps for determination of the originals of the sought values begins and this determination is made numerically through calculation of the integrals 37 σ 22 σ 11 u 1 u 2 t 22 k t 11 k t 12 k v 1 k v 2

results through the analytic determination of the fourier transforms of the sought values and through the numerical calculation of the inverse fourier transforms by the integrals in 37 note that under these calculations the improper integral f s e i s x 1 d s in 39 is replaced by the corresponding definite integral s 1 s 1 f s e i s x 1 d s for which the values of s 1 are determined from the convergence requirement of the numerical results moreover note that under this calculation the integration interval s 1 s 1 is further divided into a certain number of shorter intervals which are used in the gauss integration algorithm and the values of the integrated expressions at the sample points are calculated through the algorithm discussed in the previous section all the calculation procedures are performed automatically with the pc programs constructed by the author in matlab as the convergence of the employed method with respect to the numbers m the number of sub regions n the number of short integrated intervals into which the integration interval s 1 s 1 is divided and s 1 is discussed in detail in the papers by akbarov and ismailov 2018 and akbarov and panaghli 2015 2017 therefore here we do not consider this question again nevertheless we note that all the numerical results which will be discussed below are obtained in the case where m 20 s 1 5 and n 2000 where the number m is determined in the numerical solution procedure from the convergence requirement of the numerical results with respect to the number of sub regions 4 numerical results and discussions to obtain concrete numerical results which will relate to the influence of the viscoelastic plate moving or the plate moving velocity on the interface stress and fluid velocities between the fluid and plate first we select the kernel functions μ 1 t and λ 1 t in 4 and 6 by using rabotnov s 1980 fractional exponential operator which can be presented as follows 38 μ ϕ t μ 0 ϕ t 3 β 0 2 1 ν 0 π α 3 β 0 2 1 ν 0 β ϕ t λ ϕ t λ 0 ϕ t β 0 1 ν 0 π α 3 β 0 2 1 ν 0 β ϕ t e ϕ t e 0 ϕ t β 0 π α β 0 β ϕ t ν ϕ t ν 0 ϕ t 1 2 ν 0 2 ν 0 β 0 π α β 0 β ϕ t where 39 π α x ϕ t 0 π α x t τ ϕ τ d τ π α x t t α p 0 x p t p 1 α γ 1 p 1 α 0 α 1 in 39 γ x is the gamma function and the constants α β 0 and β in 40 and 41 are the rheological parameters of the plate material note that under writing the expressions in 38 it is assumed that the volumetric expansion of the plate material is purely elastic according to which the following relation takes place 40 λ 2 3 μ ϕ t λ 0 2 3 μ 0 ϕ t where λ 0 2 3 μ 0 is the modulus of volume expansion we obtain from 13 14 38 and 40 that 41 μ c μ 0 1 3 2 1 ν 0 d β 01 1 π α c β 01 β ω μ c μ 0 3 2 1 ν 0 d β 01 1 π α s β 01 β ω π α c β 01 β ω ξ 2 ξ sin π α 2 ξ 2 2 ξ sin π α 2 1 π α

analyses made in the monographs by rabotnov 1980 akbarov 2015 and others listed therein we note that the rheological parameter α in 38 and 39 characterizes the mechanical behavior of the viscoelastic material in the near vicinity t 0 moreover it follows from the expressions 38 and 39 that the dimensions of the rheological parameters β and β 0 are the same and this dimension is t α 1 where t is a time dimension moreover in the foregoing monographs the following expressions of the long term values of the elastic constants of the plate material are established 43 λ lim t λ λ 0 1 1 1 ν 0 1 3 2 1 ν 0 d ν lim t ν ν 0 1 1 2 ν 0 2 ν 0 1 1 d ν lim t ν ν 0 1 1 2 ν 0 2 ν 0 1 1 d μ lim t μ μ 0 1 3 2 1 ν 0 1 3 2 1 ν 0 d e lim t e e 0 1 1 1 d in 43 the notation is introduced 44 d β β 0 through which the long term values of the elastic constants of the plate material can be characterized consequently the ratio β β 0 of the rheological parameters β and β 0 characterizes the long term values of the elastic constants moreover according to the monograph by rabotnov 1980 the values of the time calculated through the expressions 45 t r β 1 α 1 t c 3 2 1 ν 0 β 0 β 1 α 1 can be taken as the characteristic relaxation time t r and characteristic creep time t c it follows from expression q in 42 and from expression t c in 45 that the dimensionless rheological parameter q can be presented as follows 46 q t c c 2 h consequently according to the expression 46 the parameter q characterizes the creep time of the viscoelastic material note that the values of the rheological parameters α β 0 and β are determined experimentally for instance in the paper by golub et al 2008 it was experimentally established that for polymer concrete these rheological parameters have the following values α 0 723778 β 0 β 0 18875 h α 1 and β 0 0 02598 h α 1 another example on the experimental determination of the values of the aforementioned rheological parameters for polymethyl methacrylate is given in the paper by kaminskii and selivanov 2005 according to which these values are α 0 53 β 0 β 49 d a y α 1 and β 0 0 98 d a y α 1 these and other data given in the monograph by rabotnov 1980 allow us to select the values for the dimensionless rheological parameters α q and d moreover in the theoretical sense selection of the values for the parameters α q and d follows from the physico mechanical considerations according to which an increase a decrease in the values of the dimensionless rheological parameters d and q means a decrease an increase in the magnitude of the influence of the material viscosity on the deformation procedure thus according to the foregoing discussions through the dimensionless rheological parameters α q and d we study the influence of the plate material viscoelasticity on the frequency response of the interface stress and velocities in the case where the plate moves with constant velocity note that under this consideration we assume that α 0 5 and consider only the aforementioned influence caused by the parameters q and d this completes the selection of the viscoelastic operators and dimensionless rheological parameters which characterize the viscoelasticity of the plate material for obtaining concrete numerical results it is assumed that the values of the lame constants at t 0 and the plate material density are selected as those of lucite i e we assume that μ 0 1 86 10 9 p a and λ 0 3 96 10 9 p a and the density ρ 0 1160 k g m 3 guz and makhort 2000 but the material of the fluid is glycerin with viscosity coefficient μ 1 1 393 k g m s density ρ 0 1 1260 k g m 3 and sound speed a 0 1927 m s guz 2009 moreover we assume that h 0 01 m and h d h 2 and consider the frequency response of the interface stress and velocities calculated at the point x 1 h 0 and analyze the numerical results obtained within this framework we begin this analysis with the graphs given in figs 2 and 3 which show the frequency response of the dimensionless interface stress t 22 h p 0 and dimensionless velocity v 2 μ 0 h p 0 c 2 respectively note that these graphs are constructed in the case where d 1 and q 1 under ω t 0 the graphs grouped by the letter a and ω t π 2 the graphs grouped by the letter b under various values of the plate moving velocity v h among these graphs are the graphs obtained for the case where v h 0 which are also obtained in the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2018 consequently comparison of the present results obtained in the case where v h 0 with the corresponding ones obtained in the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2018 shows that they coincide with each other completely according to the physico mechanical consideration the results obtained in the cases where v h 0 must approach the corresponding ones obtained in the case where v h 0 with decreasing of the magnitude v h this consideration is confirmed with the results given in figs 2 and 3 the foregoing confirmation gives a certain guarantee on the reliability of the algorithm and pc programs which are used in the present investigations however this confirmation and the foregoing coinciding of the present results with the corresponding ones obtained in the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2018 are not enough to say that the reliability of the used algorithm is completely proven unfortunately we cannot find any other results in the literature for comparison with the present results moreover we cannot compare the present results obtained in particular cases with the corresponding results obtained in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 because the numerical results in the last two papers were obtained for the case where the material of the plate is steel the values of the mechanical constant of which do not coincide with the values of the corresponding ones of the plate material at t 0 as selected in the present paper nevertheless in the qualitative sense the results illustrated in figs 2 and 3 agree with the corresponding results obtained in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 this agreement can also be taken as further confirmation of the used calculation algorithm therefore we are forced to restrict ourselves with the foregoing confirmations in the sense of the reliability of the calculation algorithm moreover it follows from figs 2 and 3 that there exists a certain critical frequency denote it by ω c r under which the absolute values of the velocity and stress under consideration have jumps i e the resonance type phenomenon takes place in the quantitative sense these results show that the moving of the plate causes to decrease the absolute values of the interface stress and the magnitude of this decrease increases with the plate moving velocity v h however the character of the influence of this velocity on the fluid flow velocity on the interface plane has a complicated character so that around the critical frequency the plate moving causes to increase the absolute values of the fluid flow velocity however after a certain value of the vibration frequency of the external force acting on the plate the fluid flow velocity decreases with the moving velocity of the plate besides all this the results given in figs 2 and 3 show that the values of the critical frequency approach zero as the plate moving velocity approaches zero i e ω c r 0 as v h 0 note that all the foregoing conclusions made above agree in the qualitative sense with the corresponding ones made in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 this situation proves again the validity of the algorithm and pc programs used in the present investigation one of the main particularities of the viscoelasticity of the plate material as well as of the viscosity of the fluid is their influence on the change of the studied quantities with respect to the vibration phase ω t of the external forces it is known that see the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2017 if the fluid is inviscid and the plate material is purely elastic then the velocities the stress have their absolute maximum in the case where ω t π 2 ω t 0 and in the case where ω t π 2 ω t 0 the stress is equal to zero the velocities are equal to zero however in the case where the fluid is viscous the foregoing values of the vibration phases under which the stress and velocities have their absolute maximum or zero have an insignificant change moreover it is known that see the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2018 the viscoelasticity of the plate material also changes the vibration phase noted above as well in the work by akbarov and panakhli 2017 it was established that the plate moving velocity also influences the values of the vibration phases thus taking into consideration the foregoing conclusions made in the papers indicated above and by other authors it can be concluded that in the case under consideration the influence of the plate material viscoelasticity on the vibration phase under which the studied quantities have their absolute maximum and zeros must be more considerable for confirmation of this prediction we analyze the graphs given in figs 4 6 which show the change of t 22 h p 0 v 2 μ 0 h p 0 c 2 and v 1 μ 0 h p 0 c 2 respectively with respect to the vibration phase ω t in the case where ω 100 h z and v h 1250 1 sec under various values of the rheological parameters d and q note that in these figures the graphs grouped by the letter a are constructed for various values of the parameter d under q 5 however the graphs grouped by the letter b are constructed for various values of the parameter q under d 1 recall that the rheological parameter d characterizes the long term values of the mechanical properties however the rheological parameter q characterizes the creep time of the plate material and a decrease in the values of these parameters means an increase of the viscosity properties of the plate material therefore it follows from the graphs given in figs 4 6 that the aforementioned change of the vibration phases under which the studied stress and velocities have their absolute maximum and zeros becomes more considerable with decreasing of the values of the rheological parameters d and q note that this considerable increase of the indicated influence is also caused with the plate moving velocity moreover it follows from the results given in these figures that in the considered cases the influence of the rheological parameter d on the vibration phase is more considerable than that of the rheological parameter q though the change of the vibration phase of the external force significantly influences the frequency response of the studied quantities we consider below the influence of the parameters d and q on these responses only in the cases where ω t 0 and ω t π 2 this is because these values of the vibration phases are also selected in the previous papers related to investigations of the frequency responses of the interface stress and velocities thus we consider the graphs given in figs 7 10 which show the frequency response of the interface dimensionless stress t 22 h p 0 in the cases where v h 750 1 sec figs 7 and 8 and v h 1250 1 sec figs 9 and 10 under ω t 0 figs 7 and 9 and ω t π 2 figs 8 and 10 for various values of the rheological parameters d and q note that in these figures the graphs grouped by the letter a show the influence of the rheological parameter d under q 5 however the graphs grouped by the letter b show the influence of the rheological parameter q under d 1 on the considered frequency responses the graphs given in figs 7 10 show that there exists a certain frequency domain denote it as 0 ω ω under which the dependence between the stress t 22 h p 0 and ω is non monotonic and in general a decrease in the values of the parameter d causes to increase the absolute values of the stress moreover these results show that in this domain of the frequency with the parameter d the values of the stress approach the corresponding values of those obtained for the case where the plate material is purely elastic however in the frequency domain ω ω 400 h z the character of the influence of the rheological parameter depends on the values of the frequency as well as on the values of the vibration phase of the external force for instance in the case before a certain value of the frequency denote it by ω ω the absolute values of the stress obtained for the viscoelastic moving plate are greater than the corresponding ones obtained for the purely elastic moving plate however in the cases where ω ω the plate material viscosity causes to decrease the absolute values of the stress and the magnitude of this decrease increases with decreasing of the rheological parameter d also note that the frequency ω increases with the parameter d analysis of the graphs grouped by the letter b and obtained in the case where ω t 0 shows that the influence of the rheological parameter q on the values of the stress in the case where 0 ω ω has a complicated character however in the case where ω ω 400 h z the absolute values of the stress under consideration increase with decreasing of the values of the parameter q it follows from observation of the graphs constructed in the case where ω t π 2 for various values of the parameter d that in all the frequencies and in all the considered values of this parameter in the cases where ω ω the absolute values of the stress decrease monotonically with ω and with decreasing of d however in this case the influence of the parameter q on the frequency response of the stress has a more complicated character as shown in figs 8b and 10b comparison of the results obtained under v h 750 1 sec figs 7 and 8 with the corresponding ones obtained in the case where v h 1250 1 sec figs 9 and 10 shows that the frequency domain 0 ω ω i e the frequency ω increases with the plate moving velocity now we consider the influence of the parameters d and q on the frequency response of the velocity v 2 μ 0 h p 0 c 2 the graphs of which are given in figs 11 14 these graphs are constructed in the cases where v h 750 1 sec figs 11 and 12 and v h 1250 1 sec figs 13 and 14 for various values of the rheological parameter d under q 5 the graphs grouped by the letter a and for various values of the parameter q under d 1 the graphs grouped by the letter b moreover these graphs are constructed in the cases where ω t 0 figs 11 and 13 and ω t π 2 figs 12 and 14 analyses of these graphs allow us to conclude that the considered frequency responses illustrating the influence of the rheological parameter d on these responses in the qualitative sense are similar to those obtained for the purely elastic plate case in general in the frequency domain ω ω a decrease in values of the parameter d causes to increase in the absolute values of the interface stress and velocities however there sometimes appears a violation of this rule for instance in fig 13a the values of the velocity calculated in the case where d 0 25 become less than those obtained for the case where d 0 5 this situation can be explained by the complicated character of the frequency responses of the velocities calculated at ω t 0 moreover during the transition from the frequency region ω ω to the frequency region ω ω there exists some transitional frequency domain after which the character of the influence of the parameter d on the values of the velocities is steadied apparently in the case under consideration the aforementioned transitional frequency domain is not yet finished and will be finished under ω 400 h z however the character of the influence of the rheological parameter q on the frequency responses has a complicated character which is illustrated through the graphs grouped by the letter b at the same time it should be noted that the influence is more considerable and visible in the case where ω t π 2 comparison of the results given in fig 12a with the corresponding ones given in fig 14a shows that the values of the frequency ω at which the absolute values of the velocity become maximum increase with the plate moving velocity moreover comparison of the results given in fig 11a with the corresponding ones given in fig 13a shows that the values of the frequency increase with the plate moving velocity after which the considered velocity graphs are higher than the graph constructed for the purely elastic plate this completes the analyses of the numerical results under the investigations carried out above it was quietly assumed that the considered couette flow in the initial state before the action of the external time harmonic forces on the free face plane of the plate is laminar for which according to paolo et al 2015 the reynolds number re ρ 0 1 v h d μ 1 must be less than 1000 as we considered the case where h 0 01 m h d 0 02 m and the selected maximum value of v h is 1250 h z therefore in the cases under consideration for a selected fluid glycerin by direct calculation of re ρ 0 1 v h d μ 1 we obtain the maximum value of the reynolds number as equal to 300 consequently the laminar flow of the fluid is provided in the initial state as noted above all the foregoing results are obtained for the case where h 0 01 m and h d 0 02 m nevertheless the obtained results and their analyses give a lot of new information on the influence of the viscoelasticity of the plate material on the dynamics of considered types of plate fluid systems and the results may be useful in the qualitative sense for other possible values of h and h d however for more accurate results on the influence of the values of h and h d on the studied dynamic process corresponding additional numerical investigations are required which will be considered in future works by the author 5 conclusions thus in the present paper the time harmonic forced vibration of the axially moving viscoelastic plate in contact with compressible viscous fluid with finite depth is considered the exact equations of the theory of visco elastodynamics in the plane strain case are employed for describing the motion of the plate however for describing the fluid flow linearized navier stokes equations are employed for solution to the corresponding mathematical problems the exponential fourier transform with respect to the x 1 coordinate fig 1 is employed and for finding the analytical expressions of the fourier transforms of the sought values the discrete analytical solution method is employed the originals of the fluid flow velocities and stresses are found numerically for which the corresponding calculation algorithm and pc programs are developed under concrete numerical investigations the viscoelasticity of the plate material is described by rabotnov s fractional exponential operators and the dimensionless rheological parameters d and q are introduced which characterize the long term values of the mechanical properties and the characteristic creep time respectively of the plate material the main aim of these investigations is to determine how these dimensionless rheological parameters influence the frequency responses of the stress and the velocities on the interface plane between the fluid and viscoelastic plate as a result of the analysis of these results the following concrete conclusions can be drawn as in the purely elastic case there exists a critical frequency at which jumps of the studied quantities take place and the magnitude of these jumps increases with decreasing of the rheological parameters d and q the viscoelasticity of the plate material causes to increase the critical frequencies the values of the vibration phase at which the interface stresses and velocities have their maximums and minimums depend significantly on the rheological parameters d and q we recall that the parameters d and q characterize the long time values of the mechanical constant and creep time respectively of the plate material i e a decrease an increase in the values of d and q means a decrease an increase in the long time values of the mechanical constants and in the values of the creep time of the plate material there exists a certain frequency denoted by ω before and after which the character of the influence of the rheological parameters on the studied frequency responses is different from each other consequently the character of the influence of the rheological parameters d and q on the studied frequency responses depends significantly on the vibration frequency of the external forces such character of the frequency responses caused namely by the moving of the plate with constant velocity v causes the term 2 ω h a 0 h s v 1 k a 0 to appear in the expression ω 1 2 in 33 the frequency ω increases with plate moving velocity and under ω t 0 in the frequency domain 0 ω ω the influence of the rheological parameter d on the values of the interface normal stress is more considerable than that of the rheological parameter q in the case where ω t π 2 under the frequency domain ω ω 400 h z the absolute values of the interface stresses and velocity increase monotonically with decreasing of the parameter d and with the frequency ω moreover with increasing of the parameter d the values approach the corresponding ones which are obtained for the case where the plate material is purely elastic in the case where ω t π 2 under the frequency domain ω ω 400 h z the character of the influence of the rheological parameter q on the values of the studied stress and velocity has a complicated character but nevertheless after a certain frequency a decrease in the values of this parameter also causes the values of the quantities to increase at the same time with the parameter q the values of the studied quantities approach those of the corresponding ones obtained for the case where the plate material is purely elastic credit authorship contribution statement tarık koçal conceptualization methodology software validation

21546,the present paper studies the dynamical behavior of the moving viscoelastic plate which is in contact with barotropic compressible viscous fluid with finite depth the time harmonic lineal

composite materials with a polymer matrix in the various leading branches of industry such as aeronautical nuclear chemical biological mechanical civil and especially marine and sub marine engineering requires detailed study of the dynamic interaction of the elements of constructions made of these materials with fluids as the polymers are time dependent materials it appears necessary to study the problems related to the dynamics of hydro viscoelastic systems one of which is the system consisting of a viscoelastic covering layer compressible viscous fluid and rigid wall the first attempt in this field was made in the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2018 in which the time harmonic forced vibration of the viscoelastic plate contacting the compressible viscous fluid with finite depth was studied another new aspect in the investigations related to the dynamics of hydro elastic systems is the taking into consideration of the moving of the plate which is in contact with the fluids the attempt in this field was made in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 in which the forced vibration of the moving elastic plate in contact with the viscous fluid was studied consequently the results obtained in these papers relate only to the cases where the plate material is purely elastic and cannot be used for the cases where this material is viscoelastic therefore in the present paper the attempt is made to study the forced vibration of the system consisting of the moving viscoelastic plate and of the compressible viscous fluid with finite depth and rigid wall a sketch of which is shown in fig 1 an explanation of the notation in this figure will be given below it is evident that the results of this investigation will further the development of the investigations carried out in the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2018 for the case where the plate moves axially with constant velocity and will also be a development of the investigations carried out in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 for the case where the material of the plate is a viscoelastic one the distinguishing characteristics of the present problem from those considered in the papers by akbarov and ismailov 2018 and akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 will be clearly described at the end of the next section in the historical aspect the dynamics the plate fluid systems was started with the paper by lamb 1921 in which the non dimensional added virtual mass incremental navmi method is employed for the study of the natural vibration of the circular elastic baffled plate in contact with still water after lamb 1921 in the papers by amabili and kwak 1996 and kwak and kim 1991 the aforementioned problem was solved with a more accurate approximation of the vibration mode moreover in the paper by mclachlan 1932 investigation of lamb s problem was developed for the free edge circular plate case however in these papers it was assumed that the plate is in contact with a semi infinite fluid on one side of the plate in the paper by amabili 1996 this semi infinite fluid condition was refused and it was assumed that the baffled circular and annular plates are in contact with the fluid which has a finite depth the same investigation for the free edge circular plate was carried out by kwak and han 2000 it should be noted that in all the foregoing works it is assumed that the fluid is inviscid and incompressible and the plate motion was described within the scope of the kirchhoff hypothesis unlike the foregoing investigations the paper by jeong and kim 2005 takes the compressibility of the inviscid fluid into consideration and the natural frequencies of a circular plate submerged in a bounded fluid were investigated the influence of the incompressible fluid viscosity on the frequency response of the rectangular cantilever plate submerged in an infinite fluid was investigated by atkinson and manrique de lara 2007 moreover kozlovsky 2009 developed lamb s problem for the viscous fluid case and studied the influence of this viscosity on the navmi coefficient the paper by sorokin and chubinskij 2008 investigated the role of fluid viscosity in wave propagation in the plate fluid system consisting of an infinite sandwich plate compressible viscous fluid and rigid wall however in this investigation the equations of motion of the plate are written by employing the approximate plate theories the equations for the motion of the face layers are written within the kirchhoff plate theory but for the motion of the middle layer they are written within the first order refined plate theory therefore this situation decreases significantly the analyzed range of the wave modes and corresponding dispersion curves for instance the results obtained in this paper cannot describe waves the length of which is less than the plate s layers thickness such description however can be made by the use of the exact equations of elastodynamics and linearized elastodynamics under linearized elastodynamics the three dimensional linearized theory of elastic waves in initially stressed bodies is understood the attempts in this field were made in the works by bagno and guz 1997 bagno 2015 and many others listed therein reviewed in the paper by guz et al 2016 and analyzed in the monograph by guz 2009 note that in these works infinite plate compressible viscous or inviscid fluid systems were considered and the plate motion is described by the equations and relations of the linearized elastodynamics obtained for the homogeneous uniaxial pre stressed plate case and the fluid flow is written by employing linearized navier stokes equations for instance in the paper by bagno et al 1994 the influence of the fluid viscosity on the wave propagation in the plate made of highly elastic compressible elastic material was studied and this plate has initial uniaxial homogeneous stress detailed analyses of the wave dispersion spectrum in the initially stressed compressible layer inviscid compressible fluid systems were made in the paper by bagno 2015 until six years ago there had not been any investigations related to the forced vibration of the plate fluid system carried out within the exact equations and relations of elastodynamics linearized elastodynamics or linearized navier stokes equations the first attempts in this field were made in the papers by akbarov and ismailov 2014 2015 2016a 2017 and 2018 akbarov and huseynova 2019 akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 and in others listed therein note that the paper akbarov and ismailov 2014 studied the harmonic forced vibration of the pre strained highly elastic plate under compressible viscous fluid loading in the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2016a b this study is developed for the pre stressed metal elastic plate moreover the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2017 deals with the investigation of the harmonic forced vibration of the system consisting of an elastic plate compressible viscous fluid and rigid wall and it was established that the magnitude of the fluid viscosity on the frequency response of the interface pressure and velocity increases with decreasing of the fluid depth the dynamics of the moving load and dynamics of the harmonically oscillating moving load acting on the free face plane of the plate which is in contact with the compressible viscous fluid with finite depth were investigated in the papers by akbarov and ismailov 2015 and akbarov and ismailov 2016a b respectively in the paper by akbarov and huseynova 2019 the problem considered by akbarov and ismailov 2017 was developed for the case where the plate material is anisotropic orthotropic we recall as noted above that akbarov and ismailov 2018 studied the same problem for the case where the plate material is isotropic viscoelastic at the same time we recall that akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 studied the forced vibration of the system consisting of the moving plate compressible viscous fluid and rigid wall a more detailed review of the foregoing and other related investigations was made in the paper by akbarov 2018 moreover the results obtained in these works can be used as benchmarks for calculation of the interface pressure between the plate and fluid under dynamic loading of the fluid structure systems which were considered in the works by hadzalic et al 2018 kelvani et al 2013 mandal and maity 2015 and in many others indicated therein for illustration of the significance and novelty of the present investigations which relate to the harmonic forced vibration of the axially moving viscoelastic plate compressible viscous fluid rigid wall and according to the foregoing review regarding the investigations carried out within the scope of the exact equations of elastodynamics linearized elastodynamics and linearized navier stokes equations we attempt to distinguish the following types of problems with respect to the forces acting on the plate and with respect to the plate state on which the forces act thus it follows from these investigations that with respect to the force acting on the plate there are cases where the force is time harmonic i moving ii and moving time harmonic iii however with respect to the plate state two cases can be considered where the plate does not move in the absolute rigid body sense a and where the plate moves axially with constant velocity also in the sense of the absolute rigid body b up to now the cases i ii and iii have been considered for the a state in the aforementioned papers by akbarov and ismailov 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 however the state b has only been considered for the case i in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 at the same time it follows from the foregoing review that the investigations mentioned above can also be classified with respect to the plate material such as elastic highly elastic isotropic anisotropic and viscoelastic note that in all the investigations except the investigations carried out in the paper by akbarov and huseynova 2019 the cases were considered the case where the plate material is isotropic moreover in all the investigations except the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2018 it was assumed that the properties of the plate s material is time independent according to the foregoing classification it can be concluded that in the present paper the state b is considered for the case i within the scope of the assumption of the viscoelasticity of the plate material i e the case is considered where the time harmonic force acts on the viscoelastic axially moving plate which is in contact with the compressible viscous fluid with finite depth the plane strain state in the plate and the plane flow of the fluid are considered the motion of the plate is described with the exact linear equations and relations of the visco elastodynamics and the fluid flow is described by the linearized navier stokes equations the significance of the subject of the present investigation also follows from the following experimental results townsend et al 2018 experimented with various composite materials used in hulls of high speed crafts during these experiments they observed that the use of viscoelastic layers caused a significant reduction in the impact damage rate and that the viscoelastic material absorbed the impact energy borges et al 2014 investigated to reducing vibrations in steel catenary risers by the use of viscoelastic sandwich layers in their paper they concluded that the use of viscoelastic layers in steel catenary risers results in a large increase in damping the vibrations creation of the fundamental theoretical base to understand the foregoing experimental results and to predict and prevent catastrophic dangers in hulls of high speed crafts and submarines fabricated using viscoelastic materials necessitates investigation of the problems such as those considered in the present paper 2 formulation of the problem consider the hydro viscoelastic system consisting of the viscoelastic plate which moves with constant velocity v compressible viscous fluid and rigid wall and we associate the cartesian coordinate system o x 1 x 2 x 3 with the plate s free face plane and assume that this system moves with the plate and the direction of this moving coincides with the o x 1 axis direction moreover we introduce the additional cartesian system of coordinates o 0 x 10 x 20 x 30 which is also associated with the plate s free face plane however this coordinate system is a fixed one and does not move with the plate the aforementioned hydro viscoelastic system and associated coordinate systems are illustrated in the sketch in fig 1 in introducing the coordinate systems it is assumed that the directions of the o x 3 and o 0 x 30 axes are perpendicular to the o x 1 x 2 or o 0 x 10 x 20 plane and therefore these axes are not shown in fig 1 and the plane strain state in the plate and the plane flow of the fluid take place in the o x 1 x 2 or o 0 x 10 x 20 plane thus within this framework we can conclude that the plate occupies the region x 1 h x 2 0 and the fluid occupies the region x 1 h d h x 2 h and there exists the following relation between the coordinates x i and x i 0 1 x 1 x 10 v t x 2 x 20 where t is the time the velocities of the fluid flow caused by the plate moving load can be presented as 2 v 1 0 v x 20 h d v h h d 1 v 2 0 0 in the coordinate system o 0 x 10 x 20 we assume that in the system described above the time harmonic linearly located force act with intensity p 0 and this action causes certain perturbations in the fluid flow and plate moving and it is necessary to determine the values of these perturbations and the influence of the problem parameters such as the rheological properties of the plate material and plate moving velocity before perturbation etc on these values for this determination we use the following field equations and relations for describing the motion of the viscoelastic plate in the moving coordinate system o x 1 x 2 these equations and relations are 3 σ 11 x 1 σ 12 x 2 ρ 2 u 1 t 2 σ 12 x 1 σ 22 x 2 ρ 2 u 2 t 2 4 σ 11 λ 2 μ ε 11 λ ε 22 σ 22 λ ε 11 λ 2 μ ε 22 σ 12 2 μ ε 12 5 ε 11 u 1 x 1 ε 22 u 2 x 2 ε 12 1 2 u 1 x 2 u 2 x 1 where λ and μ are viscoelastic operators which are determined as follows 6 λ μ ϕ t λ 0 μ 0 ϕ t 0 t λ 1 μ 1 t τ ϕ τ d τ the equations in 3 are the equations of motion of the plate the equations in 4 are the constitutive relations of the plate material i e the relations which connect the stresses and strains and the equations in 5 are the geometrical relations which illustrate the relations between the strains and displacements in 6 λ 0 and μ 0 are the values of lame s constants at t 0 and λ 1 t and μ 1 t are the corresponding kernel functions of the plate material s hereditary properties note that these functions characterize the viscosity properties of the plate material and are not related to the process of damage in the structure of the material moreover in 3 6 σ 11 σ 12 and σ 22 are components of the stress tensor ε 11 ε 12 and ε 22 are components of the strain tensor and u 1 and u 2 are components of the displacement vector for simplicity we attempt to explain the expression in 6 with respect to the uniaxial stress state in the non ageing viscoelastic material according to the boltzmann superposition principle for this type of viscoelastic material the relation between the stress and deformation can be presented as σ t 0 t j t τ d ε τ where the function j t is called the relaxation function employing partial integration we obtain σ t 0 t j t τ d ε τ 0 t j t τ d ε τ d τ d τ j 0 ε τ 0 t d j t τ d τ ε τ d τ according to the mechanical consideration it must be that j 0 ε 0 where ε 0 is the instantaneous value of the modulus of elasticity at t 0 introducing the notation k t d j t d t the relation σ t 0 t j t τ d ε τ can be rewritten as σ t e 0 ε τ 0 t k t τ ε τ d τ note that the relaxation function j t is determined experimentally for each selected viscoelastic material separately from which the derivative of the relaxation function k t is also determined in a similar manner the relations in 6 are also obtained and the kernel functions λ 1 t and μ 1 t in these relations are determined the meaning of which follows from this determination now according to guz 2009 we write the governing field equations and relations for the fluid flow in the fixed coordinate system o 0 x 10 x 20 7 ρ 0 1 v 1 t ρ 0 1 v 1 0 x 20 v 1 x 10 μ 1 2 v 1 x 10 2 2 v 1 x 20 2 λ 1 μ 1

before perturbation v 1 and v 2 are the components of the velocity vector in the perturbed state p 1 is the perturbation of the pressure t 11 t 12 and t 22 are components of the stress tensor in the fluid e 11 e 12 and e 22 are components of the strain velocity tensor a 0 is the sound speed in the fluid μ 1 is a viscosity coefficient and λ 1 is a second viscosity coefficient upper index 1 in 7 is used for distinguishing the mechanical constants and pressure related to the fluid note that the first two equations in 7 are the linearized navier stokes equations the third equation in 7 is the linearized equation of the continuity the equations in the fourth line in 7 are the constitutive or rheological relations for the fluid and the relations in the fifth line in 7 are the relations between the components of the strain velocity tensor and components of the velocity vector thus within the framework of the foregoing field equations and relations we assume satisfaction of the boundary conditions 8 on the upper face plane of the plate compatibility conditions 9 on the interface plane between the plate and fluid and impermeability conditions 10 on the rigid wall 8 σ 21 t x 1

formulation of the problem under consideration note that this formulation in particular cases coincides with the corresponding formulations made in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 and akbarov and ismailov 2018 namely i if we assume v 0 in equations 1 and 2 and in the compatibility conditions 9 and also assume that v 1 0 x 20 0 which follows from the assumption v 0 in the linearized navier stokes equations in 7 then the present formulation coincides with the formulation made in the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2018 ii if we assume λ c o n s t and μ c o n s t lame constants are the constitutive relations in 4 instead of the operators λ and μ which are determined by equations in 6 respectively then the present formulation coincides with the formulation made in the paper by akbarov and panakhli 2015 3 method of solution according to the time harmonic character of the external forces the sought values related to the plate and the sought values related to the fluid can be represented as follows 11 u k x 1 x 2 t u k x 1 x 2 e i ω t ε k n x 1 x 2 t ε k n x 1 x 2 e i ω t ε x 1 x 2 t ε x 1 x 2 e i ω t v k x 1 x 2 t v k x 1 x 2 e i ω t e k n x 1 x 2 t e k n x 1 x 2 e i ω t e x 1 x 2 t e x 1 x 2 e i ω t k n 1 2 below the over bar will be omitted on the amplitudes of the sought quantities using the expressions in 11 in equations 4 and 6 and doing the corresponding mathematical transformations the following relations instead of 4 and 6 are obtained 12 σ k n λ ω ε x 1 x 2 δ k n 2 m ω ε k n x 1 x 2 e i ω t 13 λ ω λ 0 λ 1 c ω i λ 1 s ω m ω μ 0 μ 1 c ω i μ 1 s ω where 14 λ 1 c ω μ 1 c ω 0 λ 1 s μ 1 s cos ω s d s λ 1 s ω μ 1 s ω 0 λ 1 s μ 1 s sin ω s d s thus in this way we obtain the complete system of field equations and relations 3 12 14 and 5 for determination of the amplitudes of the sought values related to the viscoelastic plate now we consider the transformation of the field equations related to the fluid flow and after this consideration we will again turn to the solution of the equations related to the plate motion as noted above the equations in 7 are written in the fixed coordinate system o 0 x 10 x 20 however the field equations related to the plate motion 3 12 14 are written with respect to the coordinate system o x 1 x 2 which is fixed on the plate s upper plane and moves with the plate with respect to the rigid wall or with respect to the coordinate system o 0 x 10 x 20 using the relations in 1 the equality can be written g x 10 x 20 g x 1 v t x 2 g x 1 x 2 below the over symbol will be omitted according to which we can rewrite the field equations in 7 and the compatibility 9 and impermeability 10 conditions in the moving coordinate system o x 1 x 2 it should be noted that under this rewriting the derivatives t x 10 and x 20 in 7 must be replaced with t v x 1 x 1 and x 2 respectively thus as a result of these transformations we obtain the following equations instead of those written in 7 15 ρ 0 1 v 1 t ρ 0 1 v

at the same time we obtain the following compatibility and impermeability conditions instead of the conditions given in 9 and 10 respectively 16 u 1 t x 1 x 2 t x 2 h v 1 t x 1 x 2 x 2 h u 2 t x 1 x 2

into the equation in 15 and into the conditions in 16 and 17 we obtain the corresponding equations and conditions for determination of the amplitudes related to the fluid in the moving coordinate system o x 1 x 2 thus after the foregoing transformation we employ the exponential fourier transformation 18 f f s x 2 f x 1 x 2 e i s x 1 d x 1 to all the equations and relations obtained for the amplitudes of the sought values related not only to the fluid flow but also to the plate motion as a result we obtain the following equations and relations for the fourier transforms of the amplitudes of the sought values related to the viscoelastic plate 19 i s σ 11 f d σ 12 f d x 2 ρ ω 2 u 1 f 0 i s σ 12 f d σ 22 f d x 2 ρ ω 2 u 2 f 0 σ 11 f λ ω 2 μ ω ε 11 f λ ω ε 22 f σ 22 f λ ω ε 11 f λ ω 2 μ ω

attempt to find the solution to the system of equations in 19 which can be reduced to the following one 23 a u 1 f b d u 2 f d x 2 c d 2 u 1 f d x 2 2 0 d u 2 f b d u 1 f d x 2 g d 2 u 2 f d x 2 2 0 where 24 a x 2 s 2 λ ω 2 μ ω b s λ ω μ ω c μ ω d x 2 s 2 μ ω g λ ω 2 μ ω x 2 ω 2 h 2 c 2 2 c 2 μ 0 ρ where λ ω and μ ω are determined in the expressions in 13 thus after some obvious mathematical manipulations and using the notation 25 a 0 a g b 2 c d c g b 0 b d c g k 1 a 0 2 a 0 2 4 b 0 k 2 a 0 2 a 0 2 4 b 0 the solution to equation 23 can be written as follows 26 u 2 f z 1 e k 1 x 2 z 2 e k

expressions 26 and 19 the fourier transforms of the strains and stresses in the plate are also obtained consider also determination of the fourier transforms of the quantities related to the fluid for which we attempt to solve the equations in 20 however to find the analytical solution to these equations is not so simple because this system contains the variable coefficient v 1 0 x 2 and so we employ the discrete analytical solution method developed and employed in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 akbarov and bagirov 2019a b akbarov et al 2019 and akbarov et al 2018 and also detailed in the monograph by akbarov 2015 according to this method the region s h d h x 2 h occupied by the fluid is divided into the certain m number of sub regions 28 s k k h d m h x 2 k 1 h d m h k 1 2 m s k 1 m s k after this division we assume that within each sub region the fluid moving velocity is constant and the value of this constant is determined through the following expression 29 v 1 0 k v 1 0 x 2 x 2 h 2 k 1 h d 2 m substituting the constant v 1 0 k instead of the function v 1 0 x 2 in the equations and relations in 20 we obtain the corresponding equations and relations with constant coefficients for each aforementioned sub region moreover we write the corresponding contact conditions between these sub regions and in this way the solution to the equations with variable coefficients is reduced to the solution of the series of equations with constant coefficients as obtaining the expression of these equations and contact conditions between the sub regions is evident and as these expressions are given in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 therefore here we do not give explicit expressions of the equations and conditions thus after doing the foregoing procedures according to guz 2009 to solve the equations obtained for each sub region we use the presentation of the velocities and the pressure in the k t h sub region through the fourier transform of the potentials ϕ f k and ψ f k as follows 30 v 1 f k i s ϕ f k d ψ f k d x 2 v 2 k d ϕ f k d x 2 i s ψ f k p f k 1 ρ 0 1 λ 1 2 μ 1 ρ 0 1 δ f i ω s v 1 k ϕ f k where these potentials are determined from the following equations 31 1 λ 1 2 μ 1 a 0 2 ρ 0 1 i ω s v 1 k δ f ω s v 1 k 2 a 0 2 ϕ f k 0 ν 1 δ f i ω s v 1 k ψ f k 0 δ f s 2 2 x 2 2 in 31 ν 1 μ 1 ρ 0 1 is the kinematic viscosity note that in 30 31 and below the k index denotes belonging of the corresponding quantity to the k t h sub region using the notation 32 ϕ f ω s v 1 k h 2 ϕ f ψ f ω s v 1 k h 2 ψ f and assuming that λ 1 2 μ 1 3 we obtain from 31 and 32 the following equations for unknown functions ϕ f x 2 and ψ f x 2 in 32 33 d 2 ϕ f k d x 2 2 ω 1 2 1 i 4 ω 1 2 3 n w 2 s 2 ϕ f k 0 d 2 ψ f k d x 2 2 s 2 i n w 2 ψ f k 0 in 33 the following notation is used 34 ω 1 ω h a 0 h s v 1 k a 0 ω 10 ω 1 s ω 10 ω h a 0 ω 1 s h s v 1 k a 0 n w 2 ω h 2 ν 1 s v 1 k h 2 ν 1 n w 0 2 n w s 2 n w 0 2 ω h 2 ν 1 n w s 2 s v 1 k h 2 ν 1 note that assumption λ 1 2 μ 1 3 follows from the equality t 11 t 22 t 33 3 p where t 33 p 1 θ thus it follows from 7 that t 11 t 22 t 33 3 p 3 λ 1 2 3 μ 1 θ in order to satisfy the equality t 11 t 22 t 33 3 p it must be that λ 1 2 3 μ 1 0 from which it follows that λ 1 2 μ 1 3 employing the equations in 33 and the well known solution procedure for ordinary differential equations the functions ϕ f x 2 and ψ f x 2 are found as below ϕ f k z 5 k e δ 1 x 2 z 7 k e δ 1 x 2 ψ f k z 6 k e γ 1 x 2 z 8 k e γ 1 x 2 35 δ 1 s 2 ω 1 2 1 i 4 ω 1 2 3 n w 2 γ 1 s 2 i n w 2 substituting the expressions in 35 into the expressions in 32 and 30 we determine the fourier transforms of the fluid velocities as follows 36 v 1 f k ω s v 1 k h z 5 k s e δ 1 x 2 z 7 k s e δ 1 x 2 z 6 k e γ 1 x 2 z 8 k e γ 1 x 2 v 2 f k ω s v 1 k h z 5 k δ 1 e δ 1 x 2 z 7 k δ 1 e δ 1 x 2 z 6 k s e γ 1 x 2 z 8 k s e γ 1 x 2 finally using relations 30 and 20 the fourier transforms of all the sought values related to the fluid flow are determined completely the unknown constants z 5 k z 6 k z 7 k and z 8 k which enter into these expressions and the unknown constants z 1 z 2 z 3 and z 4 indicated in the expressions in 26 are determined from the corresponding contact and boundary conditions the fluid flow determined by the expressions 1 and 2 relates to the initial state i e before the action of the time harmonic forces on the upper face plane of the plate therefore the velocity field determined by 1 and 2 as well as the location of the sub regions into which is divided the region occupied by the fluid do not depend on the perturbations of the quantities related to the fluid and plate however the perturbation state depends on the fluid velocity state related to the initial state and is determined by expressions 1 and 2 in this way we completely determine the fourier transforms of the unknown functions related to each constituent of the hydro viscoelastic system under consideration after these procedures the steps for determination of the originals of the sought values begins and this determination is made numerically through calculation of the integrals 37 σ 22 σ 11 u 1 u 2 t 22 k t 11 k t 12 k v 1 k v 2

results through the analytic determination of the fourier transforms of the sought values and through the numerical calculation of the inverse fourier transforms by the integrals in 37 note that under these calculations the improper integral f s e i s x 1 d s in 39 is replaced by the corresponding definite integral s 1 s 1 f s e i s x 1 d s for which the values of s 1 are determined from the convergence requirement of the numerical results moreover note that under this calculation the integration interval s 1 s 1 is further divided into a certain number of shorter intervals which are used in the gauss integration algorithm and the values of the integrated expressions at the sample points are calculated through the algorithm discussed in the previous section all the calculation procedures are performed automatically with the pc programs constructed by the author in matlab as the convergence of the employed method with respect to the numbers m the number of sub regions n the number of short integrated intervals into which the integration interval s 1 s 1 is divided and s 1 is discussed in detail in the papers by akbarov and ismailov 2018 and akbarov and panaghli 2015 2017 therefore here we do not consider this question again nevertheless we note that all the numerical results which will be discussed below are obtained in the case where m 20 s 1 5 and n 2000 where the number m is determined in the numerical solution procedure from the convergence requirement of the numerical results with respect to the number of sub regions 4 numerical results and discussions to obtain concrete numerical results which will relate to the influence of the viscoelastic plate moving or the plate moving velocity on the interface stress and fluid velocities between the fluid and plate first we select the kernel functions μ 1 t and λ 1 t in 4 and 6 by using rabotnov s 1980 fractional exponential operator which can be presented as follows 38 μ ϕ t μ 0 ϕ t 3 β 0 2 1 ν 0 π α 3 β

is assumed that the volumetric expansion of the plate material is purely elastic according to which the following relation takes place 40 λ 2 3 μ ϕ t λ 0 2 3 μ 0 ϕ t where λ 0 2 3 μ 0 is the modulus

analyses made in the monographs by rabotnov 1980 akbarov 2015 and others listed therein we note that the rheological parameter α in 38 and 39 characterizes the mechanical behavior of the viscoelastic material in the near vicinity t 0 moreover it follows from the expressions 38 and 39 that the dimensions of the rheological parameters β and β 0 are the same and this dimension is t α 1 where t is a time dimension moreover in the foregoing monographs the following expressions of the long term values of the elastic constants of the plate material are established 43 λ lim t λ λ 0 1 1 1 ν 0 1 3 2 1 ν 0 d ν lim t ν ν 0 1 1 2 ν 0 2 ν 0 1 1 d ν lim t ν ν 0 1 1 2 ν 0 2 ν 0 1 1 d μ lim t μ μ 0 1 3 2 1 ν 0 1 3 2 1 ν 0 d e lim t e e 0 1 1 1 d in 43 the notation is introduced 44 d β β 0 through which the long term values of the elastic constants of the plate material can be characterized consequently the ratio β β 0 of the rheological parameters β and β 0 characterizes the long term values of the elastic constants moreover according to the monograph by rabotnov 1980 the values of the time calculated through the expressions 45 t r β 1 α 1 t c 3 2 1 ν 0 β 0 β 1 α 1 can be taken as the characteristic relaxation time t r and characteristic creep time t c it follows from expression q in 42 and from expression t c in 45 that the dimensionless rheological parameter q can be presented as follows 46 q t c c 2 h consequently according to the expression 46 the parameter q characterizes the creep time of the viscoelastic material note that the values of the rheological parameters α β 0 and β are determined experimentally for instance in the paper by golub et al 2008 it was experimentally established that for polymer concrete these rheological parameters have the following values α 0 723778 β 0 β 0 18875 h α 1 and β 0 0 02598 h α 1 another example on the experimental determination of the values of the aforementioned rheological parameters for polymethyl methacrylate is given in the paper by kaminskii and selivanov 2005 according to which these values are α 0 53 β 0 β 49 d a y α 1 and β 0 0 98 d a y α 1 these and other data given in the monograph by rabotnov 1980 allow us to select the values for the dimensionless rheological parameters α q and d moreover in the theoretical sense selection of the values for the parameters α q and d follows from the physico mechanical considerations according to which an increase a decrease in the values of the dimensionless rheological parameters d and q means a decrease an increase in the magnitude of the influence of the material viscosity on the deformation procedure thus according to the foregoing discussions through the dimensionless rheological parameters α q and d we study the influence of the plate material viscoelasticity on the frequency response of the interface stress and velocities in the case where the plate moves with constant velocity note that under this consideration we assume that α 0 5 and consider only the aforementioned influence caused by the parameters q and d this completes the selection of the viscoelastic operators and dimensionless rheological parameters which characterize the viscoelasticity of the plate material for obtaining concrete numerical results it is assumed that the values of the lame constants at t 0 and the plate material density are selected as those of lucite i e we assume that μ 0 1 86 10 9 p a and λ 0 3 96 10 9 p a and the density ρ 0 1160 k g m 3 guz and makhort 2000 but the material of the fluid is glycerin with viscosity coefficient μ 1 1 393 k g m s density ρ 0 1 1260 k g m 3 and sound speed a 0 1927 m s guz 2009 moreover we assume that h 0 01 m and h d h 2 and consider the frequency response of the interface stress and velocities calculated at the point x 1 h 0 and analyze the numerical results obtained within this framework we begin this analysis with the graphs given in figs 2 and 3 which show the frequency response of the dimensionless interface stress t 22 h p 0 and dimensionless velocity v 2 μ 0 h p 0 c 2 respectively note that these graphs are constructed in the case where d 1 and q 1 under ω t 0 the graphs grouped by the letter a and ω t π 2 the graphs grouped by the letter b under various values of the plate moving velocity v h among these graphs are the graphs obtained for the case where v h 0 which are also obtained in the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2018 consequently comparison of the present results obtained in the case where v h 0 with the corresponding ones obtained in the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2018 shows that they coincide with each other completely according to the physico mechanical consideration the results obtained in the cases where v h 0 must approach the corresponding ones obtained in the case where v h 0 with decreasing of the magnitude v h this consideration is confirmed with the results given in figs 2 and 3 the foregoing confirmation gives a certain guarantee on the reliability of the algorithm and pc programs which are used in the present investigations however this confirmation and the foregoing coinciding of the present results with the corresponding ones obtained in the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2018 are not enough to say that the reliability of the used algorithm is completely proven unfortunately we cannot find any other results in the literature for comparison with the present results moreover we cannot compare the present results obtained in particular cases with the corresponding results obtained in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 because the numerical results in the last two papers were obtained for the case where the material of the plate is steel the values of the mechanical constant of which do not coincide with the values of the corresponding ones of the plate material at t 0 as selected in the present paper nevertheless in the qualitative sense the results illustrated in figs 2 and 3 agree with the corresponding results obtained in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 this agreement can also be taken as further confirmation of the used calculation algorithm therefore we are forced to restrict ourselves with the foregoing confirmations in the sense of the reliability of the calculation algorithm moreover it follows from figs 2 and 3 that there exists a certain critical frequency denote it by ω c r under which the absolute values of the velocity and stress under consideration have jumps i e the resonance type phenomenon takes place in the quantitative sense these results show that the moving of the plate causes to decrease the absolute values of the interface stress and the magnitude of this decrease increases with the plate moving velocity v h however the character of the influence of this velocity on the fluid flow velocity on the interface plane has a complicated character so that around the critical frequency the plate moving causes to increase the absolute values of the fluid flow velocity however after a certain value of the vibration frequency of the external force acting on the plate the fluid flow velocity decreases with the moving velocity of the plate besides all this the results given in figs 2 and 3 show that the values of the critical frequency approach zero as the plate moving velocity approaches zero i e ω c r 0 as v h 0 note that all the foregoing conclusions made above agree in the qualitative sense with the corresponding ones made in the papers by akbarov and panakhli 2015 2017 this situation proves again the validity of the algorithm and pc programs used in the present investigation one of the main particularities of the viscoelasticity of the plate material as well as of the viscosity of the fluid is their influence on the change of the studied quantities with respect to the vibration phase ω t of the external forces it is known that see the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2017 if the fluid is inviscid and the plate material is purely elastic then the velocities the stress have their absolute maximum in the case where ω t π 2 ω t 0 and in the case where ω t π 2 ω t 0 the stress is equal to zero the velocities are equal to zero however in the case where the fluid is viscous the foregoing values of the vibration phases under which the stress and velocities have their absolute maximum or zero have an insignificant change moreover it is known that see the paper by akbarov and ismailov 2018 the viscoelasticity of the plate material also changes the vibration phase noted above as well in the work by akbarov and panakhli 2017 it was established that the plate moving velocity also influences the values of the vibration phases thus taking into consideration the foregoing conclusions made in the papers indicated above and by other authors it can be concluded that in the case under consideration the influence of the plate material viscoelasticity on the vibration phase under which the studied quantities have their absolute maximum and zeros must be more considerable for confirmation of this prediction we analyze the graphs given in figs 4 6 which show the change of t 22 h p 0 v 2 μ 0 h p 0 c 2 and v 1 μ 0 h p 0 c 2 respectively with respect to the vibration phase ω t in the case where ω 100 h z and v h 1250 1 sec under various values of the rheological parameters d and q note that in these figures the graphs grouped by the letter a are constructed for various values of the parameter d under q 5 however the graphs grouped by the letter b are constructed for various values of the parameter q under d 1 recall that the rheological parameter d characterizes the long term values of the mechanical properties however the rheological parameter q characterizes the creep time of the plate material and a decrease in the values of these parameters means an increase of the viscosity properties of the plate material therefore it follows from the graphs given in figs 4 6 that the aforementioned change of the vibration phases under which the studied stress and velocities have their absolute maximum and zeros becomes more considerable with decreasing of the values of the rheological parameters d and q note that this considerable increase of the indicated influence is also caused with the plate moving velocity moreover it follows from the results given in these figures that in the considered cases the influence of the rheological parameter d on the vibration phase is more considerable than that of the rheological parameter q though the change of the vibration phase of the external force significantly influences the frequency response of the studied quantities we consider below the influence of the parameters d and q on these responses only in the cases where ω t 0 and ω t π 2 this is because these values of the vibration phases are also selected in the previous papers related to investigations of the frequency responses of the interface stress and velocities thus we consider the graphs given in figs 7 10 which show the frequency response of the interface dimensionless stress t 22 h p 0 in the cases where v h 750 1 sec figs 7 and 8 and v h 1250 1 sec figs 9 and 10 under ω t 0 figs 7 and 9 and ω t π 2 figs 8 and 10 for various values of the rheological parameters d and q note that in these figures the graphs grouped by the letter a show the influence of the rheological parameter d under q 5 however the graphs grouped by the letter b show the influence of the rheological parameter q under d 1 on the considered frequency responses the graphs given in figs 7 10 show that there exists a certain frequency domain denote it as 0 ω ω under which the dependence between the stress t 22 h p 0 and ω is non monotonic and in general a decrease in the values of the parameter d causes to increase the absolute values of the stress moreover these results show that in this domain of the frequency with the parameter d the values of the stress approach the corresponding values of those obtained for the case where the plate material is purely elastic however in the frequency domain ω ω 400 h z the character of the influence of the rheological parameter depends on the values of the frequency as well as on the values of the vibration phase of the external force for instance in the case before a certain value of the frequency denote it by ω ω the absolute values of the stress obtained for the viscoelastic moving plate are greater than the corresponding ones obtained for the purely elastic moving plate however in the cases where ω ω the plate material viscosity causes to decrease the absolute values of the stress and the magnitude of this decrease increases with decreasing of the rheological parameter d also note that the frequency ω increases with the parameter d analysis of the graphs grouped by the letter b and obtained in the case where ω t 0 shows that the influence of the rheological parameter q on the values of the stress in the case where 0 ω ω has a complicated character however in the case where ω ω 400 h z the absolute values of the stress under consideration increase with decreasing of the values of the parameter q it follows from observation of the graphs constructed in the case where ω t π 2 for various values of the parameter d that in all the frequencies and in all the considered values of this parameter in the cases where ω ω the absolute values of the stress decrease monotonically with ω and with decreasing of d however in this case the influence of the parameter q on the frequency response of the stress has a more complicated character as shown in figs 8b and 10b comparison of the results obtained under v h 750 1 sec figs 7 and 8 with the corresponding ones obtained in the case where v h 1250 1 sec figs 9 and 10 shows that the frequency domain 0 ω ω i e the frequency ω increases with the plate moving velocity now we consider the influence of the parameters d and q on the frequency response of the velocity v 2 μ 0 h p 0 c 2 the graphs of which are given in figs 11 14 these graphs are constructed in the cases where v h 750 1 sec figs 11 and 12 and v h 1250 1 sec figs 13 and 14 for various values of the rheological parameter d under q 5 the graphs grouped by the letter a and for various values of the parameter q under d 1 the graphs grouped by the letter b moreover these graphs are constructed in the cases where ω t 0 figs 11 and 13 and ω t π 2 figs 12 and 14 analyses of these graphs allow us to conclude that the considered frequency responses illustrating the influence of the rheological parameter d on these responses in the qualitative sense are similar to those obtained for the purely elastic plate case in general in the frequency domain ω ω a decrease in values of the parameter d causes to increase in the absolute values of the interface stress and velocities however there sometimes appears a violation of this rule for instance in fig 13a the values of the velocity calculated in the case where d 0 25 become less than those obtained for the case where d 0 5 this situation can be explained by the complicated character of the frequency responses of the velocities calculated at ω t 0 moreover during the transition from the frequency region ω ω to the frequency region ω ω there exists some transitional frequency domain after which the character of the influence of the parameter d on the values of the velocities is steadied apparently in the case under consideration the aforementioned transitional frequency domain is not yet finished and will be finished under ω 400 h z however the character of the influence of the rheological parameter q on the frequency responses has a complicated character which is illustrated through the graphs grouped by the letter b at the same time it should be noted that the influence is more considerable and visible in the case where ω t π 2 comparison of the results given in fig 12a with the corresponding ones given in fig 14a shows that the values of the frequency ω at which the absolute values of the velocity become maximum increase with the plate moving velocity moreover comparison of the results given in fig 11a with the corresponding ones given in fig 13a shows that the values of the frequency increase with the plate moving velocity after which the considered velocity graphs are higher than the graph constructed for the purely elastic plate this completes the analyses of the numerical results under the investigations carried out above it was quietly assumed that the considered couette flow in the initial state before the action of the external time harmonic forces on the free face plane of the plate is laminar for which according to paolo et al 2015 the reynolds number re ρ 0 1 v h d μ 1 must be less than 1000 as we considered the case where h 0 01 m h d 0 02 m and the selected maximum value of v h is 1250 h z therefore in the cases under consideration for a selected fluid glycerin by direct calculation of re ρ 0 1 v h d μ 1 we obtain the maximum value of the reynolds number as equal to 300 consequently the laminar flow of the fluid is provided in the initial state as noted above all the foregoing results are obtained for the case where h 0 01 m and h d 0 02 m nevertheless the obtained results and their analyses give a lot of new information on the influence of the viscoelasticity of the plate material on the dynamics of considered types of plate fluid systems and the results may be useful in the qualitative sense for other possible values of h and h d however for more accurate results on the influence of the values of h and h d on the studied dynamic process corresponding additional numerical investigations are required which will be considered in future works by the author 5 conclusions thus in the present paper the time harmonic forced vibration of the axially moving viscoelastic plate in contact with compressible viscous fluid with finite depth is considered the exact equations of the theory of visco elastodynamics in the plane strain case are employed for describing the motion of the plate however for describing the fluid flow linearized navier stokes equations are employed for solution to the corresponding mathematical problems the exponential fourier transform with respect to the x 1 coordinate fig 1 is employed and for finding the analytical expressions of the fourier transforms of the sought values the discrete analytical solution method is employed the originals of the fluid flow velocities and stresses are found numerically for which the corresponding calculation algorithm and pc programs are developed under concrete numerical investigations the viscoelasticity of the plate material is described by rabotnov s fractional exponential operators and the dimensionless rheological parameters d and q are introduced which characterize the long term values of the mechanical properties and the characteristic creep time respectively of the plate material the main aim of these investigations is to determine how these dimensionless rheological parameters influence the frequency responses of the stress and the velocities on the interface plane between the fluid and viscoelastic plate as a result of the analysis of these results the following concrete conclusions can be drawn as in the purely elastic case there exists a critical frequency at which jumps of the studied quantities take place and the magnitude of these jumps increases with decreasing of the rheological parameters d and q the viscoelasticity of the plate material causes to increase the critical frequencies the values of the vibration phase at which the interface stresses and velocities have their maximums and minimums depend significantly on the rheological parameters d and q we recall that the parameters d and q characterize the long time values of the mechanical constant and creep time respectively of the plate material i e a decrease an increase in the values of d and q means a decrease an increase in the long time values of the mechanical constants and in the values of the creep time of the plate material there exists a certain frequency denoted by ω before and after which the character of the influence of the rheological parameters on the studied frequency responses is different from each other consequently the character of the influence of the rheological parameters d and q on the studied frequency responses depends significantly on the vibration frequency of the external forces such character of the frequency responses caused namely by the moving of the plate with constant velocity v causes the term 2 ω h a 0 h s v 1 k a 0 to appear in the expression ω 1 2 in 33 the frequency ω increases with plate moving velocity and under ω t 0 in the frequency domain 0 ω ω the influence of the rheological parameter d on the values of the interface normal stress is more considerable than that of the rheological parameter q in the case where ω t π 2 under the frequency domain ω ω 400 h z the absolute values of the interface stresses and velocity increase monotonically with decreasing of the parameter d and with the frequency ω moreover with increasing of the parameter d the values approach the corresponding ones which are obtained for the case where the plate material is purely elastic in the case where ω t π 2 under the frequency domain ω ω 400 h z the character of the influence of the rheological parameter q on the values of the studied stress and velocity has a complicated character but nevertheless after a certain frequency a decrease in the values of this parameter also causes the values of the quantities to increase at the same time with the parameter q the values of the studied quantities approach those of the corresponding ones obtained for the case where the plate material is purely elastic credit authorship contribution statement tarık koçal conceptualization methodology software validation

promising concept able to improve overall ship propulsion performance and recover wave energy reducing fuel consumption and making maritime equipment eco friendlier in this context the present article aims to present a 2d parametric study of a flapping foil system able to operate in two modes energy harnessing and propulsion first a brief theoretical review is presented followed by the numerical approach used and the validation tests performed the main goal of the parametric study is to analyse how the out of phase configuration and the spacing inter foils influence the results in terms of hydrodynamic coefficients and power output when compared to the baseline foils aligned implementing the cases using the κ ω sst turbulence model combined with the overset 6dof approach for the foil motion from the commercial cfd tool ansys fluent it was possible to show that cases 1 2 unaligned spaced configuration presented a better overall performance for the two operation modes keywords flapping foil dual foil system propulsion wave energy energy harnesssing parametric study 1 introduction the maritime industry has consistently searched for new ways to improve ship propulsion efficiency with raising costs in fuel the interest in alternative designs has increased during the last few decades when concepts based on swimming animals and their fins started being a great source of inspiration due to their exceptional performance allied to a low energy consumption osborne 1961 triantafyllou et al 2000 provided a comprehensive review in theoretical and experimental works about flexible bodies and fins able to produce propulsive forces studying the agility in live fish this field of research enables the usage of many biomimetic flapping foil mechanisms as source of propulsion including the one considered in the present study another area of constant research is the use of renewable sources in marine energy systems extending from improving already established energy harnessing systems to developing complete new ways of energy recovery being the hydrokinetic turbine based on flapping foils a sheer example of advancements in the field in this sense the industry standards have been shifting to a low emissions goal where according to a new strategy of the imo international maritime organization greenhouse gases ghg emissions will have to be reduced by at least 50 by 2050 if compared to 2008 shallcross et al 2012 this scenario is totally aligned with the main focus of this research optimize a two mode foil system able to potentially improve a vessel performance the use of flapping hydrofoils for propulsion is not a new concept rozhdestvensky and ryzhov 2003 made a comprehensive review on the evolution of its design and on their inspiration in nature analysing the most common ones in terms of aerohydrodynamics and implementing some numerical models however yamaguchi and bose 1994 applied the concept specifically for a ship propulsion case showing that a bio inspired active flapping foil could achieve 5 more efficiency than a classic screw propeller mostly due to the increased working area in a similar topic anderson et al 1998 analysed and tested a naca0012 foil profile using flow visualisation techniques to determine the flow and the wake of the hydrofoil estimating a high propulsive efficiency of 87 these experiments were analysed and compared to numerical results obtained by guglielmini and blondeaux 2004 adding pitching oscillations to the heaving motion of the foil expanding concepts from wang 2000 and showing that it is possible to achieve larger values for thrust the dynamic study of the forces acting on a flapping foil was performed experimentally by read et al 2003 where a range of parameters were varied including strouhal number angle of attack and phase to determine optimal conditions and best thrust performance in another numerical approach murray and howle 2003 used the stiffness of a spring model to vary heave movement conditions using a two dimensional vortex lattice method it was demonstrated that the critical frequency for positive thrust is reduced when the foil allowed to heave passively and that multiple foils can produce higher efficiencies in certain conditions moreover multiple configurations and characteristics were studied and analysed in order to define optimal thrust performance parameters de silva and yamaguchi de silva and yamaguchi 2012 tested numerically eight different settings and considered the free surface effect and incident waves in the analysis concluding that when the wave amplitude to foil chord length ratio is less than 1 7 it is possible to recover more than 70 of the incoming waves energy to be used as propulsion hover et al 2004 considered variation in the hydrofoil angle of attack profile dividing the experiment in four cases simple harmonic motion for heave and pitch square wave symmetric sawtooth and cosine function using flow visualisation to confirm some hypotheses adopted it was shown that a cosine angle of attack profile produces higher thrust filippas and belibassakis 2014 developed a numerical model based on bem boundary element method to evaluate the effect of free surface in a hydrofoil passively heaving but actively pitching in wave conditions with finite depth it was demonstrated that the free surface effect becomes important for relatively low submergences in the same research the model was also expanded to consider different actively pitch controlled foil profiles naca4412 and naca0012 for ship propulsion augmentation still taking into account the effects of free surface and waves using the low order bem developed a more comprehensive analysis was presented by filippas 2019 another study from the same authors belibassakis and filippas 2015 investigated the effect of the foils arrangement in terms of thrust production and showed that under general operation conditions it is possible to reach a significant propulsion gain belibassakis et al filippas et al 2018 implemented the same method but then considered the effects of waves and current acting simultaneously concluding that it is possible to obtain significant output responses even in such conditions contributing to the same field belibassakis and politis 2013 studied the performance of a wing located beneath the hull that actuates as ship augmented propulsion system the research considered two arrangements horizontal and vertical showing that a significant amount of thrust is produced by the former and a reduction of ship response for a range of motions is achieved by the latter serving as a type of stabilizer analysing now the design of flapping wing propulsion systems politis and tsarsitalidis 2014 used an unsteady boundary element modelling code ubem to evaluate the performance of 24 configurations altering several parameters such as span chord heaving amplitude and strouhal numbers it was shown that compared to conventional propellers flapping wings can be very efficient with propulsive coefficients of the order of 79 bringing considerable advantages such as a reduced thrust load coefficient better utilization of ship stern area no cavitation and being environmental friendlier other lines of research evaluated how the pitch motion should be controlled and multiple foils arrangements in one of these studies bøckmann and steen 2014 developed two prototypes and defined experimentally that a spring loaded hydrofoil naca0015 can produce higher thrust and efficiency than an actively controlled one with the conditions used the experiment considered a 90 phase angle between pitch and heave with a pivot point 57 mm above the cord line 0 25 c from the leading edge for the actively controlled foil while for the passive case the rotation centre was located at the chord line 0 14 c this difference in the rotation axis position was crucial for the better performance of the spring loaded foil while a well designed active system can have advantages in certain cases the same authors bøckmann and steen 2016 experimentally tested a wavefoil system that acted as ship resistance reducer and stabilizer showing that it was possible to lower the resistance of a modelled tanker by 17 while for heave and pitch the system was able to reduce the motions response up to 32 and 25 respectively considering now two foils a tandem configuration for a hydrofoil system also has a considerable impact on the performance of the foil located at an aft positon mostly due to interference in the flow caused by the wake of the forward foil as epps et al 2017 described the distance between foils and the phase lag between them are important parameters that need attention when using multiple foils for propulsion in addition to this researches naito and isshiki 2005 made an important review about the generation of thrust and enhancement of ship stability by bow wings in the review many parameters were discussed such as wing shape size and position together with energy conversion strategies when considering a hydrofoil system for power extraction from wave energy wu 1972 was responsible for developing the methodology behind the concept and analysing the conditions in which such operation mode would be possible it was considered several aspects in which energy was able to be harvested or even transformed in mechanical power thrust from a wavy flow as such conversion would be unattainable in a uniform flow depending exclusively on a wavy regime to happen later researches explored such conditions by using numerical methods to model flapping foils in wavy flows considering the energy recovery hypothesis kinsey and dumas 2006 first used a commercial cfd code to test a naca0015 in the heave frame of motion being the pitch the only motion left to be analysed power extraction efficiencies as high as 34 were found considering a foil angle amplitude of 55 after this first approach a parametric study kinsey and dumas 2008 was performed considering different reduced frequencies non dimensional frequency and high pitching amplitudes finding that for 0 15 and 75 respectively the model produced the highest efficiencies advancing on their analysis kinsey and dumas 2012a also explored the effects of a three dimension hydrofoil model in terms of power extraction and found a 20 30 reduction in total power recovered it was suggested that this reduction can be avoided or minimized with the use of endplates afterwards seeking a more experimental analysis and comparisons with the numerical simulations a tandem configuration for the hydrofoils kinsey and dumas 2012b was considered in order to find the optimal spatial arrangement that maximized the power extraction efficiency a global phase parameter was defined to try and predict favourable scenarios for high gains from foil wake interactions but must be used with caution when analysing the system other lines of research evaluated the undulatory motion of biomimetic systems for wave energy harnessing purposes in specific wave velocities huang et al 2017 considered the effects of the reynolds number in a flexible naca0012 ji and huang 2017 and even studied energy recovery of plate in wavy wind flows li and huang 2017 different arrangements were tested in side by side configurations by ding and huang 2018 considering the phase difference and foil distance as variables showing that for a certain range the performance can be optimal moreover koutsogiannakis et al 2019 studied hydrokinetic turbines based in flapping foil mechanisms in single or multiple configurations using an unsteady boundary element method bem in the research the bottom and free surface effects were neglected while a parametric study in a single foil configuration was conducted together with the analysis of two foils in different arrangements and multiple foil devices it was shown from the research that despite not being able to achieve performances greater than a tidal turbine used as baseline twin foil and triple foil systems can be 11 and 21 more efficient than a single foil configuration respectively zhu and peng 2009 on the other hand focused on controlling vorticity to enhance foil performance and showed that it is possible to partially recover the vortex energy from the leading edge while huxham et al 2012 applied a prescribed pitch and heave motion on foils to study energy harnessing from tidal streams finally young et al 2014 published a comprehensive review on the evolution and main challenges of the flapping foil energy harvesters while xiao and zhu 2014 explored the studies available in the field showing the main results achieved other reviews bringing the latest advancements in flapping foils were conducted by shyy et al shyy 2010 and wu et al 2020 the two operation modes possible for a flapping hydrofoil under wavy flows inspired some researchers to develop and study a dual system used for propulsion and energy harnessing depending on the conditions topic that is totally aligned with the studies performed and presented in this article jones and platzer 2013 analysed multiple configurations for a propulsion or harvester device ranging from different foils profiles and number to isolated pitch heave or combined motions and under many different strouhal numbers despite the fact that the study was made considering air as the medium some of the conclusions obtained were insightful especially the ones regarding the motions phases and pitching amplitudes it was shown that a 90 phase and a high amplitude are ideal for the power extraction mode bowker et al 2015 2016 explored even more the dual system concept now focusing on asv autonomous surface vessels applications the research had several phases including the numerical simulation and evaluation of both modes the prototype manufacturing to perform the experiments and theoretical modelling and tests of a simplified pto to determine energy recovery feasibility totally aligned to the subject of the present work the research was consolidated in a thesis presenting the complete formulation and results for the analysis bowker 2018 important design parameters were defined in the study to guide future research and application of the technology in this context this article presents the results of a 2d parametric study considering a dual system for propulsion and energy harnessing based on flapping hydrofoils applied to the portugal coastal environment the main goal of the study was to test different configurations for the foils in unaligned or out of phase positions in order to evaluate performance improvements an analysis with research in the literature so far expanding the concept of a dual system bowker et al 2015 2016 bowker 2018 and seeking optimization via a parametric study all implementations of the present work were made using the commercial cfd tool ansys fluent with geometry and meshing process developed using the tools from ansys workbench package in section 2 1 brief theoretical review is presented covering the essential relations of flapping foil dynamics and wave models while section 3 brings the numerical methodology used in the study the results and further analyses are presented in sections iv and v 2 theoretical review 2 1 flapping foils a flapping foil system can be arranged in several ways to serve as augmented propulsion for a vessel and wave energy harnessing system for example considering the scope of the present research two foils would be placed in an unaligned configuration separated by horizontal and vertical distances of l x and l y respectively discussed in full in section 3 2 with a ship relative velocity of u in order to illustrate the system application in a wavy environment a simplified sketch is presented in fig 1 however as will be discussed in section 3 the free surface and bottom effects were neglected being the ship relative velocity u represented in fig 1 considered as a uniform relative flow velocity in the formulation presented and in all simulations and calculations performed considering now a generic foil profile with vertical translation heave and rotation pitch motions as shown in fig 2 the time varying forces actuating on the body are t l and m z thrust lift and moment components respectively thrust is the horizontal component of the acting forces in favour of motion and the angle θ is the pitch position the hydrodynamics coefficients for thrust and lift c t and c l respectively are calculated by the relations presented in eqs 1 and 2 1 c t t 1 2 ρ u 2 b c 2 c l l 1 2 ρ u 2 b c where ρ is the fluid density b is the foil span and c is the foil chord due to the periodic characteristic of the motion the power p is calculated in time by eq 3 3 p l d h d t m z d θ d t being d h d t and d θ d t the vertical and angular velocities respectively with power determined it is possible to obtain the power coefficient c p using an analogue expression as shown in eq 4 4 c p p 1 2 ρ u 3 b c moreover when the hydrofoil is acting as wave energy converter it is important to determine the power available as presented in eq 5 5 p a v a i l 1 2 ρ u 3 b d with d representing the total vertical motion amplitude which corresponds to both wave and foil amplitude as will be discussed in section 2 2 thus the efficiencies when the system is operating in energy harnessing and propulsion modes can be determined by eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 η e h p p a v a i l 7 η p t u p it is important to notice that as the motion is periodic thus the parameters used to calculate the efficiencies are time averages over one period of oscillation represented here by the bar over the variable 2 2 wave models waves are naturally occurring phenomena that suffer the influence of many factors ranging from wind sea bed topology and weather for example so as one would expect the development and improvement of wave models is as important to the design of sea related technology as it is intrinsically complex in this context irregular wave models try to include the most important factors and numerically predict sea elevation using statistical data while regular wave models are simple harmonic functions both approaches have their own applications depending on the problem studied and the degree of complexity wanted for the simulations a description of the foil motion based on regular waves will be presented next followed by a brief introduction on irregular waves models 2 2 1 regular waves foil motion and equal energy transport theory as the models for irregular waves are purely stochastic the amount of flow time needed in order to produce a meaningful set of results is considerable this scenario would not be ideal for a first approach especially in a parametric study where it is more important to compare as many cases as possible other than have a final design tested in situations close to the real environment in this context a way to avoid such complications is to use a regular wave model that is equivalent in terms of energy transport to a real sea state model like jonswap a regular wave can have its elevation represented mathematically by a sinusoidal function which reduces considerably the model complexity in eq 8 it is shown a generic regular wave function 8 h t a sin ω t ϕ where h is the elevation ω is the angular frequency ω 2 π f being f the frequency a is the wave amplitude and ϕ is the phase for simplification purposes and to focus only on the foils interactions and performance the foil motion is directly coupled to the wave elevation which is equivalent to a unity response amplitude operator rao at the foil locations in an eventual ship attached system this is assumption is adequate for waves with wavelength significantly greater than the ship length thus the position for heave and the respective velocities for each foil are easily obtained as shown in eqs 9 12 9 h 1 t h 0 sin ω e t φ 10 h 2 t h 0 sin ω e t φ ϕ 12 11 v y 1 t h 0 ω e cos ω e t φ 12 v y 2 t h 0 ω e cos ω e t φ ϕ 12 where h 1 and h 2 are the position of the upstream and downstream foil respectively h 0 is the heave amplitude ω e is the encounter frequency ω e ω k u k being the wave number φ is the phase between the heave and pitch motion v y 1 and v y 2 are the vertical velocities for each foil and ϕ 12 is the phase between foils for the pitching motion the functions that represent the angular position and velocity for each foil are as presented in eqs 13 16 13 θ 1 t θ 0 sin ω e t 14 θ 2 t θ 0 sin ω e t ϕ 12 15 ω 1 t θ 0 γ cos ω e t 16 ω 2 t θ 0 γ cos ω e t ϕ 12 where θ 1 and θ 2 are the angular position of the upstream and downstream foil respectively θ 0 is the pitch amplitude ω 1 and ω 2 are the angular velocities for each foil and ϕ 12 is the phase between foils the relations presented in eqs 9 16 describe the total motion of the flapping foil system with parameters such h 0 and γ being defined by the sea state and θ 0 φ and ϕ 12 by design so it is possible to simulate an irregular sea state using the sinusoidal functions aforementioned using the equal energy transport theory sang et al 2016 tedeschi et al 2011 as long as certain criteria is met according to eqs 17 and 18 17 t t e 18 e i r r e g ρ g 16 h s 2 e r e g ρ g 2 a 2 e r e g e i r r e g a 2 h s 4 thus from the energy period t e of the irregular wave the hydrofoils motion period t and consequently the frequency f 1 t and angular frequency γ are known the heave amplitude h 0 is easily obtained by h 0 a 2 from the sea elevation h s finally using the coastal data from the portuguese west coast and choosing the two most occurring sea states as will be presented in section 2 2 2 the parameters for the foil motion can be determined mathematically by the relations aforementioned 2 2 2 irregular waves and portugal coastal environment in general when studying hydrodynamic motions studies can be divided into frequency domain analysis and time domain analysis in a simplified way the frequency domain focuses on the analysis of the mathematical model for each given frequency band whereas the time domain focuses on the rate of change of the movement over time the frequency domain allows for the study of regular waves over diverse frequencies and irregular waves based upon the principle that they are the superposition of several waves with different frequencies and by performing a fourier series analysis one can derive a spectrum from a measured wave elevation record in the time domain in other words for a given irregular wave whose basis is the superposition of a series of sinusoidal regular waves the irregular signal wave is studied concerning its frequency characteristics using a fourier series analysis which implies that the signal being studied repeats itself after each long interval consequently the wave elevation in the time domain of a long crested irregular sea can be written as the summation of a considerable number of regular wave components in the frequency domain as shown in eq 19 19 ζ t n 1 n ζ a n cos k n x ω n t ε n in which for each component of n ζ a n wave amplitude component m ω n circular frequency component rad s k n wave number component rad m ε n random phase angle component rad in many cases wave frequencies follow a narrow banded frequency spectrum in this case when in the presence of a surface elevation that follows a gaussian distribution the wave amplitudes can be expressed as a rayleigh distribution for the energy spectra the n t h moment of the area under the spectrum is expressed by eq 20 20 m n ζ 0 ω n s ζ ω d ω some most common variables when analysing irregular waves are the significant wave height h s the peak period t p and the mean zero crossing period t z the significant wave height is the mean highest 1 3 of the waves in a given time record while the peak period is the wave period with the highest energy the energy period is often used for power estimation by the way of considering it the period of the regular wave with the same power density as the sea state under consideration and it is generically defined by eq 21 21 t e m 1 m 0 researchers have formulated several standard wave spectra most notably the bretschneider the pierson moskowitz and jonswap wave spectra have been created bretschneider 1959 pierson and moskowitz 1964 hasselmannet al 1973 the jonswap spectrum was derived from extensive wave measurements carried out in the north sea for fetch limited conditions its general equation is as presented in eq 22 22 s ζ ω 320 h 1 3 2 t p 4 ω 5 exp 1950 t p 4 ω 4 γ a where γ 3 3 peakness factor a exp ω ω p 1 σ 2 2 σ step function of ω in this particular case the energy period might be expressed as a function of the peak period pecher and kofoed 2017 or the mean wave period as shown in eq 23 23 t p 1 12 t e 1 29 t z due to the strict relation between peak period and energy period a regular wave was applied to the hydrofoils for wave generation data from the portuguese hydrographic institute was used as case study for the hydrofoil design the most common peak period off the west coast of portugal are in the range of 7 15 s and with significant wave heights in the range of 2 m with a predominant direction of nw as such two sea states were considered i t p 9 s with h s 2 m ii t p 13 s with h s 2 m costa et al 2001 next section will expand on the numerical methodology used in the simulations performed for the cases considered 3 numerical model 3 1 domain and methodology in order to perform the simulations the first step was to define the foil geometry it is well established in the literature that a symmetrical profile is the best option considering the harmonic nature of the motion imposed to the foil it is also preferable to keep the profile as thin as possible to avoid unnecessary residual drag forces kinsey and dumas 2008 xiao and zhu 2014 that way a naca four digit foil is a relatively simple geometry to be implemented and meets all the requirements being the naca0015 chosen as final design it is important to notice that this type of naca profile is broadly used in other studies available in the literature allowing for comparisons to be made and validations attained as will be presented in section 3 3 a naca0015 foil does not have camber which size and location are represented by the first two digits of the profile in terms of percentage of the chord and has a total thickness of only 15 of the chord the chord considered in all simulations was c 1 m while the reference span b 1 m numerical value used by the solver to calculate forces and coefficients was adopted for simplification purposes moreover the next step was to obtain a high quality mesh for the domains from the beginning it was defined that the best option to impose the foils motion in the ansys fluent solver was via the overset tool which reduces drastically the computational cost this is due to the fact that the information is transmitted between cells in different domains without the need of remeshing or defining interfaces which can be demanding however it was necessary to define an outer domain background as well an inner domain in the foil region the boundary conditions were considered as symmetry in the atmosphere and bottom regions of the domain to neglect the associated effects while velocity inlet and pressure outlet were chosen to give direct control on flow velocity and maintain continuity avoiding reversed flows both domains with the mesh already defined respective dimensions and boundary conditions can be seen in fig 3 and fig 4 r from fig 3 it is possible to observe that the background domain is rectangular allowing for a structured mesh to be easily generated moreover as the main goal was to calculate forces actuating on the foil an inflation layer and a triangular zone were defined in the region near the wall as shown in the detailed views of the foil leading edge and trailing edge presented in fig 5 it is important to notice that with the inflation layer defined the first element size near the foil wall could be controlled making it possible to keep the values of y inside the range considered acceptable 1 for the turbulent model chosen κ ω sst the body forces calculations are known to be more robust when the κ ω model is used near the wall and the unity value guarantees the solver uses its formulation making the results more precise κ ω sst is a hybrid model that switches formulation depending on the value of y with both meshes determined the outer and the inner domain were arranged following the configurations of the validation single foil case and the parametric study multiple arrangements double foil cases as will be presented in the next sections for all cases and for simplification purposes the foils were considered as totally submerged being the free surface and bottom effects neglected at this stage finally the foil motion following the formulation developed in section 2 2 2 was implemented via udfs user defined functions according to each case specification in table 1 a summary of the main setup parameters used in the simulations developed in ansys fluent is presented 3 2 parametric study procedure for the design of the parametric study several aspects were considered to achieve the final configurations these configurations were divided into a baseline case plus four different foil positions first the baseline case was modelled to represent the default configuration or the standard foils position both aligned the results of the baseline case were intended to provide a good starting point and allow to evaluate if the different configurations improved the system performance then a known problem of an aligned configuration is the interaction between the upstream and downstream foils which reduces the performance of the latter as such in order to inspect if it was possible to reduce this interaction out of phase configurations were considered varying both the distance inter foils and the location of the upstream and downstream foils in alternate up and down positions in fig 6 the parametric study design is shown with an schematic representation of the baseline case and the other four positions considered in the simulations the distances l x 1 l x 2 and l y were defined in terms of foil chords and are displayed in table 2 it is important to notice that the centre of rotation was adopted as being the aerodynamic centre of the foil which for a symmetrical profile with a closed trailing edge can be calculated analytically as 0 3994 c in addition the conditions used in all simulations performed in the parametric study can be seen in table 3 with parameters for each sea state and for all cases represented it is important to notice that the θ 0 m a x was defined by design and the phase differences φ and ϕ 12 were chosen as it represents an ideal scenario finally the reynolds number of the flow were around 1 10 6 for the conditions presented in table 3 foils chord and water properties this reynolds number in a typical turbulent flow represents a full scale model for a realistic flow using data for the sea states considered 3 3 mesh independency study and literature validation the last step before the parametric study itself was to perform a mesh independency study followed by a literature validation of the model and hypotheses adopted both analyses were developed using the same numerical approach of the parametric study but with a simpler arrangement of just one foil single foil case for that four meshes with different degrees of refinement were considered factor r 2 the procedure followed well established guidelines for verification and validation v v tests in numerical methods stern et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 which was also used in the reference consulted for the literature validation de silva and yamaguchi 2012 it is important to consider that as the study is fully based on forces calculations the parameter used for the analysis was the average thrust coefficient c t moreover the conditions used both in the independency study and literature validation were the presented in table 4 using the conditions from table 4 it was possible to test the four meshes obtained it is important to notice that the region near the foil wall was thoroughly refined with special attention to the mesh metrics as obtaining the best result possible for the body forces was the main goal however due to the nature of the overset implementation the background mesh had to be refined as well to ensure cell connectivity providing compatible element size in the wake region the graph from fig 7 shows c t versus number of elements while in table 5 it is also displayed the variation parameter regarding the most refined mesh ε i c t c o a r s e r c t f i n e r c t f i n e s t from fig 7 and table 5 it is clear how the results converge when the mesh is refined reaching a point that the variation of c t is almost neglectable thus to define the mesh that would be used in the simulations to come the final step was the verification analysis which from several parameters such as the convergence ratio r the order of accuracy p the correction factor c the generalized richardson extrapolation error δ r e and uncertainty u g it was possible to compare the meshes three by three for example for the first analysis regarding meshes i iii these parameters are obtained following the relations presented in eqs 24 28 stern et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 an equivalent procedure was adopted for meshes ii iv using the same notation 24 r ε i i i i ε i i i i i i 25 p ln ε i i i i i i ε i i i i ln r 26 c r p 1 r p t h 1 27 δ r e ε i i i i r p 1 28 u g c δ r e 1 c δ r e being p t h the order of accuracy necessary to make the correction factor reach the asymptotic range that way the results of the verification analysis is presented in table 6 from table 6 it is possible to conclude that the meshes in the finer range i iii produce uncertainties u g considerably lower than the ones in the coarser range ii iv being the variation of c t for mesh ii almost stable compared to the finer case table 5 thus mesh ii was the one chosen for the all simulations performed in the present article finally the model implemented were compared to the literature in order to evaluate if the hypotheses and simplifications adopted could produce quality results for that a reference article regarding wave devouring systems based on flapping foils was used de silva and yamaguchi 2012 it is worth mentioning that the study referenced is broadly used for comparison in many other works the graphs shown in fig 8 and fig 9 present the comparison between the thrust c t and lift c l coefficients respectively with the present method and de silva 2011 de silva and yamaguchi 2012 the results were computed over one oscillation period from figs 8 and 9 it is noticeable that the present method has a response close to the one implemented by the referenced article with the main differences more evident near the crests and troughs this is probably because the analysis made by de silva 2012 included more complex effects in the model such as the influence of the free surface even then it is comfortable to say that the assumptions made in the present study can produce satisfactory results with a good degree of generalization 4 results and discussion this section brings the main results obtained for the parametric study performed for the dual foil system the results are organized in two groups first the hydrodynamic coefficients thrust c t lift c l and power c p are displayed for each case and by sea state the main purpose here is to realize trends and provide data to be used by other authors or future works then a case comparison analysis in terms of power and efficiency is presented to help identifying the best overall configuration for both energy harnessing and propulsion modes 4 1 hydrodynamic coefficients 4 1 1 sea state i h s 2 m t p 9 s the graphs in fig 10 fig 11 and fig 12 present the hydrodynamic coefficients thrust c t lift c l and power c p respectively for all cases sea state i it is important to notice from figs 10 figs 11 and 12 that as the upstream foil does not suffer any type of interference in the flow the response obtained for that foil in all cases are virtually the same and can be represented by only one curve the same is valid for the downstream foil in cases 1 and 2 with an analogue situation occurring in cases 3 and 4 the downstream foil of the baseline case is represented to provide comparison with others downstream foils therefore from the beginning it is possible to conclude that the unaligned configuration as opposed to an in line one improved the response for all coefficients being however independent from the vertical position considered for each foil upstream foil up downstream foil down or upstream foil down downstream foil up cases 1 3 and 2 4 respectively when comparing cases 1 2 and 3 4 it is possible to observe a noticeable reduction in the thrust coefficient in the latter c t fig 10 which is not so expressive in lift c l fig 11 and power c p fig 12 coefficients another aspect to consider is that in cases 1 and 2 the out of phase configuration reduced the difference between the response in the upstream and downstream foils a desired effect cases 3 and 4 with the foils closer presented a reduction in overall performance for all coefficients being the lift curve c l fig 11 displaced along the period if compared to cases 1 and 2 probably due to a different interaction between the wave length and the inter foils spacing this also occurred because of the interference in flow caused by upstream foil wake region which can have different effects depending on the sea state considered as shown in fig 14 and discussed in the section 4 1 2 4 1 2 sea state ii h s 2 m t p 13 s for the sea state ii the same results in terms of the hydrodynamic coefficients thrust c t lift c l and power c p are presented in figs 13 figs 14 and 15 respectively in the graphs shown in figs 13 figs 14 and 15 the upstream foil results are again represented in one curve as the same effect from sea state i is observed being the response virtually identical the same is valid for the downstream foil in cases 1 2 and 3 4 from the graphs it is possible to observe that the behaviour is similar to sea state i results but the main difference observed is the amplitude of the coefficients obtained the thrust c t fig 13 and the lift c l fig 14 coefficients have an increased amplitude compared to sea state i while the power coefficient c p fig 15 has been displaced in the positive direction which contributes in the energy harnessing performance these effects is mostly due to the fact that as the wave frequency is reduced in sea state ii the system is able to operate with less losses from rapid changes in motion direction especially in the case 3 4 downstream foil response for the lift coefficient c l fig 14 it was shown that for certain conditions a configuration with closer foils can have its applications providing higher amplitude for lift and better performance in the energy harnessing mode despite overall not being the best solution for a dual system as will be discussed in section 4 2 4 2 case comparison and power evaluation the last set of results presented is a case comparison in terms of power and efficiency for each operation mode that allows for the determination of which case has better performance considering the configurations tested it is important to notice that all power calculations in the present work were performed using reference values for flow velocity u 1 m s and foil span as a 2d geometry span b was considered as 1 m the main goal was to provide data for comparison purposes and more importantly to obtain efficiencies that could be used to determine which configuration had a better performance in general thus power values are presentative only and limited to the conditions imposed to the simulations in fig 16 and fig 17 it is shown the total power for the whole system both foils for energy harnessing mode and the associated efficiencies respectively it is worth mentioning that the results were calculated following the notation presented in section 2 1 moreover the baseline case is treated as case 0 in all graphs displayed from fig 16 it is observed that for the sea state i there was almost no differences between the power extracted in all cases although cases 3 4 performed slightly better all improving if compared to the baseline however in the sea state ii cases 1 2 got a worse response compared to the first state inverting the scenario for cases 3 4 as power for the energy harnessing mode is calculated through moment and lift the increase in amplitude discussed in section 4 1 probably caused this effect the calculated power in energy harnessing mode for all cases were in the range of 65 85 w moreover the same behaviour is observed for the associated efficiency η e h fig 17 once the power available is constant for both sea states from eq 5 p a v a i l 352 91 w it is worth mention that the efficiency in the range of 20 is within the limits for this type of system and pitch amplitude kinsey and dumas 2006 lastly fig 18 and fig 19 display the total power both foils for propulsion mode and the associated efficiencies for each case respectively from fig 18 it is possible to observe that the power converted for propulsion is considerably less when compared to the results obtained for the energy harnessing mode that is justifiable by the fact that in the propulsion mode the main parameters are the forces acting in the horizontal direction and the flow velocity which in passive conditions like the ones tested produce less power than the total motion of the foil probably for the same reasons aforementioned sea state ii had slightly better results than sea state i but with small variation globally cases 1 and 2 had better performances and the power that potentially could be converted in propulsion was in the range of 34 38 w in fig 19 the efficiency for propulsion mode η p is displayed showing that as the reference power in this mode varies by case it was possible to find better efficiencies in the baseline cases even producing less power the efficiency obtained was in the range of 42 52 therefore analysing the data from the graphs in figs 16 19 it is possible to conclude that overall the best configurations for a dual foil system able to operate in both energy harnessing and propulsion modes are the ones presented by case 1 or 2 as the foil out of phase position does not influence much bringing the foils closer has a clear advantage in the energy harnessing mode but reduces considerably the performance for propulsion finally another important achievement was the reduction in the flow interaction between foils which proved to be beneficial for performance once they are placed in an out of phase configuration this has the potential to steer future works to reach an optimal design in systems of this nature 5 conclusion using flapping foils for propulsion or energy harnessing is a concept that has been gaining more interest in the past few decades as greener solutions has been substituting or complementing traditional maritime systems in this context the present work analysed the concept of a dual foil system that can operate in two modes energy harnessing and propulsion using the two most occurring sea states off the portuguese west coast as a case study it is known that in a dual foil configuration there are interferences in the flow downstream caused by the upstream foil thus to try to minimize such effect a 2d parametric study was proposed and performed along the necessary numerical validations from the numerical simulations it was found that the hydrodynamic coefficients thrust c t lift c l and power c p have better overall results in cases 1 2 than in cases 3 4 all compared to the baseline the downstream foil experienced a reduction in the flow interaction from the upstream foil if compared to the baseline which was a desired effect comparing both sea states it was possible to observe an increase in the amplitude of the coefficients in sea state ii mostly due to the reduction in rapid motion associated losses therefore analysing the power obtained for both modes energy harnessing and propulsion and the associated efficiencies it was possible to conclude that cases 1 2 provide the best overall performance as the out of phase position i e up or down alternate positions does not produce a considerable effect credit authorship

promising concept able to improve overall ship propulsion performance and recover wave energy reducing fuel consumption and making maritime equipment eco friendlier in this context the present article aims to present a 2d parametric study of a flapping foil system able to operate in two modes energy harnessing and propulsion first a brief theoretical review is presented followed by the numerical approach used and the validation tests performed the main goal of the parametric study is to analyse how the out of phase configuration and the spacing inter foils influence the results in terms of hydrodynamic coefficients and power output when compared to the baseline foils aligned implementing the cases using the κ ω sst turbulence model combined with the overset 6dof approach for the foil motion from the commercial cfd tool ansys fluent it was possible to show that cases 1 2 unaligned spaced configuration presented a better overall performance for the two operation modes keywords flapping foil dual foil system propulsion wave energy energy harnesssing parametric study 1 introduction the maritime industry has consistently searched for new ways to improve ship propulsion efficiency with raising costs in fuel the interest in alternative designs has increased during the last few decades when concepts based on swimming animals and their fins started being a great source of inspiration due to their exceptional performance allied to a low energy consumption osborne 1961 triantafyllou et al 2000 provided a comprehensive review in theoretical and experimental works about flexible bodies and fins able to produce propulsive forces studying the agility in live fish this field of research enables the usage of many biomimetic flapping foil mechanisms as source of propulsion including the one considered in the present study another area of constant research is the use of renewable sources in marine energy systems extending from improving already established energy harnessing systems to developing complete new ways of energy recovery being the hydrokinetic turbine based on flapping foils a sheer example of advancements in the field in this sense the industry standards have been shifting to a low emissions goal where according to a new strategy of the imo international maritime organization greenhouse gases ghg emissions will have to be reduced by at least 50 by 2050 if compared to 2008 shallcross et al 2012 this scenario is totally aligned with the main focus of this research optimize a two mode foil system able to potentially improve a vessel performance the use of flapping hydrofoils for propulsion is not a new concept rozhdestvensky and ryzhov 2003 made a comprehensive review on the evolution of its design and on their inspiration in nature analysing the most common ones in terms of aerohydrodynamics and implementing some numerical models however yamaguchi and bose 1994 applied the concept specifically for a ship propulsion case showing that a bio inspired active flapping foil could achieve 5 more efficiency than a classic screw propeller mostly due to the increased working area in a similar topic anderson et al 1998 analysed and tested a naca0012 foil profile using flow visualisation techniques to determine the flow and the wake of the hydrofoil estimating a high propulsive efficiency of 87 these experiments were analysed and compared to numerical results obtained by guglielmini and blondeaux 2004 adding pitching oscillations to the heaving motion of the foil expanding concepts from wang 2000 and showing that it is possible to achieve larger values for thrust the dynamic study of the forces acting on a flapping foil was performed experimentally by read et al 2003 where a range of parameters were varied including strouhal number angle of attack and phase to determine optimal conditions and best thrust performance in another numerical approach murray and howle 2003 used the stiffness of a spring model to vary heave movement conditions using a two dimensional vortex lattice method it was demonstrated that the critical frequency for positive thrust is reduced when the foil allowed to heave passively and that multiple foils can produce higher efficiencies in certain conditions moreover multiple configurations and characteristics were studied and analysed in order to define optimal thrust performance parameters de silva and yamaguchi de silva and yamaguchi 2012 tested numerically eight different settings and considered the free surface effect and incident waves in the analysis concluding that when the wave amplitude to foil chord length ratio is less than 1 7 it is possible to recover more than 70 of the incoming waves energy to be used as propulsion hover et al 2004 considered variation in the hydrofoil angle of attack profile dividing the experiment in four cases simple harmonic motion for heave and pitch square wave symmetric sawtooth and cosine function using flow visualisation to confirm some hypotheses adopted it was shown that a cosine angle of attack profile produces higher thrust filippas and belibassakis 2014 developed a numerical model based on bem boundary element method to evaluate the effect of free surface in a hydrofoil passively heaving but actively pitching in wave conditions with finite depth it was demonstrated that the free surface effect becomes important for relatively low submergences in the same research the model was also expanded to consider different actively pitch controlled foil profiles naca4412 and naca0012 for ship propulsion augmentation still taking into account the effects of free surface and waves using the low order bem developed a more comprehensive analysis was presented by filippas 2019 another study from the same authors belibassakis and filippas 2015 investigated the effect of the foils arrangement in terms of thrust production and showed that under general operation conditions it is possible to reach a significant propulsion gain belibassakis et al filippas et al 2018 implemented the same method but then considered the effects of waves and current acting simultaneously concluding that it is possible to obtain significant output responses even in such conditions contributing to the same field belibassakis and politis 2013 studied the performance of a wing located beneath the hull that actuates as ship augmented propulsion system the research considered two arrangements horizontal and vertical showing that a significant amount of thrust is produced by the former and a reduction of ship response for a range of motions is achieved by the latter serving as a type of stabilizer analysing now the design of flapping wing propulsion systems politis and tsarsitalidis 2014 used an unsteady boundary element modelling code ubem to evaluate the performance of 24 configurations altering several parameters such as span chord heaving amplitude and strouhal numbers it was shown that compared to conventional propellers flapping wings can be very efficient with propulsive coefficients of the order of 79 bringing considerable advantages such as a reduced thrust load coefficient better utilization of ship stern area no cavitation and being environmental friendlier other lines of research evaluated how the pitch motion should be controlled and multiple foils arrangements in one of these studies bøckmann and steen 2014 developed two prototypes and defined experimentally that a spring loaded hydrofoil naca0015 can produce higher thrust and efficiency than an actively controlled one with the conditions used the experiment considered a 90 phase angle between pitch and heave with a pivot point 57 mm above the cord line 0 25 c from the leading edge for the actively controlled foil while for the passive case the rotation centre was located at the chord line 0 14 c this difference in the rotation axis position was crucial for the better performance of the spring loaded foil while a well designed active system can have advantages in certain cases the same authors bøckmann and steen 2016 experimentally tested a wavefoil system that acted as ship resistance reducer and stabilizer showing that it was possible to lower the resistance of a modelled tanker by 17 while for heave and pitch the system was able to reduce the motions response up to 32 and 25 respectively considering now two foils a tandem configuration for a hydrofoil system also has a considerable impact on the performance of the foil located at an aft positon mostly due to interference in the flow caused by the wake of the forward foil as epps et al 2017 described the distance between foils and the phase lag between them are important parameters that need attention when using multiple foils for propulsion in addition to this researches naito and isshiki 2005 made an important review about the generation of thrust and enhancement of ship stability by bow wings in the review many parameters were discussed such as wing shape size and position together with energy conversion strategies when considering a hydrofoil system for power extraction from wave energy wu 1972 was responsible for developing the methodology behind the concept and analysing the conditions in which such operation mode would be possible it was considered several aspects in which energy was able to be harvested or even transformed in mechanical power thrust from a wavy flow as such conversion would be unattainable in a uniform flow depending exclusively on a wavy regime to happen later researches explored such conditions by using numerical methods to model flapping foils in wavy flows considering the energy recovery hypothesis kinsey and dumas 2006 first used a commercial cfd code to test a naca0015 in the heave frame of motion being the pitch the only motion left to be analysed power extraction efficiencies as high as 34 were found considering a foil angle amplitude of 55 after this first approach a parametric study kinsey and dumas 2008 was performed considering different reduced frequencies non dimensional frequency and high pitching amplitudes finding that for 0 15 and 75 respectively the model produced the highest efficiencies advancing on their analysis kinsey and dumas 2012a also explored the effects of a three dimension hydrofoil model in terms of power extraction and found a 20 30 reduction in total power recovered it was suggested that this reduction can be avoided or minimized with the use of endplates afterwards seeking a more experimental analysis and comparisons with the numerical simulations a tandem configuration for the hydrofoils kinsey and dumas 2012b was considered in order to find the optimal spatial arrangement that maximized the power extraction efficiency a global phase parameter was defined to try and predict favourable scenarios for high gains from foil wake interactions but must be used with caution when analysing the system other lines of research evaluated the undulatory motion of biomimetic systems for wave energy harnessing purposes in specific wave velocities huang et al 2017 considered the effects of the reynolds number in a flexible naca0012 ji and huang 2017 and even studied energy recovery of plate in wavy wind flows li and huang 2017 different arrangements were tested in side by side configurations by ding and huang 2018 considering the phase difference and foil distance as variables showing that for a certain range the performance can be optimal moreover koutsogiannakis et al 2019 studied hydrokinetic turbines based in flapping foil mechanisms in single or multiple configurations using an unsteady boundary element method bem in the research the bottom and free surface effects were neglected while a parametric study in a single foil configuration was conducted together with the analysis of two foils in different arrangements and multiple foil devices it was shown from the research that despite not being able to achieve performances greater than a tidal turbine used as baseline twin foil and triple foil systems can be 11 and 21 more efficient than a single foil configuration respectively zhu and peng 2009 on the other hand focused on controlling vorticity to enhance foil performance and showed that it is possible to partially recover the vortex energy from the leading edge while huxham et al 2012 applied a prescribed pitch and heave motion on foils to study energy harnessing from tidal streams finally young et al 2014 published a comprehensive review on the evolution and main challenges of the flapping foil energy harvesters while xiao and zhu 2014 explored the studies available in the field showing the main results achieved other reviews bringing the latest advancements in flapping foils were conducted by shyy et al shyy 2010 and wu et al 2020 the two operation modes possible for a flapping hydrofoil under wavy flows inspired some researchers to develop and study a dual system used for propulsion and energy harnessing depending on the conditions topic that is totally aligned with the studies performed and presented in this article jones and platzer 2013 analysed multiple configurations for a propulsion or harvester device ranging from different foils profiles and number to isolated pitch heave or combined motions and under many different strouhal numbers despite the fact that the study was made considering air as the medium some of the conclusions obtained were insightful especially the ones regarding the motions phases and pitching amplitudes it was shown that a 90 phase and a high amplitude are ideal for the power extraction mode bowker et al 2015 2016 explored even more the dual system concept now focusing on asv autonomous surface vessels applications the research had several phases including the numerical simulation and evaluation of both modes the prototype manufacturing to perform the experiments and theoretical modelling and tests of a simplified pto to determine energy recovery feasibility totally aligned to the subject of the present work the research was consolidated in a thesis presenting the complete formulation and results for the analysis bowker 2018 important design parameters were defined in the study to guide future research and application of the technology in this context this article presents the results of a 2d parametric study considering a dual system for propulsion and energy harnessing based on flapping hydrofoils applied to the portugal coastal environment the main goal of the study was to test different configurations for the foils in unaligned or out of phase positions in order to evaluate performance improvements an analysis with research in the literature so far expanding the concept of a dual system bowker et al 2015 2016 bowker 2018 and seeking optimization via a parametric study all implementations of the present work were made using the commercial cfd tool ansys fluent with geometry and meshing process developed using the tools from ansys workbench package in section 2 1 brief theoretical review is presented covering the essential relations of flapping foil dynamics and wave models while section 3 brings the numerical methodology used in the study the results and further analyses are presented in sections iv and v 2 theoretical review 2 1 flapping foils a flapping foil system can be arranged in several ways to serve as augmented propulsion for a vessel and wave energy harnessing system for example considering the scope of the present research two foils would be placed in an unaligned configuration separated by horizontal and vertical distances of l x and l y respectively discussed in full in section 3 2 with a ship relative velocity of u in order to illustrate the system application in a wavy environment a simplified sketch is presented in fig 1 however as will be discussed in section 3 the free surface and bottom effects were neglected being the ship relative velocity u represented in fig 1 considered as a uniform relative flow velocity in the formulation presented and in all simulations and calculations performed considering now a generic foil profile with vertical translation heave and rotation pitch motions as shown in fig 2 the time varying forces actuating on the body are t l and m z thrust lift and moment components respectively thrust is the horizontal component of the acting forces in favour of motion and the angle θ is the pitch position the hydrodynamics coefficients for thrust and lift c t and c l respectively are calculated by the relations presented in eqs 1 and 2 1 c t t 1 2 ρ u 2 b c 2 c l l 1 2 ρ u 2 b c where ρ is the fluid density b is the foil span and c is the foil chord due to the periodic characteristic of the motion the power p is calculated in time by eq 3 3 p l d h d t m z d θ d t being d h d t and d θ d t the vertical and angular velocities respectively with power determined it is possible to obtain the power coefficient c p using an analogue expression as shown in eq 4 4 c p p 1 2 ρ u 3 b c moreover when the hydrofoil is acting as wave energy converter it is important to determine the power available as presented in eq 5 5 p a v a i l 1 2 ρ u 3 b d with d representing the total vertical motion amplitude which corresponds to both wave and foil amplitude as will be discussed in section 2 2 thus the efficiencies when the system is operating in energy harnessing and propulsion modes can be determined by eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 η e h p p a v a i l 7 η p t u p it is important to notice that as the motion is periodic thus the parameters used to calculate the efficiencies are time averages over one period of oscillation represented here by the bar over the variable 2 2 wave models waves are naturally occurring phenomena that suffer the influence of many factors ranging from wind sea bed topology and weather for example so as one would expect the development and improvement of wave models is as important to the design of sea related technology as it is intrinsically complex in this context irregular wave models try to include the most important factors and numerically predict sea elevation using statistical data while regular wave models are simple harmonic functions both approaches have their own applications depending on the problem studied and the degree of complexity wanted for the simulations a description of the foil motion based on regular waves will be presented next followed by a brief introduction on irregular waves models 2 2 1 regular waves foil motion and equal energy transport theory as the models for irregular waves are purely stochastic the amount of flow time needed in order to produce a meaningful set of results is considerable this scenario would not be ideal for a first approach especially in a parametric study where it is more important to compare as many cases as possible other than have a final design tested in situations close to the real environment in this context a way to avoid such complications is to use a regular wave model that is equivalent in terms of energy transport to a real sea state model like jonswap a regular wave can have its elevation represented mathematically by a sinusoidal function which reduces considerably the model complexity in eq 8 it is shown a generic regular wave function 8 h t a sin ω t ϕ where h is the elevation ω is the angular frequency ω 2 π f being f the frequency a is the wave amplitude and ϕ is the phase for simplification purposes and to focus only on the foils interactions and performance the foil motion is directly coupled to the wave elevation which is equivalent to a unity response amplitude operator rao at the foil locations in an eventual ship attached system this is assumption is adequate for waves with wavelength significantly greater than the ship length thus the position for heave and the respective velocities for each foil are easily obtained as shown in eqs 9 12 9 h 1 t h 0 sin ω e t φ 10 h 2 t h 0 sin ω e t φ ϕ 12 11 v y 1 t h 0 ω e cos ω e t φ 12 v y 2 t h 0 ω e cos ω e t φ ϕ 12 where h 1 and h 2 are the position of the upstream and downstream foil respectively h 0 is the heave amplitude ω e is the encounter frequency ω e ω k u k being the wave number φ is the phase between the heave and pitch motion v y 1 and v y 2 are the vertical velocities for each foil and ϕ 12 is the phase between foils for the pitching motion the functions that represent the angular position and velocity for each foil are as presented in eqs 13 16 13 θ 1 t θ 0 sin ω e t 14 θ 2 t θ 0 sin ω e t ϕ 12 15 ω 1 t θ 0 γ cos ω e t 16 ω 2 t θ 0 γ cos ω e t ϕ 12 where θ 1 and θ 2 are the angular position of the upstream and downstream foil respectively θ 0 is the pitch amplitude ω 1 and ω 2 are the angular velocities for each foil and ϕ 12 is the phase between foils the relations presented in eqs 9 16 describe the total motion of the flapping foil system with parameters such h 0 and γ being defined by the sea state and θ 0 φ and ϕ 12 by design so it is possible to simulate an irregular sea state using the sinusoidal functions aforementioned using the equal energy transport theory sang et al 2016 tedeschi et al 2011 as long as certain criteria is met according to eqs 17 and 18 17 t t e 18 e i r r e g ρ g 16 h s 2 e r e g ρ g 2 a 2 e r e g e i r r e g a 2 h s 4 thus from the energy period t e of the irregular wave the hydrofoils motion period t and consequently the frequency f 1 t and angular frequency γ are known the heave amplitude h 0 is easily obtained by h 0 a 2 from the sea elevation h s finally using the coastal data from the portuguese west coast and choosing the two most occurring sea states as will be presented in section 2 2 2 the parameters for the foil motion can be determined mathematically by the relations aforementioned 2 2 2 irregular waves and portugal coastal environment in general when studying hydrodynamic motions studies can be divided into frequency domain analysis and time domain analysis in a simplified way the frequency domain focuses on the analysis of the mathematical model for each given frequency band whereas the time domain focuses on the rate of change of the movement over time the frequency domain allows for the study of regular waves over diverse frequencies and irregular waves based upon the principle that they are the superposition of several waves with different frequencies and by performing a fourier series analysis one can derive a spectrum from a measured wave elevation record in the time domain in other words for a given irregular wave whose basis is the superposition of a series of sinusoidal regular waves the irregular signal wave is studied concerning its frequency characteristics using a fourier series analysis which implies that the signal being studied repeats itself after each long interval consequently the wave elevation in the time domain of a long crested irregular sea can be written as the summation of a considerable number of regular wave components in the frequency domain as shown in eq 19 19 ζ t n 1 n ζ a n cos k n x ω n t ε n in which for each component of n ζ a n wave amplitude component m ω n circular frequency component rad s k n wave number component rad m ε n random phase angle component rad in many cases wave frequencies follow a narrow banded frequency spectrum in this case when in the presence of a surface elevation that follows a gaussian distribution the wave amplitudes can be expressed as a rayleigh distribution for the energy spectra the n t h moment of the area under the spectrum is expressed by eq 20 20 m n ζ 0 ω n s ζ ω d ω some most common variables when analysing irregular waves are the significant wave height h s the peak period t p and the mean zero crossing period t z the significant wave height is the mean highest 1 3 of the waves in a given time record while the peak period is the wave period with the highest energy the energy period is often used for power estimation by the way of considering it the period of the regular wave with the same power density as the sea state under consideration and it is generically defined by eq 21 21 t e m 1 m 0 researchers have formulated several standard wave spectra most notably the bretschneider the pierson moskowitz and jonswap wave spectra have been created bretschneider 1959 pierson and moskowitz 1964 hasselmannet al 1973 the jonswap spectrum was derived from extensive wave measurements carried out in the north sea for fetch limited conditions its general equation is as presented in eq 22 22 s ζ ω 320 h 1 3 2 t p 4 ω 5 exp 1950 t p 4 ω 4 γ a where γ 3 3 peakness factor a exp ω ω p 1 σ 2 2 σ step function of ω in this particular case the energy period might be expressed as a function of the peak period pecher and kofoed 2017 or the mean wave period as shown in eq 23 23 t p 1 12 t e 1 29 t z due to the strict relation between peak period and energy period a regular wave was applied to the hydrofoils for wave generation data from the portuguese hydrographic institute was used as case study for the hydrofoil design the most common peak period off the west coast of portugal are in the range of 7 15 s and with significant wave heights in the range of 2 m with a predominant direction of nw as such two sea states were considered i t p 9 s with h s 2 m ii t p 13 s with h s 2 m costa et al 2001 next section will expand on the numerical methodology used in the simulations performed for the cases considered 3 numerical model 3 1 domain and methodology in order to perform the simulations the first step was to define the foil geometry it is well established in the literature that a symmetrical profile is the best option considering the harmonic nature of the motion imposed to the foil it is also preferable to keep the profile as thin as possible to avoid unnecessary residual drag forces kinsey and dumas 2008 xiao and zhu 2014 that way a naca four digit foil is a relatively simple geometry to be implemented and meets all the requirements being the naca0015 chosen as final design it is important to notice that this type of naca profile is broadly used in other studies available in the literature allowing for comparisons to be made and validations attained as will be presented in section 3 3 a naca0015 foil does not have camber which size and location are represented by the first two digits of the profile in terms of percentage of the chord and has a total thickness of only 15 of the chord the chord considered in all simulations was c 1 m while the reference span b 1 m numerical value used by the solver to calculate forces and coefficients was adopted for simplification purposes moreover the next step was to obtain a high quality mesh for the domains from the beginning it was defined that the best option to impose the foils motion in the ansys fluent solver was via the overset tool which reduces drastically the computational cost this is due to the fact that the information is transmitted between cells in different domains without the need of remeshing or defining interfaces which can be demanding however it was necessary to define an outer domain background as well an inner domain in the foil region the boundary conditions were considered as symmetry in the atmosphere and bottom regions of the domain to neglect the associated effects while velocity inlet and pressure outlet were chosen to give direct control on flow velocity and maintain continuity avoiding reversed flows both domains with the mesh already defined respective dimensions and boundary conditions can be seen in fig 3 and fig 4 r from fig 3 it is possible to observe that the background domain is rectangular allowing for a structured mesh to be easily generated moreover as the main goal was to calculate forces actuating on the foil an inflation layer and a triangular zone were defined in the region near the wall as shown in the detailed views of the foil leading edge and trailing edge presented in fig 5 it is important to notice that with the inflation layer defined the first element size near the foil wall could be controlled making it possible to keep the values of y inside the range considered acceptable 1 for the turbulent model chosen κ ω sst the body forces calculations are known to be more robust when the κ ω model is used near the wall and the unity value guarantees the solver uses its formulation making the results more precise κ ω sst is a hybrid model that switches formulation depending on the value of y with both meshes determined the outer and the inner domain were arranged following the configurations of the validation single foil case and the parametric study multiple arrangements double foil cases as will be presented in the next sections for all cases and for simplification purposes the foils were considered as totally submerged being the free surface and bottom effects neglected at this stage finally the foil motion following the formulation developed in section 2 2 2 was implemented via udfs user defined functions according to each case specification in table 1 a summary of the main setup parameters used in the simulations developed in ansys fluent is presented 3 2 parametric study procedure for the design of the parametric study several aspects were considered to achieve the final configurations these configurations were divided into a baseline case plus four different foil positions first the baseline case was modelled to represent the default configuration or the standard foils position both aligned the results of the baseline case were intended to provide a good starting point and allow to evaluate if the different configurations improved the system performance then a known problem of an aligned configuration is the interaction between the upstream and downstream foils which reduces the performance of the latter as such in order to inspect if it was possible to reduce this interaction out of phase configurations were considered varying both the distance inter foils and the location of the upstream and downstream foils in alternate up and down positions in fig 6 the parametric study design is shown with an schematic representation of the baseline case and the other four positions considered in the simulations the distances l x 1 l x 2 and l y were defined in terms of foil chords and are displayed in table 2 it is important to notice that the centre of rotation was adopted as being the aerodynamic centre of the foil which for a symmetrical profile with a closed trailing edge can be calculated analytically as 0 3994 c in addition the conditions used in all simulations performed in the parametric study can be seen in table 3 with parameters for each sea state and for all cases represented it is important to notice that the θ 0 m a x was defined by design and the phase differences φ and ϕ 12 were chosen as it represents an ideal scenario finally the reynolds number of the flow were around 1 10 6 for the conditions presented in table 3 foils chord and water properties this reynolds number in a typical turbulent flow represents a full scale model for a realistic flow using data for the sea states considered 3 3 mesh independency study and literature validation the last step before the parametric study itself was to perform a mesh independency study followed by a literature validation of the model and hypotheses adopted both analyses were developed using the same numerical approach of the parametric study but with a simpler arrangement of just one foil single foil case for that four meshes with different degrees of refinement were considered factor r 2 the procedure followed well established guidelines for verification and validation v v tests in numerical methods stern et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 which was also used in the reference consulted for the literature validation de silva and yamaguchi 2012 it is important to consider that as the study is fully based on forces calculations the parameter used for the analysis was the average thrust coefficient c t moreover the conditions used both in the independency study and literature validation were the presented in table 4 using the conditions from table 4 it was possible to test the four meshes obtained it is important to notice that the region near the foil wall was thoroughly refined with special attention to the mesh metrics as obtaining the best result possible for the body forces was the main goal however due to the nature of the overset implementation the background mesh had to be refined as well to ensure cell connectivity providing compatible element size in the wake region the graph from fig 7 shows c t versus number of elements while in table 5 it is also displayed the variation parameter regarding the most refined mesh ε i c t c o a r s e r c t f i n e r c t f i n e s t from fig 7 and table 5 it is clear how the results converge when the mesh is refined reaching a point that the variation of c t is almost neglectable thus to define the mesh that would be used in the simulations to come the final step was the verification analysis which from several parameters such as the convergence ratio r the order of accuracy p the correction factor c the generalized richardson extrapolation error δ r e and uncertainty u g it was possible to compare the meshes three by three for example for the first analysis regarding meshes i iii these parameters are obtained following the relations presented in eqs 24 28 stern et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 an equivalent procedure was adopted for meshes ii iv using the same notation 24 r ε i i i i ε i i i i i i 25 p ln ε i i i i i i ε i i i i ln r 26 c r p 1 r p t h 1 27 δ r e ε i i i i r p 1 28 u g c δ r e 1 c δ r e being p t h the order of accuracy necessary to make the correction factor reach the asymptotic range that way the results of the verification analysis is presented in table 6 from table 6 it is possible to conclude that the meshes in the finer range i iii produce uncertainties u g considerably lower than the ones in the coarser range ii iv being the variation of c t for mesh ii almost stable compared to the finer case table 5 thus mesh ii was the one chosen for the all simulations performed in the present article finally the model implemented were compared to the literature in order to evaluate if the hypotheses and simplifications adopted could produce quality results for that a reference article regarding wave devouring systems based on flapping foils was used de silva and yamaguchi 2012 it is worth mentioning that the study referenced is broadly used for comparison in many other works the graphs shown in fig 8 and fig 9 present the comparison between the thrust c t and lift c l coefficients respectively with the present method and de silva 2011 de silva and yamaguchi 2012 the results were computed over one oscillation period from figs 8 and 9 it is noticeable that the present method has a response close to the one implemented by the referenced article with the main differences more evident near the crests and troughs this is probably because the analysis made by de silva 2012 included more complex effects in the model such as the influence of the free surface even then it is comfortable to say that the assumptions made in the present study can produce satisfactory results with a good degree of generalization 4 results and discussion this section brings the main results obtained for the parametric study performed for the dual foil system the results are organized in two groups first the hydrodynamic coefficients thrust c t lift c l and power c p are displayed for each case and by sea state the main purpose here is to realize trends and provide data to be used by other authors or future works then a case comparison analysis in terms of power and efficiency is presented to help identifying the best overall configuration for both energy harnessing and propulsion modes 4 1 hydrodynamic coefficients 4 1 1 sea state i h s 2 m t p 9 s the graphs in fig 10 fig 11 and fig 12 present the hydrodynamic coefficients thrust c t lift c l and power c p respectively for all cases sea state i it is important to notice from figs 10 figs 11 and 12 that as the upstream foil does not suffer any type of interference in the flow the response obtained for that foil in all cases are virtually the same and can be represented by only one curve the same is valid for the downstream foil in cases 1 and 2 with an analogue situation occurring in cases 3 and 4 the downstream foil of the baseline case is represented to provide comparison with others downstream foils therefore from the beginning it is possible to conclude that the unaligned configuration as opposed to an in line one improved the response for all coefficients being however independent from the vertical position considered for each foil upstream foil up downstream foil down or upstream foil down downstream foil up cases 1 3 and 2 4 respectively when comparing cases 1 2 and 3 4 it is possible to observe a noticeable reduction in the thrust coefficient in the latter c t fig 10 which is not so expressive in lift c l fig 11 and power c p fig 12 coefficients another aspect to consider is that in cases 1 and 2 the out of phase configuration reduced the difference between the response in the upstream and downstream foils a desired effect cases 3 and 4 with the foils closer presented a reduction in overall performance for all coefficients being the lift curve c l fig 11 displaced along the period if compared to cases 1 and 2 probably due to a different interaction between the wave length and the inter foils spacing this also occurred because of the interference in flow caused by upstream foil wake region which can have different effects depending on the sea state considered as shown in fig 14 and discussed in the section 4 1 2 4 1 2 sea state ii h s 2 m t p 13 s for the sea state ii the same results in terms of the hydrodynamic coefficients thrust c t lift c l and power c p are presented in figs 13 figs 14 and 15 respectively in the graphs shown in figs 13 figs 14 and 15 the upstream foil results are again represented in one curve as the same effect from sea state i is observed being the response virtually identical the same is valid for the downstream foil in cases 1 2 and 3 4 from the graphs it is possible to observe that the behaviour is similar to sea state i results but the main difference observed is the amplitude of the coefficients obtained the thrust c t fig 13 and the lift c l fig 14 coefficients have an increased amplitude compared to sea state i while the power coefficient c p fig 15 has been displaced in the positive direction which contributes in the energy harnessing performance these effects is mostly due to the fact that as the wave frequency is reduced in sea state ii the system is able to operate with less losses from rapid changes in motion direction especially in the case 3 4 downstream foil response for the lift coefficient c l fig 14 it was shown that for certain conditions a configuration with closer foils can have its applications providing higher amplitude for lift and better performance in the energy harnessing mode despite overall not being the best solution for a dual system as will be discussed in section 4 2 4 2 case comparison and power evaluation the last set of results presented is a case comparison in terms of power and efficiency for each operation mode that allows for the determination of which case has better performance considering the configurations tested it is important to notice that all power calculations in the present work were performed using reference values for flow velocity u 1 m s and foil span as a 2d geometry span b was considered as 1 m the main goal was to provide data for comparison purposes and more importantly to obtain efficiencies that could be used to determine which configuration had a better performance in general thus power values are presentative only and limited to the conditions imposed to the simulations in fig 16 and fig 17 it is shown the total power for the whole system both foils for energy harnessing mode and the associated efficiencies respectively it is worth mentioning that the results were calculated following the notation presented in section 2 1 moreover the baseline case is treated as case 0 in all graphs displayed from fig 16 it is observed that for the sea state i there was almost no differences between the power extracted in all cases although cases 3 4 performed slightly better all improving if compared to the baseline however in the sea state ii cases 1 2 got a worse response compared to the first state inverting the scenario for cases 3 4 as power for the energy harnessing mode is calculated through moment and lift the increase in amplitude discussed in section 4 1 probably caused this effect the calculated power in energy harnessing mode for all cases were in the range of 65 85 w moreover the same behaviour is observed for the associated efficiency η e h fig 17 once the power available is constant for both sea states from eq 5 p a v a i l 352 91 w it is worth mention that the efficiency in the range of 20 is within the limits for this type of system and pitch amplitude kinsey and dumas 2006 lastly fig 18 and fig 19 display the total power both foils for propulsion mode and the associated efficiencies for each case respectively from fig 18 it is possible to observe that the power converted for propulsion is considerably less when compared to the results obtained for the energy harnessing mode that is justifiable by the fact that in the propulsion mode the main parameters are the forces acting in the horizontal direction and the flow velocity which in passive conditions like the ones tested produce less power than the total motion of the foil probably for the same reasons aforementioned sea state ii had slightly better results than sea state i but with small variation globally cases 1 and 2 had better performances and the power that potentially could be converted in propulsion was in the range of 34 38 w in fig 19 the efficiency for propulsion mode η p is displayed showing that as the reference power in this mode varies by case it was possible to find better efficiencies in the baseline cases even producing less power the efficiency obtained was in the range of 42 52 therefore analysing the data from the graphs in figs 16 19 it is possible to conclude that overall the best configurations for a dual foil system able to operate in both energy harnessing and propulsion modes are the ones presented by case 1 or 2 as the foil out of phase position does not influence much bringing the foils closer has a clear advantage in the energy harnessing mode but reduces considerably the performance for propulsion finally another important achievement was the reduction in the flow interaction between foils which proved to be beneficial for performance once they are placed in an out of phase configuration this has the potential to steer future works to reach an optimal design in systems of this nature 5 conclusion using flapping foils for propulsion or energy harnessing is a concept that has been gaining more interest in the past few decades as greener solutions has been substituting or complementing traditional maritime systems in this context the present work analysed the concept of a dual foil system that can operate in two modes energy harnessing and propulsion using the two most occurring sea states off the portuguese west coast as a case study it is known that in a dual foil configuration there are interferences in the flow downstream caused by the upstream foil thus to try to minimize such effect a 2d parametric study was proposed and performed along the necessary numerical validations from the numerical simulations it was found that the hydrodynamic coefficients thrust c t lift c l and power c p have better overall results in cases 1 2 than in cases 3 4 all compared to the baseline the downstream foil experienced a reduction in the flow interaction from the upstream foil if compared to the baseline which was a desired effect comparing both sea states it was possible to observe an increase in the amplitude of the coefficients in sea state ii mostly due to the reduction in rapid motion associated losses therefore analysing the power obtained for both modes energy harnessing and propulsion and the associated efficiencies it was possible to conclude that cases 1 2 provide the best overall performance as the out of phase position i e up or down alternate positions does not produce a considerable effect credit authorship

21548,the concept of cyclic ultimate strength of ship hull structures is proposed in navigating in waves a ship is subjected to alternate bending moments in hogging and sagging conditions the present study aims to demonstrate that the ship hull girder can experience a weaker ultimate strength under cyclic loading than under monotonically increasing bending moment as assumed in the conventional analysis nonlinear finite element method is employed using the explicit ls dyna solver to analyse the ultimate strength of a container ship hull structure subjected to monotonic and cyclic bending moments the numerical analyses under cyclic loading consider the ratcheting effect and the bauschinger effect in steel the ship hull girder can break due to the plastic strain accumulation and alternating plasticity collapse when the cyclic external load is greater than the elastic limit but lower than the monotonic ultimate limit the collapse modes of the hull girder under monotonic and cyclic loadings are compared to reveal their different failure principles keywords ultimate strength ship cyclic load ratcheting effect bauschinger effect finite element method 1 introduction the ultimate strength of ship hull structures is often assessed under monotonically increasing bending moment in hogging or sagging condition nevertheless as the ship experiences cyclic loading induced by the continuous hogging and sagging moments as shown in fig 1 the hull may collapse because of the alternating structural plasticity in extreme sea conditions at a lower bending moment than predicted by monotonically increasing bending moment in hogging or sagging condition this type of collapse could have been one of the causes of the break in two accidents of large container ships for example two accidents in a hogging condition maib 2008 mlit 2013 the importance of whipping contribution on extreme wave bending amidships has been reported by issc 2018 the whipping cycles can be superimposed on the wave loading and the whipping can amplify the wave bending in both sagging and hogging for example full scale measurements showed that the whipping vibration contribution is up to 70 for an 8600 teu container ship and 34 for a 4400 teu ship storhaug 2014 numerical calculations on present day very large container ships have shown that whipping vibrations can induce very large amplifications of the wave induced bending moments as confirmed also by experimental results corak et al 2015a 2015b furthermore accounting for hydroelastic effect in the whipping response increases even further the whipping response as predicted by calculations and also experiments rajendran et al 2016 rajendran and guedes soares 2016 classnk 2014 and sumi et al 2015 conducted an accident analysis of a container ship s hull girder failure it was concluded that the hogging bending moment at 90 of ultimate strength could cause permanent plate buckling deformation in the outer bottom the combination of the deviations in cargo weights local pressure loads plus regular wave loads and whipping effects could result in a total load exceeding its residual ultimate strength some initial studies by iijima and fujikubo 2015 and zhang et al 2016 focused on the cumulative damage of ship hull girders under cyclic extreme wave loadings with the above research background issc 2018 concluded that a ship hull girder failure is in fact a dynamic collapse process over one or more load cycles and the ultimate load should take into account the local pressure loads and the short duration slamming induced whipping loads these additional loads are essential for the large container ship with slender hull form and high speed the ultimate limit state is one of the criteria for ship structural assessment and design it is of critical importance to make clear the realistic ultimate strength of ships in service so as to derive the appropriate hull safety margin several efficient analysis methods have been proposed to analyse the ultimate longitudinal strength of traditional commercial ships under monotonic bending loading such as the nonlinear finite element method the idealized structural unit method and the smith s method the nonlinear finite element method is an accurate approach to analyse the ultimate strength of mono hull ships under complex loadings or the ultimate strength of multi hull ships tekgoz et al 2018 takami et al 2018 liu et al 2018d xu et al 2019 most investigations on the ultimate strength are relevant to the standard structural components in ship structures such as stiffened panels tanaka and endo 1988 ghavami and khedmati 2006 gordo and guedes soares 2008 xu and guedes soares 2013 xu et al 2017b and box girders qi et al 2015 gordo and guedes soares 2009 saad eldeen et al 2011 generally the buckling strength of stiffened plates is strongly affected by the flexural stiffness of the stiffener gordo and guedes soares 1993 and the ultimate strength and collapse of box girders subjected to vertical symmetrical bending moment are mainly caused by the buckling and yielding of structural elements in the compressive side of bending the standard structural components are suitable for developing the theoretical analysis of ultimate strength regarding the actual mono hull ships the multi bay models in the cross sectional level are often used to assess their ultimate longitudinal strength analysing the ship bending moment curvature relationship gordo and guedes soares 1996 some recent investigations on the ultimate strength have been focused on the accuracy of the assessment methods luis et al 2009 prestileo et al 2013 xu et al 2017a the comparison of the intact and damage conditions parunov et al 2017 2018 structural optimisation based on ultimate limit state kim and paik 2017 the ships subjected to asymmetrical bending loading gordo and guedes soares 1997 makouei et al 2015 tekgoz et al 2018 these special conditions should account for the neutral axis translations and rotations and the nonlinear finite element method is much more appropriate to be used for the ultimate strength analysis the ultimate strength analysis of ship hull girder under cyclic hogging and sagging loadings is more complicated than that under monotonic loading the investigations are also called the low cycle fatigue strength assessment of ship structures the cyclic ultimate strength i e ultimate strength under cyclic bending moments can be regarded as a combination of the fatigue and ultimate strength problems nevertheless these two problems are mainly investigated separately for ship structures in the literature some analyses of low cycle fatigue of steel materials can be found in kang and liu 2008 and dong et al 2019 the cyclic failure of steel materials is involved in both the ratcheting effect and the bauschinger effect lemaitre and chaboche 1990 these material characteristics have been studied extensively in the mechanics of materials but their application on the ship structural analysis is very rare 1 1 ratcheting effect the ratcheting effect in materials is a cyclic accumulation of plastic deformation under cyclic loading sun et al 2013 as shown in fig 2 the ratcheting can cause excessive plastic deformation with an increasing number of cycles leading to structural collapse and instability the effect of ratcheting behaviour has been considered in structural designs and safety assessments in the field of aircraft engines spacecraft and nuclear reactors lee and barlat 2014 also an example of the assessment of the breakage of a ship hull girder under cyclic bending was presented by zhang et al 2016 the ship structure is possible to undergo alternating plastic deformation when the ship hull girder is subjected to cyclic loading in tension and compression it is repeatedly deformed plastically with the reduced resistance and continuous accumulation of damage in the material the plastic strain is accumulated leading to the local fracture in the structure and finally to global collapse which is typically called alternating plasticity collapse but alternatively can be called ratcheting collapse in the conventional analysis of ship ultimate strength the structural collapse is dominated by the nonlinear buckling under compression however the ultimate strength analysis involving the ratcheting effect should consider both local fracture and global buckling accounting for the material fracture 1 2 bauschinger effect the bauschinger effect is defined as the phenomenon whereby the flow stress decreases when the loading direction is reversed lemaitre and chaboche 1990 for example when tensile loading is followed by compressive loading during uniaxial deformation the reverse curve commonly exhibits early re yielding see fig 3 this phenomenon refers to the change of the material stress strain characteristics as a result of the microscopic stress distribution the isotropic hardening model assumes that the yield strength is initially the same in tension and compression the kinematic hardening represents the bauschinger effect i e the yield stress in compression is lower than that if was loaded in tension firstly in isotropic hardening the centre of the yield surface is fixed but the radius is a function of the plastic strain in kinematic hardening the radius of the yield surface is fixed but the centre translates in the direction of the plastic strain lemaitre and chaboche 1990 for most metallic materials the hardening rule is between the isotropic and the kinematic the bauschinger effect has been found to be very small for conventional steels but larger for advanced high strength steels lee and barlat 2014 high strength steels approved by the classification societies and used for shipbuilding consider their yield stress tensile strength elongation fracture toughness and corrosion resistance lr 2019b but the bauschinger effect is not assessed for the classified steels the unknown property of the steel materials under complicated loadings increases the risk of ship safety when using new advanced high strength steels to develop lighter and high efficient ships 1 3 present work the aim of the present study is to illustrate that the progressive collapse of ship hull structures under continuous sagging and hogging moments can present a lower ultimate strength than under monotonically increasing bending moment cumulative collapse behaviour of ship hull girders under cyclic load was investigated by iijima and fujikubo 2015 and cui and yang 2018 these analyses aim to study the post ultimate strength under cyclic load which maximum applied load equals the monotonic ultimate load fig 4 a in the present analysis the maximum applied load is smaller fig 4b and more realistic material properties under cyclic load are accounted for the material plastic strain is accumulated leading to the local structural fractures so that the residual ultimate strength of entire structure decreases continuously under the repeated sagging and hogging bending moments the ultimate longitudinal strength of container ships has been widely investigated in monotonic hogging and sagging conditions kim et al 2012 tekgoz et al 2018 yang and wang 2018 wang et al 2018 2019 sumi 2019 the ultimate strength is reached in the sagging loading when the failure progresses to the uppermost sides and correspondingly in the hogging loading when the bottom structures fail in compression in this paper the ultimate strength of a container ship hull structure subjected to monotonic and cyclic bending moments are compared numerically to show differences in the ultimate loadings and the collapse modes nonlinear finite element method using explicit dynamic integration method implemented in ls dyna is employed firstly the ultimate longitudinal strength of a ship compartment under monotonic sagging and hogging bending moments is analysed to provide the reference values for the cyclic loading cases afterwards the same numerical model under cyclic loading is analysed accounting for the local structural fracture induced by the plastic strain accumulation the analysis considers the ratcheting effect and the bauschinger effect in steel materials under cyclic loading since the ship deck and bottom structures can suffer alternately the tensile and compressive plastic deformations the monotonic and cyclic cases are compared for better understanding the collapse modes of the hull structures the analysis method of ultimate strength of ships under cyclic load is discussed for assessing the safety margin in the limit state analysis 2 finite element modelling finite element simulations are performed to evaluate the ultimate strength of a container ship hull structure subjected to monotonic and cyclic bending moments the ultimate strength is analysed using the explicit ls dyna finite element solver hallquist 2006 considering the elastoplastic material properties and the large deformations the dynamic explicit solver similar as in the present study has been used for the ultimate strength analyses in parunov et al 2017 2018 the explicit solution is used in order to well simulate the ultimate strength under cyclic loading considering the structural fracture 2 1 description of the numerical model the present analysis considers a 4200 teu twenty foot equivalent unit container ship the main dimensions of the ship are given in table 1 and the scantlings of the ship compartment structures are presented in fig 5 the finite element model is one hold long covering one compartment see fig 6 the ship structure is modelled by shell elements for both plates and stiffeners consisting of 145 502 nodes and 151 262 elements the finite element size of the structure is chosen as 200 mm that is sixteen elements between web frames and four elements between longitudinals the mesh size should be fine enough to capture the buckling mode shapes as a dynamic multi cycle analysis will be performed the mesh cannot be finer according to the computational capability this mesh four or five elements between longitudinals or about ten times the plate thickness is often used in ship collision analysis to find equilibrium between practical application and reasonable results liu et al 2017 2018b when the finite element model is coarsely meshed the structural strain energy potential decreases leading to a larger stiffness and ultimate strength 2 2 material definition the material model selected from the library of ls dyna is mat 003 plastic kinematic which is suited to model isotropic and kinematic hardening plasticity with the option of including the material fracture strain hallquist 2006 this material model can well describe the plastic strain accumulation ratcheting effect and the onset of structural fracture during the cyclic bending process the bauschinger effect of the material is described simply using the kinematic hardening plasticity the material of the ship hull structure is ht36 steel and the material properties are defined as follows young s modulus e 206 gpa poisson s ratio μ 0 3 and yield stress σ y 355 mpa a plastic tangent modulus of 1 0 gpa is also defined which is acceptable for normal and higher strength steels iacs 2006 xu and guedes soares 2012 in conventional ultimate strength analysis of ship structures under monotonic loading the material fracture is not considered nevertheless in the case of cyclic loading the failure strain has to be defined in the material model since the structure will experience the material fracture induced by the plastic strain accumulation instead of the plastic buckling in compression here it is assumed that the onset of fracture occurs when the plastic strain of finite elements reaches 0 1 for simplicity the finite element will be deleted from the mesh when its effective plastic strain exceeds the defined failure strain hallquist 2006 the chosen value 0 1 is close to the magnitude of the critical failure strain defined in ship collision simulations for example the pes criterion peschmann 2001 the material failure strain analysed using this criterion is 0 107 taking an example of the finite element size of 200 mm and the plate thickness of 13 mm it should be mentioned that the definition of this magnitude 0 1 affects the number of cycles to structural collapse but does not change the conclusion on the cyclic ultimate strength in general the numerical definitions are conservative in the evaluation of ship structural strength for example the definition of the material yield strength and failure strain 2 3 load and boundary conditions the main global loading is the vertical bending moment including the still water and the wave induced loads here a full load condition is simulated by the compartment model the fully loaded cargos are considered and the lateral external loads include both the still water and the wave loadings the gravity is loaded in the form of inertial load to simulate the self weight of the compartment structures the boundary condition is one of the most important characteristics to be taken into account in the finite element analysis when the strength assessment is performed as half of the compartment model is created the symmetrical constraint is applied at the boundaries in each end section all the nodes are coupled to define a rigid body and the nodal translations and rotations are controlled by a reference node at the centre of gravity a small mass point is assigned to each reference node to satisfy the force equilibrium condition in the numerical model a rotation is applied of the two reference nodes at the fore and aft end sections imposing gradually in that way a curvature of the model the same definitions of boundary conditions were used by parunov et al 2017 the reaction moment is developed at each end section expressing the bending moment associated to the applied curvature 3 ultimate strength analysis under monotonic loading the ultimate bending moments of the ship hull in sagging and hogging conditions are assessed the hogging and sagging bending moment curvature curves are given in fig 7 some small oscillations are observed at the beginning of progressive deformation due to the explicit solver where the load and response are treated as dynamic processes similar phenomenon can be also found in classnk 2014 the stress contour plots at ultimate moment and at post buckling stage are shown in fig 8 the analyses provide the basis of the comparative study on the monotonic and cyclic loadings 3 1 hogging condition the ultimate load is analysed at 4 70 gnm for the half compartment model in hogging condition see fig 7 the deformation process of the compartment model is summarised herein as the compartment mainly undergoes longitudinal bending the compressive stresses are mainly concentrated at the outer bottom longitudinals connected to the bottom floors and the tensile stresses are at the hatch corners the structural deformation has an almost linear relationship with the applied bending moments until about 70 ultimate load which corresponds to the plastic buckling of the longitudinals in the outer bottom structures after yielding or buckling the stresses are redistributed continuously in the double bottom structures subjected to compressive loading associated with the decrease of the slope of hogging bending moment curvature curve the deformation of the ship hull girder accounts for the yielding and post buckling effect before the ultimate limit state is achieved finally most structural components yield in the uppermost sides and the plastic buckling is developed in the double bottom resulting in the hogging failure of the hull structures see fig 8a and b 3 2 sagging condition the ultimate load is analysed at 4 95 gnm for the half compartment model in sagging condition see fig 7 in the case of the container ship the ultimate strength in the sagging loading is about 5 3 higher than that in the hogging loading in the elastic stage the compartment structures under sagging and hogging moments experience almost the same response due to the same bending stiffness the small discrepancy is mainly induced by imposing the local loads in the simulations initially the compressive stresses are mainly concentrated at the uppermost sides especially at the hatch corners and the tensile stresses are at the double bottom structures afterwards the local plastic buckling occurs continuously at the ship side components closing to the bulkhead decreasing the slope of sagging bending moment curvature curve as the shell plates are very thick 50 mm eh36 steel in the uppermost sides the plastic buckling mainly occurs at the intermediate sides with thinner plate thickness 11 5 mm 25 mm finally most structural components yield in the double bottoms and the global plastic buckling is developed in the ship sides resulting in the sagging failure of the hull structures see fig 8c and d 4 ultimate strength analysis under cyclic loading 4 1 bending moment curvature curves it is expected that the ultimate strength of the hull girder under cyclic loading should be reduced as compared to the one under monotonic hogging or sagging bending it calculates the actual strength in the time domain following the history of the actual loading the analysed cyclic bending moment curvature curves of the hull structures are presented in fig 9 here the curvature is defined ranging from 0 166 to 0 166 rad km which corresponds to the bending moment of 4 47 and 4 23 gnm in the first sagging and hogging cycle respectively the moment magnitudes are 9 7 and 10 0 smaller than the monotonic ultimate strength 4 95 and 4 70 gnm under sagging and hogging moments respectively the analysed cyclic bending moment curvature curves shows that the hogging bending moment decreases to 3 71 gnm at the end of 12th cycle see fig 9 the decrease of residual ultimate strength illustrates that the hull structures should collapse before the 12th cycle in the simulation the 10 decrease of ultimate load is used in the cyclic analysis demonstrating that the hull structures under cyclic hogging and sagging loading present smaller ultimate longitudinal strength it should be mentioned that a smaller external bending moment is possible to collapse the hull structures with more cycles the container ship is classed with lloyd s register and the design loads are 4 85 and 5 12 gnm for sagging and hogging respectively lr 2019a in the numerical analyses the hull girder ultimate strength is twice the calculated bending moments since only half compartment is modelled here the design safety margins are 1 84 4 47 2 4 85 for sagging and 1 65 4 23 2 5 12 for hogging when employing the values of cyclic ultimate strength 4 2 failure mode under the cyclic moment the cracks occur at the region of stress concentration due to the plastic strain accumulation the cracks reduce the bending stiffness and the residual ultimate strength of the hull structures especially at the double bottoms leading to the hogging failure of the ship figs 10 and 11 the cracks occur at regions of stress concentration i e the outer bottom longitudinals webs connected to the bottom floors fig 12 a and a hatch corner closing to the non watertight bulkhead fig 12b under monotonic ultimate hogging and sagging moments the maximum plastic strains at the ultimate loads are 0 02 and 0 01 respectively refer to the maximum stresses in fig 8a and c the very small plastic strains do not result in the material fracture in the structures and the collapse of hull structures is dominated by the nonlinear buckling of structures under compression nevertheless under the cyclic moment the continuous plastic strain accumulation leads to larger stress concentration and fracture at the local components for example the initial fracture occurs at the 9th cycle due to the plastic strain accumulation under cyclic loading as shown in fig 13 the plastic strain is accumulated during the compressive process in hogging but not accumulated during the tensile process in sagging the cyclic failure of hull girder is dominated by the accumulated failures under the hogging moments generally the failure modes of hull structures under monotonic and cyclic loadings are different 5 discussion some aspects of particular relevance to the ultimate strength analysis under cyclic loading are discussed to investigate the rationality of numerical modelling 5 1 omission of dynamic effect as the cyclic extreme wave load happens in a short time the specific time interval should be estimated to investigate whether to consider the structural dynamic effect when the distance between two wave crests is similar to the ship length the sagging and hogging conditions happen and the ship experiences the repeated hull bending in deep water the speed v w of the regular water wave can be analysed using its wavelength l bowden 1983 1 v w g l 2 π where g is the acceleration of gravity as l is equal to the ship length in the hogging and sagging conditions the most dangerous wave speed v w is 19 7 m s for the container ship with 248 m length eq 1 the analysed values are reasonable for wave length velocity and period for linear waves as shown in fig 3 3 in dnvgl 2017 in heavy seas the ship speed should be reduced even if considering that the ship navigates with the service speed of 13 0 m s 24 kn in a head wave the alternative time interval between hogging and sagging is 3 8 s 248 19 7 13 0 2 s as the time of the response is relatively long in the view of dynamic loading liu et al 2018b liu and guedes soares 2019 the ship girder bending amidships is reasonable to be assumed as quasi static 5 2 material properties 5 2 1 isotropic and kinematic hardening the isotropic hardening increases the yield surface of the material not considering the bauschinger effect it presents better plasticity than the kinematic hardening here one more simulation using the isotropic hardening material model is presented see fig 14 similar failure mode is found i e the cracks occur at the same locations in the double bottoms leading to the hogging failure although the crack does not occur at the hatch corner in the simulation the compartment model collapses at the 13th cycle but it will not change the conclusion on the ultimate strength of ship hull under cyclic loading 5 2 2 ratcheting shakedown if the cyclic load is within a certain range the plastic deformation accumulation due to ratcheting will not indefinitely develop to collapse and instead the material will reach a shakedown state after certain cycles sun et al 2013 2018 it is mainly caused by the material hardening in tension compression cyclic load in other words if the cyclic load exceeds the shakedown limit the plastic deformation accumulation will develop continuously until the structural collapse as described in section 4 the concept of the ratcheting shakedown was also introduced into the ultimate strength analysis of ship hull girder under cyclic load zhang et al 2016 therefore it is possible to the find the minimum cyclic load to collapse the ship hull structures based on the shakedown limit of the steel materials actually it is a challenge to analyse the ultimate strength of real ships under cyclic load without the incorporation of the appropriate material model considering the ratcheting shakedown in finite element analysis moreover the accuracy for describing the material property of shipbuilding steels has to be further validated on the other hand the ageing effect of corrosion reduces both the plate thickness and the mechanical properties of steel materials especially the ultimate tensile strength and the fracture strain garbatov et al 2014 2016 liu et al 2018a the corrosion effect on the ratcheting shakedown is also unknown therefore this paper mainly provides the concept of cyclic ultimate strength i e the minimum cyclic load to break up the hull structures in the limit state assessment of ships instead of calculating accurately the minimum cyclic ultimate load to collapse the hull structures 5 3 influence of local loads two more simulations in hogging and sagging conditions are performed omitting the local loads such as the lateral water pressures the weight of the containers and the self weight of the compartment the analysed ultimate hogging and sagging moments are 5 06 gnm and 4 92 gnm respectively fig 15 it illustrates that the omission of local loads overestimates about 7 6 and underestimates about 0 6 the bending stiffness of the hull girder in hogging and sagging conditions respectively the influence is not very significant on the ultimate strength analysis demonstrating that the transverse loads contribute only in a limited way to the longitudinal ultimate strength of hull structures 6 comments on limit state analysis structures should be designed to avoid failing in ultimate fatigue serviceability or accidental limit states issc 2018 the analysed situation in the present study is a limiting condition involving both ultimate and fatigue limit states the predefined condition under cyclic loading presents a weaker ultimate strength to support the structural capacity nevertheless this important phenomenon is omitted in the conventional ultimate strength analysis in the analysis presented in section 4 a small number of cycles are enough to reach the ultimate failure of hull structure i e low cycle fatigue failure as a ship experiences continuous extreme waves in a destructive storm the hull structure is possible to undergo the cyclic extreme load in alternative hogging and sagging conditions during a short time thus the failure principle of the low cycle fatigue is the elastoplastic material deformation and fracture characteristics under applied tensile compressive and multi axial stresses and the residual plastic buckling strength of the hull structure the analysis is not related to the prediction of structural lifetime in fatigue limit state analysis although the high cycle fatigue induced small cracks in the structural components can accelerate the low cycle fatigue failure it is not the key factor to result in the cyclic ultimate failure of ship hull structure zhang et al 2016 in the view of ship structural analysis future developments of the limit state analysis should pay attention to the concept of cyclic ultimate strength involving the uncertainty of material plasticity and fracture characteristics this concept also affects the uncertainty analysis of ultimate strength of ship hulls required in the use of structural reliability based design and assessment methodologies 7 conclusions numerical assessments of the ultimate strength of ship hull structures subjected to monotonic and cyclic bending moments are performed demonstrating the existence of the cyclic ultimate strength of ship hull structures the ship hull girder presents weaker ultimate strength under cyclic load due to the plastic strain accumulation and the alternating plasticity collapse the effect of cyclic loading on the material hardening and fracture is considered comprehensively in the ship hull ultimate strength analysis for the first time the results show that the cyclic ultimate load of hull structures is lower than the conventional ultimate strength by about 10 the continuous plastic strain accumulation leads to larger stress concentration and fracture at the local components so that the residual ultimate strength of hull structures decreases continuously until becoming less than the external loads which results in structural collapse the present simulation gives new insights into the ultimate limit state analysis of ships the explicit finite element analysis has to be used to assess the cyclic ultimate strength of ship hulls associated with crack initiation and propagation the explicit analysis is less accurate than the implicit analysis as both the hull structural systems and the material properties in tension compression cyclic load are very complex the results of a series of explicit analyses are not very accurate and reliable to get a function of cycles with the cyclic ultimate strength this limitation also illustrates why the lower cyclic load is not selected in the present study the ratcheting and the bauschinger effect in steel materials are not considered in the conventional analysis of ship hull ultimate strength and this omission can lead to the overestimation in the evaluation of ship safety margin furthermore other unfavourable material properties may be considered for example the corrosion effect in ageing structures the residual plastic strain induced by the ship structural manufacturing liu et al 2018c and the material degradation due to high cycle fatigue it is recommended to consider the cyclic ultimate load in the evaluation of the ultimate limit state analysis of

ultimate strength of ship hull structures is often assessed under monotonically increasing bending moment in hogging or sagging condition nevertheless as the ship experiences cyclic loading induced by the continuous hogging and sagging moments as shown in fig 1 the hull may collapse because of the alternating structural plasticity in extreme sea conditions at a lower bending moment than predicted

extensively in the mechanics of materials but their application on the ship structural analysis is very rare 1 1 ratcheting effect the ratcheting effect in materials is a cyclic accumulation of plastic deformation under cyclic loading sun et al 2013 as shown in fig 2 the ratcheting can cause excessive plastic deformation with an increasing number of cycles leading to structural collapse and instability the effect of ratcheting behaviour has been considered in structural designs and safety assessments in the field of aircraft engines spacecraft and nuclear reactors lee and barlat 2014 also an example of the assessment of the breakage of a ship hull girder under cyclic bending was presented by zhang et al 2016 the ship structure is possible to undergo alternating plastic deformation when the ship hull girder is subjected to cyclic loading in tension and compression it is repeatedly deformed plastically with the reduced resistance and continuous accumulation of damage in the material the plastic strain is accumulated leading to the local fracture in the structure and finally to global collapse which is typically called alternating plasticity collapse but alternatively can be called ratcheting collapse in the conventional analysis of ship ultimate strength the structural collapse is dominated by the nonlinear buckling under compression however the ultimate strength analysis involving the ratcheting effect should consider both local fracture and global buckling accounting for the material fracture 1 2 bauschinger effect the bauschinger effect is defined as the phenomenon whereby the flow stress decreases when the loading direction is reversed lemaitre and chaboche 1990 for example when tensile loading is followed by compressive loading during uniaxial deformation the reverse curve commonly exhibits early re yielding see fig 3 this phenomenon refers to the change of the material stress strain characteristics as a result of the microscopic stress distribution the isotropic hardening model assumes that the yield strength is initially the same in tension and compression the kinematic hardening represents the bauschinger effect i e the yield stress in compression is lower than that if was loaded in tension firstly in isotropic hardening the centre of the yield surface is fixed but the radius is a function of the plastic strain in kinematic hardening the radius of the yield surface is fixed but the centre translates in the direction of the plastic strain lemaitre and chaboche 1990 for most metallic materials the hardening rule is between the isotropic and the kinematic the bauschinger effect has been found to be very small for conventional steels but larger for advanced high strength steels lee and barlat 2014 high strength steels approved by the classification societies and used for shipbuilding consider their yield stress tensile strength elongation fracture toughness and corrosion resistance lr 2019b but the bauschinger effect is not assessed for the classified steels the unknown property of the steel materials under complicated loadings increases the risk of ship safety when using new advanced high strength steels to develop lighter and high efficient ships 1 3 present work the aim of the present study is to illustrate that the progressive collapse of ship hull structures under continuous sagging and hogging moments can present a lower ultimate strength than under monotonically increasing bending moment cumulative collapse behaviour of ship hull girders under cyclic load was investigated by iijima and fujikubo 2015 and cui and yang 2018 these analyses aim to study the post ultimate strength under cyclic load which maximum applied load equals the monotonic ultimate load fig 4 a in the present analysis the maximum applied load is smaller fig 4b and more realistic material properties under cyclic load are accounted for the material plastic strain is accumulated leading to the local structural fractures so that the residual ultimate strength of entire structure decreases continuously under the repeated sagging and hogging bending moments the ultimate longitudinal strength of container ships has been widely investigated in monotonic hogging and sagging conditions kim et al 2012 tekgoz et al 2018 yang and wang 2018 wang et al 2018 2019 sumi 2019 the ultimate strength is reached in the sagging loading when the failure progresses to the uppermost sides and correspondingly in the hogging loading when the bottom structures fail in compression in this paper the ultimate strength of a container ship hull structure subjected to monotonic and cyclic bending moments are compared numerically to show differences in the ultimate loadings and the collapse modes nonlinear finite element method using explicit dynamic integration method implemented in ls dyna is employed firstly the ultimate longitudinal strength of a ship compartment under monotonic sagging and hogging bending moments is analysed to provide the reference values for the cyclic loading cases afterwards the same numerical model under cyclic loading is analysed accounting for the local structural fracture induced by the plastic strain accumulation the analysis considers the ratcheting effect and the bauschinger effect in steel materials under cyclic loading since the ship deck and bottom structures can suffer alternately the tensile and compressive plastic deformations the monotonic and cyclic cases are compared for better understanding the collapse modes of the hull structures the analysis method of ultimate strength of ships under cyclic load is discussed for assessing the safety margin in the limit state analysis 2 finite element modelling finite element simulations are performed to evaluate the ultimate strength of a container ship hull structure subjected to monotonic and cyclic bending moments the ultimate strength is analysed using the explicit ls dyna finite element solver hallquist 2006 considering the elastoplastic material properties and the large deformations the dynamic explicit solver similar as in the present study has been used for the ultimate strength analyses in parunov et al 2017 2018 the explicit solution is used in order to well simulate the ultimate strength under cyclic loading considering the structural fracture 2 1 description of the numerical model the present analysis considers a 4200 teu twenty foot equivalent unit container ship the main dimensions of the ship are given in table 1 and the scantlings of the ship compartment structures are presented in fig 5 the finite element model is one hold long covering one compartment see fig 6 the ship structure is modelled by shell elements for both plates and stiffeners consisting of 145 502 nodes and 151 262 elements the finite element size of the structure is chosen as 200 mm that is sixteen elements between web frames and four elements between longitudinals the mesh size should be fine enough to capture the buckling mode shapes as a dynamic multi cycle analysis will be performed the mesh cannot be finer according to the computational capability this mesh four or five elements between longitudinals or about ten times the plate thickness is often used in ship collision analysis to find equilibrium between practical application and reasonable results liu et al 2017 2018b when the finite element model is coarsely meshed the structural strain energy potential decreases leading to a larger stiffness and ultimate strength 2 2 material definition the material model selected from the library of ls dyna is mat 003 plastic kinematic which is suited to model isotropic and kinematic hardening plasticity with the option of including the material fracture strain hallquist 2006 this material model can well describe the plastic strain accumulation ratcheting effect and the onset of structural fracture during the cyclic bending process the bauschinger effect of the material is described simply using the kinematic hardening plasticity the material of the ship hull structure is ht36 steel and the material properties are defined as follows young s modulus e 206 gpa poisson s ratio μ 0 3 and yield stress σ y 355 mpa a plastic tangent modulus of 1 0 gpa is also defined which is acceptable for normal and higher strength steels iacs 2006 xu and guedes soares 2012 in conventional ultimate strength analysis of ship structures under monotonic loading the material fracture is not considered nevertheless in the case of cyclic loading the failure strain has to be defined in the material model since the structure will experience the material fracture induced by the plastic strain accumulation instead of the plastic buckling in compression here it is assumed that the onset of fracture occurs when the plastic strain of finite elements reaches 0 1 for simplicity the finite element will be deleted from the mesh when its effective plastic strain exceeds the defined failure strain hallquist 2006 the chosen value 0 1 is close to the magnitude of the critical failure strain defined in ship collision simulations for example the pes criterion peschmann 2001 the material failure strain analysed using this criterion is 0 107 taking an example of the finite element size of 200 mm and the plate thickness of 13 mm it should be mentioned that the definition of this magnitude 0 1 affects the number of cycles to structural collapse but does not change the conclusion on the cyclic ultimate strength in general the numerical definitions are conservative in the evaluation of ship structural strength for example the definition of the material yield strength and failure strain 2 3 load and boundary conditions the main global loading is the vertical bending moment including the still water and the wave induced loads here a full load condition is simulated by the compartment model the fully loaded cargos are considered and the lateral external loads include both the still water and the wave loadings the gravity is loaded in the form of inertial load to simulate the self weight of the compartment structures the boundary condition is one of the most important characteristics to be taken into account in the finite element analysis when the strength assessment is performed as half of the compartment model is created the symmetrical constraint is applied at the boundaries in each end section all the nodes are coupled to define a rigid body and the nodal translations and rotations are controlled by a reference node at the centre of gravity a small mass point is assigned to each reference node to satisfy the force equilibrium condition in the numerical model a rotation is applied of the two reference nodes at the fore and aft end sections imposing gradually in that way a curvature of the model the same definitions of boundary conditions were used by parunov et al 2017 the reaction moment is developed at each end section expressing the bending moment associated to the applied curvature 3 ultimate strength analysis under monotonic loading the ultimate bending moments of the ship hull in sagging and hogging conditions are assessed the hogging and sagging bending moment curvature curves are given in fig 7 some small oscillations are observed at the beginning of progressive deformation due to the explicit solver where the load and response are treated as dynamic processes similar phenomenon can be also found in classnk 2014 the stress contour plots at ultimate moment and at post buckling stage are shown in fig 8 the analyses provide the basis of the comparative study on the monotonic and cyclic loadings 3 1 hogging condition the ultimate load is analysed at 4 70 gnm for the half compartment model in hogging condition see fig 7 the deformation process of the compartment model is summarised herein as the compartment mainly undergoes longitudinal bending the compressive stresses are mainly concentrated at the outer bottom longitudinals connected to the bottom floors and the tensile stresses are at the hatch corners the structural deformation has an almost linear relationship with the applied bending moments until about 70 ultimate load which corresponds to the plastic buckling of the longitudinals in the outer bottom structures after yielding or buckling the stresses are redistributed continuously in the double bottom structures subjected to compressive loading associated with the decrease of the slope of hogging bending moment curvature curve the deformation of the ship hull girder accounts for the yielding and post buckling effect before the ultimate limit state is achieved finally most structural components yield in the uppermost sides and the plastic buckling is developed in the double bottom resulting in the hogging failure of the hull structures see fig 8a and b 3 2 sagging condition the ultimate load is analysed at 4 95 gnm for the half compartment model in sagging condition see fig 7 in the case of the container ship the ultimate strength in the sagging loading is about 5 3 higher than that in the hogging loading in the elastic stage the compartment structures under sagging and hogging moments experience almost the same response due to the same bending stiffness the small discrepancy is mainly induced by imposing the local loads in the simulations initially the compressive stresses are mainly concentrated at the uppermost sides especially at the hatch corners and the tensile stresses are at the double bottom structures afterwards the local plastic buckling occurs continuously at the ship side components closing to the bulkhead decreasing the slope of sagging bending moment curvature curve as the shell plates are very thick 50 mm eh36 steel in the uppermost sides the plastic buckling mainly occurs at the intermediate sides with thinner plate thickness 11 5 mm 25 mm finally most structural components yield in the double bottoms and the global plastic buckling is developed in the ship sides resulting in the sagging failure of the hull structures see fig 8c and d 4 ultimate strength analysis under cyclic loading 4 1 bending moment curvature curves it is expected that the ultimate strength of the hull girder under cyclic loading should be reduced as compared to the one under monotonic hogging or sagging bending it calculates the actual strength in the time domain following the history of the actual loading the analysed cyclic bending moment curvature curves of the hull structures are presented in fig 9 here the curvature is defined ranging from 0 166 to 0 166 rad km which corresponds to the bending moment of 4 47 and 4 23 gnm in the first sagging and hogging cycle respectively the moment magnitudes are 9 7 and 10 0 smaller than the monotonic ultimate strength 4 95 and 4 70 gnm under sagging and hogging moments respectively the analysed cyclic bending moment curvature curves shows that the hogging bending moment decreases to 3 71 gnm at the end of 12th cycle see fig 9 the decrease of residual ultimate strength illustrates that the hull structures should collapse before the 12th cycle in the simulation the 10 decrease of ultimate load is used in the cyclic analysis demonstrating that the hull structures under cyclic hogging and sagging loading present smaller ultimate longitudinal strength it should be mentioned that a smaller external bending moment is possible to collapse the hull structures with more cycles the container ship is classed with lloyd s register and the design loads are 4 85 and 5 12 gnm for sagging and hogging respectively lr 2019a in the numerical analyses the hull girder ultimate strength is twice the calculated bending moments since only half compartment is modelled here the design safety margins are 1 84 4 47 2 4 85 for sagging and 1 65 4 23 2 5 12 for hogging when employing the values of cyclic ultimate strength 4 2 failure mode under the cyclic moment the cracks occur at the region of stress concentration due to the plastic strain accumulation the cracks reduce the bending stiffness and the residual ultimate strength of the hull structures especially at the double bottoms leading to the hogging failure of the ship figs 10 and 11 the cracks occur at regions of stress concentration i e the outer bottom longitudinals webs connected to the bottom floors fig 12 a and a hatch corner closing to the non watertight bulkhead fig 12b under monotonic ultimate hogging and sagging moments the maximum plastic strains at the ultimate loads are 0 02 and 0 01 respectively refer to the maximum stresses in fig 8a and c the very small plastic strains do not result in the material fracture in the structures and the collapse of hull structures is dominated by the nonlinear buckling of structures under compression nevertheless under the cyclic moment the continuous plastic strain accumulation leads to larger stress concentration and fracture at the local components for example the initial fracture occurs at the 9th cycle due to the plastic strain accumulation under cyclic loading as shown in fig 13 the plastic strain is accumulated during the compressive process in hogging but not accumulated during the tensile process in sagging the cyclic failure of hull girder is dominated by the accumulated failures under the hogging moments generally the failure modes of hull structures under monotonic and cyclic loadings are different 5 discussion some aspects of particular relevance to the ultimate strength analysis under cyclic loading are discussed to investigate the rationality of numerical modelling 5 1 omission of dynamic effect as the cyclic extreme wave load happens in a short time the specific time interval should be estimated to investigate whether to consider the structural dynamic effect when the distance between two wave crests is similar to the ship length the sagging and hogging conditions happen and the ship experiences the repeated hull bending in deep water the speed v w of the regular water wave can be analysed using its wavelength l bowden 1983 1 v w g l 2 π where g is the acceleration of gravity as l is equal to the ship length in the hogging and sagging conditions the most dangerous wave speed v w is 19 7 m s for the container ship with 248 m length eq 1 the analysed values are reasonable for wave length velocity and period for linear waves as shown in fig 3 3 in dnvgl 2017 in heavy seas the ship speed should be reduced even if considering that the ship navigates with the service speed of 13 0 m s 24 kn in a head wave the alternative time interval between hogging and sagging is 3 8 s 248 19 7 13 0 2 s as the time of the response is relatively long in the view of dynamic loading liu et al 2018b liu and guedes soares 2019 the ship girder bending amidships is reasonable to be assumed as quasi static 5 2 material properties 5 2 1 isotropic and kinematic hardening the isotropic hardening increases the yield surface of the material not considering the bauschinger effect it presents better plasticity than the kinematic hardening here one more simulation using the isotropic hardening material model is presented see fig 14 similar failure mode is found i e the cracks occur at the same locations in the double bottoms leading to the hogging failure although the crack does not occur at the hatch corner in the simulation the compartment model collapses at the 13th cycle but it will not change the conclusion on the ultimate strength of ship hull under cyclic loading 5 2 2 ratcheting shakedown if the cyclic load is within a certain range the plastic deformation accumulation due to ratcheting will not indefinitely develop to collapse and instead the material will reach a shakedown state after certain cycles sun et al 2013 2018 it is mainly caused by the material hardening in tension compression cyclic load in other words if the cyclic load exceeds the shakedown limit the plastic deformation accumulation will develop continuously until the structural collapse as described in section 4 the concept of the ratcheting shakedown was also introduced into the ultimate strength analysis of ship hull girder under cyclic load zhang et al 2016 therefore it is possible to the find the minimum cyclic load to collapse the ship hull structures based on the shakedown limit of the steel materials actually it is a challenge to analyse the ultimate strength of real ships under cyclic load without the incorporation of the appropriate material model considering the ratcheting shakedown in finite element analysis moreover the accuracy for describing the material property of shipbuilding steels has to be further validated on the other hand the ageing effect of corrosion reduces both the plate thickness and the mechanical properties of steel materials especially the ultimate tensile strength and the fracture strain garbatov et al 2014 2016 liu et al 2018a the corrosion effect on the ratcheting shakedown is also unknown therefore this paper mainly provides the concept of cyclic ultimate strength i e the minimum cyclic load to break up the hull structures in the limit state assessment of ships instead of calculating accurately the minimum cyclic ultimate load to collapse the hull structures 5 3 influence of local loads two more simulations in hogging and sagging conditions are performed omitting the local loads such as the lateral water pressures the weight of the containers and the self weight of the compartment the analysed ultimate hogging and sagging moments are 5 06 gnm and 4 92 gnm respectively fig 15 it illustrates that the omission of local loads overestimates about 7 6 and underestimates about 0 6 the bending stiffness of the hull girder in hogging and sagging conditions respectively the influence is not very significant on the ultimate strength analysis demonstrating that the transverse loads contribute only in a limited way to the longitudinal ultimate strength of hull structures 6 comments on limit state analysis structures should be designed to avoid failing in ultimate fatigue serviceability or accidental limit states issc 2018 the analysed situation in the present study is a limiting condition involving both ultimate and fatigue limit states the predefined condition under cyclic loading presents a weaker ultimate strength to support the structural capacity nevertheless this important phenomenon is omitted in the conventional ultimate strength analysis in the analysis presented in section 4 a small number of cycles are enough to reach the ultimate failure of hull structure i e low cycle fatigue failure as a ship experiences continuous extreme waves in a destructive storm the hull structure is possible to undergo the cyclic extreme load in alternative hogging and sagging conditions during a short time thus the failure principle of the low cycle fatigue is the elastoplastic material deformation and fracture characteristics under applied tensile compressive and multi axial stresses and the residual plastic buckling strength of the hull structure the analysis is not related to the prediction of structural lifetime in fatigue limit state analysis although the high cycle fatigue induced small cracks in the structural components can accelerate the low cycle fatigue failure it is not the key factor to result in the cyclic ultimate failure of ship hull structure zhang et al 2016 in the view of ship structural analysis future developments of the limit state analysis should pay attention to the concept of cyclic ultimate strength involving the uncertainty of material plasticity and fracture characteristics this concept also affects the uncertainty analysis of ultimate strength of ship hulls required in the use of structural reliability based design and assessment methodologies 7 conclusions numerical assessments of the ultimate strength of ship hull structures subjected to monotonic and cyclic bending moments are performed demonstrating the existence of the cyclic ultimate strength of ship hull structures the ship hull girder presents weaker ultimate strength under cyclic load due to the plastic strain accumulation and the alternating plasticity collapse the effect of cyclic loading on the material hardening and fracture is considered comprehensively in the ship hull ultimate strength analysis for the first time the results show that the cyclic ultimate load of hull structures is lower than the conventional ultimate strength by about 10 the continuous plastic strain accumulation leads to larger stress concentration and fracture at the local components so that the residual ultimate strength of hull structures decreases continuously until becoming less than the external loads which results in structural collapse the present simulation gives new insights into the ultimate limit state analysis of ships the explicit finite element analysis has to be used to assess the cyclic ultimate strength of ship hulls associated with crack initiation and propagation the explicit analysis is less accurate than the implicit analysis as both the hull structural systems and the material properties in tension compression cyclic load are very complex the results of a series of explicit analyses are not very accurate and reliable to get a function of cycles with the cyclic ultimate strength this limitation also illustrates why the lower cyclic load is not selected in the present study the ratcheting and the bauschinger effect in steel materials are not considered in the conventional analysis of ship hull ultimate strength and this omission can lead to the overestimation in the evaluation of ship safety margin furthermore other unfavourable material properties may be considered for example the corrosion effect in ageing structures the residual plastic strain induced by the ship structural manufacturing liu et al 2018c and the material degradation due to high cycle fatigue it is recommended to consider the cyclic ultimate load in the evaluation of the ultimate limit state analysis of

21549,the intense surge motion the low installation costs and the less environmental threat promote the development of the nearshore wave energy technologies which are often classified as oscillating wave surge converters owscs this paper investigates the hydrodynamic performance of a multi cylindrical fully submerged owsc by developing a 3 d numerical model based on fully nonlinear potential flow theory and time domain higher order element method hobem a local change in the geometric configuration is verified as an effective approach to enhance wave energy extraction in long waves then it is found that a larger incident wave height not only reduces the peak value of the capture efficiency but it also leads to a change in the real resonant frequency the geometrical parameters have a significant influence on the energy extraction with the thicker wider and shallower device demonstrating both higher average generated power and capture efficiency in low frequency region meanwhile the maximum efficiency is mainly related to the optimal pto parameters a two value optimization strategy on pto damping is applied to industriously maximize the absorbed energy over whole wave frequency region and is easier to be implemented in practical application compared with ideal optimal scheme at each frequency component of incident wave spectrum keywords owsc hobem optimization strategy capture efficiency fully nonlinear simulation 1 introduction during recent years various wave energy converter wec technologies are widely proposed for extracting energy from vertical or horizontal motions of water particles within ocean waves for deep water region fluid particles move in a circular motion trace to meet the motion conditions of waves so much of offshore wecs i e oscillating buoy type converters relies strongly on energy utilization from heave motion when incident waves propagate from offshore to nearshore as shown in fig 1 the wave seabed interaction i e shoaling effect elongates the circular motion into a horizontal elliptic shape which amplifies the horizontal movement of water particles in the near shore region creating an apparent surge zone thus a flap type converter oscillating back and forth under surface waves for absorbing surge energy has been exploited by some different devices i e oyster 2010 and waveroller 2017 which are classified into oscillating wave surge converters owscs however the hydrodynamics of owsc devices still have not been fully understood due to many complex factors i e geometrical configuration wave shoaling wave nonlinearity optimization strategy of power take off pto system and so on therefore it is of practical importance to investigate the hydrodynamics of owsc devices numerically and experimentally although extensive works have been conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic behavior of owsc devices analytically or numerically to date such as renzi and dias 2012 2014 gunawardane et al 2019 gomes et al 2015 and tay and venugopal 2017 majority of owsc models are based on linear wave theory and neglect instantaneous variation of free wave surface and wetted body surface the capture efficiency of energy extraction is often over estimated based on the simple analytic and numerical solutions wang et al 2018 babarit 2013 some nonlinear numerical models are gradually developed due to the considerable complexity and nonlinear coupling effects incorporated into the hydrodynamics of owsc devices base on the navier stokes n s equation solver wei et al 2015 2016 simulated the flow features around an owsc device using the commercial software ansys fluent they found that the hinged flap with high rotational velocity enters and exits water and during this process a thin and long jet is generated along the flap surface schmitt and elsaesser 2015 and martínez ferrer et al 2018 implemented a nonlinear computational fluid dynamic cfd model using open foam to study the optimum fluid structure coupling for an owsc device brito et al 2017 2020 investigated the effects of mechanical constraints induced by pto system on the hydrodynamics of an owsc under regular waves using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method based on multi body solver mottahedi et al 2018 developed a 2 d fast fictitious domain method based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solvers and the volume of finite vof free water surface tracing scheme to simulate the extreme wave loads on an owsc however above viscous cfd models provide accurate solutions at a cost of expensive and complex mesh particle moving algorithms due to the motion of the owsc with large amplitude additionally the complex coupled interactions between the flap and power take off pto usually require additional mathematical formulations to simulate real time motion of pto system which may lead to that the prescribed mesh sizes and time steps are impracticable recently researchers have also proposed various potential flow models with nonlinear boundary conditions to analyze the owsc device based on domain decomposition method sun et al 2015 developed a boundary element model by coupling the splash jet along the body surface and the integral equation of the main water domain to investigate the hydrodynamic problem of an owsc device entering water with the constant speed along the same lines cheng et al 2019a b applied the higher order boundary element method hobem to simulate the hydrodynamic behavior of a hinged owsc device in free rotating motion and analyze its convergence later cheng et al 2019a b further analyzed nonlinear wave scattering by an owsc device to study the resonant performance of the owsc subjected simultaneously to wave and current loads all of these nonlinear potential models are concerned with the case of 2 d owsc configuration however in certain conditions the capture efficiency of the owsc is more directly related to the 3 d flow field due to large deformation of free surface and instantaneous motion of the flap therefore it could be numerically more accurate and physically realistic to simulate the hydrodynamic problems as being for a 3 d owsc configuration this brings illumination to the study in this paper the 3 d nonlinear wave interaction with floating marine structures is usually divided into three categories based on the incompressible velocity potential theory the first one is based on higher order perturbation procedure together with some series expansions it starts with the solution for various order integral equations in which the instantaneous free surface and body surface conditions are approximately satisfied on their mean position using taylor series expression from the solution the first order and second order scattering potentials are obtained which will intersect with the pressure distribution on the body surface and therefore the wave loads will be nonlinearly considered the typical work based the higher order perturbation procedure includes those by isaascson and cheung 1991 for wave run up along the body surface kim and kim 1997 for multi degree of freedom coupled motions of floating structures and yang et al 2012 for the dynamic interaction between floating structures and their mooring system however wave elevation and wave loads are respectively calculated on the calm water surface and mean body surface without considering variation of spatial position and its normal derivatives as time progresses which means that such approaches are valid only when both incident wave amplitude and the structural motion amplitude are smaller compared with the characteristic wave length and structure dimension the second approach for this problem is to focus on the nonlinear hydrodynamic problems generated by the large amplitude motion while the incident wave amplitude is small thus the body boundary condition is exactly imposed on the instantaneous wetted surface of the moving structure and the water surface condition is linearized the proponents of this method are lin and yue 1991 sen 2002 and qiu and peng 2008 however this body nonlinear theory is not effective for large amplitude waves which may induce large deformation of water surface both the first and second methods would lead to some unexpected inaccuracy and instability during directly calculating the time derivative of the scattering potential beyond above applicable conditions the third approach based on fully nonlinear theory should be adopt this approach requires the boundary condition to be imposed on the time varying free surface and body surface the major difficulty is to the complicate regeneration of meshes on the water surface and the intersection lines between the free and solid surfaces with the accumulation of past study experiences and the amelioration of computer power some dynamic mesh techniques i e spring pulling method zhou et al 2015 the transformation between space fixed and body fixed coordinates bai and taylor 2009 eulerian updated method and mixed eulerian lagrangian method sun et al 2019 cheng et al 2017 are recently proposed to develop fully nonlinear approach this fully nonlinear approach has been applied in many marine structures however to the author s knowledge less works has been conducted on the hydrodynamic problems of a 3 d owsc device in cases of typically both large motion and wave amplitudes by means of the third approach which is different from the aforementioned two approaches to this end hydrodynamic performances of a 3 d fully submerged owsc device called waveroller are investigated using the proposed fully nonlinear higher order boundary element method hobem for the analysis the coupled numerical model of pto location and flap motion developed the same authors cheng et al 2019 for a 2 d waveroller is extended to involve more complicated 3 d structure i e multi cylindrical configuration in addition mathematical formulas are generalized to incorporate hostile environmental conditions which require mesh regridding and interpolation to be more flexible and be able to deal with arbitrary motion efficiently the primary objective of this paper is to provide new some insights into the influence of the geometric features pto parametric optimization wave nonlinearity and shoaling effect on the extracted energy of the owsc device this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the proposed nonlinear hobem model and the auxiliary function method of calculating fully nonlinear wave loads in section 3 the present results are verified against the published experimental and numerical solutions in section 4 the hydrodynamic behavior of the owsc device subjected various waves are investigated finally the corresponding conclusions are presented in section 5 2 mathematical model and numerical procedure 2 1 governing equation and boundary conditions the problem of nonlinear waves interaction with a 3 d multi cylindrical owsc device the structure having the dimensions of h b 2c is sketched in fig 2 in which the body hinged at the seabed is fully submerged in the calm water surface with water depth d two right hand cartesian coordinate systems i e space fixed oxyz and body fixed ox y z coordinates are chosen with origin points o 0 and o respectively at the water surface and the mass center the relationship between these two coordinate systems can be expressed as 1 x y z x c 0 y c 0 z c 0 c x y z where x c0 y c0 z c0 is the position of mass center in space fixed coordinate system m the transform matrix defined as 2 m cos γ 0 sin γ 0 1 0 sin γ 0 cos γ the hinged distance from the seabed is l 2 while the distance from the top of body to the calm water surface is l 1 under the excitation of waves the owsc device will rotate forth and back about the horizontal hinged axis which is orthogonal with incident wave direction and its angle displacement is denoted by γ which is zero when the body is located at vertical direction the rotating motion of the multi cylindrical flap is then converted into electrical energy by driving a pto system which has an initial angle θ with the seabed and is coupled with the body motion at each time step in this paper the gravitational acceleration g seawater density ρ and the device height h are used for non dimensionalize and thus the length scale the time t the force f the velocity potential the pto stiffness coefficient c pto and the pto damping coefficient b pto are based on h h g f ρgh 3 g h 3 ρgh 4 and ρgh 4 h g based on the assumption that the fluid flow is incompressible irrotational and inviscid a velocity potential φ x y z t can be introduced and satisfies following governing equation 3 2 φ 0 in computational domain ω the fully nonlinear kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions are imposed on free water surface sf which is truncated at a sufficiently large distance by the vertical boundary surface s in order to absorb the scattering waves due to body motion and existence a numerical damping layer with coefficient υ r is added to the truncated boundary and then the free surface condition can be given in the

development of scattering velocity potential a ramp function r m t is imposed on the incident wave 8 r m t 1 2 1 cos π t t m t t m 1 t t m where t m is ramp time and kept constant as 2t in this paper according to the numerical stability as the above boundary value problem is simulated in the time domain the initial water surface conditions should be considered and the incident wave conditions are required as follows 9 φ t 0 φ i η t 0 η i 2 2 higher order boundary element method hobem green s second approach is used to convert the governing equation for velocity potential into the following water integral equation with corresponding boundary conditions 10 χ p s φ p s s g p s q f φ q f n φ q f g p s q f n d s where s denotes domain boundary including s f s b s d and s χ is solid angle

the remaining boundaries are divided into a series of eight node quadratic isoparametric elements this means that within each element all physical variables including coordinates potential and its

discretized equation is found the fluid moment can be obtained from the integration of the local moment created by the pressure over the body surface 14 m s b φ t 1 2 φ 2 x n z z n x d s s b z h x n z z n x d s m z c sin γ where m is the body mass and z c is z directional coordinate of gravity center at initial time it is noted that the velocity potential φ has been obtained at each time step numerically while the time derivative of the velocity potential φ t is still not clearly known an effective approach to resolve this is to treat φ t as another unknown function which satisfies the laplace equation in computational domain and the following body conditions 15 φ t n γ x n z z n x γ x φ z z φ x on s b where γ denotes the acceleration of body motion and in turn depends on the fluid

time the wave elevation and the potential on the free surface are prescribed based on the incident wave conditions together with the initial value of γ and γ the solution of eq 22 then obtains γ from which γ and γ can be updated though the fourth order runge kutta method meanwhile eq 4 is solved to trace node position of free surface the calculation then moves to the next time and it continues until the desired time step 2 4 extracted wave energy in this study the capture efficiency of the owsc device is obtained by using the relation between the generated power and the power of the corresponding incident waves the average generated power e p i e extracted from the waves by the owsc during a wave period can be written as the time average of the product of the motion 24 e p 1 m t

extracted power to the wave power 26 r e p e w when the hydrodynamic efficiency of an owsc due to waves is analyzed the acting loads of the pto system acting on the body must be evaluated at the same time if the flap moves the pto system connected with the flap also moves thus the mechanical loads including elastic load and damping load surrounding the flap changes in order to satisfy the motion condition on the other hand if the mechanical loads changes the motion of the flap is affected this kind of mutual relationship is referred to as a body pto interaction in order to assess accurately hydrodynamic efficiency of the owsc device the investigation of coupled effect between pto and flap is thus necessary in this paper the length l from the hinge x o y o to connection point x p y p of the flap and the piston can be written as 27 l x p x o 2 y p y o 2 z p z o 2 and the length r from the point x p y p to the contact point x r y r of the piston and the seabed is 28 r x p x r 2 y p y r 2 z p z r 2 here r varies with the flap motion and y direction coordinates y p y r y 0 according to the owsc configuration then the mechanical moment m p in eq 20 generated by pto can be given 29 m p f p t l p t b p t o s c p t o s l n τ p where f p is the mechanical force on the flap and l p is the corresponding moment arm τ p x p x r r z p z r r is unit tangential vector along the piston surface s s and s are the displacement velocity and acceleration of pto system and can be given as 30 s l γ n τ p s l ω n τ p substituting eq 21 23 into 20 the final motion equation can be obtained 31 i a γ b

paper is fully submerged this means that no special treatment is required for elements on the body surface in the mel form of the water surface condition the mesh nodes move both horizontally and vertically with the corresponding water particles as time continues the elements would gradually become distorted and the mesh quality further becomes poor become some nodes may cluster or scatter which leads to divergency of numerical solution in this paper a spring analogy method proposed by batina 1990 is applied to regenerate the mesh and the total force of arbitrary node i can be described as follows 32 f i j 1 n i k i j δ j δ i where n i denote the total number of adjacent node δ j and δ i is the displacement vector of node i thus the nodal displacement can be solved by using jacobi iterative form i e 33 δ i j 1 n i k i j δ j j 1 n i k i j then space coordinates x i of node i can be updated 34 x i t δ t x i t δ i where superscript t denotes time t and δt is the length of each time step based on the space coordinates of new mesh nodes obtained by above mesh regeneration the velocity potential and wave elevation on the free surface can be calculated by interpolation to find which old element the new node belongs to the following criterion is used 35 a 0 i 1 m 1 a i 0 0 wherea 0 denotes the area of old elements and a i denotes the area of a triangular sub element consisting of two vertices of the old element and the obtained new node and m 1 the number of triangular sub elements surrounding node i if eq 18 is satisfied the node should lie inside this element and then coordinates of new node can be obtained by using the quadratic shape function within old element 36 x i k 1 8 h k ξ η x k 0 3 convergence and model validation 3 1 convergent tests in order to examine the numerical stability and accuracy in this paper the convergent tests are firstly conducted for an owsc device with multi cylindrical configuration in which the cylinder diameter 2c the device mass m the device width b the device height h the water depth d the distance l 1 from the structural top to the mean water surface the rotational inertia i about the hinge point and the vertical position z c of mass center are 0 088 m 4 27 kg 0 67 m 0 22 m 0 308 m 0 066 m 0 115 kgm2 and 0 13 m respectively after non dimensionalize the values of 2c m b h d l 1 i and z c are 0 4 0 133 3 06 1 1 4 0 3 0 048 and 0 59 respectively mechanical coefficients of the pto system with initial inclined angle θ 20 are set as b pto 0 0775 and c pto 0 045 in the numerical discussion i e section 4 the geometric and mechanical parameters of the owsc device remain constant unless otherwise specified the corresponding computational domain is sufficiently large in a 3d open water i e the cylindrical radius r d 8b on the wetted body surface each cylindrical body is divided into 10 segments along the circumferential direction and 20 segments are used in the width direction of the owsc device on the free surface three different mesh schemes are used i e finer elements 30 segments per wave length intermediate elements 20 segments per wave length and coarse elements 10 segments per wave length along the radial direction and the ratio of radial length and arc length for each element is 1 0 fig 3 a and b gives the time series of angular displacement and velocity from above three different mesh schemes with time step dt t 60 for wave frequency ω 0 5 and wave height h i 0 3 it can be clearly seen that the curves converge rapidly with element length and the difference between the results obtained from finer and intermediate element is slight while the coarse mesh leads to some deviation furthermore the temporal convergent tests are performed with respect to three time steps i e dt t 100 dt t 60 and dt t 20 using intermediate elements which indicates that the hydrodynamic behaviors of the owsc are almost identical between dt t 100 and dt t 60 therefore the intermediate mesh scheme and dt t 60 are adopted in the following section 3 2 validation tests next the present fully nonlinear solutions are given to investigate the experimental example of an owsc device described by brito et al 2017 in a wave flume the configuration of the owsc device is a rectangular flap and detailed geometrical parameters have been listed in table 1 two different combinations of incident wave parameter t 2 0 s and h i 0 15 m t 3 5 s and h i 0 25 m are selected with static water depth d 0 85 m figs 4 and 5 gives the time series of the steady free surface elevation and the angular velocity respectively the comparisons among the experimental data brito et al 2017 the numerical results by a mesh free method smooth particle hydrodynamics sph brito et al 2017 and the present numerical solutions are also shown in the figures for ease of comparison with the published results the wave elevation and angular velocity multiplied respectively by h and h g are expressed in dimensional sense it can be seen that the sph solutions under predict the amplitude of wave elevation for short incident waves and vice versa for long incident waves which may be because values of some hydrodynamic coefficients i e compressible coefficient and viscous coefficient are usually set according experimental or numerical empiricism and can not exactly correspond to all incident waves near the amplitude region or nonlinear features the present model is better agreement with measured data than the sph model the mean errors of the present model and experimental results are 7 5 and 5 7 for wave elevation and angular velocity respectively overall an accurate hydrodynamic behavior of the owsc device is simulated by the present model in which the mutual dependence between fluid flow and structure motion is decoupled by some auxiliary functions as indicated in eqs 15 19 4 numerical results in this section the hydrodynamic performance of a waveroller with multi cylindrical configuration is discussed by comparing to that with single rectangular flap furthermore the influences of wave parameters i e wave amplitude and wave frequency geometrical parameters cylinder length cylinder diameter shoaling effect i e water depth and pto coefficients i e damping and stiffness coefficients on the capture efficiency of the waveroller are emphatically examined by using the developed numerical model 4 1 model configuration to compare the hydrodynamic behavior of the owsc device with multi cylindrical configuration to that with single rectangular flap numerical solutions were conducted with different wave frequencies and constant other parameters l 1 0 3 l 2 0 1 b 3 06 b pto 0 0775 and c pto 0 045 in addition the cylinder diameter is equal to the flap thickness 2c 0 4 fig 6 shows the motion amplitude γ 0 the average generated power e p and the capture efficiency r as functions of dimensionless wave frequency ω it can be seen that the motion response the average generated power and the capture efficiency remain almost the same for two configurations in the high frequency region ω 0 6 but those values for multi cylindrical configuration is apparently larger than those for single rectangular flap in the low frequency region ω 0 6 in addition the resonant frequency for multi cylindrical configuration is smaller than that for single rectangular flap the maximum points are around ω 0 4 and 0 5 respectively the reason is that the added inertia coefficient a z increases from 0 39 to 0 63 based on linear wave theory mei 2012 when the rectangular flap is modified as multi cylindrical configuration the approximated natural frequency formula for an owsc device is obtained as follows 37 ω n c p t o l 2 n τ p 2 c z i a z the natural frequency formula is linear and hence does not necessarily consider some nonlinear factors in the case of owsc device however the dependence of the natural frequency on the design parameters can be obviously seen in above equation to investigate the effect of the incident wave height on the hydrodynamic performance of above two types of owsc devices fig 7 shows the variation of the motion amplitude γ 0 the average generated power e p and the capture efficiency r with the incident wave height at the wave frequency of ω 0 5 it can be observed that the results for different configurations exhibit the similar trend but the corresponding values are larger for multi cylindrical configuration than those for single rectangular configuration in addition the difference between two configurations for both the motion amplitude and the average generated power increases with the increase of incident wave amplitude however the difference for capture efficiency is almost constant value about 0 01 over the whole range of tested wave amplitude this reason is that the motion amplitude and the average generated power are respectively growing proportional to h i and h i 2 whereas the capture efficiency is independent of incident wave height based on linear wave theory it is also interesting that both the motion amplitude and the average generated power for above two configurations increase with the increase of wave height but it is a completely opposite trend for the capture efficiency this example typically indicates that the wave nonlinearity affects obviously the hydrodynamic behavior of the owsc device and will be analyzed by following case by case basis 4 2 wave nonlinearity to further illustrate the effect of wave nonlinearity on the hydrodynamic behavior of the owsc device fig 8 a c gives the ratio of γ 0 and h i the ratio of e p and h i 2 and r against wave frequency ω for the incident wave heights h i 0 05 h i 0 2 and h i 0 35 the other parameters are kept the same as those in figs 6 and 7 it can be observed that the shapes of these curves indicated in fig 8 are similar i e the values for motion amplitude the average generated power and the capture efficiency increase with wave frequency to a maximum near resonant frequency and then monotonically decrease thereafter the difference is that the values begins to decrease at a larger wave frequency with increasing wave height which means that the real resonant frequency would be amplified by wave nonlinearity and diverge from linear solutions obtained from eq 37 what s more the capture efficiency is reduced with increasing wave height and maximum values for h i 0 05 h i 0 2 and h i 0 35 are 0 09 0 04 and 0 03 respectively an explanation to such a phenomenon is that the nonlinear behavior of waves interaction with floating body is featured by two different higher order components i e the bounded waves and the free waves in which the phases of higher order free waves are different from incident waves and thus free waves can mitigate motion responses of the owsc device as incident wave height increases the energy exchange between fundamental waves and higher order free waves is enhanced which leads to the reduction of capture efficiency therefore the linear wave theory generally over predicts the capacity of the owsc device subjected action of large amplitude waves this result is consistent with the 2 d work of cheng et al 2019a b to examine the effect of wave nonlinearity on the temporal variation of motion responses fig 9 a and b gives the time series of the rotating displacement and velocity of the fully submerged owsc device for three different incident wave heights h i 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 and constant other parameters l 1 0 3 l 2 0 1 b 3 06 ω 0 5 b pto 1 409 and c pto 0 818 overall with increasing incident wave height the asymmetry of the positive negative peak becomes more prominent and higher harmonic motion responses are found to be more noticeable in addition it indicates more distinct nonlinear influence on the dimensionless angular velocity which is likely due to the instantaneous variation of hydrodynamic moment on the owsc device during the rotating motion to verify this point fig 10 a and b gives the response spectrum of displacement and velocity fig 9 a shows that the highest harmonic energy for rotating displacement occurs at the second harmonic frequency while that for rotating velocity occurs at the third harmonic frequency the fundamental response increases as the wave height h i increases from 0 4 to 0 5 and decreases as h i increase from 0 5 to 0 6 the maximum fundamental values are at h i 0 4 among these three wave heights which because that the energy transfer from the first order mode to the higher order modes increases with increasing wave height this further means that the wave nonlinearity has a significant effect on the hydrodynamic behavior of owsc devices 4 3 geometrical parameters the thickness the height and the width of the flap are three important geometrical parameters affecting the hydrodynamic behavior and the construction cost of an owsc device the effects of the thickness the height and the width on the motion performance and wave energy extraction against wave loads are studied in this subsection as shown in fig 11 three thicknesses are tested in the numerical simulations the thickness can be described by the cylindrical shaped radius c where the smaller radius denotes that the flap is constructed by more cylinders in this set of simulations three radiuses of the cylinders c 0 3 0 2 and 0 15 correspond to the cylinder numbers of two three four respectively the incident wave height h i 0 05 is selected and other parameters are kept the same as those in fig 10 as c decreases the numerical results show an obvious left shift of the whole curves the peaks of γ 0 and e p increases with the decrease of c and it follows a completely opposite trend for the peak of r which are 0 44 0 41 and 0 39 for ω 0 8 0 6 and 0 5 respectively overall the peak of r is lower for a thinner flap and occurs at longer waves the variation of unequal peaks for motion response and energy extraction is because that the energy absorption capacity of the owsc device is related to both rotating velocity and pto damping although the motion response significantly increases with the decrease of the cylinder radius the pto damping is the optimal scheme for maximizing wave energy extraction over each wave frequency which will be rigorously analyzed in subsection 4 4 therefore the extent of variation of γ 0 is wider than that of e p since the non dimensional definition in this paper is based on the height of the flap the effects of the height of the flap on the hydrodynamic performance of the owsc device can be concluded by changing the relative distance l 1 from the top of the flap to the calm water surface but other parameters remaining constant fig 11 a c depicts the motion amplitude γ 0 the average generated power e p and the capture efficiency r as functions of both l 1andω it can be seen that the maximum value of the motion amplitude γ 0 decreases with the relative distance l 1 increases which is attributed to the horizontal velocity distribution of water particle along the water depth furthermore the rotating displacement decreases with increasing the relative distance in the low frequency region ω 0 5 this is because for long waves the owsc device can rotate in phase with wave motion thus the shallower owsc device can be more effectively coupled with incident waves however as shown in fig 12 b and c the maximum values of both the average generated power and the capture efficiency increase as the relative distance l 1 increases from 0 1 to 0 3 and decreases as l 1 from 0 3 to 0 7 the maximum capture efficiency is at l 1 0 3 among these four relative distance this is important for energy extraction because both the very strong or very weak interaction of the owsc device with incident waves corresponding to the small or large relative distance respectively lead to the lower energy extraction the highest energy extraction occurs at the middle relative distance when the pto damping is equal to the optimal damping 4 4 shoaling effect the harvesting energy of the owsc device is extracted from the surge motion of wave particles intuitively shallow ocean area increases the horizontal velocity of wave particles due to shoaling effect and thus contribute to increasing the fluid loads on the flap surface in this subsection a local reduction in the distance from the hinged point of the flap to the seabed is explored as an effective approach to enhance the energy extraction of the owsc device the effects of the distance between the hinged point to the seabed on the hydrodynamic performance against wave frequency is shown in fig 13 it can be seen that the energy efficiency decreases rapidly as the distance l 2 increases from 0 3 to 1 3 and then tends the stable value after that in addition the maximum response extracted energy and capture efficiency for different distance l 2 almost correspond to the same wave frequency in brief the distance l 2 has few effects on both the curve shape and the natural frequency in practical applications such as wave energy technologies although there may be 10 20 energy losses when waves propagate from deep water to shallow water whittaker and folley 2012 the owsc devices can achieve higher capture efficiency and realize wider applicable extent of wave frequency 4 5 optimal strategy the mechanical functions c pto and b pto are two important coefficients affecting the wave energy extraction of the owsc device in this subsection the effects of c pto and b pto on the hydrodynamic performance of an owsc device are examined with constant parameters h i 0 05 d 2 0 3 d 1 0 1 b 3 06 and θ 200 four different combinations of pto parameters c pto 0 b pto b opt c pto 0 0762 b pto b opt c pto 1 525 b pto b opt and c pto 2 288 b pto b opt are selected where b opt denotes an optimal pto damping which maximizes wave energy extraction e p at each wave frequency based on extremal theory e p b pto 0 we can obtain following relationship 38 b pto b opt i a z ω 2 n τ p n τ p n τ p 2 c z 2 ω 2 b z 2 fig 14 illustrates the effects of pto stiffness parameter c pto when pto damping is optimized for maximizing the average generated power the variations of the motion amplitude γ 0 the average generated power e p the capture efficiency r and the pto damping b pto are versus incident wave frequency ω it can be seen that the motion amplitude the average generated power and the capture efficiency decrease with the increase of pto stiffness in the low frequency zone ω 0 5 but follow a completely opposite trend in the high frequency zone ω 0 6 in general the extracted energy indicated in fig 14 b is a litter lower for a larger pto stiffness and occurs at a shorter wave due to the increase of whole stiffness in eq 37 however as shown in fig 14 c when the pto damping is optimized for e p the corresponding maximum capture efficiency slightly increases with the increase of pto stiffness this is because that the capture efficiency r is proportional to the average generated energy e p and is inversely proportional to the incident wave energy e w the incident wave energy e w is found to increase faster than the average generated energy e p as wave frequency ω increases and thus the maximum capture efficiency r may be reduced nevertheless the maximum values of capture efficiency r still remain at a high level it should be noted that the bandwidth of the efficiency maximum is broaden by the increase of pto stiffness c pto comparing fig 14 c with fig 14 d the corresponding maximum values of b opt occur at roughly the lower wave frequencies for each pto stiffness this reason is due to that the optimal pto damping b opt in fig 14 d is obtained from eq 38 where the inclined angle of the pto system respect to the negative direction of x axis is set as the initial angle θ 200 actually the angle θ changes in real time with the motion of the flap subjected to wave actions and is not a constant value which means that the instantaneous coupled interaction of the pto and the flap can affect the natural features of the owsc device the maximum efficiency is in principle reached by both two condition i e the owsc rotates at the resonant frequency and meanwhile the pto damping is set as the radiation damping fig 14 d shows that a larger optimal pto damping is desired for a larger pto stiffness when resonance occurs above studied cases for the optimization of pto parameters however are based on the ideal conditions of maximizing the average generated power over all tested wave frequencies which means that the characteristics of the generator system i e mechanical properties are regularly tuned to balance the incident wave spectrum this ideal scheme is hard to meet in realistic conditions a more practical optimization strategy proposed by lovas et al 2010 that only selects some effective pto damping at certain frequency region are adopted in following subsection fig 15 a gives the variation of the optimal pto damping with wave frequency for pto stiffness c pto 0 762 and other parameters remaining the same as those in fig 14 as indicated in fig 15 a the valley value and the arithmetic mean value of b opt i e b pto 1 06 and 3 83 are taken as the two discrete damping coefficients respectively the corresponding motion amplitude the average generated power and the capture efficiency for b opt b pto 1 06 and b pto 3 83 are depicted in fig 15 b c it can be seen from fig 15 b that a lager pto damping leads to a smaller motion response for example γ for b pto 1 06 is larger than that for b opt which is due to that b pto 1 06 is the lowest value radiation damping of b opt and γ for b pto 3 83 is larger than that for b opt only at frequency region ω 0 7 or ω 0 3 however this large motion response does not indicate that high energy extraction can be obtained by the owsc device as shown in fig 15 c and d both the average generated power and the capture efficiency for b pto 1 06 is close to those for b opt near the wave frequency region around the maximum value occurs and the average generated power and the capture efficiency for b pto 3 83 is identical to those for b opt over other wave frequency region two intersection points between the curves for b pto 1 06 and 3 83 occur at ω 0 4 and 0 7 for above particular optimization strategy the dimensionless mechanical damping b pto piecewise values are set as b pto 1 06 for 0 4 ω 0 7 and b pto 3 83 for ω 0 4 or ω 0 7 the average generated power and the capture efficiency are re plotted in fig 16 a and b the results indicate that it is possible to absorb energy close to maximum value with only selecting two pto damping coefficients actually the largest differences between the particular and ideal optimization strategy are only 0 05 and 0 09 according to the average generated power and the capture efficiency respectively although these differences can be further reduced by selecting more piecewise damping the two value optimization strategy has been validated to be accurate enough over whole wave frequency region in addition it is easier to conduct the scheme for fewer damping coefficients in other words with the two value pto damping scheme both the average generated power and the capture efficiency can be ensured to achieve the maximum for the fully submerged owsc devices 5 conclusions in the present work the hydrodynamic performance of a fully submerged multi cylindrical owsc device is numerically simulated based on nonlinear potential flow theory and the validated hobem a local change in the body shape proposed as an economical way to enhance favorable behavior is demonstrated to obviously increase wave energy extraction the effects of wave nonlinearity water depth and geometrical parameters including height thickness and width on the body motion the average generated energy and hydrodynamic efficiency are emphatically examined initially the ideal strategy of maximum energy extraction is targeted by selecting optimal pto damping at each wave frequency and is very difficult to implement in the practical wave environment therefore a more practical strategy to optimize the mechanical parameters of pto system is explored with the same objective through extensive simulations for the 3 d wave energy conversion the following conclusions can be drawn 1 both the motion response and the energy extraction of the multi cylindrical configuration is larger than those of single rectangular configuration in low frequency region but the hydrodynamic performance is not sensitive to the change of the configuration in high frequency region for this reason selecting multi cylindrical configuration as pendulum shape of the owsc device is preferable 2 different linear theoretical prediction 3 d nonlinear numerical solutions indicate that when an owsc device is subjected to the stokes wave at a given wave length a larger incident wave height will induce more higher harmonic free wave components which will then reduce the capture efficiency in addition the real resonant frequency increases with increasing wave height due to complex fluid structure interaction 3 as regards the effects of the flap thickness a larger cylindrical shaped radius leads to an increase in the extraction bandwidth for long waves albeit at the expense of a slightly lower peak value of the capture efficiency as for the flap width a wider flap can enhance the capture efficiency in long waves but the opposite trend occurs in the short waves meanwhile the corresponding peak value is independent of the flap width as intuitively expected a shallower submerged depth of the owsc device shows more intense motion as floating body however the energy extraction would not be further enhanced with increasing the flap height due to additional pto damping 4 an ideal adjusting scheme towards maximum energy extraction corresponds to select optimal pto damping at each wave frequency as pto stiffness increases the optimal pto damping increases in low frequency region and decreases in high frequency region which leads to higher resonant frequency in addition the peak values of the capture efficiency are almost identical among all pto stiffness however it is difficult to tune pto parameters over whole incident wave spectrum by conducting easier two value optimization strategy in practical application the desired energy extraction can be achieved which is as efficient as applying every ideal pto damping the present work considers the effects of 3 d nonlinear flow field in time domain as well as the instantaneous coupled interaction of pto system and body motion which gives many realistic guidelines for assisting in the parametric atlas analysis site selection structural design and commercial scale operation of the owsc devices the developed numerical model can be

21549,the intense surge motion the low installation costs and the less environmental threat promote the development of the nearshore wave energy technologies which are often classified as oscillating wave surge converters owscs this paper investigates the hydrodynamic performance of a multi cylindrical fully submerged owsc by developing a 3 d numerical model based on fully nonlinear potential flow theory and time domain higher order element method hobem a local change in the geometric configuration is verified as an effective approach to enhance wave energy extraction in long waves then it is found that a larger incident wave height not only reduces the peak value of the capture efficiency but it also leads to a change in the real resonant frequency the geometrical parameters have a significant influence on the energy extraction with the thicker wider and shallower device demonstrating both higher average generated power and capture efficiency in low frequency region meanwhile the maximum efficiency is mainly related to the optimal pto parameters a two value optimization strategy on pto damping is applied to industriously maximize the absorbed energy over whole wave

horizontal motions of water particles within ocean waves for deep water region fluid particles move in a circular motion trace to meet the motion conditions of waves so much of offshore wecs i e oscillating buoy type converters relies strongly on energy utilization from heave motion when incident waves propagate from offshore to nearshore as shown in fig 1 the wave seabed interaction i e shoaling effect elongates the circular motion into a horizontal elliptic shape which amplifies the horizontal movement of water particles in the near shore region creating an apparent surge zone thus a flap type converter oscillating back and forth under surface waves for absorbing surge energy has been exploited by some different devices i e oyster 2010 and waveroller 2017 which are classified into oscillating wave surge converters owscs however the hydrodynamics of owsc devices still have not been fully understood due to many complex factors i e geometrical configuration wave shoaling wave nonlinearity optimization strategy of power take off pto system and so on therefore it is of practical importance to investigate the hydrodynamics of owsc devices numerically and experimentally although extensive works have been conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic behavior of owsc devices analytically or numerically to date such as renzi and dias 2012 2014 gunawardane et al 2019 gomes et al 2015 and tay and venugopal 2017 majority of owsc models are based on linear wave theory and neglect instantaneous variation of free wave surface and wetted body surface the capture efficiency of energy extraction is often over estimated based on the simple analytic and numerical solutions wang et al 2018 babarit 2013 some nonlinear numerical models are gradually developed due to the considerable complexity and nonlinear coupling effects incorporated into the hydrodynamics of owsc devices base on the navier stokes n s equation solver wei et al 2015 2016 simulated the flow features around an owsc device using the commercial software ansys fluent they found that the hinged flap with high rotational velocity enters and exits water and during this process a thin and long jet is generated along the flap surface schmitt and elsaesser 2015 and martínez ferrer et al 2018 implemented a nonlinear computational fluid dynamic cfd model using open foam to study the optimum fluid structure coupling for an owsc device brito et al 2017 2020 investigated the effects of mechanical constraints induced by pto system on the hydrodynamics of an owsc under regular waves using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method based on multi body solver mottahedi et al 2018 developed a 2 d fast fictitious domain method based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solvers and the volume of finite vof free water surface tracing scheme to simulate the extreme wave loads on an owsc however above viscous cfd models provide accurate solutions at a cost of expensive and complex mesh particle moving algorithms due to the motion of the owsc with large amplitude additionally the complex coupled interactions between the flap and power take off pto usually require additional mathematical formulations to simulate real time motion of pto system which may lead to that the prescribed mesh sizes and time steps are impracticable recently researchers have also proposed various potential flow models with nonlinear boundary conditions to analyze the owsc device based on domain decomposition method sun et al 2015 developed a boundary element model by coupling the splash jet along the body surface and the integral equation of the main water domain to investigate the hydrodynamic problem of an owsc device entering water with the constant speed along the same lines cheng et al 2019a b applied the higher order boundary element method hobem to simulate the hydrodynamic behavior of a hinged owsc device in free rotating motion and analyze its convergence later cheng et al 2019a b further analyzed nonlinear wave scattering by an owsc device to study the resonant performance of the owsc subjected simultaneously to wave and current loads all of these nonlinear potential models are concerned with the case of 2 d owsc configuration however in certain conditions the capture efficiency of the owsc is more directly related to the 3 d flow field due to large deformation of free surface and instantaneous motion of the flap therefore it could be numerically more accurate and physically realistic to simulate the hydrodynamic problems as being for a 3 d owsc configuration this brings illumination to the study in this paper the 3 d nonlinear wave interaction with floating marine structures is usually divided into three categories based on the incompressible velocity potential theory the first one is based on higher order perturbation procedure together with some series expansions it starts with the solution for various order integral equations in which the instantaneous free surface and body surface conditions are approximately satisfied on their mean position using taylor series expression from the solution the first order and second order scattering potentials are obtained which will intersect with the pressure distribution on the body surface and therefore the wave loads will be nonlinearly considered the typical work based the higher order perturbation procedure includes those by isaascson and cheung 1991 for wave run up along the body surface kim and kim 1997 for multi degree of freedom coupled motions of floating structures and yang et al 2012 for the dynamic interaction between floating structures and their mooring system however wave elevation and wave loads are respectively calculated on the calm water surface and mean body surface without considering variation of spatial position and its normal derivatives as time progresses which means that such approaches are valid only when both incident wave amplitude and the structural motion amplitude are smaller compared with the characteristic wave length and structure dimension the second approach for this problem is to focus on the nonlinear hydrodynamic problems generated by the large amplitude motion while the incident wave amplitude is small thus the body boundary condition is exactly imposed on the instantaneous wetted surface of the moving structure and the water surface condition is linearized the proponents of this method are lin and yue 1991 sen 2002 and qiu and peng 2008 however this body nonlinear theory is not effective for large amplitude waves which may induce large deformation of water surface both the first and second methods would lead to some unexpected inaccuracy and instability during directly calculating the time derivative of the scattering potential beyond above applicable conditions the third approach based on fully nonlinear theory should be adopt this approach requires the boundary condition to be imposed on the time varying free surface and body surface the major difficulty is to the complicate regeneration of meshes on the water surface and the intersection lines between the free and solid surfaces with the accumulation of past study experiences and the amelioration of computer power some dynamic mesh techniques i e spring pulling method zhou et al 2015 the transformation between space fixed and body fixed coordinates bai and taylor 2009 eulerian updated method and mixed eulerian lagrangian method sun et al 2019 cheng et al 2017 are recently proposed to develop fully nonlinear approach this fully nonlinear approach has been applied in many marine structures however to the author s knowledge less works has been conducted on the hydrodynamic problems of a 3 d owsc device in cases of typically both large motion and wave amplitudes by means of the third approach which is different from the aforementioned two approaches to this end hydrodynamic performances of a 3 d fully submerged owsc device called waveroller are investigated using the proposed fully nonlinear higher order boundary element method hobem for the analysis the coupled numerical model of pto location and flap motion developed the same authors cheng et al 2019 for a 2 d waveroller is extended to involve more complicated 3 d structure i e multi cylindrical configuration in addition mathematical formulas are generalized to incorporate hostile environmental conditions which require mesh regridding and interpolation to be more flexible and be able to deal with arbitrary motion efficiently the primary objective of this paper is to provide new some insights into the influence of the geometric features pto parametric optimization wave nonlinearity and shoaling effect on the extracted energy of the owsc device this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the proposed nonlinear hobem model and the auxiliary function method of calculating fully nonlinear wave loads in section 3 the present results are verified against the published experimental and numerical solutions in section 4 the hydrodynamic behavior of the owsc device subjected various waves are investigated finally the corresponding conclusions are presented in section 5 2 mathematical model and numerical procedure 2 1 governing equation and boundary conditions the problem of nonlinear waves interaction with a 3 d multi cylindrical owsc device the structure having the dimensions of h b 2c is sketched in fig 2 in which the body hinged at the seabed is fully submerged in the calm water surface with water depth d two right hand cartesian coordinate systems i e space fixed oxyz and body fixed ox y z coordinates are chosen with origin points o 0 and o respectively at the water surface and the mass center the relationship between these two coordinate systems can be expressed as 1 x y z x c 0 y c 0 z c 0 c x y z where x c0 y c0 z c0 is the position of mass center in space fixed coordinate system m the transform matrix defined as 2 m cos γ 0 sin γ 0 1 0 sin γ 0 cos γ the hinged distance from the seabed is l 2 while the distance from the top of body to the calm water surface is l 1 under the excitation of waves the owsc device will rotate forth and back about the horizontal hinged axis which is orthogonal with incident wave direction and its angle displacement is denoted by γ which is zero when the body is located at vertical direction the rotating motion of the multi cylindrical flap is then converted into electrical energy by driving a pto system which has an initial angle θ with the seabed and is coupled with the body motion at each time step in this paper the gravitational acceleration g seawater density ρ and the device height h are used for non dimensionalize and thus the length scale the time t the force f the velocity potential the pto stiffness coefficient c pto and the pto damping coefficient b pto are based on h h g f ρgh 3 g h 3 ρgh 4 and ρgh 4 h g based on the assumption that the fluid flow is incompressible irrotational and inviscid a velocity potential φ x y z t can be introduced and satisfies following governing equation 3 2 φ 0 in computational domain ω the fully nonlinear kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions are imposed on free water surface sf which is truncated at a sufficiently large distance by the vertical boundary surface s in order to absorb the scattering waves due to body motion and existence a numerical damping layer with coefficient υ r is added to the truncated boundary and then the free surface condition can be given in the mixed eulerian lagrangian mel form sun et al 2019 4 d x y η d t φ ν r x y η x 0 y 0 z 0 d φ d t η 1 2 φ 2 ν r φ φ i o n s f where d dt denotes the material derivative defined as d d t t φ η and φi are

out of the fluid domain the seabed surface is assumed to be flat and impermeable which results into 7 φ n 0 on sd with the purpose of avoiding a sudden start of flap motion and allowing a steady development of scattering velocity potential a ramp function r m t is imposed on the incident wave 8 r m t 1 2 1 cos π t t m t t m 1 t t m where t m is ramp time and kept constant as 2t in this paper according to the numerical stability as the above boundary value problem is simulated in the time domain the initial water surface conditions should be considered and the incident wave conditions are required as follows 9 φ t 0 φ i η t 0 η i 2 2 higher order boundary element method hobem green s second approach is used to convert the governing equation for velocity potential into the following

the remaining boundaries are divided into a series of eight node quadratic isoparametric elements this means that within each element all physical variables including coordinates potential and its

discretized equation is found the fluid moment can be obtained from the integration of the local moment created by the pressure over the body surface 14 m s b φ t 1 2 φ 2 x n z z n x d s s b z h x n z z n x d s m z c sin γ where m is the body mass and z c is z directional coordinate of gravity center at initial time it is noted that the velocity potential φ has been obtained at each time step numerically while the time derivative of the velocity potential φ t is still not clearly known an effective approach to resolve this is to treat φ t as another unknown function which satisfies the laplace equation in computational domain and the following body conditions 15 φ t n γ x n z z n x γ x φ z z φ x on s b where γ denotes the acceleration of body motion and in turn depends on the fluid moment to decouple this nonlinear mutual dependence of the body acceleration and fluid loads two auxiliary functions are adopted as follows 16 φ t γ ψ 1 ψ 2 and they satisfy following boundary

similar to the numerical procedure of solving potential and then the fluid moment is submitted into following motion equation 20 i γ b pto γ c pto γ m where i is rotational inertia if we define 21 a s

time the wave elevation and the potential on the free surface are prescribed based on the incident wave conditions together with the initial value of γ and γ the solution of eq 22 then obtains γ from which γ and γ can be updated though the fourth order runge kutta method meanwhile eq 4 is solved to trace node position of free surface the calculation then moves to the next time and it continues until the desired time step 2 4 extracted wave energy in this study the capture efficiency of the owsc device is obtained by using the relation between the generated power and the power of the corresponding incident waves the average generated power e p i e extracted from the waves by the owsc during a wave period can be written as the time average of the product of the motion 24 e p 1 m t t t m t m γ d t b pto m t t t m t γ 2 d t where m is the integer and m 1 let the incident potential be denoted by φ i and the incident wave elevation by η i the average incident wave power over a period at x 0 can be obtained mei 1983 25 e w λ t 2 0 t b 2 b 2 l η i 0 t φ i x φ i x d z d y d t where wave length λ ct therefore the capture efficiency can be determined as the ratio of the extracted power to the wave power 26 r e p e w when the hydrodynamic efficiency of an owsc due to waves is analyzed the acting loads of the pto system acting on the body must be evaluated at the same time if the flap moves the pto system connected with the flap also moves thus the mechanical loads including elastic load and damping load surrounding the flap changes in order to satisfy the motion condition on the other hand if the mechanical loads changes the motion of the flap is affected this kind of mutual relationship is referred to as a body pto interaction in order to assess accurately hydrodynamic efficiency of the owsc device the investigation of coupled effect between pto and flap is thus necessary in this paper the length l from the hinge x o y o to connection point x p y p of the flap and the piston can be written as 27 l x p x o 2 y p y o 2 z p z o 2 and the length r from the point x p y p to the contact point x r y r of the piston and the seabed is 28 r x p x r 2 y p y r 2 z p z r 2 here r varies with the flap motion and y direction coordinates y p y r y 0 according to the owsc configuration then the mechanical moment m p in eq 20 generated by pto can be given 29 m p f p t l p t b p t o s c p t o s l n τ p where f p is the mechanical force on the flap and l p is the corresponding moment arm τ p x p x r r z p z r r is unit tangential vector along the piston surface s s and s are the displacement velocity and acceleration of pto system and can be given as 30 s l γ n τ p s l ω n τ p substituting eq 21 23 into 20 the final motion equation can be obtained 31 i a γ b p t o l 2 n τ p 2 γ c p t o l 2 n τ p 2 γ m 2 5 other numerical techniques during the process of mesh regridding the element size is fixed on the wetted body surface because the owsc device in this paper is fully submerged this means that no special treatment is required for elements on the body surface in the mel form of the water surface condition the mesh nodes move both horizontally and vertically with the corresponding water particles as time continues the elements would gradually become distorted and the mesh quality further becomes poor become some nodes may cluster or scatter which leads to divergency of numerical solution in this paper a spring analogy method proposed by batina 1990 is applied to regenerate the mesh and the total force of arbitrary node i can be described as follows 32 f i j 1 n i k i j δ j δ i where n i denote the total number of adjacent node δ j and δ i is the displacement vector of node i thus the nodal displacement can be solved by using jacobi iterative form i e 33 δ i j 1 n i k i j δ j j 1 n i k i j then space coordinates x i of node i can be updated 34 x i t δ t x i t δ i where superscript t denotes time t and δt is the length of each time step based on the space coordinates of new mesh nodes obtained by above mesh regeneration the velocity potential and wave elevation on the free surface can be calculated by interpolation to find which old element the new node belongs to the following criterion is used 35 a 0 i 1 m 1 a i 0 0 wherea 0 denotes the area of old elements and a i denotes the area of a triangular sub element consisting of two vertices of the old element and the obtained new node and m 1 the number of triangular sub elements surrounding node i if eq 18 is satisfied the node should lie inside this element and then coordinates of new node can be obtained by using the quadratic shape function within old element 36 x i k 1 8 h k ξ η x k 0 3 convergence and model validation 3 1 convergent tests in order to examine the numerical stability and accuracy in this paper the convergent tests are firstly conducted for an owsc device with multi cylindrical configuration in which the cylinder diameter 2c the device mass m the device width b the device height h the water depth d the distance l 1 from the structural top to the mean water surface the rotational inertia i about the hinge point and the vertical position z c of mass center are 0 088 m 4 27 kg 0 67 m 0 22 m 0 308 m 0 066 m 0 115 kgm2 and 0 13 m respectively after non dimensionalize the values of 2c m b h d l 1 i and z c are 0 4 0 133 3 06 1 1 4 0 3 0 048 and 0 59 respectively mechanical coefficients of the pto system with initial inclined angle θ 20 are set as b pto 0 0775 and c pto 0 045 in the numerical discussion i e section 4 the geometric and mechanical parameters of the owsc device remain constant unless otherwise specified the corresponding computational domain is sufficiently large in a 3d open water i e the cylindrical radius r d 8b on the wetted body surface each cylindrical body is divided into 10 segments along the circumferential direction and 20 segments are used in the width direction of the owsc device on the free surface three different mesh schemes are used i e finer elements 30 segments per wave length intermediate elements 20 segments per wave length and coarse elements 10 segments per wave length along the radial direction and the ratio of radial length and arc length for each element is 1 0 fig 3 a and b gives the time series of angular displacement and velocity from above three different mesh schemes with time step dt t 60 for wave frequency ω 0 5 and wave height h i 0 3 it can be clearly seen that the curves converge rapidly with element length and the difference between the results obtained from finer and intermediate element is slight while the coarse mesh leads to some deviation furthermore the temporal convergent tests are performed with respect to three time steps i e dt t 100 dt t 60 and dt t 20 using intermediate elements which indicates that the hydrodynamic behaviors of the owsc are almost identical between dt t 100 and dt t 60 therefore the intermediate mesh scheme and dt t 60 are adopted in the following section 3 2 validation tests next the present fully nonlinear solutions are given to investigate the experimental example of an owsc device described by brito et al 2017 in a wave flume the configuration of the owsc device is a rectangular flap and detailed geometrical parameters have been listed in table 1 two different combinations of incident wave parameter t 2 0 s and h i 0 15 m t 3 5 s and h i 0 25 m are selected with static water depth d 0 85 m figs 4 and 5 gives the time series of the steady free surface elevation and the angular velocity respectively the comparisons among the experimental data brito et al 2017 the numerical results by a mesh free method smooth particle hydrodynamics sph brito et al 2017 and the present numerical solutions are also shown in the figures for ease of comparison with the published results the wave elevation and angular velocity multiplied respectively by h and h g are expressed in dimensional sense it can be seen that the sph solutions under predict the amplitude of wave elevation for short incident waves and vice versa for long incident waves which may be because values of some hydrodynamic coefficients i e compressible coefficient and viscous coefficient are usually set according experimental or numerical empiricism and can not exactly correspond to all incident waves near the amplitude region or nonlinear features the present model is better agreement with measured data than the sph model the mean errors of the present model and experimental results are 7 5 and 5 7 for wave elevation and angular velocity respectively overall an accurate hydrodynamic behavior of the owsc device is simulated by the present model in which the mutual dependence between fluid flow and structure motion is decoupled by some auxiliary functions as indicated in eqs 15 19 4 numerical results in this section the hydrodynamic performance of a waveroller with multi cylindrical configuration is discussed by comparing to that with single rectangular flap furthermore the influences of wave parameters i e wave amplitude and wave frequency geometrical parameters cylinder length cylinder diameter shoaling effect i e water depth and pto coefficients i e damping and stiffness coefficients on the capture efficiency of the waveroller are emphatically examined by using the developed numerical model 4 1 model configuration to compare the hydrodynamic behavior of the owsc device with multi cylindrical configuration to that with single rectangular flap numerical solutions were conducted with different wave frequencies and constant other parameters l 1 0 3 l 2 0 1 b 3 06 b pto 0 0775 and c pto 0 045 in addition the cylinder diameter is equal to the flap thickness 2c 0 4 fig 6 shows the motion amplitude γ 0 the average generated power e p and the capture efficiency r as functions of dimensionless wave frequency ω it can be seen that the motion response the average generated power and the capture efficiency remain almost the same for two configurations in the high frequency region ω 0 6 but those values for multi cylindrical configuration is apparently larger than those for single rectangular flap in the low frequency region ω 0 6 in addition the resonant frequency for multi cylindrical configuration is smaller than that for single rectangular flap the maximum points are around ω 0 4 and 0 5 respectively the reason is that the added inertia coefficient a z increases from 0 39 to 0 63 based on linear wave theory mei 2012 when the rectangular flap is modified as multi cylindrical configuration the approximated natural frequency formula for an owsc device is obtained as follows 37 ω n c p t o l 2 n τ p 2 c z i a z the natural frequency formula is linear and hence does not necessarily consider some nonlinear factors in the case of owsc device however the dependence of the natural frequency on the design parameters can be obviously seen in above equation to investigate the effect of the incident wave height on the hydrodynamic performance of above two types of owsc devices fig 7 shows the variation of the motion amplitude γ 0 the average generated power e p and the capture efficiency r with the incident wave height at the wave frequency of ω 0 5 it can be observed that the results for different configurations exhibit the similar trend but the corresponding values are larger for multi cylindrical configuration than those for single rectangular configuration in addition the difference between two configurations for both the motion amplitude and the average generated power increases with the increase of incident wave amplitude however the difference for capture efficiency is almost constant value about 0 01 over the whole range of tested wave amplitude this reason is that the motion amplitude and the average generated power are respectively growing proportional to h i and h i 2 whereas the capture efficiency is independent of incident wave height based on linear wave theory it is also interesting that both the motion amplitude and the average generated power for above two configurations increase with the increase of wave height but it is a completely opposite trend for the capture efficiency this example typically indicates that the wave nonlinearity affects obviously the hydrodynamic behavior of the owsc device and will be analyzed by following case by case basis 4 2 wave nonlinearity to further illustrate the effect of wave nonlinearity on the hydrodynamic behavior of the owsc device fig 8 a c gives the ratio of γ 0 and h i the ratio of e p and h i 2 and r against wave frequency ω for the incident wave heights h i 0 05 h i 0 2 and h i 0 35 the other parameters are kept the same as those in figs 6 and 7 it can be observed that the shapes of these curves indicated in fig 8 are similar i e the values for motion amplitude the average generated power and the capture efficiency increase with wave frequency to a maximum near resonant frequency and then monotonically decrease thereafter the difference is that the values begins to decrease at a larger wave frequency with increasing wave height which means that the real resonant frequency would be amplified by wave nonlinearity and diverge from linear solutions obtained from eq 37 what s more the capture efficiency is reduced with increasing wave height and maximum values for h i 0 05 h i 0 2 and h i 0 35 are 0 09 0 04 and 0 03 respectively an explanation to such a phenomenon is that the nonlinear behavior of waves interaction with floating body is featured by two different higher order components i e the bounded waves and the free waves in which the phases of higher order free waves are different from incident waves and thus free waves can mitigate motion responses of the owsc device as incident wave height increases the energy exchange between fundamental waves and higher order free waves is enhanced which leads to the reduction of capture efficiency therefore the linear wave theory generally over predicts the capacity of the owsc device subjected action of large amplitude waves this result is consistent with the 2 d work of cheng et al 2019a b to examine the effect of wave nonlinearity on the temporal variation of motion responses fig 9 a and b gives the time series of the rotating displacement and velocity of the fully submerged owsc device for three different incident wave heights h i 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 and constant other parameters l 1 0 3 l 2 0 1 b 3 06 ω 0 5 b pto 1 409 and c pto 0 818 overall with increasing incident wave height the asymmetry of the positive negative peak becomes more prominent and higher harmonic motion responses are found to be more noticeable in addition it indicates more distinct nonlinear influence on the dimensionless angular velocity which is likely due to the instantaneous variation of hydrodynamic moment on the owsc device during the rotating motion to verify this point fig 10 a and b gives the response spectrum of displacement and velocity fig 9 a shows that the highest harmonic energy for rotating displacement occurs at the second harmonic frequency while that for rotating velocity occurs at the third harmonic frequency the fundamental response increases as the wave height h i increases from 0 4 to 0 5 and decreases as h i increase from 0 5 to 0 6 the maximum fundamental values are at h i 0 4 among these three wave heights which because that the energy transfer from the first order mode to the higher order modes increases with increasing wave height this further means that the wave nonlinearity has a significant effect on the hydrodynamic behavior of owsc devices 4 3 geometrical parameters the thickness the height and the width of the flap are three important geometrical parameters affecting the hydrodynamic behavior and the construction cost of an owsc device the effects of the thickness the height and the width on the motion performance and wave energy extraction against wave loads are studied in this subsection as shown in fig 11 three thicknesses are tested in the numerical simulations the thickness can be described by the cylindrical shaped radius c where the smaller radius denotes that the flap is constructed by more cylinders in this set of simulations three radiuses of the cylinders c 0 3 0 2 and 0 15 correspond to the cylinder numbers of two three four respectively the incident wave height h i 0 05 is selected and other parameters are kept the same as those in fig 10 as c decreases the numerical results show an obvious left shift of the whole curves the peaks of γ 0 and e p increases with the decrease of c and it follows a completely opposite trend for the peak of r which are 0 44 0 41 and 0 39 for ω 0 8 0 6 and 0 5 respectively overall the peak of r is lower for a thinner flap and occurs at longer waves the variation of unequal peaks for motion response and energy extraction is because that the energy absorption capacity of the owsc device is related to both rotating velocity and pto damping although the motion response significantly increases with the decrease of the cylinder radius the pto damping is the optimal scheme for maximizing wave energy extraction over each wave frequency which will be rigorously analyzed in subsection 4 4 therefore the extent of variation of γ 0 is wider than that of e p since the non dimensional definition in this paper is based on the height of the flap the effects of the height of the flap on the hydrodynamic performance of the owsc device can be concluded by changing the relative distance l 1 from the top of the flap to the calm water surface but other parameters remaining constant fig 11 a c depicts the motion amplitude γ 0 the average generated power e p and the capture efficiency r as functions of both l 1andω it can be seen that the maximum value of the motion amplitude γ 0 decreases with the relative distance l 1 increases which is attributed to the horizontal velocity distribution of water particle along the water depth furthermore the rotating displacement decreases with increasing the relative distance in the low frequency region ω 0 5 this is because for long waves the owsc device can rotate in phase with wave motion thus the shallower owsc device can be more effectively coupled with incident waves however as shown in fig 12 b and c the maximum values of both the average generated power and the capture efficiency increase as the relative distance l 1 increases from 0 1 to 0 3 and decreases as l 1 from 0 3 to 0 7 the maximum capture efficiency is at l 1 0 3 among these four relative distance this is important for energy extraction because both the very strong or very weak interaction of the owsc device with incident waves corresponding to the small or large relative distance respectively lead to the lower energy extraction the highest energy extraction occurs at the middle relative distance when the pto damping is equal to the optimal damping 4 4 shoaling effect the harvesting energy of the owsc device is extracted from the surge motion of wave particles intuitively shallow ocean area increases the horizontal velocity of wave particles due to shoaling effect and thus contribute to increasing the fluid loads on the flap surface in this subsection a local reduction in the distance from the hinged point of the flap to the seabed is explored as an effective approach to enhance the energy extraction of the owsc device the effects of the distance between the hinged point to the seabed on the hydrodynamic performance against wave frequency is shown in fig 13 it can be seen that the energy efficiency decreases rapidly as the distance l 2 increases from 0 3 to 1 3 and then tends the stable value after that in addition the maximum response extracted energy and capture efficiency for different distance l 2 almost correspond to the same wave frequency in brief the distance l 2 has few effects on both the curve shape and the natural frequency in practical applications such as wave energy technologies although there may be 10 20 energy losses when waves propagate from deep water to shallow water whittaker and folley 2012 the owsc devices can achieve higher capture efficiency and realize wider applicable extent of wave frequency 4 5 optimal strategy the mechanical functions c pto and b pto are two important coefficients affecting the wave energy extraction of the owsc device in this subsection the effects of c pto and b pto on the hydrodynamic performance of an owsc device are examined with constant parameters h i 0 05 d 2 0 3 d 1 0 1 b 3 06 and θ 200 four different combinations of pto parameters c pto 0 b pto b opt c pto 0 0762 b pto b opt c pto 1 525 b pto b opt and c pto 2 288 b pto b opt are selected where b opt denotes an optimal pto damping which maximizes wave energy extraction e p at each wave frequency based on extremal theory e p b pto 0 we can obtain following relationship 38 b pto b opt i a z ω 2 n τ p n τ p n τ p 2 c z 2 ω 2 b z 2 fig 14 illustrates the effects of pto stiffness parameter c pto when pto damping is optimized for maximizing the average generated power the variations of the motion amplitude γ 0 the average generated power e p the capture efficiency r and the pto damping b pto are versus incident wave frequency ω it can be seen that the motion amplitude the average generated power and the capture efficiency decrease with the increase of pto stiffness in the low frequency zone ω 0 5 but follow a completely opposite trend in the high frequency zone ω 0 6 in general the extracted energy indicated in fig 14 b is a litter lower for a larger pto stiffness and occurs at a shorter wave due to the increase of whole stiffness in eq 37 however as shown in fig 14 c when the pto damping is optimized for e p the corresponding maximum capture efficiency slightly increases with the increase of pto stiffness this is because that the capture efficiency r is proportional to the average generated energy e p and is inversely proportional to the incident wave energy e w the incident wave energy e w is found to increase faster than the average generated energy e p as wave frequency ω increases and thus the maximum capture efficiency r may be reduced nevertheless the maximum values of capture efficiency r still remain at a high level it should be noted that the bandwidth of the efficiency maximum is broaden by the increase of pto stiffness c pto comparing fig 14 c with fig 14 d the corresponding maximum values of b opt occur at roughly the lower wave frequencies for each pto stiffness this reason is due to that the optimal pto damping b opt in fig 14 d is obtained from eq 38 where the inclined angle of the pto system respect to the negative direction of x axis is set as the initial angle θ 200 actually the angle θ changes in real time with the motion of the flap subjected to wave actions and is not a constant value which means that the instantaneous coupled interaction of the pto and the flap can affect the natural features of the owsc device the maximum efficiency is in principle reached by both two condition i e the owsc rotates at the resonant frequency and meanwhile the pto damping is set as the radiation damping fig 14 d shows that a larger optimal pto damping is desired for a larger pto stiffness when resonance occurs above studied cases for the optimization of pto parameters however are based on the ideal conditions of maximizing the average generated power over all tested wave frequencies which means that the characteristics of the generator system i e mechanical properties are regularly tuned to balance the incident wave spectrum this ideal scheme is hard to meet in realistic conditions a more practical optimization strategy proposed by lovas et al 2010 that only selects some effective pto damping at certain frequency region are adopted in following subsection fig 15 a gives the variation of the optimal pto damping with wave frequency for pto stiffness c pto 0 762 and other parameters remaining the same as those in fig 14 as indicated in fig 15 a the valley value and the arithmetic mean value of b opt i e b pto 1 06 and 3 83 are taken as the two discrete damping coefficients respectively the corresponding motion amplitude the average generated power and the capture efficiency for b opt b pto 1 06 and b pto 3 83 are depicted in fig 15 b c it can be seen from fig 15 b that a lager pto damping leads to a smaller motion response for example γ for b pto 1 06 is larger than that for b opt which is due to that b pto 1 06 is the lowest value radiation damping of b opt and γ for b pto 3 83 is larger than that for b opt only at frequency region ω 0 7 or ω 0 3 however this large motion response does not indicate that high energy extraction can be obtained by the owsc device as shown in fig 15 c and d both the average generated power and the capture efficiency for b pto 1 06 is close to those for b opt near the wave frequency region around the maximum value occurs and the average generated power and the capture efficiency for b pto 3 83 is identical to those for b opt over other wave frequency region two intersection points between the curves for b pto 1 06 and 3 83 occur at ω 0 4 and 0 7 for above particular optimization strategy the dimensionless mechanical damping b pto piecewise values are set as b pto 1 06 for 0 4 ω 0 7 and b pto 3 83 for ω 0 4 or ω 0 7 the average generated power and the capture efficiency are re plotted in fig 16 a and b the results indicate that it is possible to absorb energy close to maximum value with only selecting two pto damping coefficients actually the largest differences between the particular and ideal optimization strategy are only 0 05 and 0 09 according to the average generated power and the capture efficiency respectively although these differences can be further reduced by selecting more piecewise damping the two value optimization strategy has been validated to be accurate enough over whole wave frequency region in addition it is easier to conduct the scheme for fewer damping coefficients in other words with the two value pto damping scheme both the average generated power and the capture efficiency can be ensured to achieve the maximum for the fully submerged owsc devices 5 conclusions in the present work the hydrodynamic performance of a fully submerged multi cylindrical owsc device is numerically simulated based on nonlinear potential flow theory and the validated hobem a local change in the body shape proposed as an economical way to enhance favorable behavior is demonstrated to obviously increase wave energy extraction the effects of wave nonlinearity water depth and geometrical parameters including height thickness and width on the body motion the average generated energy and hydrodynamic efficiency are emphatically examined initially the ideal strategy of maximum energy extraction is targeted by selecting optimal pto damping at each wave frequency and is very difficult to implement in the practical wave environment therefore a more practical strategy to optimize the mechanical parameters of pto system is explored with the same objective through extensive simulations for the 3 d wave energy conversion the following conclusions can be drawn 1 both the motion response and the energy extraction of the multi cylindrical configuration is larger than those of single rectangular configuration in low frequency region but the hydrodynamic performance is not sensitive to the change of the configuration in high frequency region for this reason selecting multi cylindrical configuration as pendulum shape of the owsc device is preferable 2 different linear theoretical prediction 3 d nonlinear numerical solutions indicate that when an owsc device is subjected to the stokes wave at a given wave length a larger incident wave height will induce more higher harmonic free wave components which will then reduce the capture efficiency in addition the real resonant frequency increases with increasing wave height due to complex fluid structure interaction 3 as regards the effects of the flap thickness a larger cylindrical shaped radius leads to an increase in the extraction bandwidth for long waves albeit at the expense of a slightly lower peak value of the capture efficiency as for the flap width a wider flap can enhance the capture efficiency in long waves but the opposite trend occurs in the short waves meanwhile the corresponding peak value is independent of the flap width as intuitively expected a shallower submerged depth of the owsc device shows more intense motion as floating body however the energy extraction would not be further enhanced with increasing the flap height due to additional pto damping 4 an ideal adjusting scheme towards maximum energy extraction corresponds to select optimal pto damping at each wave frequency as pto stiffness increases the optimal pto damping increases in low frequency region and decreases in high frequency region which leads to higher resonant frequency in addition the peak values of the capture efficiency are almost identical among all pto stiffness however it is difficult to tune pto parameters over whole incident wave spectrum by conducting easier two value optimization strategy in practical application the desired energy extraction can be achieved which is as efficient as applying every ideal pto damping the present work considers the effects of 3 d nonlinear flow field in time domain as well as the instantaneous coupled interaction of pto system and body motion which gives many realistic guidelines for assisting in the parametric atlas analysis site selection structural design and commercial scale operation of the owsc devices the developed numerical model can be extended straightforwardly to irregular wave cases in a future study credit authorship contribution statement yong cheng conceptualization data curation investigation methodology software writing
