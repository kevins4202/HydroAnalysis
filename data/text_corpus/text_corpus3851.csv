19255,in the top layer of aerated rapid sand filtration systems uncharged as iii is biologically converted to charged as v subsequently the main removal mechanism for as v is adsorption onto oxidised flocculated fe iii hydrous ferric hydroxides hfo the aim of this research was to understand the interactions between as and fe in biologically active rapid filter columns and investigate the effect of different operational modes on fe removal to subsequently promote as removal for this purpose different filter media column experiments were performed using natural aerated groundwater containing 3 4 μg l as iii results show that independent of the filter media size complete biological conversion of as iii manganese ammonium and nitrite was achieved in approximately 70 days after ripening enhanced as removal was achieved with a top layer of coarse media or by dosing additional fe iii addition of fe ii did not have the same effect on as removal potentially due to heterogeneous fe ii oxidation in the upper layer of the filter attaching rapidly to the filter grain surface and thereby preventing hfo flocs to penetrate deeper into the bed increasing the flow rate from 1 to 4 m h did not improve as removal and lowering the ph from 8 to 7 4 resulted in an 55 increased removal of dissolved as altogether it is concluded that as removal in biologically active rapid sand filters can be improved by applying coarser filter media on top in combination with dosing fe iii and or ph correction graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater treatment rapid filtration arsenite oxidation and arsenic adsorption 1 introduction arsenic as removal is increasingly important when treating groundwater for drinking water production the world health organization who put in effect a provisional guideline of 10 μg l on as since 1993 however as is toxic and can cause adverse health effects even at concentrations below 10 μg l roh et al 2017 van halem et al 2009 who 2011 hence drinking water companies in the netherlands have decided to investigate the practical implications of distributing drinking water with as concentrations 1 0 μg l in practice requiring a reduction in the range of 1 4 μg l to below 1 μg l vitens 2014 in commonly applied aeration rapid sand filtration systems at these low concentrations the challenge for effective as removal is rapid oxidation of as iii to as v before iron fe removal occurs since as v is more effectively adsorbed onto flocculating hydrous ferric oxides hfo than as iii bissen and frimmel 2003 gude et al 2016 2017 2018 both reduced as iii and fe ii react with o2 to as v and fe iii respectively these are the species present at thermodynamic equilibrium in an oxic environment at alkaline ph stumm and morgan 1996 unlike fe ii oxidation homogeneous as iii oxidation by oxygen o2 is sluggish driehaus et al 1995 kim and nriagu 2000 observed that in 5 days only 54 of 48 μg l as iii in groundwater ph between 7 6 and 8 5 was oxidised when exposed to air this oxidation pathway is therefore not relevant for centralised groundwater treatment plants with limited residence times gude et al 2016 strong oxidants like chlorine permanganate and ozone gas can instantly oxidise as iii together with most other reduced constituents in groundwater ghurye and clifford 2004 however as an alternative also biological oxidation of as iii can be employed the existence of bacteria that are capable of oxidizing as iii with oxygen o2 has been well documented cavalca et al 2013 huang 2014 oremland and stolz 2003 quéméneur et al 2008 and their presence in rapid sand filters has been observed bai et al 2016 corsini et al 2015 gude et al 2018 despite their usefulness no extensive research is available on how these as iii oxidising bacteria in rapid sand filters can be optimally exploited for enhanced as removal for fe ii oxidation with o2 in aeration filtration systems a subdivision is generally made between homogeneous heterogeneous and biological oxidation van beek et al 2015 vries et al 2017 homogeneous oxidation rate is mainly influenced by ph and o2 concentration stumm and lee 1961 and occurs predominantly during aeration and supernatant water storage heterogeneous and biological fe ii oxidation occur on the surface of filter media in the rapid filter during heterogeneous fe ii oxidation fe ii is adsorbed to fe oxides such as hfo prior to oxidation sharma et al 1999 wolthoorn et al 2004 this oxidation rate is similarly governed by ph and o2 but much faster since it is catalysed by fe oxides jones et al 2014 tamura et al 1976 additionally biological oxidation can occur in the filter bed becoming more predominant when homogeneous and heterogeneous oxidation are hampered de vet et al 2011 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004b the aim of this research was to understand the interactions between as and fe in biologically active rapid filter columns and investigate the effect of different modes of fe removal to subsequently promote as removal filter media size filtration velocity supernatant level and ph can greatly affect fe ii and hfo removal pathways in rapid sand filters e g sharma et al 2001 and van beek et al 2015 however to the best of our knowledge the influence of these design and operational conditions on as removal has not been investigated yet as iii in the native groundwater is oxidized in the top layer of biologically active filters gude et al 2016 so as v is mainly present in the deeper layers of the filter bed it is therefore hypothesized that stimulating hfo penetration deeper into the filter bed with applicable operational and design conditions will result in more effective as adsorption in filters therefore experiments were performed to compare various filter media sizes fe ii and fe iii additions filtration velocity and ph in natural groundwater containing on average 3 4 μg l as iii 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater quality the research was performed at drinking water production plant wageningseberg vitens n v the tested water has a relative high ph ph 8 0 contains low concentrations of as 3 4 μg l fe 0 31 mg l and ammonium nh4 0 04 mg l the manganese mn concentrations were 0 14 mg l the groundwater used for these experiments was the same as used for regular drinking water production therefore depending on production demand the number of groundwater wells in operation varied multiple times per day leading to minor water quality changes as depicted in table 1 2 2 experimental column set up the experimental set up consisted of eight columns with a diameter of 90 mm and a height of 1 m four pairs were made by filling duplicate columns with either fine sand coarse sand anthracite or pumice at a filter bed height of 50 cm mainly simulating the upper part of a rapid filter all variable settings were tested on one of the duplicate columns whereas the other acted as the reference fig 2 a fixed pressure of 6 m was obtained by a feed pump in the raw water wilo yonos para 3 45w to ensure a constant steady flow throughout the experiment the pressure was reduced just before the individual columns before starting the experiment the columns were 30 min backwashed at 30 expansion 15 cm backwashing was done with tap water without air scouring aeration of the anaerobic groundwater was achieved by application of a small spray aeration device and cascading the water from 30 cm directly into the supernatant water resulting in an o2 concentration of 5 6 mg l this is half of the o2 equilibrium concentration at 10 c 11 8 mg l o2 however the cumulative o2 demand for the oxidation reactions of as iii fe ii mn ii and nh4 was below 0 5 mg l o2 the supernatant water height was set at 1 cm by adjusting the height of the filtrate overflow directly after backwashing the default filtration velocity was 1 m h 6 4 l h per column due to filter clogging the supernatant water in the fine sand columns rose to 10 cm in three to four days for the other columns no rise in supernatant level was observed in this timeframe after clogging of the fine sand columns all columns were backwashed throughout the nine months of experiments the columns were continuously fed with aerated groundwater and were situated at a location deprived from sun and artificial light 2 3 experimental settings all collected data contributed to the assessment of five experiments 1 biological filter ripening 2 influence of filter media on fe and as removal 3 fe ii or fe iii addition in the supernatant water 4 influence of filtration velocity on fe and as removal and 5 adjusting the ph in the range of 7 4 8 0 thereby varying the time to homogeneously oxidise 90 of the fe ii from 20 min to 1 5 min calculated in phreeqc with wateq4f dat thus greatly affecting the mode of fe removal within the practical ph range of groundwater treatment in experiment 1 the column pairs were operated in the same manner and therefore acted as real duplicates in experiments 3 5 the duplicate filter media columns were operated as single columns one was used to impose the various settings while the other column acted as reference to account for the small water quality changes in the raw water in this set up the reference column and the setting column were measured twice in the time span of 3h and averaged the results could therefore be subjected to the paired t test for statistical analysis to evaluate whether a significant difference was measured between the reference and the setting columns experiment 1 the biological ripening phase was performed to observe the changing water quality as a result of the accumulation of biomass as iii nh4 and mn ii were analysed in the filtrate twice a week at a filtration rate of 1 m h 10 after the ripening period 72 days and an additional 70 days stable operation was observed in all filter columns mn nh4 and nitrite no2 were converted or removed completely at this point the other experiments 2 5 were performed for experiment 2 the influence of filter media on as removal all measurements of the reference filters were used 18 measurements over 4 months with the same settings were averaged n 18 when running the other experimental settings 3 5 a stabilisation period of at least two days per setting was used before taking samples gude et al 2016 jessen et al 2005 and before every setting the columns were backwashed after 48 h runtime the filtrate of all columns was sampled and analysed for experiment 3 on top of the naturally occurring 0 3 mg l fe ii 0 3 and 0 6 mg l fe ii or fe iii was added to the feed water of the four columns containing fine sand coarse sand anthracite and pumice in experiment 4 different ph values between 7 4 and 8 0 were tested by acidifying the raw groundwater with hno3 finally for experiment 5 the filtration velocity was increased to 4 m h and compared to their reference filters that were kept at a velocity of 1 m h to ensure that the biomass was adjusted to the higher flow rate the filter columns were ripened for an additional 32 days duplicates for all settings were obtained by sampling all columns twice within a period of 2 h 2 4 filter media four types of filter media were compared on their ability to remove as the filter media and their properties are depicted table 2 filter media were obtained from aqua techniek b v fine and coarse sand were of 100 natural silica and type 1 according to en 12904 anthracite was type iii and the pumice was aqua volcano according to en 12906 sand and anthracite are non porous pumice is initially porous technical datasheet 2 5 chemicals sampling and analytical methods fe was obtained from sigma aldrich fecl2 4h2o 99 99 and fecl3 6h2o 99 reagents grade 5m hno3 was used to adjust the ph of the columns and to stabilize the fe ii and fe iii dosing solutions by decreasing the ph to 3 the chemical concentration was adjusted in the reservoir see fig 1 to obtain the various desired concentrations the peristaltic pump continuously pumped the chemicals into the supernatant water at a flow rate of 0 9 ml min only ph 7 7 was achieved by increasing the pump speed to 1 8 ml min filtrate was collected in 2l jars that were continuously fed after the overflow to prevent changing the filtration rate while sampling from these jars filtered samples 0 45 μm and unfiltered samples were taken and analysed after 0 45 μm filtration total fe concentrations in all samples were 0 02 mg l so the as in these samples can be considered as dissolved as ph electrical conductivity ec and o2 were measured with wtw electrodes sentix 940 terracon 925 and fdo925 respectively as fe and mn were analysed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo x2 series nh4 no2 and no3 were analysed by a spectrophotometer aquakem 250 company thermo scientific as speciation was done according the clifford 2006 method here 150 ml sample was passed through an anionic resin 80 ml amberlite ira 400 cl in a 100 ml syringe the first 50 ml was always discarded the remaining 100 ml was collected and analysed using icp ms the charged as v species are retained by the resin and the filtrate from the resin is considered to be only as iii an additional measurement without using resin was done to determine the total as concentration and the as v concentration was determined by subtracting the as iii concentration from the total as concentration however at neutral ph the resin unavoidably retains on average 14 of as iii min 7 max 23 n 24 gude et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 ripening of the filters in rapid sand filters that treat aerated groundwater without application of strong oxidants like permanganate and chlorine as iii is biologically oxidised gude et al 2018 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004a oremland and stolz 2003 mn ii starts biologically bruins et al 2015 and nh4 oxidation is a biological process lee et al 2014 the processes start to become effective when sufficient biomass has accumulated on the filter media grains during a period of several weeks previous work showed that biological as iii oxidation develops first followed by nh4 and mn ii gude et al 2018 in the current study the ripening of the different filter media was monitored for a period of 72 days the filtrate concentrations of dissolved as iii as v nh4 no2 and mn are depicted in fig 2 for each of the filter media the biological oxidation processes of as iii nh4 and mn ii developed sequentially over time in all columns as iii oxidation developed first followed by nh4 oxidation and thereafter mn ii oxidation nevertheless a differentiation between the various filter media can be made on the rate of start up of the various processes the biological ripening time was shortest for the fine sand columns and after 72 days all as iii nh4 no2 and mn was completely converted or removed on the coarse sand and anthracite which have a larger grain size and therefore a smaller specific surface area than fine sand mn oxidation and removal started about 1 3 weeks later while nitrification i e no2 production started about 2 weeks later measurements not shown in fig 2 indicated that all columns completely removed and converted all as iii nh4 no2 and mn after 86 days pumice with the largest grain size but with a very high internal porosity was quickest to establish a biomass to convert as iii to as v however after 14 days the steep decline in as iii concentration was reversed and as iii concentrations in the filtrate increased again we visually observed using a microscope that in time pumice becomes covered with mineral deposits possibly hindering the transport of as iii to the internal biomass while not shown in fig 2 the fe removal initial concentration 0 3 mg l was instantaneous in all columns and fe oxides may thus well be responsible for blockage of the internal pores of pumice overall the filter media with their different sizes surface areas and shapes had a minor impact on the start up time of as iii nh4 and mn oxidation this may be related to the relatively low concentrations of mn nh4 and as iii in the groundwater for which only a limited amount of surface would suffice to accommodate the required biomass this is confirmed by lee et al 2014 in denmark where fe mn and nh4 at similar concentrations were completely removed in the first 50 cm of a sand filter in a pilot experiment it is expected that when the filter loading increases more surface area is required for the biomass in addition the accompanying effect due to frequent backwashing to remove the higher fe solids load can disrupt immature biofilms and flush loosely attached biomass out of the system liu et al 2012 3 2 influence of ripened filter media on as removal the major part of removed as in a rapid sand filter is achieved by adsorption of as v to hfo gude et al 2016 the hfo originates from naturally present fe ii by either homogeneous oxidation in the supernatant or in the pore volume of the filter material or heterogeneous biological oxidation on the surface of the filter grains the homogeneously formed hfo flocs are subsequently retained in the filter while at least part of the heterogeneous oxidised fe ii attaches itself to the filter media grains de vet et al 2011 van beek et al 2015 vries et al 2017 in this respect it was hypothesised that different ripened filter media sizes i e different surface area and hydraulic pore channel size perform differently concerning fe removal and the accompanied as adsorption both dissolved as left and total fe right concentrations in the filtrate of the columns are depicted in fig 3 the variations per filter media which are depicted by the error bars were mostly due to water quality changes during the measuring period of four months the removal of mn nh4 and no2 was after ripening complete and consistent in all columns as on the other hand varied as a result of the applied filter media the removal of as was highest for the filter materials with the largest grain sizes 27 27 22 and 19 as removal for pumice anthracite coarse sand and fine sand respectively for fe the opposite was observed fe removal was less effective in the columns with larger size filter media grains the remaining fe in the filtrate for pumice anthracite coarse sand and fine sand was 31 28 20 and 10 μg l respectively consequently less hfo was present in the coarser filter media however an increased as adsorption was observed in table 3 the accumulated as and the accumulated fe present in the filter bed at the moment of sampling are depicted not only the dissolved as concentrations were lower in the filtrate of the anthracite and pumice columns but also the total as was lower in 48h the accumulated as was highest in the anthracite and pumice columns while the least hfo was retained hence it is concluded that not only the amount of hfo is important in rapid filtration but also the location where the hfo is retained in the filter bed i e height over the filter is of importance for effective as removal the application of different size filter media influences as and fe removal a smaller grain diameter results in high available surface area for chemical and biological processes while a larger diameter results in more deep bed filtration and subsequently a less effective particle retention moel et al 2006 apparently the positive effect on biological activity by an increased surface area in the fine sand columns is out competed by the positive effect of deep bed filtration of fe in the coarser media columns the proposed mechanism that larger grain sizes resulted in more effective as removal is that they permit less effective sieving filtering of formed hfo and the larger hydraulic pore channels of the coarse filter media allows more homogeneous hfo production since homogeneous fe ii oxidation it is not surface related it is assumed that the subsequently formed hfo can penetrate deeper in the filter bed 3 3 effect oxidation state of fe entering the filter bed on as removal it was shown that by applying filter media with larger grains more fe ended up in the filtrate indicating that hfo penetrated deeper into the filter bed and subsequently adsorbed more as this positive effect was hypothesised to be related to a higher ratio homogeneous fe oxidation and flocculation compared to heterogeneous surface related oxidation within the larger hydraulic pore channels of the coarser material to investigate the role of fe oxidation state in the filter bed different fe ii and fe iii concentrations were dosed to the influent total fe concentrations in the filtrate of the fine sand coarse sand anthracite and pumice columns after dosing additional fe are depicted in fig 4 for 0 3 and 0 6 mg l fe ii and 0 3 and 0 6 mg l fe iii additions addition of either fe ii or fe iii at the same concentrations resulted in different fe concentrations in the filtrate fe ii was more effectively retained than fe iii in the coarse sand anthracite and pumice filter columns fine sand on the other hand removed the additional fe iii slightly more effectively than fe ii the dosing of 0 3 and 0 6 mg l fe ii resulted in filtrate concentrations of 16 and 23 μg l versus 12 and 11 μg l for fe iii apparently confirmed by the strongest increase in pressure drop the fe iii blocked the pores in the top layer of the fine sand column increasing fe iii removal efficiency also observed by sharma et al 2001 where 4 times more head loss was occurred in fine media compared to coarse media during fe floc filtration the other media did not remove fe iii better than fe ii clearly the larger hydraulic pore channels in the coarse filter media retained less hfo flocs originating from the fe iii ending up deeper in the filter bed and ultimately in the filtrate similarly for fe ii the grain size determined the fe removal efficiency however the removal efficiencies were more in the same range apparently fe ii is more efficiency removed in coarse filters than fe iii probably due to the surface related heterogeneous fe ii oxidation which does not occur when fe iii is dosed sharma et al 2001 also observed decreased fe concentrations in the filtrate when comparing adsorptive fe ii removal compared to floc filtration altogether is concluded that heterogeneously oxidised fe ii especially in media with larger grain size was more effectively removed than homogeneous fe ii oxidation prior to filtration simulated by fe iii addition in the feed water fig 5 depicts the decrease of dissolved as in the filtrate as a result of fe ii and fe iii additions this decrease was calculated by using the dissolved as values asref as asref 100 as a result of adding 0 3 mg l fe iii dissolved as was decreased by 28 38 40 and 46 for fine sand coarse sand anthracite and pumice respectively addition of 0 6 mg l fe iii resulted even in higher adsorption of dissolved as 28 57 65 and 74 also fine sand coarse sand anthracite and pumice respectively for fe ii dissolved as adsorption was lower 29 23 33 and 34 for fine sand coarse sand anthracite and pumice respectively when adding 0 3 mg l fe ii and 46 47 45 and 54 when adding 0 6 fe ii for all filter media except fine sand the addition of fe iii thus resulted in a larger decrease in dissolved as than the addition of fe ii confirming the hypothesis that more as is adsorbed in rapid filters when fe ii is oxidised prior to filtration or in the pore channels in addition the better retention of fe ii compared to fe iii resulted in more hfo accumulation during a filter run however this did not attribute to increased as removal calculating the as hfo ratio that was retained in the filter during the run time it was found that with both the fe ii and fe iii additions the as fe ratio in the filter bed increased with the filter media size fine sand course sand anthracite pumice indicating that the filter media that retained the least amount of hfo most effectively adsorbed as the data suggest that application of a dual layer filter with coarse media in the top to effectively adsorb as to hfo and fine media in the bottom to retain the as hfo flocs would result in maximum as removal possible explanations for the lower effectivity of reducing the dissolved as concentrations by fe ii compared to fe iii are 1 fe ii oxidises partly on the grain surface and is removed rapidly in the top layer of the filter bed mettler et al 2009 tamura et al 1976 vries et al 2017 preventing it to reach deeper layers for as v adsorption sharma et al 2001 van beek et al 2015 and or 2 heterogeneous oxidation results in less available sites for surface complexation lowering the adsorption capacity of the hfo comparable to hfo formed through fe ii oxidation by mno2 gude et al 2017 and or 3 that the fe minerals form a mineral layer on top of as oxidizing biofilm or taking available surface hindering as iii oxidation 3 4 influence of filtration velocity on as removal increasing the filtration velocity can be an alternative method to force hfo deeper into the filter bed as it among other mechanisms increases the hydraulic shear forces within the pore channels on the other hand biological as iii oxidation may occur deeper in the filter bed as well fig 6 depicts the total fe and dissolved as concentration in the filtrate of the fine sand coarse sand anthracite and pumice columns at 1 m h and 4 m h there were basically no changes in fe concentrations in the filtrate of the fine and coarse sand filters when increasing the filtration velocity from 1 m h to 4 m h only in the anthracite and pumice columns an increase of 10 μg l fe was observed in the filtrate and instead of improving the as removal the concentration in the filtrate went up modestly however with 5 1 6 and 4 for fine sand coarse sand anthracite and pumice respectively these results show that by increasing filtration velocity as adsorption to hfo is slightly decreased however the removal was not significantly reduced in the columns with increased filtration velocity t test p 0 05 it seems that the strictly surface related biological as iii oxidation was differently affected by increased filtration velocity than hfo formation together this resulted in a negative effect on as removal which is in line with the finding that fe ii oxidation prior to filtration is beneficial for as removal fig 5 at increased filter loading the residence time in the supernatant level is shortened which should result in increased fe ii in the filter bed and a subsequent negative effect on as removal additionally the increased filtration velocity resulted in a factor 4 higher reynold numbers e g pumice from 1 2 to 4 7 tchobanoglous et al 2003 more turbulence within the hydraulic pore channels may have accelerated the transport of fe ii to the grain surface and increased the chance for heterogeneous oxidation at the grain surface in addition the surface related mineral formation may have competed with biological as iii oxidation for the available surface this surface limitation hypothesis is for example building on observations by lee et al 2014 where increased loading of nh4 on a rapid sand filter did not result in additional oxidation of nh4 the complexity and number of processes involved make it difficult to draw a general conclusion on the observations shown in fig 6 however it is clear that simply increasing the filtration velocity to bring hfo deeper into the filter bed will increase as removal is not true 3 5 influence of ph on as removal lowering the ph decreases the rate of fe ii oxidation both homogeneous stumm and lee 1961 and heterogeneous tamura et al 1976 and could potentially cause fe to penetrate deeper in the filter bed additionally hfo has a higher adsorption capacity for as v at lower ph dixit and hering 2003 dzombak and morel 1990 gude et al 2016 suggesting that as v adsorption can be increased at lower ph values after as iii is oxidised influence of ph was investigated at a ph range of 7 4 8 0 which is not an uncommon ph for groundwater treatment the dissolved as concentration in the filtrate as a function of ph for the investigated filter media is depicted in fig 7 the results show that in the investigated ph range the dissolved as in the filtrate decreased as the ph decreased for all filter media dissolved as concentrations decreased from 2 40 to 2 60 μg l at ph 8 0 to 1 50 1 65 μg l at ph 7 4 respectively this corresponds to a decrease in dissolved as of 15 55 the exceptional as removal performance by pumice at the measurement intervals ph 7 7 was probably caused by a greater pool of retained hfo in the filter bed from previous runs which provided temporarily additional sorption sites while lowering the ph analogue to observations in gude et al 2016 where hfo showed increased sorption capacity at lower ph fig 8 depicts the corresponding fe removal percentage in the fine sand coarse sand anthracite and pumice for ph 7 4 and 8 0 anthracite and pumice the coarsest filter media showed improved fe removal from 91 to 88 at ph 8 93 92 at ph 7 4 respectively while for the fine and coarse sand filters fe removal efficiency dropped from about 97 to 94 given that floc filtration is not so effective while using large grain sizes the increased removal can perhaps be explained by a switch to adsorptive removal which was also observed by sharma et al 2001 in itself this shift to surface related heterogeneous oxidation was observed not be beneficiary for as removal as observed in the prior experiments with fe ii additions however when reducing the ph also heterogeneous fe oxidation rate is reduced jones et al 2014 tamura et al 1980 additionally substantial increase in adsorption capacity of hfo for as v was found at lower ph dixit and hering 2003 gude et al 2016 mercer and tobiason 2008 qiao et al 2012 hence hfo formation may have occurred deeper in the filter bed where biological as iii oxidation was complete and the adsorption capacity would have been increased due to favourable charge conditions 4 conclusions the research aimed at promoting as removal by understanding its interaction with fe ii and hfo in the filter bed for this purpose the effect of filter media size ph fe ii and fe iii additions and filtration velocity were investigated in natural groundwater filter columns based on the presented research it may be concluded that biological as iii oxidation developed in filter columns independent of the applied filter media fine sand coarse sand anthracite or pumice with a slightly faster ripening for media with a finer grain size or larger internal porosity pumice after ripening enhanced as removal was achieved with a layer of coarser media or by dosing additional fe iii promoting hfo flocs to penetrate deeper into the bed which was observed by higher fe concentrations in the filtrate apparently fe ii oxidation prior to rapid filtration is beneficial to as iii removal this was confirmed by increasing the flow rate from 1 to 4 m h where as removal was not improved although hfo flocs were pushed deeper in the filter bed lowering the ph in the range of 7 4 8 0 resulted in a positive effect on as removal possibly due to slowing the fe removal rate and the advantageous adsorption capacity of hfo at lower ph altogether it is concluded that as removal in biologically active rapid sand filters can be improved by applying coarser filter media in the top of the filter bed in combination with dosing of fe iii and or ph

however to the best of our knowledge the influence of these design and operational conditions on as removal has not been investigated yet as iii in the native groundwater is oxidized in the top layer of biologically active filters gude et al 2016 so as v is mainly present in the deeper layers of the filter bed it is therefore hypothesized that stimulating hfo penetration deeper into the filter bed with applicable operational and design conditions will result in more effective as adsorption in filters therefore experiments were performed to compare various filter media sizes fe ii and fe iii additions filtration velocity and ph in natural groundwater containing on average 3 4 μg l as iii 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater quality the research was performed at drinking water production plant wageningseberg vitens n v the tested water has a relative high ph ph 8 0 contains low concentrations of as 3 4 μg l fe 0 31 mg l and ammonium nh4 0 04 mg l the manganese mn concentrations were 0 14 mg l the groundwater used for these experiments was the same as used for regular drinking water production therefore depending on production demand the number of groundwater wells in operation varied multiple times per day leading to minor water quality changes as depicted in table 1 2 2 experimental column set up the experimental set up consisted of eight columns with a diameter of 90 mm and a height of 1 m four pairs were made by filling duplicate columns with either fine sand coarse sand anthracite or pumice at a filter bed height of 50 cm mainly simulating the upper part of a rapid filter all variable settings were tested on one of the duplicate columns whereas the other acted as the reference fig 2 a fixed pressure of 6 m was obtained by a feed pump in the raw water wilo yonos para 3 45w to ensure a constant steady flow throughout the experiment the pressure was reduced just before the individual columns before starting the experiment the columns were 30 min backwashed at 30 expansion 15 cm backwashing was done with tap water without air scouring aeration of the anaerobic groundwater was achieved by application of a small spray aeration device and cascading the water from 30 cm directly into the supernatant water resulting in an o2 concentration of 5 6 mg l this is half of the o2 equilibrium concentration at 10 c 11 8 mg l o2 however the cumulative o2 demand for the oxidation reactions of as iii fe ii mn ii and nh4 was below 0 5 mg l o2 the supernatant water height was set at 1 cm by adjusting the height of the filtrate overflow directly after backwashing the default filtration velocity was 1 m h 6 4 l h per column due to filter clogging the supernatant water in the fine sand columns rose to 10 cm in three to four days for the other columns no rise in supernatant level was observed in this timeframe after clogging of the fine sand columns all columns were backwashed throughout the nine months of experiments the columns were continuously fed with aerated groundwater and were situated at a location deprived from sun and artificial light 2 3 experimental settings all collected data contributed to the assessment of five experiments 1 biological filter ripening 2 influence of filter media on fe and as removal 3 fe ii or fe iii addition in the supernatant water 4 influence of filtration velocity on fe and as removal and 5 adjusting the ph in the range of 7 4 8 0 thereby varying the time to homogeneously oxidise 90 of the fe ii from 20 min to 1 5 min calculated in phreeqc with wateq4f dat thus greatly affecting the mode of fe removal within the practical ph range of groundwater treatment in experiment 1 the column pairs were operated in the same manner and therefore acted as real duplicates in experiments 3 5 the duplicate filter media columns were operated as single columns one was used to impose the various settings while the other column acted as reference to account for the small water quality changes in the raw water in this set up the reference column and the setting column were measured twice in the time span of 3h and averaged the results could therefore be subjected to the paired t test for statistical analysis to evaluate whether a significant difference was measured between the reference and the setting columns experiment 1 the biological ripening phase was performed to observe the changing water quality as a result of the accumulation of biomass as iii nh4 and mn ii were analysed in the filtrate twice a week at a filtration rate of 1 m h 10 after the ripening period 72 days and an additional 70 days stable operation was observed in all filter columns mn nh4 and nitrite no2 were converted or removed completely at this point the other experiments 2 5 were performed for experiment 2 the influence of filter media on as removal all measurements of the reference filters were used 18 measurements over 4 months with the same settings were averaged n 18 when running the other experimental settings 3 5 a stabilisation period of at least two days per setting was used before taking samples gude et al 2016 jessen et al 2005 and before every setting the columns were backwashed after 48 h runtime the filtrate of all columns was sampled and analysed for experiment 3 on top of the naturally occurring 0 3 mg l fe ii 0 3 and 0 6 mg l fe ii or fe iii was added to the feed water of the four columns containing fine sand coarse sand anthracite and pumice in experiment 4 different ph values between 7 4 and 8 0 were tested by acidifying the raw groundwater with hno3 finally for experiment 5 the filtration velocity was increased to 4 m h and compared to their reference filters that were kept at a velocity of 1 m h to ensure that the biomass was adjusted to the higher flow rate the filter columns were ripened for an additional 32 days duplicates for all settings were obtained by sampling all columns twice within a period of 2 h 2 4 filter media four types of filter media were compared on their ability to remove as the filter media and their properties are depicted table 2 filter media were obtained from aqua techniek b v fine and coarse sand were of 100 natural silica and type 1 according to en 12904 anthracite was type iii and the pumice was aqua volcano according to en 12906 sand and anthracite are non porous pumice is initially porous technical datasheet 2 5 chemicals sampling and analytical methods fe was obtained from sigma aldrich fecl2 4h2o 99 99 and fecl3 6h2o 99 reagents grade 5m hno3 was used to adjust the ph of the columns and to stabilize the fe ii and fe iii dosing solutions by decreasing the ph to 3 the chemical concentration was adjusted in the reservoir see fig 1 to obtain the various desired concentrations the peristaltic pump continuously pumped the chemicals into the supernatant water at a flow rate of 0 9 ml min only ph 7 7 was achieved by increasing the pump speed to 1 8 ml min filtrate was collected in 2l jars that were continuously fed after the overflow to prevent changing the filtration rate while sampling from these jars filtered samples 0 45 μm and unfiltered samples were taken and analysed after 0 45 μm filtration total fe concentrations in all samples were 0 02 mg l so the as in these samples can be considered as dissolved as ph electrical conductivity ec and o2 were measured with wtw electrodes sentix 940 terracon 925 and fdo925 respectively as fe and mn were analysed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo x2 series nh4 no2 and no3 were analysed by a spectrophotometer aquakem 250 company thermo scientific as speciation was done according the clifford 2006 method here 150 ml sample was passed through an anionic resin 80 ml amberlite ira 400 cl in a 100 ml syringe the first 50 ml was always discarded the remaining 100 ml was collected and analysed using icp ms the charged as v species are retained by the resin and the filtrate from the resin is considered to be only as iii an additional measurement without using resin was done to determine the total as concentration and the as v concentration was determined by subtracting the as iii concentration from the total as concentration however at neutral ph the resin unavoidably retains on average 14 of as iii min 7 max 23 n 24 gude et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 ripening of the filters in rapid sand filters that treat aerated groundwater without application of strong oxidants like permanganate and chlorine as iii is biologically oxidised gude et al 2018 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004a oremland and stolz 2003 mn ii starts biologically bruins et al 2015 and nh4 oxidation is a biological process lee et al 2014 the processes start to become effective when sufficient biomass has accumulated on the filter media grains during a period of several weeks previous work showed that biological as iii oxidation develops first followed by nh4 and mn ii gude et al 2018 in the current study the ripening of the different filter media was monitored for a period of 72 days the filtrate concentrations of dissolved as iii as v nh4 no2 and mn are depicted in fig 2 for each of the filter media the biological oxidation processes of as iii nh4 and mn ii developed sequentially over time in all columns as iii oxidation developed first followed by nh4 oxidation and thereafter mn ii oxidation nevertheless a differentiation between the various filter media can be made on the rate of start up of the various processes the biological ripening time was shortest for the fine sand columns and after 72 days all as iii nh4 no2 and mn was completely converted or removed on the coarse sand and anthracite which have a larger grain size and therefore a smaller specific surface area than fine sand mn oxidation and removal started about 1 3 weeks later while nitrification i e no2 production started about 2 weeks later measurements not shown in fig 2 indicated that all columns completely removed and converted all as iii nh4 no2 and mn after 86 days pumice with the largest grain size but with a very high internal porosity was quickest to establish a biomass to convert as iii to as v however after 14 days the steep decline in as iii concentration was reversed and as iii concentrations in the filtrate increased again we visually observed using a microscope that in time pumice becomes covered with mineral deposits possibly hindering the transport of as iii to the internal biomass while not shown in fig 2 the fe removal initial concentration 0 3 mg l was instantaneous in all columns and fe oxides may thus well be responsible for blockage of the internal pores of pumice overall the filter media with their different sizes surface areas and shapes had a minor impact on the start up time of as iii nh4 and mn oxidation this may be related to the relatively low concentrations of mn nh4 and as iii in the groundwater for which only a limited amount of surface would suffice to accommodate the required biomass this is confirmed by lee et al 2014 in denmark where fe mn and nh4 at similar concentrations were completely removed in the first 50 cm of a sand filter in a pilot experiment it is expected that when the filter loading increases more surface area is required for the biomass in addition the accompanying effect due to frequent backwashing to remove the higher fe solids load can disrupt immature biofilms and flush loosely attached biomass out of the system liu et al 2012 3 2 influence of ripened filter media on as removal the major part of removed as in a rapid sand filter is achieved by adsorption of as v to hfo gude et al 2016 the hfo originates from naturally present fe ii by either homogeneous oxidation in the supernatant or in the pore volume of the filter material or heterogeneous biological oxidation on the surface of the filter grains the homogeneously formed hfo flocs are subsequently retained in the filter while at least part of the heterogeneous oxidised fe ii attaches itself to the filter media grains de vet et al 2011 van beek et al 2015 vries et al 2017 in this respect it was hypothesised that different ripened filter media sizes i e different surface area and hydraulic pore channel size perform differently concerning fe removal and the accompanied as adsorption both dissolved as left and total fe right concentrations in the filtrate of the columns are depicted in fig 3 the variations per filter media which are depicted by the error bars were mostly due to water quality changes during the measuring period of four months the removal of mn nh4 and no2 was after ripening complete and consistent in all columns as on the other hand varied as a result of the applied filter media the removal of as was highest for the filter materials with the largest grain sizes 27 27 22 and 19 as removal for pumice anthracite coarse sand and fine sand respectively for fe the opposite was observed fe removal was less effective in the columns with larger size filter media grains the remaining fe in the filtrate for pumice anthracite coarse sand and fine sand was 31 28 20 and 10 μg l respectively consequently less hfo was present in the coarser filter media however an increased as adsorption was observed in table 3 the accumulated as and the accumulated fe present in the filter bed at the moment of sampling are depicted not only the dissolved as concentrations were lower in the filtrate of the anthracite and pumice columns but also the total as was lower in 48h the accumulated as was highest in the anthracite and pumice columns while the least hfo was retained hence it is concluded that not only the amount of hfo is important in rapid filtration but also the location where the hfo is retained in the filter bed i e height over the filter is of importance for effective as removal the application of different size filter media influences as and fe removal a smaller grain diameter results in high available surface area for chemical and biological processes while a larger diameter results in more deep bed filtration and subsequently a less effective particle retention moel et al 2006 apparently the positive effect on biological activity by an increased surface area in the fine sand columns is out competed by the positive effect of deep bed filtration of fe in the coarser media columns the proposed mechanism that larger grain sizes resulted in more effective as removal is that they permit less effective sieving filtering of formed hfo and the larger hydraulic pore channels of the coarse filter media allows more homogeneous hfo production since homogeneous fe ii oxidation it is not surface related it is assumed that the subsequently formed hfo can penetrate deeper in the filter bed 3 3 effect oxidation state of fe entering the filter bed on as removal it was shown that by applying filter media with larger grains more fe ended up in the filtrate indicating that hfo penetrated deeper into the filter bed and subsequently adsorbed more as this positive effect was hypothesised to be related to a higher ratio homogeneous fe oxidation and flocculation compared to heterogeneous surface related oxidation within the larger hydraulic pore channels of the coarser material to investigate the role of fe oxidation state in the filter bed different fe ii and fe iii concentrations were dosed to the influent total fe concentrations in the filtrate of the fine sand coarse sand anthracite and pumice columns after dosing additional fe are depicted in fig 4 for 0 3 and 0 6 mg l fe ii and 0 3 and 0 6 mg l fe iii additions addition of either fe ii or fe iii at the same concentrations resulted in different fe concentrations in the filtrate fe ii was more effectively retained than fe iii in the coarse sand anthracite and pumice filter columns fine sand on the other hand removed the additional fe iii slightly more effectively than fe ii the dosing of 0 3 and 0 6 mg l fe ii resulted in filtrate concentrations of 16 and 23 μg l versus 12 and 11 μg l for fe iii apparently confirmed by the strongest increase in pressure drop the fe iii blocked the pores in the top layer of the fine sand column increasing fe iii removal efficiency also observed by sharma et al 2001 where 4 times more head loss was occurred in fine media compared to coarse media during fe floc filtration the other media did not remove fe iii better than fe ii clearly the larger hydraulic pore channels in the coarse filter media retained less hfo flocs originating from the fe iii ending up deeper in the filter bed and ultimately in the filtrate similarly for fe ii the grain size determined the fe removal efficiency however the removal efficiencies were more in the same range apparently fe ii is more efficiency removed in coarse filters than fe iii probably due to the surface related heterogeneous fe ii oxidation which does not occur when fe iii is dosed sharma et al 2001 also observed decreased fe concentrations in the filtrate when comparing adsorptive fe ii removal compared to floc filtration altogether is concluded that heterogeneously oxidised fe ii especially in media with larger grain size was more effectively removed than homogeneous fe ii oxidation prior to filtration simulated by fe iii addition in the feed water fig 5 depicts the decrease of dissolved as in the filtrate as a result of fe ii and fe iii additions this decrease was calculated by using the dissolved as values asref as asref 100 as a result of adding 0 3 mg l fe iii dissolved as was decreased by 28 38 40 and 46 for fine sand coarse sand anthracite and pumice respectively addition of 0 6 mg l fe iii resulted even in higher adsorption of dissolved as 28 57 65 and 74 also fine sand coarse sand anthracite and pumice respectively for fe ii dissolved as adsorption was lower 29 23 33 and 34 for fine sand coarse sand anthracite and pumice respectively when adding 0 3 mg l fe ii and 46 47 45 and 54 when adding 0 6 fe ii for all filter media except fine sand the addition of fe iii thus resulted in a larger decrease in dissolved as than the addition of fe ii confirming the hypothesis that more as is adsorbed in rapid filters when fe ii is oxidised prior to filtration or in the pore channels in addition the better retention of fe ii compared to fe iii resulted in more hfo accumulation during a filter run however this did not attribute to increased as removal calculating the as hfo ratio that was retained in the filter during the run time it was found that with both the fe ii and fe iii additions the as fe ratio in the filter bed increased with the filter media size fine sand course sand anthracite pumice indicating that the filter media that retained the least amount of hfo most effectively adsorbed as the data suggest that application of a dual layer filter with coarse media in the top to effectively adsorb as to hfo and fine media in the bottom to retain the as hfo flocs would result in maximum as removal possible explanations for the lower effectivity of reducing the dissolved as concentrations by fe ii compared to fe iii are 1 fe ii oxidises partly on the grain surface and is removed rapidly in the top layer of the filter bed mettler et al 2009 tamura et al 1976 vries et al 2017 preventing it to reach deeper layers for as v adsorption sharma et al 2001 van beek et al 2015 and or 2 heterogeneous oxidation results in less available sites for surface complexation lowering the adsorption capacity of the hfo comparable to hfo formed through fe ii oxidation by mno2 gude et al 2017 and or 3 that the fe minerals form a mineral layer on top of as oxidizing biofilm or taking available surface hindering as iii oxidation 3 4 influence of filtration velocity on as removal increasing the filtration velocity can be an alternative method to force hfo deeper into the filter bed as it among other mechanisms increases the hydraulic shear forces within the pore channels on the other hand biological as iii oxidation may occur deeper in the filter bed as well fig 6 depicts the total fe and dissolved as concentration in the filtrate of the fine sand coarse sand anthracite and pumice columns at 1 m h and 4 m h there were basically no changes in fe concentrations in the filtrate of the fine and coarse sand filters when increasing the filtration velocity from 1 m h to 4 m h only in the anthracite and pumice columns an increase of 10 μg l fe was observed in the filtrate and instead of improving the as removal the concentration in the filtrate went up modestly however with 5 1 6 and 4 for fine sand coarse sand anthracite and pumice respectively these results show that by increasing filtration velocity as adsorption to hfo is slightly decreased however the removal was not significantly reduced in the columns with increased filtration velocity t test p 0 05 it seems that the strictly surface related biological as iii oxidation was differently affected by increased filtration velocity than hfo formation together this resulted in a negative effect on as removal which is in line with the finding that fe ii oxidation prior to filtration is beneficial for as removal fig 5 at increased filter loading the residence time in the supernatant level is shortened which should result in increased fe ii in the filter bed and a subsequent negative effect on as removal additionally the increased filtration velocity resulted in a factor 4 higher reynold numbers e g pumice from 1 2 to 4 7 tchobanoglous et al 2003 more turbulence within the hydraulic pore channels may have accelerated the transport of fe ii to the grain surface and increased the chance for heterogeneous oxidation at the grain surface in addition the surface related mineral formation may have competed with biological as iii oxidation for the available surface this surface limitation hypothesis is for example building on observations by lee et al 2014 where increased loading of nh4 on a rapid sand filter did not result in additional oxidation of nh4 the complexity and number of processes involved make it difficult to draw a general conclusion on the observations shown in fig 6 however it is clear that simply increasing the filtration velocity to bring hfo deeper into the filter bed will increase as removal is not true 3 5 influence of ph on as removal lowering the ph decreases the rate of fe ii oxidation both homogeneous stumm and lee 1961 and heterogeneous tamura et al 1976 and could potentially cause fe to penetrate deeper in the filter bed additionally hfo has a higher adsorption capacity for as v at lower ph dixit and hering 2003 dzombak and morel 1990 gude et al 2016 suggesting that as v adsorption can be increased at lower ph values after as iii is oxidised influence of ph was investigated at a ph range of 7 4 8 0 which is not an uncommon ph for groundwater treatment the dissolved as concentration in the filtrate as a function of ph for the investigated filter media is depicted in fig 7 the results show that in the investigated ph range the dissolved as in the filtrate decreased as the ph decreased for all filter media dissolved as concentrations decreased from 2 40 to 2 60 μg l at ph 8 0 to 1 50 1 65 μg l at ph 7 4 respectively this corresponds to a decrease in dissolved as of 15 55 the exceptional as removal performance by pumice at the measurement intervals ph 7 7 was probably caused by a greater pool of retained hfo in the filter bed from previous runs which provided temporarily additional sorption sites while lowering the ph analogue to observations in gude et al 2016 where hfo showed increased sorption capacity at lower ph fig 8 depicts the corresponding fe removal percentage in the fine sand coarse sand anthracite and pumice for ph 7 4 and 8 0 anthracite and pumice the coarsest filter media showed improved fe removal from 91 to 88 at ph 8 93 92 at ph 7 4 respectively while for the fine and coarse sand filters fe removal efficiency dropped from about 97 to 94 given that floc filtration is not so effective while using large grain sizes the increased removal can perhaps be explained by a switch to adsorptive removal which was also observed by sharma et al 2001 in itself this shift to surface related heterogeneous oxidation was observed not be beneficiary for as removal as observed in the prior experiments with fe ii additions however when reducing the ph also heterogeneous fe oxidation rate is reduced jones et al 2014 tamura et al 1980 additionally substantial increase in adsorption capacity of hfo for as v was found at lower ph dixit and hering 2003 gude et al 2016 mercer and tobiason 2008 qiao et al 2012 hence hfo formation may have occurred deeper in the filter bed where biological as iii oxidation was complete and the adsorption capacity would have been increased due to favourable charge conditions 4 conclusions the research aimed at promoting as removal by understanding its interaction with fe ii and hfo in the filter bed for this purpose the effect of filter media size ph fe ii and fe iii additions and filtration velocity were investigated in natural groundwater filter columns based on the presented research it may be concluded that biological as iii oxidation developed in filter columns independent of the applied filter media fine sand coarse sand anthracite or pumice with a slightly faster ripening for media with a finer grain size or larger internal porosity pumice after ripening enhanced as removal was achieved with a layer of coarser media or by dosing additional fe iii promoting hfo flocs to penetrate deeper into the bed which was observed by higher fe concentrations in the filtrate apparently fe ii oxidation prior to rapid filtration is beneficial to as iii removal this was confirmed by increasing the flow rate from 1 to 4 m h where as removal was not improved although hfo flocs were pushed deeper in the filter bed lowering the ph in the range of 7 4 8 0 resulted in a positive effect on as removal possibly due to slowing the fe removal rate and the advantageous adsorption capacity of hfo at lower ph altogether it is concluded that as removal in biologically active rapid sand filters can be improved by applying coarser filter media in the top of the filter bed in combination with dosing of fe iii and or ph

19256,remediating uranium contamination becomes a worldwide interest because of increasing uranium release from mining activities due to ubiquitous presence of pyrite and the application of iron based technology colloidal iron oxy hydroxides such as akaganéite colloid akc extensively exist in uranium polluted water at uranium tailing sites in this context we studied individual and co transport of u vi and akc in water saturated sand columns at 50 mg l akc and environmentally relevant u vi concentrations 5 0 10 7 5 0 10 5 m it was found that in addition to the impact of ph and ionic strength whether akc facilitated u vi transport depended on u vi concentration as well the presence of akc facilitated u vi transport at relatively low u vi concentration 5 0 10 7 5 0 10 6 m which was due to the strong adsorption of u vi on akc and faster transport of akc than that u vi as observed in their individual transport experiments at relatively high u vi concentrations 5 0 10 5 m however akc impeded u vi transport because u vi of high concentration decreased akc colloidal stability and increased akc aggregation and attachment thus u vi and akc co transport was even blocked completely at relatively high ph and ionic strength the mechanisms behind the co transport of u vi and akc were also confirmed by assessing the evolutions of aqueous ph and akc zeta potential and particle size distribution in the column effluents a two site non equilibrium model and a two site kinetic attachment detachment model well described the breakthrough curves of u vi and akc respectively knowledge generated from this study provides a thorough understanding of uranium transport in the absence presence of akc and brings new insights into the influence of contaminant concentration on co transport

u vi laboratory studies on u vi individual transport in packed columns have been documented uyusur et al 2015 it was found that whether in quartz or in sediment packed columns u vi transport was governed by adsorption desorption and u vi speciation which were sensitive to pore water ph and ionic strength cheng et al 2007 qafoku et al 2005 uyusur et al 2015 however one of the key factors i e u

could vary spatially and temporally from 10 8 to 10 4 m depending on the groundwater flow and liquid effluent process iaea 2004 similar to other cationic type contaminant u vi transport is also

transport of cesium iodine and plutonium lin et al 2014 satmark et al 1996 whereas their influence on u vi transport is rarely studied the aim of the present work was to bring greater details on the co transport of uranium and colloidal iron oxy hydroxides and to investigate their mutual effects under different chemical conditions sand packed column was used to mimic environmental porous medium and akc was selected as a representative of ferric colloid individual and co transport of u vi and akc was performed under environmentally relevant u vi concentration ph and ionic strength conditions the evolutions of ph zeta potential and particle size of akc in column effluents of co transport system were assessed to highlight the processes controlling u vi and akc co transport a two site non equilibrium model and a two site kinetic attachment model were applied to quantitatively describe the breakthrough curves btcs of u vi and akc colloids respectively the results of this study provide thorough insights into understanding and predicting the uranium transport process and have a significant implication on the elimination of drinking water supply contamination around uranium tailing sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of akaganéite colloids akc the synthesis of akc was performed according to schwertmann and cornell 2007 with some modifications briefly 3 ml saturated ferric chloride solution 3 4 m was added into 1 l boiling milli q water 18 mω cm with stirring for 10 min the obtained suspension was dialyzed using 3 5 kda membrane against milli q water until the electrical conductivity of the suspension was close to that of milli q water and was then stored at 4 c as stock suspension for later use the mass concentration of the akc stock suspension 300 mg l was obtained by freeze drying and weighing x ray diffraction xrd characterization of freeze dried akc see fig s1 in supplementary materials indicated that akc had a low crystallization particle size and zeta potential ζ of akc were analyzed by dynamic light scattering and laser doppler electrophoresis respectively both of which were embedded in the zetasizer nano zs malvern uk the particle size distribution of akc ranged between 25 and 300 nm fig s2 the phiep ph of isoelectric point was determined to be at ph 7 9 fig s3 consistent with the reported value 8 0 kosmulski 2009 2 2 influents for individual and co transport of u vi and akc all chemicals used were of analytical grade solutions were prepared using degassed milli q water the stock solution 3 0 10 2 m of u vi was made from uo2 no3 2 6h2o the ph of influent for column transport experiments described below was adjusted using hcl or naoh solution the experimental conditions for u vi individual transport were listed in table s1 the ionic strength and ph of influents as well as the corresponding properties of quartz sand and akc for individual transport experiments were summarized in table s2 the initial akc concentration was maintained constant at 50 mg l in all transport experiments for co transport experiments u vi was added into akc suspension and the mixture was shaken for at ambient temperature for 24 h before injection the mixture was used as influent for co transport experiments the conditions of influents as well as the corresponding properties of akc for co transport experiments were listed in table s3 during transport experiments the influents were stirred to ensure a consistent dispersion and avoid reduce the influence of colloid aggregation to assess the stability of the influents the properties of some representative suspension were checked from time to time and the results were shown in table s4 and fig s4 2 3 porous media and column transport experiments quartz sands tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china were used as model granular porous media the principal component of the sands was silicon dioxide 99 0 with a particle size obtained by 20 40 mesh sieves the sand was pre treated using a sequential acid base and milli q water washing procedures liao et al 2017 to remove impurities the schematic of experimental setup for column transport experiments was shown in fig s5 the cleaned sand was wet packed into a column to ensure that no air was trapped the parameters of the packed column were listed in table 1 the transport experiment was performed following a three step procedure in the first step pre equilibration the column was conditioned and pre equilibrated by injecting background electrolyte solution at desired ionic strength and ph for several pore volumes pvs in the second step breakthrough the influent of u vi akc was pumped into the packed column in an upward mode at an injection rate of 0 373 ml min in the final step elution the column was eluted with several pvs of akc u vi free background electrolyte solutions at the same ionic strength and ph as the injected influent of u vi akc the elution step was not stopped until the concentrations of u vi akc were monitored to be 0 column effluents were collected with a fraction collector at a regular time interval some effluents were sampled to determine the evolutions of akc zeta potential and colloid size column apparatus and all associated accessories were repeatedly cleaned between experiments by pumping several pvs of a strong acid 2 m hcl followed by elution with several pvs of background electrolyte solution to ensure that the physicochemical conditions were uniform among different experimental treatments elimelech et al 2000 2 4 batch experiments to better understand individual and co transport of u vi and akc u vi adsorption on akc and quartz sand was carried out at ambient temperature respectively the solid to liquid ratios were kept identical to those in column transport experiments i e 50 mg l for akc and m v 1500 g l for quartz sand other experimental conditions were listed in table s3 solid and liquid phases were separated by centrifugation 18000 g 1 h after reaching the adsorption equilibrium 24 h the separated supernatants were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane before u vi concentration determination u vi adsorption on akc and sand was calculated from the difference between initial and final concentrations in aqueous phase the surface morphologies of solid akaganéite quartz sand in the absence and presence of akc after u vi adsorption were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx jsm 6701f jeol japan both images and edx spectra were shown in fig 1 specific surface area n2 b e t of the quartz sand was measured to be 0 163 m2 g 2 5 concentration analyses for akc and u vi since akc concentration was directly proportional to fe content in akc suspension we determined the akc concentration by measuring fe content in the suspension in brief akc suspension was digested in 0 5 m hcl solution for 24 h and the fe content was then analyzed by using 1 10 phenanthroline method at a wavelength of 510 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer v 1800 mapada china liao et al 2017 details on the method were given in supplementary materials s1 for batch and column transport experiments at initial u vi concentrations higher than 5 0 10 5 m the final u vi concentration in aqueous phase was determined using arsenazo iii at 652 nm via a uv vis spectrophotometer for the experiments at initial u vi concentrations less than 5 0 10 5 m a trace uranium analyzer wgj iii hangzhou daji photoelectric instrument co ltd china using fluorescence enhancement agents was used 2 6 transport models u vi transport was simulated using a modified form of convection dispersion equation cde with two site non equilibrium sorption kinetics mehta et al 2015 toride et al 1999 it was assumed that adsorption on type 1 site reached equilibrium instantaneously whereas adsorption on type 2 site was rate limited and followed first order kinetics an elaborated description of the mathematical model including governing equations was given in supplementary materials s2 the retardation factor r f the fraction of instantaneous retardation β and the dimensionless mass transfer coefficient ω were estimated parameters in the model a one dimensional form of cde with two site kinetic attachment detachment model was used to simulate akc transport simunek et al 1997 wang et al 2011 in this model the retention on the first kinetic site s 1 was assumed to be reversible and time dependent which could be described using first order attachment k 1 and detachment rate coefficients k 1d the retention on the second kinetic site s 2 was assumed to be irreversible and could be described by a first order attachment rate coefficient k 2 and a langmuirian type blocking function that accounted for the maximum colloid retention capacity of irreversible binding sites s max2 details on the mathematical model including operative equations were given in supplementary materials s3 3 results and discussion in this study breakthrough curves btcs were expressed as relative concentration c c0 versus pore volume pv where c and c0 were concentrations of u vi or akc in the effluents and influents respectively please note that the c c0 of both akc and u vi in co transport experiments was detected simultaneously in the same outflow bromide nabr was used as a conservative tracer to determine longitudinal dispersion coefficient d in column transport experiments btcs of br exhibited a high degree of symmetry fig s6 the corresponding parameters were given in table s5 three representative retention profiles rps for individual transport of akc and u vi and co transport of akc in the presence of u vi were measured see supplementary materials s4 for experimental details as expected a linear rp occurred for individual u vi transport from dissection experiments whereas exponential and hyper exponential rps occurred for individual akc transport and co transport of akc in the presence of u vi respectively fig s7 in addition the mass recoveries were found to be close to 100 table s6 3 1 effect of u vi concentration on co transport many in situ and laboratory studies indicated that colloids can facilitate actinide transport in the environment sen and khilar 2006 zaenker and hennig 2014 such colloid facilitated transport originates from the fact that actinide is adsorbed onto colloids and thus it should be affected by the factors that control adsorption process e g ph i and actinide concentration however the concentration effect on the co transport of heavy metals and colloids has not been well investigated yet to clarify the effect of u vi concentration on co transport and to address the question whether akc always facilitates u vi transport we compared u vi individual transport and the co transport of u vi with akc as a function of u vi concentration at ph 5 6 and ionic strength 4 2 10 5 m the conditions of influent were selected to ensure a relatively stable akc system during co transport 3 1 1 individual transport of u vi as shown in fig 2 btcs of u vi individual transport at varying u vi concentrations 5 0 10 5 5 0 10 6 and 5 0 10 7 m exhibited significant differences with the decrease of u vi concentration u vi retardation on sand grains became more pronounced and the btcs of u vi were featured by longer tailings these observations can be explained by u vi adsorption reactions on available surface sites of the sand guo et al 2009 at higher u vi concentration the limited adsorption sites in the column were saturated by less pvs of u vi influent resulting in an earlier u vi breakthrough and a more rapid and steep increase in c c0 value if one assumed that before the total surface sites were saturated all u vi was adsorbed with the passage of influent the position of pore volumes at which c c0 began to increase could be estimated by the site capacity in the packed column and u vi concentration in the influent by fitting u vi adsorption isotherm on the sand using langmuir equation fig s8 total adsorption sites on the sand 56 g i e the site capacity in the packed column was estimated to be 5 88 10 7 mol 1 05 10 8 mol g 56 g the details of langmuir parameters were shown table s7 based on the estimation above about 5 0 pvs of influent at u vi concentration of 5 0 10 6 m and about 11 pvs of influent at u vi concentration of 5 0 10 7 m were needed for u vi breakthrough respectively as seen in fig 2 the estimations were consistent with the observations where c c0 began to increase at 5 and 11 pvs respectively this clearly demonstrates that adsorption controlled u vi transport behaviors in the sand column 3 1 2 co transport of u vi and akc the btcs of u vi and akc in co transport system at varying u vi concentrations were shown in fig 3 in their individual transport experiments akc 50 mg l moved faster than u vi at relatively low concentrations 5 0 10 6 and 5 0 10 7 m whereas it moved much slower than u vi at relatively high concentration of u vi 5 0 10 5 m in co transport systems however c c0 for both u vi and akc increased almost simultaneously under the experimental conditions furthermore the strong tailing observed in u vi individual transport especially at the low u vi concentration of 5 0 10 7 m vanished in the co transport systems on the other hand comparing with akc individual transport the presence of u vi at 5 0 10 5 and 5 0 10 6 m had a slight transport impeding effect on akc transport especially in the rising limb of btcs in summary akc only facilitated u vi transport at relatively low u vi concentrations 5 0 10 6 and 5 0 10 7 m fig 3b and c but impeded to some extent u vi transport at relatively high u vi concentration 5 0 10 5 m fig 3a the effect of u vi on akc transport also depended on u vi concentration the facilitating effect of akc suggests that most u vi transported with akc at relatively low u vi concentrations fig 3b and c this is consistent with the strong adsorption of u vi on akc observed in batch adsorption studies where the adsorption distribution coefficient k d of u vi on akc was several orders of magnitude higher than that on quartz sand table s8 most of u vi was adsorbed on akc at relatively low u vi concentrations 5 0 10 7 and 5 0 10 6 m table s9 the strong adsorption of u vi on akc was also evidenced by sem edx analysis as shown in fig 1 u vi presented higher affinity towards akc than quartz thereby u vi was dominantly associated with akc particles in the co transport system 3 2 effects of ionic strength and ph on the co transport of u vi and akc 3 2 1 individual transport systems to fully understand the influences of ionic strength and ph on the co transport of akc and u vi the btcs of individual u vi and akc transport at varying ionic strengths 4 2 10 5 4 2 10 4 and 4 2 10 3 m nacl and ph values 5 5 6 1 and 6 6 were collected respectively fig 4 and fig 5 in general the mobility of u vi was far less sensitive than that of akc to the changes in ph and ionic strength the btcs of u vi moved slightly from left to right with increasing ph fig 4a whereas ionic strength had no discernible effect under the experimental conditions fig 4b the delayed breakthrough of u vi at higher ph fig 4a can be interpreted by the increase of u vi adsorption on the sand with increasing ph from 5 6 to 6 6 the zeta potential of the sand became more negatively charged table s2 indicating that electrostatic interaction between negatively charged sand grains and positively charged u vi species was strengthened this eventually improved u vi adsorption retention fig s9 and table s9 the discernible effect of ionic strength was due to the formation of inner sphere surface complexes of u vi on quartz guo et al 2009 which was not affected by ionic strength for akc individual transport fig 5 interestingly the btcs in the elution phase overlapped and the shape of overall btcs was asymmetric akc breakthrough was obviously retarded with increasing ionic strength and ph which was closely related to the changes in akc particle size and electrostatic interaction between akc and sand grains which will be discussed in section 3 3 1 below colloid filtration theory was used to characterize the transport and retention propensities of akc liao et al 2017 wang et al 2017 yao et al 1971 the critical parameters i e the single collector contact efficiency η0 the attachment efficiency α the deposition rate coefficient k d the rate of akc deposited onto the sand surfaces and the maximum travel distance lmax the transport distance with retention of above 99 9 of colloids were calculated according to the experimental conditions see table s10 and supplementary materials s5 it was found that η0 increased with increasing ph and ionic strength implying a decrease of akc mobility in addition lmax was much higher than the length of the column consistent with experimental observation that most akc did not retain in the column 3 2 2 co transport systems the co transport of u vi and akc was investigated as a function of ph and ionic strength respectively fig 6 and fig 7 the effect of ionic strength was investigated at ph 5 6 and the effect of ph was studied at ionic strength 4 2 10 5 m at relatively lower ionic strength 4 2 10 5 4 2 10 4 m u vi transport was delayed by akc to some extent and the value of c c0 for both u vi and akc increased at almost the same pv indicating that u vi transported in the column together with akc fig 6a and b at relatively high ionic strength 4 2 10 3 m however the breakthrough patterns of u vi and akc became quite different fig 6c the maximum c c0 value for u vi decreased sharply to 32 and akc was completely blocked no breakthrough at the same time with respect to akc transport the comparison of btcs in fig 6 and those in fig 5 demonstrated that the presence of u vi caused akc transport to be more sensitive to the changes in ionic strength which in turn affected u vi transport due to strong adsorption of u vi on akc moreover the presence of u vi also made akc transport to be more sensitive to the changes in ph fig 7 when ph increased to 6 1 and 6 6 at ionic strength 4 2 10 5 m akc was also completely blocked in the column the c c0 value of u vi was 24 at ph 6 1 and the value was decreased to 10 at ph 6 6 in addition it was noteworthy that the breakthrough of u vi was obviously delayed at higher ph i e 1 5 pv at ph 6 1 and 2 1 pv at 6 6 fig 7b and c the calculation results by colloid filtration theory indicated that the presence of u vi resulted in higher η0 higher α attachment efficiency and shorter lmax in comparison with those for individual akc transport system see table s10 implying that the presence of u vi inhibited akc mobility the effects of ph and ionic strength on the co transport of u vi and akc should be closely related to the evolutions of zeta potential and particle size of akc during co transport which will be discussed in next section 3 3 evolutions of effluent ph akc particle size and zeta potential it has been reported that the stability of colloids depends largely on ionic strength and ph wang et al 2016 however whether adsorbed u vi affects the stability of colloids has seldom been studied in addition to the btcs of colloids the variations in effluent ph akc particle size and zeta potential can provide new insight into the mechanisms controlling the in column processes of akc and u vi thus some representative effluents corresponding to the data in figs 3 5 7 were collected and analyzed 3 3 1 akc individual transport system fig 8 presents the evolutions of ph akc zeta potential and particle size in effluents obtained from akc individual transport at three ionic strengths overall the higher the influent ionic strengths were the higher the ph fig 8a the lower the zeta potential fig 8b and the larger the particle size of akc fig 8c were observed in effluents although the column was conditioned pre equilibrated with nacl solution at the identical ph and ionic strength as those of influent the ph of effluents was generally increased comparing with influent ph fig 8a indicating that physicochemical interactions occurred between akc and sand surfaces during transport processes notably under the experimental conditions akc and sand grain exhibited opposite surface charges see table s2 and thus akc retention on sand surfaces could be expected to be favorable because of electrostatic attraction fang et al 2013 the favorable akc retention might alter surface charge distribution of sand by partial charge neutralization the increase in effluent ph can be interpreted by the release of hydroxyl anions oh most probably through ligand exchange reactions however upon continuous injection of influent which is more acidic influent than initial effluent the ph of the effluents decreased gradually due to neutralization reactions between the released hydroxyl anions and protons from influent therefore the ph evolutions could be ascribed to the progress of hydroxyl anion releasing reactions combined with the neutralization reactions besides when ionic strength increased the ligand exchange reactions may be put forward because of increasing masking effect of background electrolyte resulted in a higher effluent ph at higher ionic strength fig 8a zeta potential of colloids usually varies with ph due to protonation and deprotonation reactions on surface hydroxyl groups the phiep of akc was found to be 7 9 and the zeta potential decreased as ph was increased fig s3 suggesting that akc surface potential as well as repulsive forces between akc particles reduced with ph shifted closer to the phiep bradford et al 2007 thereby akc was prone to aggregate when ph of akc suspension was increased from ph 5 6 to 6 6 i e being closer to akc phiep as evidenced by larger particle size of akc at ph 6 6 see table s2 on the other hand the electrostatic double layer thickness of colloids usually shrinks with increasing ionic strength the compression of electrostatic double layer thickness made the aggregation tendency of akc easier yielding larger akc sizes in the effluents at higher ionic strength see table s2 therefore variations in ph and ionic strength contributed spontaneously to the evolutions of effluent ph akc zeta potential and particle size during transport fig s10 additionally size exclusion effect might also contribute to the larger particle size in effluent especially at relatively earlier breakthrough time sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 bradford et al 2003 3 3 2 co transport systems fig 9 a shows the evolutions of effluent ph and akc zeta potential and particle size in co transport experiments in general the profiles of the variations in ph and akc zeta potential and particle size showed similar trends to those observed in akc individual transport experiments fig 8 except the one that akc was completely retained at i 4 2 10 3 m fig 9b shows the evolutions of effluent ph and akc zeta potential and particle size at different u vi concentrations it is obvious that u vi concentration had a significant influence effluent ph and akc zeta potential and particle size increased as influent u vi concentration increased the strong adsorption of u vi on akc changed to some extent the dependence of akc zeta potential on ph fig s3 the phiep of akc in the presence of 5 0 10 5 m u vi was 6 3 significantly lower than that phiep 7 9 in the absence of u vi consequently the repulsion forces between akc particles decreased which favored akc aggregation as evidenced by the larger size in the presence of u vi see table s2 the ionic strength effect in the presence of u vi could be interpreted in a similar way as that in the absence of u vi i e akc size increased with increasing ionic strength which was due to the double layer compression because the size of akc in the presence of u vi was systematically larger than that in the absence of u vi and the corresponding zeta potential was closer to phiep of the colloids the transport of akc in the presence of u vi was less favorable this could explain the changes in akc transport behavior in the absence fig 5 and presence figs 3 6 and 7 of u vi 3 4 transport modelling 3 4 1 estimation of btcs plateaus for u vi in co transport systems the plateaus of btcs for u vi transport without akc were controlled by u vi adsorption on the sand but the situation became more complicated in the co transport systems in the presence of akc other processes such as u vi adsorption on akc and akc retardation in the column occurred high plateau values of btcs in co transport system were only observed under conditions at relatively low u vi concentrations low ionic strength and low ph values in such cases most u vi adsorbed on akc and co transported with akc which remained small particle size and relatively high zeta potential at relatively high u vi concentrations however the k d of u vi on akc decreased meanwhile akc transport was impeded especially at relatively high ionic strength and high ph close to the phiep of akc under these conditions akc mobility was significantly retarded in the column but only a part of u vi adsorbed on akc and transported with akc thereby the plateau of btcs for u vi at relatively high u vi concentrations was relatively low the plateaus of btcs for u vi in co transport systems can be estimated from the maximum c c0 values of akc and the adsorption percentages of u vi on the sand and akc see table s7 for details generally the estimation was in good agreement with the observed data in figs 3 6 and 7 suggesting that btcs of u vi in the co transport system were primarily determined by u vi adsorption and akc transport 3 4 2 u vi transport modelling a two site non equilibrium model was used to describe the btcs of individual u vi transport the fitted btcs were presented as lines with measured btcs in figs 2 and 4 the corresponding fitted parameters were given in table 2 fitted retardation factor r f was an applicable tool for evaluating the mobility of u vi in sand packed column the higher r f the weaker ion mobility i e the stronger ion retention was observed experimentally for instance at ph 5 6 r f for br was 1 whereas for u vi r f was 2 09 because of u vi adsorption r f for u vi was greatly increased with the increase of ph and the decrease of u vi concentration by using the fitted r f values we can easily calculate the corresponding k d values using eq s2 see details in s2 the calculated k d from column experiments was slightly dissimilar to the measured k d from batch experiments table s6 this is reasonable because k d from batch experiments represented adsorption at equilibrium while calculated k d was based on non equilibrium adsorption during transport cheng et al 2007 li et al 2011 the parameter β represented the fraction of instantaneous retardation and the value of β decreased with increasing u vi retardation one possible explanation was that u vi adsorption retardation was dominated by type 2 adsorption sites which was assumed to be kinetic dependent li et al 2011 florido et al 2010 3 4 3 akc transport modelling akc transport in both individual and co transport systems was simulated by using a two site kinetic attachment detachment model model fitted first order attachment rate coefficients k 1 k 2 and first order detachment rate coefficients k 1d were used to reflect akc attachment and detachment on the sand surface respectively s max2 was defined as maximum solid phase retention capacity of site 2 the fitted parameters for the btcs of akc in figs 3 5 and 6 were summarized in table 3 in general the values of k 1d were lower than that of k 1 indicating a slow akc release kinetics this can be attributed to the overwhelming presence of favorable surfaces negative charge i e favorable attachment condition for akc positive charge attachment wang et al 2014a moreover the values of k 2 were several orders of magnitude higher than the values of k 1d and k 1 implying that akc attachment was dominated by irreversible attachment on site 2 with increased ionic strength ph and u vi concentration k 2 generally decreased whereas k 1 k 1d and s max2 increased the increase of s max2 was consistent with unfavorable transport of akc under these conditions where akc were prone to aggregate and consequently to retain on sand surfaces the variations in k 1 k 1d and k 2 indicated that the sticking kinetics was also varied with chemical conditions of the influent overall the model fitted parameters and high pearson s correlation coefficient r2 0 92 between observed and fitted data reflected that the two site kinetic attachment detachment model captured the main features of akc transport in the presence of u vi 4 conclusions in this study we systematically investigated the effects of u vi concentration ph and ionic strength on the co transport of u vi and akaganéite colloid akc in water saturated sand column comparatively studied individual and co transport behaviors of u vi and akc and assessed the evolutions of effluent ph and akc zeta potential and particle size in the column effluents based on the results we come to the following conclusions first whether akc facilitates u vi transport depends on not only ph and ionic strength but also u vi concentration facilitated u vi transport by akc only occurs at relatively low u vi concentrations at relatively high u vi concentration on the contrary akc always inhibits u vi transport second with regard to zeta potential and particle size of akc the adsorbed u vi renders akc to be more prone to aggregate and more sensitive to the changes in ph and ionic strength especially at relatively high u vi concentrations in general the presence of u vi increases akc size and impedes akc transport third the evolutions of effluent ph zeta potential and colloid size are of significance concerning the processes controlling the co transport the evolution of akc size in effluents can be interpreted by variations in zeta potential and ionic strength as well as size exclusion effect of colloids the evolution of zeta potential in effluents is mainly due to ph variation which could be interpreted by ligand exchange reactions between akc and the surfaces of the sand as well as subsequent acid base neutralization reactions in the mobile phase finally the plateaus of btcs of u vi in co transport system can be estimated by considering the maximum c c0 values of akc and u vi adsorption on both akc and sand the transport of u vi and akc can be reasonably described by a two site non equilibrium model and a two site kinetic attachment detachment model respectively acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 11675070 u1730245 and the natural science

19256,remediating uranium contamination becomes a worldwide interest because of increasing uranium release from mining activities due to ubiquitous presence of pyrite and the application of iron based technology colloidal iron oxy hydroxides such as akaganéite colloid akc extensively exist in uranium polluted water at uranium tailing sites in this context we studied individual and co transport of u vi and akc in water saturated sand columns at 50 mg l akc and environmentally relevant u vi concentrations 5 0 10 7 5 0 10 5 m it was found that in addition to the impact of ph and ionic strength whether akc facilitated u vi transport depended on u vi concentration as well the presence of akc facilitated u vi transport at relatively low u vi concentration 5 0 10 7 5 0 10 6 m which was due to the strong adsorption of u vi on akc and faster transport of akc than that u vi as observed in their individual transport experiments at relatively high u vi concentrations 5 0 10 5 m however akc impeded u vi transport because u vi of high concentration decreased akc colloidal stability and increased akc aggregation and attachment thus u vi and akc co transport was even blocked completely at relatively high ph and ionic strength the mechanisms behind the co transport of u vi and akc were also confirmed by assessing the evolutions of aqueous ph and akc zeta potential and particle size distribution in the column effluents a two site non equilibrium model and a two site kinetic attachment detachment model well described the breakthrough curves of u vi and akc respectively knowledge generated from this study provides a thorough understanding of uranium transport in the absence presence of akc and brings new insights into the influence of contaminant concentration on co transport

u vi laboratory studies on u vi individual transport in packed columns have been documented uyusur et al 2015 it was found that whether in quartz or in sediment packed columns u vi transport was governed by adsorption desorption and u vi speciation which were sensitive to pore water ph and ionic strength cheng et al 2007 qafoku et al 2005 uyusur et al 2015 however one of the key factors i e u vi concentration has been largely overlooked kohler et al 2004 according to environment monitoring results of water systems from different uranium populated areas the concentration of released u vi could vary spatially and temporally from 10 8 to 10 4 m depending on the groundwater flow and liquid effluent process iaea 2004 similar to other cationic type contaminant u vi transport is also affected by mobile colloids in the environment for example humic acid colloids can accelerate u iv vi transport in a quartz sand system mibus et al 2007 similar results were reported by wang et al 2014b who studied u vi transport in water saturated porous media in the presence of humic acid illite colloids the colloid facilitated transport effect is usually attributed to contaminant adsorption on colloid surfaces and the colloids acting as vehicles carriers of contaminants kersting 2012 crancon et al 2010 sen and khilar 2006 however far less effort has been devoted to unravel the

transport of cesium iodine and plutonium lin et al 2014 satmark et al 1996 whereas their influence on u vi transport is rarely studied the aim of the present work was to bring greater details on the co transport of uranium and colloidal iron oxy hydroxides and to investigate their mutual effects under different chemical conditions sand packed column was used to mimic environmental porous medium and akc was selected as a representative of ferric colloid individual and co transport of u vi and akc was performed under environmentally relevant u vi concentration ph and ionic strength conditions the evolutions of ph zeta potential and particle size of akc in column effluents of co transport system were assessed to highlight the processes controlling u vi and akc co transport a two site non equilibrium model and a two site kinetic attachment model were applied to quantitatively describe the breakthrough curves btcs of u vi and akc colloids respectively the results of this study provide thorough insights into understanding and predicting the uranium transport process and have a significant implication on the elimination of drinking water supply contamination around uranium tailing sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of akaganéite colloids akc the synthesis of akc was performed according to schwertmann and cornell 2007 with some modifications briefly 3 ml saturated ferric chloride solution 3 4 m was added into 1 l boiling milli q water 18 mω cm with stirring for 10 min the obtained suspension was dialyzed using 3 5 kda membrane against milli q water until the electrical conductivity of the suspension was close to that of milli q water and was then stored at 4 c as stock suspension for later use the mass concentration of the akc stock suspension 300 mg l was obtained by freeze drying and weighing x ray diffraction xrd characterization of freeze dried akc see fig s1 in supplementary materials indicated that akc had a low crystallization particle size and zeta potential ζ of akc were analyzed by dynamic light scattering and laser doppler electrophoresis respectively both of which were embedded in the zetasizer nano zs malvern uk the particle size distribution of akc ranged between 25 and 300 nm fig s2 the phiep ph of isoelectric point was determined to be at ph 7 9 fig s3 consistent with the reported value 8 0 kosmulski 2009 2 2 influents for individual and co transport of u vi and akc all chemicals used were of analytical grade solutions were prepared using degassed milli q water the stock solution 3 0 10 2 m of u vi was made from uo2 no3 2 6h2o the ph of influent for column transport experiments described below was adjusted using hcl or naoh solution the experimental conditions for u vi individual transport were listed in table s1 the ionic strength and ph of influents as well as the corresponding properties of quartz sand and akc for individual transport experiments were summarized in table s2 the initial akc concentration was maintained constant at 50 mg l in all transport experiments for co transport experiments u vi was added into akc suspension and the mixture was shaken for at ambient temperature for 24 h before injection the mixture was used as influent for co transport experiments the conditions of influents as well as the corresponding properties of akc for co transport experiments were listed in table s3 during transport experiments the influents were stirred to ensure a consistent dispersion and avoid reduce the influence of colloid aggregation to assess the stability of the influents the properties of some representative suspension were checked from time to time and the results were shown in table s4 and fig s4 2 3 porous media and column transport experiments quartz sands tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china were used as model granular porous media the principal component of the sands was silicon dioxide 99 0 with a particle size obtained by 20 40 mesh sieves the sand was pre treated using a sequential acid base and milli q water washing procedures liao et al 2017 to remove impurities the schematic of experimental setup for column transport experiments was shown in fig s5 the cleaned sand was wet packed into a column to ensure that no air was trapped the parameters of the packed column were listed in table 1 the transport experiment was performed following a three step procedure in the first step pre equilibration the column was conditioned and pre equilibrated by injecting background electrolyte solution at desired ionic strength and ph for several pore volumes pvs in the second step breakthrough the influent of u vi akc was pumped into the packed column in an upward mode at an injection rate of 0 373 ml min in the final step elution the column was eluted with several pvs of akc u vi free background electrolyte solutions at the same ionic strength and ph as the injected influent of u vi akc the elution step was not stopped until the concentrations of u vi akc were monitored to be 0 column effluents were collected with a fraction collector at a regular time interval some effluents were sampled to determine the evolutions of akc zeta potential and colloid size column apparatus and all associated accessories were repeatedly cleaned between experiments by pumping several pvs of a strong acid 2 m hcl followed by elution with several pvs of background electrolyte solution to ensure that the physicochemical conditions were uniform among different experimental treatments elimelech et al 2000 2 4 batch experiments to better understand individual and co transport of u vi and akc u vi adsorption on akc and quartz sand was carried out at ambient temperature respectively the solid to liquid ratios were kept identical to those in column transport experiments i e 50 mg l for akc and m v 1500 g l for quartz sand other experimental conditions were listed in table s3 solid and liquid phases were separated by centrifugation 18000 g 1 h after reaching the adsorption equilibrium 24 h the separated supernatants were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane before u vi concentration determination u vi adsorption on akc and sand was calculated from the difference between initial and final concentrations in aqueous phase the surface morphologies of solid akaganéite quartz sand in the absence and presence of akc after u vi adsorption were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx jsm 6701f jeol japan both images and edx spectra were shown in fig 1 specific surface area n2 b e t of the quartz sand was measured to be 0 163 m2 g 2 5 concentration analyses for akc and u vi since akc concentration was directly proportional to fe content in akc suspension we determined the akc concentration by measuring fe content in the suspension in brief akc suspension was digested in 0 5 m hcl solution for 24 h and the fe content was then analyzed by using 1 10 phenanthroline method at a wavelength of 510 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer v 1800 mapada china liao et al 2017 details on the method were given in supplementary materials s1 for batch and column transport experiments at initial u vi concentrations higher than 5 0 10 5 m the final u vi concentration in aqueous phase was determined using arsenazo iii at 652 nm via a uv vis spectrophotometer for the experiments at initial u vi concentrations less than 5 0 10 5 m a trace uranium analyzer wgj iii hangzhou daji photoelectric instrument co ltd china using fluorescence enhancement agents was used 2 6 transport models u vi transport was simulated using a modified form of convection dispersion equation cde with two site non equilibrium sorption kinetics mehta et al 2015 toride et al 1999 it was assumed that adsorption on type 1 site reached equilibrium instantaneously whereas adsorption on type 2 site was rate limited and followed first order kinetics an elaborated description of the mathematical model including governing equations was given in supplementary materials s2 the retardation factor r f the fraction of instantaneous retardation β and the dimensionless mass transfer coefficient ω were estimated parameters in the model a one dimensional form of cde with two site kinetic attachment detachment model was used to simulate akc transport simunek et al 1997 wang et al 2011 in this model the retention on the first kinetic site s 1 was assumed to be reversible and time dependent which could be described using first order attachment k 1 and detachment rate coefficients k 1d the retention on the second kinetic site s 2 was assumed to be irreversible and could be described by a first order attachment rate coefficient k 2 and a langmuirian type blocking function that accounted for the maximum colloid retention capacity of irreversible binding sites s max2 details on the mathematical model including operative equations were given in supplementary materials s3 3 results and discussion in this study breakthrough curves btcs were expressed as relative concentration c c0 versus pore volume pv where c and c0 were concentrations of u vi or akc in the effluents and influents respectively please note that the c c0 of both akc and u vi in co transport experiments was detected simultaneously in the same outflow bromide nabr was used as a conservative tracer to determine longitudinal dispersion coefficient d in column transport experiments btcs of br exhibited a high degree of symmetry fig s6 the corresponding parameters were given in table s5 three representative retention profiles rps for individual transport of akc and u vi and co transport of akc in the presence of u vi were measured see supplementary materials s4 for experimental details as expected a linear rp occurred for individual u vi transport from dissection experiments whereas exponential and hyper exponential rps occurred for individual akc transport and co transport of akc in the presence of u vi respectively fig s7 in addition the mass recoveries were found to be close to 100 table s6 3 1 effect of u vi concentration on co transport many in situ and laboratory studies indicated that colloids can facilitate actinide transport in the environment sen and khilar 2006 zaenker and hennig 2014 such colloid facilitated transport originates from the fact that actinide is adsorbed onto colloids and thus it should be affected by the factors that control adsorption process e g ph i and actinide concentration however the concentration effect on the co transport of heavy metals and colloids has not been well investigated yet to clarify the effect of u vi concentration on co transport and to address the question whether akc always facilitates u vi transport we compared u vi individual transport and the co transport of u vi with akc as a function of u vi concentration at ph 5 6 and ionic strength 4 2 10 5 m the conditions of influent were selected to ensure a relatively stable akc system during co transport 3 1 1 individual transport of u vi as shown in fig 2 btcs of u vi individual transport at varying u vi concentrations 5 0 10 5 5 0 10 6 and 5 0 10 7 m exhibited significant differences with the decrease of u vi concentration u vi retardation on sand grains became more pronounced and the btcs of u vi were featured by longer tailings these observations can be explained by u vi adsorption reactions on available surface sites of the sand guo et al 2009 at higher u vi concentration the limited adsorption sites in the column were saturated by less pvs of u vi influent resulting in an earlier u vi breakthrough and a more rapid and steep increase in c c0 value if one assumed that before the total surface sites were saturated all u vi was adsorbed with the passage of influent the position of pore volumes at which c c0 began to increase could be estimated by the site capacity in the packed column and u vi concentration in the influent by fitting u vi adsorption isotherm on the sand using langmuir equation fig s8 total adsorption sites on the sand 56 g i e the site capacity in the packed column was estimated to be 5 88 10 7 mol 1 05 10 8 mol g 56 g the details of langmuir parameters were shown table s7 based on the estimation above about 5 0 pvs of influent at u vi concentration of 5 0 10 6 m and about 11 pvs of influent at u vi concentration of 5 0 10 7 m were needed for u vi breakthrough respectively as seen in fig 2 the estimations were consistent with the observations where c c0 began to increase at 5 and 11 pvs respectively this clearly demonstrates that adsorption controlled u vi transport behaviors in the sand column 3 1 2 co transport of u vi and akc the btcs of u vi and akc in co transport system at varying u vi concentrations were shown in fig 3 in their individual transport experiments akc 50 mg l moved faster than u vi at relatively low concentrations 5 0 10 6 and 5 0 10 7 m whereas it moved much slower than u vi at relatively high concentration of u vi 5 0 10 5 m in co transport systems however c c0 for both u vi and akc increased almost simultaneously under the experimental conditions furthermore the strong tailing observed in u vi individual transport especially at the low u vi concentration of 5 0 10 7 m vanished in the co transport systems on the other hand comparing with akc individual transport the presence of u vi at 5 0 10 5 and 5 0 10 6 m had a slight transport impeding effect on akc transport especially in the rising limb of btcs in summary akc only facilitated u vi transport at relatively low u vi concentrations 5 0 10 6 and 5 0 10 7 m fig 3b and c but impeded to some extent u vi transport at relatively high u vi concentration 5 0 10 5 m fig 3a the effect of u vi on akc transport also depended on u vi concentration the facilitating effect of akc suggests that most u vi transported with akc at relatively low u vi concentrations fig 3b and c this is consistent with the strong adsorption of u vi on akc observed in batch adsorption studies where the adsorption distribution coefficient k d of u vi on akc was several orders of magnitude higher than that on quartz sand table s8 most of u vi was adsorbed on akc at relatively low u vi concentrations 5 0 10 7 and 5 0 10 6 m table s9 the strong adsorption of u vi on akc was also evidenced by sem edx analysis as shown in fig 1 u vi presented higher affinity towards akc than quartz thereby u vi was dominantly associated with akc particles in the co transport system 3 2 effects of ionic strength and ph on the co transport of u vi and akc 3 2 1 individual transport systems to fully understand the influences of ionic strength and ph on the co transport of akc and u vi the btcs of individual u vi and akc transport at varying ionic strengths 4 2 10 5 4 2 10 4 and 4 2 10 3 m nacl and ph values 5 5 6 1 and 6 6 were collected respectively fig 4 and fig 5 in general the mobility of u vi was far less sensitive than that of akc to the changes in ph and ionic strength the btcs of u vi moved slightly from left to right with increasing ph fig 4a whereas ionic strength had no discernible effect under the experimental conditions fig 4b the delayed breakthrough of u vi at higher ph fig 4a can be interpreted by the increase of u vi adsorption on the sand with increasing ph from 5 6 to 6 6 the zeta potential of the sand became more negatively charged table s2 indicating that electrostatic interaction between negatively charged sand grains and positively charged u vi species was strengthened this eventually improved u vi adsorption retention fig s9 and table s9 the discernible effect of ionic strength was due to the formation of inner sphere surface complexes of u vi on quartz guo et al 2009 which was not affected by ionic strength for akc individual transport fig 5 interestingly the btcs in the elution phase overlapped and the shape of overall btcs was asymmetric akc breakthrough was obviously retarded with increasing ionic strength and ph which was closely related to the changes in akc particle size and electrostatic interaction between akc and sand grains which will be discussed in section 3 3 1 below colloid filtration theory was used to characterize the transport and retention propensities of akc liao et al 2017 wang et al 2017 yao et al 1971 the critical parameters i e the single collector contact efficiency η0 the attachment efficiency α the deposition rate coefficient k d the rate of akc deposited onto the sand surfaces and the maximum travel distance lmax the transport distance with retention of above 99 9 of colloids were calculated according to the experimental conditions see table s10 and supplementary materials s5 it was found that η0 increased with increasing ph and ionic strength implying a decrease of akc mobility in addition lmax was much higher than the length of the column consistent with experimental observation that most akc did not retain in the column 3 2 2 co transport systems the co transport of u vi and akc was investigated as a function of ph and ionic strength respectively fig 6 and fig 7 the effect of ionic strength was investigated at ph 5 6 and the effect of ph was studied at ionic strength 4 2 10 5 m at relatively lower ionic strength 4 2 10 5 4 2 10 4 m u vi transport was delayed by akc to some extent and the value of c c0 for both u vi and akc increased at almost the same pv indicating that u vi transported in the column together with akc fig 6a and b at relatively high ionic strength 4 2 10 3 m however the breakthrough patterns of u vi and akc became quite different fig 6c the maximum c c0 value for u vi decreased sharply to 32 and akc was completely blocked no breakthrough at the same time with respect to akc transport the comparison of btcs in fig 6 and those in fig 5 demonstrated that the presence of u vi caused akc transport to be more sensitive to the changes in ionic strength which in turn affected u vi transport due to strong adsorption of u vi on akc moreover the presence of u vi also made akc transport to be more sensitive to the changes in ph fig 7 when ph increased to 6 1 and 6 6 at ionic strength 4 2 10 5 m akc was also completely blocked in the column the c c0 value of u vi was 24 at ph 6 1 and the value was decreased to 10 at ph 6 6 in addition it was noteworthy that the breakthrough of u vi was obviously delayed at higher ph i e 1 5 pv at ph 6 1 and 2 1 pv at 6 6 fig 7b and c the calculation results by colloid filtration theory indicated that the presence of u vi resulted in higher η0 higher α attachment efficiency and shorter lmax in comparison with those for individual akc transport system see table s10 implying that the presence of u vi inhibited akc mobility the effects of ph and ionic strength on the co transport of u vi and akc should be closely related to the evolutions of zeta potential and particle size of akc during co transport which will be discussed in next section 3 3 evolutions of effluent ph akc particle size and zeta potential it has been reported that the stability of colloids depends largely on ionic strength and ph wang et al 2016 however whether adsorbed u vi affects the stability of colloids has seldom been studied in addition to the btcs of colloids the variations in effluent ph akc particle size and zeta potential can provide new insight into the mechanisms controlling the in column processes of akc and u vi thus some representative effluents corresponding to the data in figs 3 5 7 were collected and analyzed 3 3 1 akc individual transport system fig 8 presents the evolutions of ph akc zeta potential and particle size in effluents obtained from akc individual transport at three ionic strengths overall the higher the influent ionic strengths were the higher the ph fig 8a the lower the zeta potential fig 8b and the larger the particle size of akc fig 8c were observed in effluents although the column was conditioned pre equilibrated with nacl solution at the identical ph and ionic strength as those of influent the ph of effluents was generally increased comparing with influent ph fig 8a indicating that physicochemical interactions occurred between akc and sand surfaces during transport processes notably under the experimental conditions akc and sand grain exhibited opposite surface charges see table s2 and thus akc retention on sand surfaces could be expected to be favorable because of electrostatic attraction fang et al 2013 the favorable akc retention might alter surface charge distribution of sand by partial charge neutralization the increase in effluent ph can be interpreted by the release of hydroxyl anions oh most probably through ligand exchange reactions however upon continuous injection of influent which is more acidic influent than initial effluent the ph of the effluents decreased gradually due to neutralization reactions between the released hydroxyl anions and protons from influent therefore the ph evolutions could be ascribed to the progress of hydroxyl anion releasing reactions combined with the neutralization reactions besides when ionic strength increased the ligand exchange reactions may be put forward because of increasing masking effect of background electrolyte resulted in a higher effluent ph at higher ionic strength fig 8a zeta potential of colloids usually varies with ph due to protonation and deprotonation reactions on surface hydroxyl groups the phiep of akc was found to be 7 9 and the zeta potential decreased as ph was increased fig s3 suggesting that akc surface potential as well as repulsive forces between akc particles reduced with ph shifted closer to the phiep bradford et al 2007 thereby akc was prone to aggregate when ph of akc suspension was increased from ph 5 6 to 6 6 i e being closer to akc phiep as evidenced by larger particle size of akc at ph 6 6 see table s2 on the other hand the electrostatic double layer thickness of colloids usually shrinks with increasing ionic strength the compression of electrostatic double layer thickness made the aggregation tendency of akc easier yielding larger akc sizes in the effluents at higher ionic strength see table s2 therefore variations in ph and ionic strength contributed spontaneously to the evolutions of effluent ph akc zeta potential and particle size during transport fig s10 additionally size exclusion effect might also contribute to the larger particle size in effluent especially at relatively earlier breakthrough time sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 bradford et al 2003 3 3 2 co transport systems fig 9 a shows the evolutions of effluent ph and akc zeta potential and particle size in co transport experiments in general the profiles of the variations in ph and akc zeta potential and particle size showed similar trends to those observed in akc individual transport experiments fig 8 except the one that akc was completely retained at i 4 2 10 3 m fig 9b shows the evolutions of effluent ph and akc zeta potential and particle size at different u vi concentrations it is obvious that u vi concentration had a significant influence effluent ph and akc zeta potential and particle size increased as influent u vi concentration increased the strong adsorption of u vi on akc changed to some extent the dependence of akc zeta potential on ph fig s3 the phiep of akc in the presence of 5 0 10 5 m u vi was 6 3 significantly lower than that phiep 7 9 in the absence of u vi consequently the repulsion forces between akc particles decreased which favored akc aggregation as evidenced by the larger size in the presence of u vi see table s2 the ionic strength effect in the presence of u vi could be interpreted in a similar way as that in the absence of u vi i e akc size increased with increasing ionic strength which was due to the double layer compression because the size of akc in the presence of u vi was systematically larger than that in the absence of u vi and the corresponding zeta potential was closer to phiep of the colloids the transport of akc in the presence of u vi was less favorable this could explain the changes in akc transport behavior in the absence fig 5 and presence figs 3 6 and 7 of u vi 3 4 transport modelling 3 4 1 estimation of btcs plateaus for u vi in co transport systems the plateaus of btcs for u vi transport without akc were controlled by u vi adsorption on the sand but the situation became more complicated in the co transport systems in the presence of akc other processes such as u vi adsorption on akc and akc retardation in the column occurred high plateau values of btcs in co transport system were only observed under conditions at relatively low u vi concentrations low ionic strength and low ph values in such cases most u vi adsorbed on akc and co transported with akc which remained small particle size and relatively high zeta potential at relatively high u vi concentrations however the k d of u vi on akc decreased meanwhile akc transport was impeded especially at relatively high ionic strength and high ph close to the phiep of akc under these conditions akc mobility was significantly retarded in the column but only a part of u vi adsorbed on akc and transported with akc thereby the plateau of btcs for u vi at relatively high u vi concentrations was relatively low the plateaus of btcs for u vi in co transport systems can be estimated from the maximum c c0 values of akc and the adsorption percentages of u vi on the sand and akc see table s7 for details generally the estimation was in good agreement with the observed data in figs 3 6 and 7 suggesting that btcs of u vi in the co transport system were primarily determined by u vi adsorption and akc transport 3 4 2 u vi transport modelling a two site non equilibrium model was used to describe the btcs of individual u vi transport the fitted btcs were presented as lines with measured btcs in figs 2 and 4 the corresponding fitted parameters were given in table 2 fitted retardation factor r f was an applicable tool for evaluating the mobility of u vi in sand packed column the higher r f the weaker ion mobility i e the stronger ion retention was observed experimentally for instance at ph 5 6 r f for br was 1 whereas for u vi r f was 2 09 because of u vi adsorption r f for u vi was greatly increased with the increase of ph and the decrease of u vi concentration by using the fitted r f values we can easily calculate the corresponding k d values using eq s2 see details in s2 the calculated k d from column experiments was slightly dissimilar to the measured k d from batch experiments table s6 this is reasonable because k d from batch experiments represented adsorption at equilibrium while calculated k d was based on non equilibrium adsorption during transport cheng et al 2007 li et al 2011 the parameter β represented the fraction of instantaneous retardation and the value of β decreased with increasing u vi retardation one possible explanation was that u vi adsorption retardation was dominated by type 2 adsorption sites which was assumed to be kinetic dependent li et al 2011 florido et al 2010 3 4 3 akc transport modelling akc transport in both individual and co transport systems was simulated by using a two site kinetic attachment detachment model model fitted first order attachment rate coefficients k 1 k 2 and first order detachment rate coefficients k 1d were used to reflect akc attachment and detachment on the sand surface respectively s max2 was defined as maximum solid phase retention capacity of site 2 the fitted parameters for the btcs of akc in figs 3 5 and 6 were summarized in table 3 in general the values of k 1d were lower than that of k 1 indicating a slow akc release kinetics this can be attributed to the overwhelming presence of favorable surfaces negative charge i e favorable attachment condition for akc positive charge attachment wang et al 2014a moreover the values of k 2 were several orders of magnitude higher than the values of k 1d and k 1 implying that akc attachment was dominated by irreversible attachment on site 2 with increased ionic strength ph and u vi concentration k 2 generally decreased whereas k 1 k 1d and s max2 increased the increase of s max2 was consistent with unfavorable transport of akc under these conditions where akc were prone to aggregate and consequently to retain on sand surfaces the variations in k 1 k 1d and k 2 indicated that the sticking kinetics was also varied with chemical conditions of the influent overall the model fitted parameters and high pearson s correlation coefficient r2 0 92 between observed and fitted data reflected that the two site kinetic attachment detachment model captured the main features of akc transport in the presence of u vi 4 conclusions in this study we systematically investigated the effects of u vi concentration ph and ionic strength on the co transport of u vi and akaganéite colloid akc in water saturated sand column comparatively studied individual and co transport behaviors of u vi and akc and assessed the evolutions of effluent ph and akc zeta potential and particle size in the column effluents based on the results we come to the following conclusions first whether akc facilitates u vi transport depends on not only ph and ionic strength but also u vi concentration facilitated u vi transport by akc only occurs at relatively low u vi concentrations at relatively high u vi concentration on the contrary akc always inhibits u vi transport second with regard to zeta potential and particle size of akc the adsorbed u vi renders akc to be more prone to aggregate and more sensitive to the changes in ph and ionic strength especially at relatively high u vi concentrations in general the presence of u vi increases akc size and impedes akc transport third the evolutions of effluent ph zeta potential and colloid size are of significance concerning the processes controlling the co transport the evolution of akc size in effluents can be interpreted by variations in zeta potential and ionic strength as well as size exclusion effect of colloids the evolution of zeta potential in effluents is mainly due to ph variation which could be interpreted by ligand exchange reactions between akc and the surfaces of the sand as well as subsequent acid base neutralization reactions in the mobile phase finally the plateaus of btcs of u vi in co transport system can be estimated by considering the maximum c c0 values of akc and u vi adsorption on both akc and sand the transport of u vi and akc can be reasonably described by a two site non equilibrium model and a two site kinetic attachment detachment model respectively acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 11675070 u1730245 and the natural science

19257,microbial mats due to their high microbial diversity have the potential to express most biogeochemical cycling processes highlighting their prospective use in bioremediation of various environmental contaminants in this study the mechanisms of nitrogen attenuation were investigated in naturally occurring microbial mats from elkhorn slough monterey bay ca usa and baja california sur mexico key processes responsible for this removal were evaluated using quantification of functional genes related to nitrification denitrification and nitrogen fixation both microbial mats were capable of removing high up to 2 mm concentrations of ammonium and nitrate ammonium assimilation rates measured for elkhorn slough mats showed that this process was responsible for most of the ammonium uptake in these mats while elkhorn slough mats did not show any evidence of nitrogen removal pathways other than microbial assimilation baja mats exhibited the potential for nitrification denitrification and dnra as well as assimilation the results of this study demonstrate the potential of microbial mats for bioremediation of nitrogenous pollutants independent of the mechanisms responsible for their removal keywords microbial mats bioremediation nitrogen assimilation nitrification denitrification 1 introduction microbial mats are laminated multi layered microbial communities comprised primarily of bacteria and archaea nisbet and fowler 1999 they are ubiquitous in diverse environments including marine bebout et al 1987 otte et al 1999 hypersaline nübel et al 2001 pinckney and paerl 1997 and fresh water systems brunberg et al 2002 during the day when photosynthesis is occurring microbial mats exhibit upper oxygenated and deeper anoxic layers during the night most mats are completely anoxic as a result both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways are active in mats kunin et al 2008 vertical redox and chemical gradients in microbial mats create stratification in the community with the top layer dominated by oxygenic phototrophs like cyanobacteria and underlying or intermixed layers mostly composed of anoxygenic phototrophs and heterotrophs stal 2012 microbial mats have been shown to represent an extremely high microbial diversity ley et al 2006 and due to such diversity can contain most if not all biogeochemical processes therein ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 are serious environmental pollutants the world health organisation who recommends that drinking water should not contain more than 50 mg l 1 of no3 due to its potential to cause methaemoglobinaemia world health organisation 2011 the environmental protection agency epa recommended final acute ambient water quality criteria awqc for protecting freshwater organisms from potential effects of ammonia is 17 mg l 1 total ammonia nitrogen tan and the final chronic awqc for ammonia is 1 9 mg l 1 tan at ph 7 0 and temperature 20 c united states environmental protection agency 2013 these nitrogen n contaminants can be removed from polluted water in several ways including assimilation by microorganisms nitrification denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox although the occurrence of nitrification and denitrification has been shown in microbial mats bonin and michotey 2006 joye and paerl 1994 their role in relation to other n transformations for n removal in these systems has not yet been explored specifically it is known that cyanobacteria and other bacteria can assimilate nitrogenous compounds like nh4 no3 and urea however it is not clear if it is solely assimilatory uptake that is responsible for n removal by microbial mats microbial mats can be artificially created using nutrient organic substrates such as ensiled materials and microorganisms immobilized either by secretions from various microbial components or by inert structures added to the organic mat such constructed microbial mats are successfully used as a natural environmentally friendly and cost effective bioremediation system they have the potential for removal of a wide range of pollutants bender and phillips 2004 roeselers et al 2008 and can be applied in bioremediation aquaculture and wastewater treatment roeselers et al 2008 zamora castro et al 2008 constructed microbial mats have been shown to successfully remove heavy metals and metalloids bender et al 1995 1994 oil akyon et al 2015 bordenave et al 2007 grötzschel et al 2002 and leachate goodroad et al 1995 from contaminated waters most research into the suitability of microbial mats for bioremediation of nitrogenous contaminants has been conducted on constructed not naturally occurring microbial mats akyon et al 2015 bender et al 1995 zamora castro et al 2008 reported high removal efficiency of nh4 uptake 79 for an artificial microbial mat at concentrations of up to 8 19 mg l 1 0 585 mm nh4 banerjee et al 2015 and lezama cervantes et al 2010 used artificial mats to treat up to 5 mg l 1 0 357 mm nh4 zamora castro et al 2008 reported maximum removal efficiency of no3 for an artificial microbial mat to be 83 at concentrations 6 38 1 87 mg l 1 0 456 mm no3 n however in some intensive pond aquaculture systems total n concentrations may exceed 30 mg l 1 avnimelech et al 1986 and in wastewater effluent high total n concentrations are often found that far exceed the values previously reported carey and migliaccio 2009 kim et al 2010 taking that into account removal of higher concentrations of nh4 no3 by microbial mats could be of great utility and should be tested while nutrient uptake has been measured in other biofilm communities such as periphyton davis and minshall 1999 hydrogen fed biofilm ontiveros valencia et al 2013 open water wetlands jones et al 2017 sediments baker et al 2015 and also in microbial mats bebout et al 1994 studies investigating mechanisms of nitrogen attenuation by naturally growing microbial mats are limited likewise the treatment capacity of microbial mats for high concentrations of nitrogenous contaminants for different types of natural microbial mats should be tested microbial mats and similar natural communities may contain a reservoir of genetic potential for a diversity of processes that are not necessarily contained in more well defined engineered systems natural mats are advantageously self maintained virtually cost free ecosystems capable of cleaning polluted waters naturally where engineered systems are hard or expensive to build naturally growing mats could be harvested and then deployed in an engineered setting analogously to the constructed mats or they could be managed manipulated for enhanced attenuation the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate mechanisms and key processes responsible for nh4 and no3 uptake by two types of naturally growing microbial mats 2 to estimate nh4 and no3 uptake capacities for these mats 3 to explore the degree to which uptake capacities could be stimulated over time by increases in addition of substrates and 4 to investigate if the growth of populations of n cycling organisms could be stimulated by these same substrate additions we hypothesized that the incubation of microbial mats under elevated nutrient concentrations would impose changes on the abundance and composition of n functional genes and that the number of copies of each of these genes provides a proxy to evaluate the relative importance of each of these pathways responsible for n removal by these mats therefore we employed quantitative pcr qpcr targeting marker functional genes catalyzing the n biogeochemical cycle including the nitrifying amoa denitrifying nirs and n fixing nifh genes here we link these molecular data to the efficiency with which mats remove nitrogenous compounds from water in order to determine the relative importance of each of these pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1 microbial mat sampling microbial mats used for experiments were collected at two locations the first mat which has been previously well described bebout et al 2002 des marais 1995 was collected from area 4 near the dike with area 5 within the salt works managed by exportadora de sal sa and located near guerrero negro baja california sur mexico further referred to as baja mat the baja mat is 10 cm thick and is covered by 1 m of brine with salinity 98 and ph 7 6 sections of microbial mats 20 25 cm in area were collected on february 25 2016 and transported to nasa ames research center moffett field ca where they were incubated in aquaria with water

mats and two mats from each site were incubated with seawater amended with nh4so4 further referred as nh4 treated mats for es mat incubations seawater with a salinity 35 from a marina near the sampling location was used artificial seawater with a salinity of 53 and the same ionic composition as water from field site was created for the baja mats due to a lack of proximity to the sampling site therefore lower salinities than the ones measured in the field at the time of collection were used for both mats in order to maximize the bioremediation potential for these mats the mats were incubated under a continuous flow rate of 100 ml day 1 and were exposed to a 16 8 h light dark photoperiod at 1200 μe m 2 s 1 from white led lamps liquid volume of the incubations was 194 2 22 8 ml the water temperature was kept constant at 16 c mats were pre incubated for 4 7 days with either seawater only controls seawater amended with 50 μm nh4 nh4 treated mats or seawater amended with 50 μm no3 no3 treated mats nitrogenous compounds were supplied to the inflow at three concentrations increasing stepwise over the course of the experiment first mats received either nh4 or no3 at a concentration of 0 5 mm for 13 days further referred as beginning phase after this period the concentration of nh4 no3 was increased to 1 mm this phase lasted 22 days further referred as middle phase finally the mats were treated with 2 mm nh4 or no3 for 10 days further referred as end phase artificial tides exposure of the mats to air for several hours were created before each concentration increase in order to simulate environmental conditions at the es sampling site to determine the concentrations of these nutrients at the outflow 2 4 ml of water was sampled every 2 4 days water samples were immediately frozen at 20 c until the analyses of nh4 and no3 were performed for microbial biological analyses cores of microbial mat 11 mm diameter 10 mm depth were sampled and frozen at 20 c at the beginning of the experiment and prior to the onset of each concentration increase the experiment was stopped when removal of nh4 or no3 by microbial mats was no longer complete i e the capacity for n removal was reached for both mats ammonium analysis was performed using a colorimetric method as described in parsons et al 1984 and no3 was analyzed using a microplate reader based colorimetric method adapted from the protocol of ringuet et al 2011 the removal efficiency re of nh4 and no3 were calculated as a percentage removed by the equation re c i c o c i 100 where c i inflow concentration μl and c o outflow concentration μl the removal rate rr of nh4 and no3 was calculated by the following equation rr c i c o m r a 1000 where rr removal rate mg n m 2 day 1 c i inflow

assimilation by freshly sampled microbial mat were determined by measuring the uptake of stable isotopically labeled ammonium 15nh4cl in order to distinguish nh4 assimilation from nitrification uptake of labeled ammonium was measured with and without the addition of nitrapyrin a nitrification inhibitor widely used in soils to decrease n loss from applied fertilizer slangen and kerkhoff 1984 due to the remote location of the baja field site and the lack of freshly collected material upon which to perform measurements assimilation rates were measured only in the es mat microbial mat was sampled at the es site on december 8 2015 and delivered to the laboratory at nasa ames research center in mountain view ca within 1 2 h a total of 24 replicate vials were prepared identically as follows small subcores 11 mm diameter 10 mm depth were cut from whole sections of intact microbial mat with plastic core tubes and the cores still contained within the plastic core tubes were placed in the bottom of 38 ml serum vials a 1 agar solution made using water from the marina near the field site was added to each bottle up to the level of the top of the core tube the agar served to physically fix the plastic core into position in the bottom of the bottle and to ensure that the only contact between the cores and the overlying water was across the top of the mat fifteen ml of seawater from the marina neighboring the sampling location was then added to each bottle nitrapyrin was added to half of vials at a final concentration of 0 5 μg ml 1 one hundred μl of 10 at 15nh4cl was injected into the vials except for the controls such that the final concentration of 15nh4cl was 50 μm three vials with and three without added nitrapyrin served as controls and did not receive any 15nh4cl one ml of water was sampled at time 0 0 5 1 3 and 6 h filtered with a 0 2 μm syringe filter and stored at 20 c until nh4 analysis ammonium analysis was performed using a colorimetric method as described in parsons et al 1984 mats were sampled destructively at 1 3 and 6 h with half of a core immediately frozen in liquid n and subsequently stored in 80 c for further rna extractions and another half frozen at 20 c for bulk 15n analysis 15n analyses were performed using irms using a pdz europa anca gsl elemental analyzer interfaced to a pdz europa 20 20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer sercon ltd cheshire

molecular analyses total genomic dna was isolated from 0 13 0 03 g of a core microbial mat using the powerbiofilm dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca according to manufacturer s instructions the quality a260 a280 and quantity a260 of extracted genomic dna was determined with an implen nanophotometer p class implen gmbh munich germany quantitative pcr qpcr was used to determine gene copy numbers of specific genes in the mat as follows the abundance of bacterial 16s rrna gene was determined using the primer pairs nad f and nad r nadkarni et al 2002 the abundance of genes known to be involved in nitrogen transformations were assayed using qpcr as follows ammonia monoxygenase amoa nitrite reductase nirs and nitrogenase nifh were monitored using respectively the primer pairs amoa 1f and amoa 2r rotthauwe et al 1997 nirs cd3af and nirs r3cd throbäck et al 2004 and igk3 and dvv ando et al 2006 amplification of all genes was performed using the illumina eco real time pcr system illumina inc san diego ca usa a dilution series of cloned amoa nirs and nifh gene fragments pcr4 topo vector invitrogen carlsbad nm were used to prepare dna standards with known quantities of target dna in the case of 16s rrna qpcr a pcr product of primer set 27f and 1492r was used as a qpcr standard weisburg et al 1991 all amplifications were performed with a reaction volume of 10 μl containing 5 μl of kapa sybr fast qpcr mastermix 500 nm of each primer and 1 μl 30 95 ng of the template dna amplifications were performed with 3 min initial denaturation at 95 c followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 c 30 s at 60 c nifh at 54 c and 30 s at 72 c after amplification an amplicon melting curve was recorded in 0 3 c steps between 55 and 95 c after testing a set of dilutions for dna samples no inhibition of pcr was detected at 1 20 dilution therefore diluting 1 20 and 1 100 of dna extracts was performed the amplification efficiency for the different assays ranged between 80 and 110 and r2 was at least 0 988 quantitative pcr data were normalized by dividing gene copy number in eluted dna to the weight of microbial mat used for dna extraction total rna was extracted from 0

turbo dna free kit ambion inc austin tx usa the quantity of extracted rna and the absence of dna contamination was determined with a qubit fluorometer invitrogen carlsbad nm rna was then reverse transcribed using superscript first strand synthesis system for rt pcr thermo fisher scientific waltman ma subsequent qpcrs were performed with the obtained cdna as described above 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analyses for differences in n removal efficiencies and gene copy numbers between different experimental phases and types of microbial mat were performed using sigma plot software sigmaplot v 13 0 microsoft normality of the data was checked using shapiro wilk test a one way analysis of variance anova was performed to check for treatment effects when significant differences were found treatment means were separated with one of pairwise multiple comparison tests tukey s dunn s or holm sidak at a p value of 0 05 error bars represent 1 standard deviation 3 results the capacity of both microbial mats to remove n contaminants and mechanisms of this removal were investigated under identical experimental conditions and throughout the same experimental time briefly while es mats had higher removal efficiency for p 0 019 the baja mats exhibited higher efficiency of removal of no3 than of nh4 p 0 001 in terms of rates however es mats had comparable removal rates for nh4 and no3 p 0 119 baja mats still had higher removal rates of no3 than of nh4 p 0 001 all the investigated mats retained viability during the whole experiment no visual differences were observed between control and nh4 no3 treated mats 3 1 ammonium removal during the beginning phase both types of microbial mat had almost complete nh4 removal 98 5 1 with baja mats showing higher removal rate than es mats as an artifact of smaller surface area of the baja mats in the es mats the removal efficiency remained high further in the middle phase and declined throughout the end phase p 0 001 fig 1 the removal rate for these mats increased throughout the beginning and middle phases and started to decrease only by the end of the end phase indicating that its treatment capacity was reached at 2 mm nh4 while still maintaining a high removal rate removal efficiency in the baja mats decreased significantly during the middle phase after the higher nh4 concentration of 1 mm was applied p 0 001 and dropped to near zero throughout the end phase of the experiment therefore these mats reached their treatment capacity at 0 5 mm nh4 subsequently es and baja microbial mats had comparable nh4 removal efficiency during the beginning phase p 0 803 but then during the middle and end phases the es mats had significantly higher removal efficiency than baja mats p 0 001 3 2 nitrate removal both es and baja microbial mats were able to remove almost all of the no3 throughout the beginning phase and first half of the middle phase 97 5 0 7 fig 2 removal rate was higher for baja mats however it was observed as an artifact of a smaller surface area of these mats in comparison with es mats considering almost complete no3 removal in both mats there was a sharp decrease in removal rates towards the end of the middle phase in both mats but rates largely recovered in both mats although no3 removal efficiency during the end phase was higher p 0 002 for es mats due to their larger surface areas removal rates for both mats were comparable p 0 941 also removal rates for both mats during the end phase did not differ from those seen during the middle phase p 0 05 indicating that their treatment capacity was reached at 1 mm no3 3 3 abundance of n cycling genes the abundance of amoa nirs nifh and bacterial 16s rrna genes were quantitatively determined for each phase of the experiment in control nh4 treated and no3 treated es and baja mats while all the studied genes were present in all phases in both microbial mat types the denitrifying nirs gene was the most abundant in all mat samples and the nitrifying amoa gene was presented by the lowest copy numbers the amoa gene did not show any variations between different treatments in either mat p 0 05 fig 3 a b furthermore no significant differences were observed between three experimental phases i e beginning middle and end in es nh4 treated mats p 0 067 conversely amoa abundance in baja nh4 treated mats was significantly different between the experimental phases with higher numbers during the middle phase than the end phase p 0 033 also a significant difference in amoa gene abundance between nh4 treated es and baja mats was detected during the end experimental phase p 0 004 no significant differences in nirs gene abundance were detected between different treatments in either the es or baja mats p 0 05 fig 4 a b nirs gene abundances between experimental phases in both types of no3 treated mats also lacked variations p 0 05 nirs gene abundance was significantly higher in no3 treated es mats than in no3 treated baja mats at the end phase of the experiment p 0 006 nifh gene abundances also did not vary between different treatments p 0 05 fig 5 a b interestingly in both es and baja no3 treated mats nifh gene abundance was significantly higher during the middle phase in comparison with beginning and end phases p 0 019 for es and 0 025 for baja mats moreover nifh gene copy numbers were significantly higher in no3 es mats than in no3 treated baja mats p 0 050 3 4 relative importance of ammonium assimilation and nitrification ammonium consumption by microbial mats conducted with and without nitrapyrin additions was not significantly different p 0 830 indicating that nitrification was likely not quantitatively important in these mats additional support for this hypothesis was provided through direct measurements of the incorporation of 15n labeled ammonium into biomass by the es mats measurements of bulk 15n in microbial mat biomass showed assimilation of 15nh4 by microbial mat at a rate between 39 4 14 0 to 115 9 6 4 mg n m 2 day 1 for the set with nitrapyrin and from 26 7 15 0 to 90 6 19 1 mg n m 2 day 1 for the set without nitrapyrin fig 6 and were not significantly different p 0 647 as an independent check for the presence of nitrification and also denitrification rt qpcr was also performed on these samples specifically targeting amoa and nirs gene transcripts these transcripts were not detected in any of the mat samples to validate the negative rt qpcr results another rt qpcr targeting 16s rrna gene transcripts was performed in the same samples positive results were obtained for the 16s rrna gene in all samples fig s2 in supplementary information and that is evidence of a functioning rt qpcr method 4 discussion both microbial mats studied here were capable of removing nh4 and no3 at concentrations of up to 2 mm this illustrates the potential of using naturally occurring microbial mat communities for bioremediation of nitrogenous compounds at concentrations which these compounds would be considered to be environmentally significant contaminants i e when they exceed recommended epa and who levels one example of an effective use of microbial mats is in the treatment of hydraulic fracturing wastewater akyon et al 2015 that has high salinity high heavy metal content and significant total kjeldahl n concentration of up to 5200 mg l 1 no3 up to 2670 mg l 1 and nh4 up to 352 mg l 1 mcelreath 2011 thacker et al 2015 some conventional wastewater treatment techniques such as activated sludge treatment are not suitable for high salinity wastewater linari et al 2013 wang et al 2005 contrariwise microbial mats due to their tolerance to high salinity and high concentrations of heavy metals may represent an appropriate treatment technology for hydraulic fracturing wastewater another application of microbial mats is in aquaculture the pollution of seawater with dissolved inorganic nutrients like n and phosphorus has been a problem resulting from the practice of aquaculture kamilya et al 2006 microbial mats are used as an effluent filtering system for aquaculture wastewater to decrease elevated nutrient concentrations banerjee et al 2015 bender et al 2004 a preincubation period of about 4 7 days was sufficient to realize the highest removal efficiencies reported here studies examining n removal using microalgae have also reported high removal efficiencies after a comparable preincubation time gonzález et al 1997 martı nez et al 2000 albeit not at the higher concentrations reported here natural mats have uniquely high diversity ley et al 2006 that may not be fully represented in an artificially created mat and this makes them a more complex system to study but with the potential to contain a greater diversity of organisms involved in n removal the 2 mm nh4 no3 concentrations applied in our study were much higher than the up to 0 6 mm nh4 no3 previously reported in literature for artificial microbial mats banerjee et al 2015 lezama cervantes et al 2010 zamora castro et al 2008 and removal efficiencies for the mats studied here were higher for these high concentrations than the ones reported for the artificial mats in terms of rates however microbial mats used in this study had lower removal rates than immobilized periphytic cyanobacteria studied by banerjee et al 2015 and constructed microbial mats investigated by zamora castro et al 2008 therefore naturally growing microbial mats can be useful where higher contaminant concentrations are observed recognizing a need to be operated under a lower flow rate or across a larger surface area than artificial mats removal rates by natural microbial mats used in this study of up to 300 mg n m 2 day 1 can be compared to plant uptake rate for phragmites australis during growth 200 670 mg n m 2 day 1 molle et al 2008 this indicates that naturally growing microbial mats can be as efficient in n uptake as some plants used in contaminated water treatment possible mechanisms of nh4 removal include volatilization anammox microbial assimilation and nitrification the loss of nh4 through free ammonia volatilization under the experimental conditions used here ph 7 6 and 8 1 and temperature 16 c could account for up to 10 of the reported rates umweltbundesamt 1996 although anammox was not investigated in this study this process has been shown to be of low importance in other microbial mats bonin and michotey 2006 anammox has also been examined in these same mats but no activity was detected coban et al in prep the measured rates of nh4 assimilation in es mats could account for all of the nh4 removal in these mats during the beginning phase however the rate of nh4 removal by es mats was higher during the middle and end phases and this could indicate that the estimated nh4 assimilation rate was not the maximal potential rate of nh4 assimilation for es mat or that other processes such as nitrification were probably involved in nh4 removal although 15nh4 assimilation rate data is lacking for baja mats lower nh4 removal rates were observed in these mats with nh4 actually being released expressed as a negative removal rate at the end of the experiment this release could be explained by a combination of mineralization ammonification the conversion of organic n into nh4 that occurs throughout the whole experiment in these mats and lower assimilation rates during the end phase an alternative hypothesis is higher rates of mineralization during the end phase as a result of high nh4 concentrations causing decomposition of these mats this hypothesis would also be supported by the high nh4 concentrations in outflow of no3 treated baja mats fig s3 in supplementary information our results from two different microbial mats appear to demonstrate that the importance of nitrification in nh4 removal differed between these two mats a lack of amoa gene copy number differences between control nh4 and no3 treatments in es mats suggests that nh4 addition did not enhance growth of the population of nitrifying bacteria in nh4 treated mats relative to control and no3 treated mats furthermore a lack of amoa gene abundance response to increases in nh4 concentration in es mats over the experimental time may indicate that nitrification is not an important pathway of n cycling in the es microbial mats in contrast amoa gene abundance in baja mats declined after 2 mm nh4 addition decreases in nh4 removal efficiencies during the end phase in comparison with beginning and middle phases is consistent with decreases in nitrifier growth under high inorganic n concentrations and nh4 removal via nitrification in the baja mats whereas the lack of a difference between assimilation rate with and without nitrapyrin is consistent with the absence of nitrification in es mats fig 6 we were unfortunately not able to confirm assimilation as the pathway for nh4 removal in similar experiments with the baja mat further support for the absence of nitrification in the es mats is provided by the lack of amoa gene transcripts after nh4 addition lastly conclusions drawn here on the basis of amoa gene abundance data are in a good agreement with nitrification rate data measured using isotope dilution technique for these types of mats coban et al in prep which also show that nitrification was present in baja mats while low or almost absent in es mats in summary while assimilation was mainly responsible for nh4 removal in es mats a combination of assimilation and possibly nitrification processes contributed to nh4 removal in baja mats while some studies have shown the presence of nitrification and denitrification in microbial mats bonin and michotey 2006 joye and paerl 1994 others report the dominance of assimilatory ammonia metabolism and absence of nitrification genes in microbial mat metagenomes varin et al 2010 as was the case with nh4 removal es and baja mats exhibited different mechanisms of no3 removal possible no3 removal pathways include denitrification and microbial assimilation as well as dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra a lack of significant differences between control nh4 and no3 treatments and between beginning middle and end experimental phases indicates that there is little or no effect of no3 addition on denitrifying nirs population in both types of mats possibly signifying that most added no3 was assimilated into microbial biomass however decreased nirs gene abundance in baja mats at the end phase of the experiment could be evidence of an inhibition of denitrifier growth presumably by high concentrations of inorganic n present at that time in fact denitrification must occur in these mats following nitrification as evidenced by the presence of nitrification and low no3 outflow concentrations in nh4 treated baja mats fig s4 in supplementary information in contrast based on nirs gene abundance data there was no evidence for any process other than assimilation to eliminate no3 in es mats a denitrification rate measurement performed using the isotope pairing technique in these mats revealed that denitrification was absent in both baja and es mats coban et al in prep another n cycling pathway that could explain some of the observations presented here is dnra this process converts no3 to nh4 and therefore does not change total n concentration elevated nh4 concentrations in outflow of no3 treated baja mats p 0 005 fig s3 in supplementary information could be evidence for the occurrence of dnra in these mats a similar elevation of nh4 was not observed in the es mats dnra has been reported in a microbial mat growing at salinities comparable to those experienced by baja mats 95 130 bonin and michotey 2006 although its quantitative contribution to n cycling in the mats described in aforementioned study was small an alternative explanation for the high nh4 concentrations in outflow of no3 treated baja mats are high mineralization rates as was also shown by a negative removal rate at the end of the experiment by the nh4 treated baja mats due to nh4 release via mineralization we also investigated how high inorganic n additions affect n fixing community in microbial mats as nitrogen fixation has been demonstrated to be an important source of nitrogen for microbial mats in a number of previous studies bebout et al 1987 omoregie et al 2004 stal et al 1984 woebken et al 2015 the energetically expensive process of nitrogen fixation is known to be suppressed by the availability of more readily assumable forms of fixed nitrogen following no3 concentration increase during the middle phase the abundance of a gene known to be required for nitrogen fixation nifh increased but then subsequently decreased during the end phase in no3 treated es and baja mats therefore the effects of no3 additions on the n fixing community in our study are not clear there is considerable ambiguity about the effects of no3 on nitrogen fixation in previous reports while many studies show inhibition e g holl and montoya 2005 pinckney et al 1995 others report no effect or even stimulation of nitrogenase activity lee and joye 2006 liengen 1999 merbach et al 1997 after addition of inorganic n and specifically no3 in pure and mixed microbial cultures as well as microbial mats further research is needed to clarify the relationship between inorganic n addition and n fixation in microbial mats 5 conclusions in this study the potential of two different types of naturally growing microbial mats for removal of nitrogenous contaminants was evaluated both microbial mats were capable of high up to 2 mm nh4 no3 uptake while es mats showed no indication of any removal pathway other than assimilation baja mats had some evidence of nitrification denitrification and dnra pathways in addition to assimilation this study demonstrates uptake of high concentrations of n by naturally occurring microbial mats and it introduces their potential in applications for contaminated seawater treatment the nitrogen fixing microbial community appeared to be affected by the nitrate additions and this relationship should be investigated further

19257,microbial mats due to their high microbial diversity have the potential to express most biogeochemical cycling processes highlighting their prospective use in bioremediation of various environmental contaminants in this study the mechanisms of nitrogen attenuation were investigated in naturally occurring microbial mats from elkhorn slough monterey bay ca usa and baja california sur mexico key processes responsible for this removal were evaluated using quantification of functional genes related to nitrification denitrification and nitrogen fixation both microbial mats were capable of removing high up to 2 mm concentrations of ammonium and nitrate ammonium assimilation rates measured for elkhorn slough mats showed that this process was responsible for most of the ammonium uptake in these mats while elkhorn slough mats did not show any evidence of nitrogen removal pathways other than microbial assimilation baja mats exhibited the potential for nitrification denitrification and dnra as well as assimilation the results of this study demonstrate the potential of microbial mats for bioremediation of nitrogenous pollutants independent of the mechanisms responsible for their removal keywords microbial mats bioremediation nitrogen assimilation nitrification denitrification 1 introduction microbial mats are laminated multi layered microbial communities comprised primarily of bacteria and archaea nisbet and fowler 1999 they are ubiquitous in diverse environments including marine bebout et al 1987 otte et al 1999 hypersaline nübel et al 2001 pinckney and paerl 1997 and fresh water systems brunberg et al 2002 during the day when photosynthesis is occurring microbial mats exhibit upper oxygenated and deeper anoxic layers during the night most mats are completely anoxic as a result both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways are active in mats kunin et al 2008 vertical redox and chemical gradients in microbial mats create stratification in the community with the top layer dominated by oxygenic phototrophs like cyanobacteria and underlying or intermixed layers mostly composed of anoxygenic phototrophs and heterotrophs stal 2012 microbial mats have been shown to represent an extremely high microbial diversity ley et al 2006 and due to such diversity can contain most if not all biogeochemical processes therein ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 are serious environmental pollutants the world health organisation who recommends that drinking water should not contain more than 50 mg l 1 of no3 due to its potential to cause methaemoglobinaemia world health organisation 2011 the environmental protection agency epa recommended final acute ambient water quality criteria awqc for protecting freshwater organisms from potential effects of ammonia is 17 mg l 1 total ammonia nitrogen tan and the final chronic awqc for ammonia is 1 9 mg l 1 tan at ph 7 0 and temperature 20 c united states environmental protection agency 2013 these nitrogen n contaminants can be removed from polluted water in several ways including assimilation by microorganisms nitrification denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox although the occurrence of nitrification and denitrification has been shown in microbial mats bonin and michotey 2006 joye and paerl 1994 their role in relation to other n transformations for n removal in these systems has not yet been explored specifically it is known that cyanobacteria and other bacteria can assimilate nitrogenous compounds like nh4 no3 and urea however it is not clear if it is solely assimilatory uptake that is responsible for n removal by microbial mats microbial mats can be artificially created using nutrient organic substrates such as ensiled materials and microorganisms immobilized either by secretions from various microbial components or by inert structures added to the organic mat such constructed microbial mats are successfully used as a natural environmentally friendly and cost effective bioremediation system they have the potential for removal of a wide range of pollutants bender and phillips 2004 roeselers et al 2008 and can be applied in bioremediation aquaculture and wastewater treatment roeselers et al 2008 zamora castro et al 2008 constructed microbial mats have been shown to successfully remove heavy metals and metalloids bender et al 1995 1994 oil akyon et al 2015 bordenave et al 2007 grötzschel et al 2002 and leachate goodroad et al 1995 from contaminated waters most research into the suitability of microbial mats for bioremediation of nitrogenous contaminants has been conducted on constructed not naturally occurring microbial mats akyon et al 2015 bender et al 1995 zamora castro et al 2008 reported high removal efficiency of nh4 uptake 79 for an artificial microbial mat at concentrations of up to 8 19 mg l 1 0 585 mm nh4 banerjee et al 2015 and lezama cervantes et al 2010 used artificial mats to treat up to 5 mg l 1 0 357 mm nh4 zamora castro et al 2008 reported maximum removal efficiency of no3 for an artificial microbial mat to be 83 at concentrations 6 38 1 87 mg l 1 0 456 mm no3 n however in some intensive pond aquaculture systems total n concentrations may exceed 30 mg l 1 avnimelech et al 1986 and in wastewater effluent high total n concentrations are often found that far exceed the values previously reported carey and migliaccio 2009 kim et al 2010 taking that into account removal of higher concentrations of nh4 no3 by microbial mats could be of great utility and should be tested while nutrient uptake has been measured in other biofilm communities such as periphyton davis and minshall 1999 hydrogen fed biofilm ontiveros valencia et al 2013 open water wetlands jones et al 2017 sediments baker et al 2015 and also in microbial mats bebout et al 1994 studies investigating mechanisms of nitrogen attenuation by naturally growing microbial mats are limited likewise the treatment capacity of microbial mats for high concentrations of nitrogenous contaminants for different types of natural microbial mats should be tested microbial mats and similar natural communities may contain a reservoir of genetic potential for a diversity of processes that are not necessarily contained in more well defined engineered systems natural mats are advantageously self maintained virtually cost free ecosystems capable of cleaning polluted waters naturally where engineered systems are hard or expensive to build naturally growing mats could be harvested and then deployed in an engineered setting analogously to the constructed mats or they could be managed manipulated for enhanced attenuation the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate mechanisms and key processes responsible for nh4 and no3 uptake by two types of naturally growing microbial mats 2 to estimate nh4 and no3 uptake capacities for these mats 3 to explore the degree to which uptake capacities could be stimulated over time by increases in addition of substrates and 4 to investigate if the growth of populations of n cycling organisms could be stimulated by these same substrate additions we hypothesized that the incubation of microbial mats under elevated nutrient concentrations would impose changes on the abundance and composition of n functional genes and that the number of copies of each of these genes provides a proxy to evaluate the relative importance of each of these pathways responsible for n removal by these mats therefore we employed quantitative pcr qpcr targeting marker functional genes catalyzing the n biogeochemical cycle including the nitrifying amoa denitrifying nirs and n fixing nifh genes here we link these molecular data to the efficiency with which mats remove nitrogenous compounds from water in order to determine the relative importance of each of these pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1 microbial mat sampling microbial mats used for experiments were collected at two locations the first mat which has been previously well described bebout et al 2002 des marais 1995 was collected from area 4 near the dike with area 5 within the salt works managed by exportadora de sal sa and located near guerrero negro baja california sur mexico further referred to as baja mat the baja mat is 10 cm thick and is covered by 1 m of brine with salinity 98 and ph 7 6 sections of microbial mats 20 25 cm in area were collected on february 25 2016 and transported to nasa ames research center moffett field ca where they were incubated in aquaria with water from the sampling location under natural light until the experiment began the second mat was collected within the elkhorn slough es estuary at monterey bay california usa the previously described burow et al 2013 mats located at this field site consists of up to 1 cm thick mats dominated by coleofasciculus sp formerly microcoleus sp and lyngbya sp the areal extent of this mat further referred to as es mat varies with seasonal changes in water flow tides and nutrient inputs the salinity of the field site water at the time of collection was 55 and ph was 8 1 a single contiguous mat piece with an area of approximately 0 15 m2 was harvested on june 22 2016 after delivery to the laboratory pieces of both mats were incubated in aquaria with water from their respective sampling site 2 2 bioremediation experiment six rectangular mat pieces with a width 5 cm and a length 14 0 6 cm for es mats 9 0 6 cm for baja mats were cut fig s1 in supplementary information two mats from each site were used as controls incubated with seawater only further referred as control mats two mat pieces from each site were incubated with seawater supplemented with kno3 further referred as no3 treated mats and two mats from each site were incubated with seawater amended with nh4so4 further referred as nh4 treated mats for es mat incubations seawater with a salinity 35 from a marina near the sampling location was used artificial seawater with a salinity of 53 and the same ionic composition as water from field site was created for the baja mats due to a lack of proximity to the sampling site therefore lower salinities than the ones measured in the field at the time of collection were used for both mats in order to maximize the bioremediation potential for these mats the mats were incubated under a continuous flow rate of 100 ml day 1 and were exposed to a 16 8 h light dark photoperiod at 1200 μe m 2 s 1 from white led lamps liquid volume of the incubations was 194 2 22 8 ml the water temperature was kept constant at 16 c mats were pre incubated for 4 7 days with either seawater only controls seawater amended with 50 μm nh4 nh4 treated mats or seawater amended with 50 μm no3 no3 treated mats nitrogenous compounds were supplied to the inflow at three concentrations increasing stepwise over the course of the experiment first mats received either nh4 or no3 at a concentration of 0 5 mm for 13 days further referred as beginning phase after this period the concentration of nh4 no3 was increased to 1 mm this phase lasted 22 days further referred as middle phase finally the mats were treated with 2 mm nh4 or no3 for 10 days further referred as end phase artificial tides exposure of the mats to air for several hours were created before each concentration increase in order to simulate environmental conditions at the es sampling site to determine the concentrations of these nutrients at the outflow 2 4 ml of water was sampled every 2 4 days water samples were immediately frozen at 20 c until the analyses of nh4 and no3 were performed for microbial biological analyses cores of microbial mat 11 mm diameter 10 mm depth were sampled and frozen at 20 c at the beginning of the experiment and prior to the onset of each concentration increase the experiment was stopped when removal of nh4 or no3 by microbial mats was no longer complete i e the capacity for n removal was reached for both mats ammonium analysis was performed using a colorimetric method as described in parsons et al 1984 and no3 was analyzed using a microplate reader based colorimetric method adapted from the protocol of ringuet et al 2011 the removal efficiency re of nh4 and no3 were calculated as a percentage removed by the equation re c i c o c i 100 where c i inflow concentration μl and c o outflow concentration μl the removal rate rr of nh4 and no3 was calculated by the following equation rr c i c o m r a 1000 where rr removal rate mg n m 2 day 1 c i inflow concentration μm c o outflow concentration μm m atomic mass of n r flow rate l day 1 and a is surface area of microbial mat m2 2 3 rate of ammonium assimilation determination rates of ammonium assimilation by freshly sampled microbial mat were determined by measuring the uptake of stable isotopically labeled ammonium 15nh4cl in order to distinguish nh4 assimilation from nitrification uptake of labeled ammonium was measured with and without the addition of nitrapyrin a nitrification inhibitor widely used in soils to decrease n loss from applied fertilizer slangen and kerkhoff 1984 due to the remote location of the baja field site and the lack of freshly collected material upon which to perform measurements assimilation rates were measured only in the es mat microbial mat was sampled at the es site on december 8 2015 and delivered to the laboratory at nasa ames research center in mountain view ca within 1 2 h a total of 24 replicate vials were prepared identically as follows small subcores 11 mm diameter 10 mm depth were cut from whole sections of intact microbial mat with plastic core tubes and the cores still contained within the plastic core tubes were placed in the bottom of 38 ml serum vials a 1 agar solution made using water from the marina near the field site was added to each bottle up to the level of the top of the core tube the agar served to physically fix the plastic core into position in the bottom of the bottle and to ensure that the only contact between the cores and the overlying water was across the top of the mat fifteen ml of seawater from the marina neighboring the sampling location was then added to each bottle nitrapyrin was added to half of vials at a final concentration of 0 5 μg ml 1 one hundred μl of 10 at 15nh4cl was injected into the vials except for the controls such that the final concentration of 15nh4cl was 50 μm three vials with and three without added nitrapyrin served as controls and did not receive any 15nh4cl one ml of water was sampled at time 0 0 5 1 3 and 6 h filtered with a 0 2 μm syringe filter and stored at 20 c until nh4 analysis ammonium analysis was performed using a colorimetric method as described in parsons et al 1984 mats were sampled destructively at 1 3 and 6 h with half of a core immediately frozen in liquid n and subsequently stored in 80 c for further rna extractions and another half frozen at 20 c for bulk 15n analysis 15n analyses were performed using irms using a pdz europa anca gsl elemental analyzer interfaced to a pdz europa 20 20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer sercon ltd cheshire uk at the stable isotope facility at the university of california davis relative contribution of 15nh4 pool to the microbial mat biomass was calculated using the isotope mixing equation spott et al

molecular analyses total genomic dna was isolated from 0 13 0 03 g of a core microbial mat using the powerbiofilm dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca according to manufacturer s instructions the quality a260 a280 and quantity a260 of extracted genomic dna was determined with an implen nanophotometer p class implen gmbh munich germany quantitative pcr qpcr was used to determine gene copy numbers of specific genes in the mat as follows the abundance of bacterial 16s rrna gene was determined using the primer pairs nad f and nad r nadkarni et al 2002 the abundance of genes known to be involved in nitrogen transformations were assayed using qpcr as follows ammonia monoxygenase amoa nitrite reductase nirs and nitrogenase nifh were monitored using respectively the primer pairs amoa 1f and amoa 2r rotthauwe et al 1997 nirs cd3af and nirs r3cd throbäck et al 2004 and igk3 and dvv ando et al 2006 amplification of all genes was performed using the illumina eco real time pcr system illumina inc san diego ca usa a dilution series of cloned amoa nirs and nifh gene fragments pcr4 topo vector invitrogen carlsbad nm were used to prepare dna standards with known quantities of target dna in the case of 16s rrna qpcr a pcr product of primer set 27f and 1492r was used as a qpcr standard weisburg et al 1991 all amplifications were performed with a reaction volume of 10 μl containing 5 μl of kapa sybr fast qpcr mastermix 500 nm of each primer and 1 μl 30 95 ng of the template dna amplifications were performed with 3 min initial denaturation at 95 c followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 c 30 s at 60 c nifh at 54 c and 30 s at 72 c after amplification an amplicon melting curve was recorded in 0 3 c steps between 55 and 95 c after testing a set of dilutions for dna samples no inhibition of pcr was detected at 1 20 dilution therefore diluting 1 20 and 1 100 of dna extracts was performed the amplification efficiency for the different assays ranged between 80 and 110 and r2 was at least 0 988 quantitative pcr data were normalized by dividing gene copy number in eluted dna to the weight of microbial mat used for dna extraction total rna was extracted from 0

transcribed using superscript first strand synthesis system for rt pcr thermo fisher scientific waltman ma subsequent qpcrs were performed with the obtained cdna as described above 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analyses for differences in n removal efficiencies and gene copy numbers between different experimental phases and types of microbial mat were performed using sigma plot software sigmaplot v 13 0 microsoft normality of the data was checked using shapiro wilk test a one way analysis of variance anova was performed to check for treatment effects when significant differences were found treatment means were separated with one of pairwise multiple comparison tests tukey s dunn s or holm sidak at a p value of 0 05 error bars represent 1 standard deviation 3 results the capacity of both microbial mats to remove n contaminants and mechanisms of this removal were investigated under identical experimental conditions and throughout the same experimental time briefly while es mats had higher removal efficiency for p 0 019 the baja mats exhibited higher efficiency of removal of no3 than of nh4 p 0 001 in terms of rates however es mats had comparable removal rates for nh4 and no3 p 0 119 baja mats still had higher removal rates of no3 than of nh4 p 0 001 all the investigated mats retained viability during the whole experiment no visual differences were observed between control and nh4 no3 treated mats 3 1 ammonium removal during the beginning phase both types of microbial mat had almost complete nh4 removal 98 5 1 with baja mats showing higher removal rate than es mats as an artifact of smaller surface area of the baja mats in the es mats the removal efficiency remained high further in the middle phase and declined throughout the end phase p 0 001 fig 1 the removal rate for these mats increased throughout the beginning and middle phases and started to decrease only by the end of the end phase indicating that its treatment capacity was reached at 2 mm nh4 while still maintaining a high removal rate removal efficiency in the baja mats decreased significantly during the middle phase after the higher nh4 concentration of 1 mm was applied p 0 001 and dropped to near zero throughout the end phase of the experiment therefore these mats reached their treatment capacity at 0 5 mm nh4 subsequently es and baja microbial mats had comparable nh4 removal efficiency during the beginning phase p 0 803 but then during the middle and end phases the es mats had significantly higher removal efficiency than baja mats p 0 001 3 2 nitrate removal both es and baja microbial mats were able to remove almost all of the no3 throughout the beginning phase and first half of the middle phase 97 5 0 7 fig 2 removal rate was higher for baja mats however it was observed as an artifact of a smaller surface area of these mats in comparison with es mats considering almost complete no3 removal in both mats there was a sharp decrease in removal rates towards the end of the middle phase in both mats but rates largely recovered in both mats although no3 removal efficiency during the end phase was higher p 0 002 for es mats due to their larger surface areas removal rates for both mats were comparable p 0 941 also removal rates for both mats during the end phase did not differ from those seen during the middle phase p 0 05 indicating that their treatment capacity was reached at 1 mm no3 3 3 abundance of n cycling genes the abundance of amoa nirs nifh and bacterial 16s rrna genes were quantitatively determined for each phase of the experiment in control nh4 treated and no3 treated es and baja mats while all the studied genes were present in all phases in both microbial mat types the denitrifying nirs gene was the most abundant in all mat samples and the nitrifying amoa gene was presented by the lowest copy numbers the amoa gene did not show any variations between different treatments in either mat p 0 05 fig 3 a b furthermore no significant differences were observed between three experimental phases i e beginning middle and end in es nh4 treated mats p 0 067 conversely amoa abundance in baja nh4 treated mats was significantly different between the experimental phases with higher numbers during the middle phase than the end phase p 0 033 also a significant difference in amoa gene abundance between nh4 treated es and baja mats was detected during the end experimental phase p 0 004 no significant differences in nirs gene abundance were detected between different treatments in either the es or baja mats p 0 05 fig 4 a b nirs gene abundances between experimental phases in both types of no3 treated mats also lacked variations p 0 05 nirs gene abundance was significantly higher in no3 treated es mats than in no3 treated baja mats at the end phase of the experiment p 0 006 nifh gene abundances also did not vary between different treatments p 0 05 fig 5 a b interestingly in both es and baja no3 treated mats nifh gene abundance was significantly higher during the middle phase in comparison with beginning and end phases p 0 019 for es and 0 025 for baja mats moreover nifh gene copy numbers were significantly higher in no3 es mats than in no3 treated baja mats p 0 050 3 4 relative importance of ammonium assimilation and nitrification ammonium consumption by microbial mats conducted with and without nitrapyrin additions was not significantly different p 0 830 indicating that nitrification was likely not quantitatively important in these mats additional support for this hypothesis was provided through direct measurements of the incorporation of 15n labeled ammonium into biomass by the es mats measurements of bulk 15n in microbial mat biomass showed assimilation of 15nh4 by microbial mat at a rate between 39 4 14 0 to 115 9 6 4 mg n m 2 day 1 for the set with nitrapyrin and from 26 7 15 0 to 90 6 19 1 mg n m 2 day 1 for the set without nitrapyrin fig 6 and were not significantly different p 0 647 as an independent check for the presence of nitrification and also denitrification rt qpcr was also performed on these samples specifically targeting amoa and nirs gene transcripts these transcripts were not detected in any of the mat samples to validate the negative rt qpcr results another rt qpcr targeting 16s rrna gene transcripts was performed in the same samples positive results were obtained for the 16s rrna gene in all samples fig s2 in supplementary information and that is evidence of a functioning rt qpcr method 4 discussion both microbial mats studied here were capable of removing nh4 and no3 at concentrations of up to 2 mm this illustrates the potential of using naturally occurring microbial mat communities for bioremediation of nitrogenous compounds at concentrations which these compounds would be considered to be environmentally significant contaminants i e when they exceed recommended epa and who levels one example of an effective use of microbial mats is in the treatment of hydraulic fracturing wastewater akyon et al 2015 that has high salinity high heavy metal content and significant total kjeldahl n concentration of up to 5200 mg l 1 no3 up to 2670 mg l 1 and nh4 up to 352 mg l 1 mcelreath 2011 thacker et al 2015 some conventional wastewater treatment techniques such as activated sludge treatment are not suitable for high salinity wastewater linari et al 2013 wang et al 2005 contrariwise microbial mats due to their tolerance to high salinity and high concentrations of heavy metals may represent an appropriate treatment technology for hydraulic fracturing wastewater another application of microbial mats is in aquaculture the pollution of seawater with dissolved inorganic nutrients like n and phosphorus has been a problem resulting from the practice of aquaculture kamilya et al 2006 microbial mats are used as an effluent filtering system for aquaculture wastewater to decrease elevated nutrient concentrations banerjee et al 2015 bender et al 2004 a preincubation period of about 4 7 days was sufficient to realize the highest removal efficiencies reported here studies examining n removal using microalgae have also reported high removal efficiencies after a comparable preincubation time gonzález et al 1997 martı nez et al 2000 albeit not at the higher concentrations reported here natural mats have uniquely high diversity ley et al 2006 that may not be fully represented in an artificially created mat and this makes them a more complex system to study but with the potential to contain a greater diversity of organisms involved in n removal the 2 mm nh4 no3 concentrations applied in our study were much higher than the up to 0 6 mm nh4 no3 previously reported in literature for artificial microbial mats banerjee et al 2015 lezama cervantes et al 2010 zamora castro et al 2008 and removal efficiencies for the mats studied here were higher for these high concentrations than the ones reported for the artificial mats in terms of rates however microbial mats used in this study had lower removal rates than immobilized periphytic cyanobacteria studied by banerjee et al 2015 and constructed microbial mats investigated by zamora castro et al 2008 therefore naturally growing microbial mats can be useful where higher contaminant concentrations are observed recognizing a need to be operated under a lower flow rate or across a larger surface area than artificial mats removal rates by natural microbial mats used in this study of up to 300 mg n m 2 day 1 can be compared to plant uptake rate for phragmites australis during growth 200 670 mg n m 2 day 1 molle et al 2008 this indicates that naturally growing microbial mats can be as efficient in n uptake as some plants used in contaminated water treatment possible mechanisms of nh4 removal include volatilization anammox microbial assimilation and nitrification the loss of nh4 through free ammonia volatilization under the experimental conditions used here ph 7 6 and 8 1 and temperature 16 c could account for up to 10 of the reported rates umweltbundesamt 1996 although anammox was not investigated in this study this process has been shown to be of low importance in other microbial mats bonin and michotey 2006 anammox has also been examined in these same mats but no activity was detected coban et al in prep the measured rates of nh4 assimilation in es mats could account for all of the nh4 removal in these mats during the beginning phase however the rate of nh4 removal by es mats was higher during the middle and end phases and this could indicate that the estimated nh4 assimilation rate was not the maximal potential rate of nh4 assimilation for es mat or that other processes such as nitrification were probably involved in nh4 removal although 15nh4 assimilation rate data is lacking for baja mats lower nh4 removal rates were observed in these mats with nh4 actually being released expressed as a negative removal rate at the end of the experiment this release could be explained by a combination of mineralization ammonification the conversion of organic n into nh4 that occurs throughout the whole experiment in these mats and lower assimilation rates during the end phase an alternative hypothesis is higher rates of mineralization during the end phase as a result of high nh4 concentrations causing decomposition of these mats this hypothesis would also be supported by the high nh4 concentrations in outflow of no3 treated baja mats fig s3 in supplementary information our results from two different microbial mats appear to demonstrate that the importance of nitrification in nh4 removal differed between these two mats a lack of amoa gene copy number differences between control nh4 and no3 treatments in es mats suggests that nh4 addition did not enhance growth of the population of nitrifying bacteria in nh4 treated mats relative to control and no3 treated mats furthermore a lack of amoa gene abundance response to increases in nh4 concentration in es mats over the experimental time may indicate that nitrification is not an important pathway of n cycling in the es microbial mats in contrast amoa gene abundance in baja mats declined after 2 mm nh4 addition decreases in nh4 removal efficiencies during the end phase in comparison with beginning and middle phases is consistent with decreases in nitrifier growth under high inorganic n concentrations and nh4 removal via nitrification in the baja mats whereas the lack of a difference between assimilation rate with and without nitrapyrin is consistent with the absence of nitrification in es mats fig 6 we were unfortunately not able to confirm assimilation as the pathway for nh4 removal in similar experiments with the baja mat further support for the absence of nitrification in the es mats is provided by the lack of amoa gene transcripts after nh4 addition lastly conclusions drawn here on the basis of amoa gene abundance data are in a good agreement with nitrification rate data measured using isotope dilution technique for these types of mats coban et al in prep which also show that nitrification was present in baja mats while low or almost absent in es mats in summary while assimilation was mainly responsible for nh4 removal in es mats a combination of assimilation and possibly nitrification processes contributed to nh4 removal in baja mats while some studies have shown the presence of nitrification and denitrification in microbial mats bonin and michotey 2006 joye and paerl 1994 others report the dominance of assimilatory ammonia metabolism and absence of nitrification genes in microbial mat metagenomes varin et al 2010 as was the case with nh4 removal es and baja mats exhibited different mechanisms of no3 removal possible no3 removal pathways include denitrification and microbial assimilation as well as dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra a lack of significant differences between control nh4 and no3 treatments and between beginning middle and end experimental phases indicates that there is little or no effect of no3 addition on denitrifying nirs population in both types of mats possibly signifying that most added no3 was assimilated into microbial biomass however decreased nirs gene abundance in baja mats at the end phase of the experiment could be evidence of an inhibition of denitrifier growth presumably by high concentrations of inorganic n present at that time in fact denitrification must occur in these mats following nitrification as evidenced by the presence of nitrification and low no3 outflow concentrations in nh4 treated baja mats fig s4 in supplementary information in contrast based on nirs gene abundance data there was no evidence for any process other than assimilation to eliminate no3 in es mats a denitrification rate measurement performed using the isotope pairing technique in these mats revealed that denitrification was absent in both baja and es mats coban et al in prep another n cycling pathway that could explain some of the observations presented here is dnra this process converts no3 to nh4 and therefore does not change total n concentration elevated nh4 concentrations in outflow of no3 treated baja mats p 0 005 fig s3 in supplementary information could be evidence for the occurrence of dnra in these mats a similar elevation of nh4 was not observed in the es mats dnra has been reported in a microbial mat growing at salinities comparable to those experienced by baja mats 95 130 bonin and michotey 2006 although its quantitative contribution to n cycling in the mats described in aforementioned study was small an alternative explanation for the high nh4 concentrations in outflow of no3 treated baja mats are high mineralization rates as was also shown by a negative removal rate at the end of the experiment by the nh4 treated baja mats due to nh4 release via mineralization we also investigated how high inorganic n additions affect n fixing community in microbial mats as nitrogen fixation has been demonstrated to be an important source of nitrogen for microbial mats in a number of previous studies bebout et al 1987 omoregie et al 2004 stal et al 1984 woebken et al 2015 the energetically expensive process of nitrogen fixation is known to be suppressed by the availability of more readily assumable forms of fixed nitrogen following no3 concentration increase during the middle phase the abundance of a gene known to be required for nitrogen fixation nifh increased but then subsequently decreased during the end phase in no3 treated es and baja mats therefore the effects of no3 additions on the n fixing community in our study are not clear there is considerable ambiguity about the effects of no3 on nitrogen fixation in previous reports while many studies show inhibition e g holl and montoya 2005 pinckney et al 1995 others report no effect or even stimulation of nitrogenase activity lee and joye 2006 liengen 1999 merbach et al 1997 after addition of inorganic n and specifically no3 in pure and mixed microbial cultures as well as microbial mats further research is needed to clarify the relationship between inorganic n addition and n fixation in microbial mats 5 conclusions in this study the potential of two different types of naturally growing microbial mats for removal of nitrogenous contaminants was evaluated both microbial mats were capable of high up to 2 mm nh4 no3 uptake while es mats showed no indication of any removal pathway other than assimilation baja mats had some evidence of nitrification denitrification and dnra pathways in addition to assimilation this study demonstrates uptake of high concentrations of n by naturally occurring microbial mats and it introduces their potential in applications for contaminated seawater treatment the nitrogen fixing microbial community appeared to be affected by the nitrate additions and this relationship should be investigated further

19258,fouling is one of the most pressing limitations during operation of membrane bioreactors as it increases operating costs and is the cause of short membrane lifespans conducting effective physical cleanings is thus essential for keeping membrane operation above viable performance limits the nature of organic foulants present in the sludge and the membrane properties are among the most influential factors determining fouling development and thus efficiency of fouling mitigation approaches the role of other factors like sludge viscosity on fouling is still unclear given that contradictory effects have been reported in the literature in the present study we use a new research approach by which the complex interplay between fouling type levels of permeate flux membrane material and feed properties is analyzed and the influence of these factors on critical flux and membrane permeability is evaluated a variety of systems including activated sludge and model solutions with distinct rheological behavior has been investigated for two membranes differing in pore size distribution we present a novel method for assessing the efficiency of fouling removal by backwash and compare it with the efficiency achieved by means of relaxation results obtained have proven that backwash delays development of critical fouling as compared with relaxation and reduces fouling irreversibility regardless of fluid rheology it was shown that backwash is especially effective for membranes for which internal fouling is the main cause of loss in permeability nonetheless we found out that for membranes with tight pores both relaxation and backwash are equally effective the critical flux decreases significantly for high viscosity fluids such as activated sludge this effect is mainly caused by an intensified concentration polarization at the feed side rather than by internal fouling events however membrane permeability has been proven to rely more on the permeate viscosity than on the feed viscosity poor rejection of organic fractions showcasing high viscosity causes an acute decline in membrane permeability as a consequence of increased shear stress inside the membrane

integration of membrane separation units with the biochemical degradation of pollutants in membrane bioreactors mbrs makes feasible operating wastewater treatment systems at high biomass concentrations this is done without compromising the effluent quality owing to the high solid liquid separation efficiency yielded by the membranes mbr technology is particularly appropriate for the implementation of water reuse schemes in areas of acute water stress the advantages of mbrs compared to conventional activated sludge processes such as their robust performance high effluent quality and reduced footprint holloway et al 2015 meng et al 2017 together with the progress achieved in this field during the last years have contributed to expand their implementation nonetheless membrane fouling is an unavoidable outcome of membrane filtration that still poses to be the most serious challenge in mbrs as it ultimately entails an increase in operating costs zhang et al 2014 the accumulation of matter on the membrane surface and inside the porous membrane network results in increased transmembrane pressures tmp and or decreased permeate fluxes j p thus diminishing the specific process throughput a critical fouling phenomenon is the manifestation of an acute tmp jump when a specific permeate flux usually called critical flux j c r is surpassed or when mbr systems are operated at demanding conditions for long periods fouling in immersed mbrs is caused by different types of species i e inorganic compounds microbial flocs or organic molecules among them extracellular polymeric substances eps are considered to be one of the major fouling initiators eps is a term which comprises organic macromolecules that are released by microorganisms including mainly polysaccharides and proteins but also other compounds such as nucleic acids and lipids lin et al 2014 eps show a three dimensional gelatinous matrix which provides cell to cell scaffolding bar zeev et al 2015 gel layers can seriously compromise the operability of mbrs especially when aggravated by interactions taking place with inorganic foulants wei et al 2011 besides the nature of the foulants operating conditions and membrane properties have a crucial impact on fouling development in immersed membrane filtration diverse studies have found correlations between fouling propensity and membrane properties such as hydrophilicity roughness or pore size hashino et al 2011 kochkodan and hilal 2015 meng et al 2017 as evident from the above discussion fouling mitigation strategies in mbr systems are indispensable they are usually classified into a physical and b chemical cleaning the former implies the utilization of relaxation and backwash procedures which are able to effectively remove gross solids attached to the membrane and even detach loosely formed cake the latter involves the use of chemical reagents in order to remove the physically irreversible fouling which refers to fouling that cannot be removed by using physical cleaning wang et al 2014 the two prevailing chemicals used are sodium hypochlorite for the organic fouling and citric acid for the inorganic fouling these chemicals attack the interactions between the different foulants as well as between the foulants and the membrane although chemical cleaning has proven to be a highly effective method for fouling removal its frequency should ideally be limited to a minimum level as when applied repeatedly it reduces the lifespan of the membranes le clech et al 2006 meng et al 2009 accordingly physical cleaning is usually preferred as it does not imply chemical degradation of membranes and can be implemented more frequently both relaxation and backwash have been extensively applied to hollow fiber membranes where backwash has been demonstrated to be more effective in keeping low irreversible fouling rates zsirai et al 2012 yet the application of backwash is not as practical for polymeric flat sheet membranes as it can induce delamination of the active layers or membrane detachment from the panels le clech et al 2006 wang et al 2014 nevertheless backwashable flat sheet membranes with enhanced mechanical integrity have recently been introduced such membranes are based on pocket configurations or on the integration of spacer fabrics between two flat sheet membranes doyen et al 2010 wang et al 2014 fouling phenomena are commonly investigated by utilizing flux stepping protocols which serve for assessing the evolution of permeability at different flux levels and for determining critical permeate fluxes the simplest flux stepping method called here conventional flux step method cfsm is based on filtrating during short periods with stepwise increments of the flux level the tmp transients induced by an increased deposition of foulants occurring after each step transition are then evaluated van der marel et al modified the cfsm by introducing relaxation steps between each flux increase van der marel et al 2009 in such a way they calculated critical fluxes with intercalated physical cleanings as it is usually practiced in mbrs additionally the permeability of the membranes measured after each cleaning step allows calculating the critical flux for irreversibility j c r i r r which is defined as the flux at which fouling cannot be removed by intermediate physical cleanings they coined this method with the term improved flux step method or shortly ifsm the efficiency of the intermediate physical cleaning may however vary depending on the cleaning procedure applied in this vein backwash is expected to be more effective in removing cohesive fouling than relaxation although at the expense of reducing water production rates nevertheless there is no clear knowledge about to which extent backwash is more effective than relaxation and whether there are specific cases where one of both physical cleanings is preferred comparison of efficiency of both physical cleaning methods in flat sheet membranes is necessary in order to find optimum operating conditions for mbrs the peculiar rheology of biological activated sludge increases complexity of fouling in mbrs activated sludge is usually highly viscous due to the presence of biological flocs eps and suspended solids this effect is even intensified in the case of mbr sludge owing to its high concentration in mixed liquor suspended solids mlss high viscosities may turn into considerably high energy costs because of higher demands of aeration for both oxygen transfer and membrane scouring as well as for permeate pumping laera et al 2007 on the one hand as solution viscosity varies within diffusion boundary layers a high viscosity is expected at the membrane surface thus intensifying concentration polarization and decreasing mass transfer rates charcosset and choplin 1995 on the other hand activated sludge is also known to exhibit shear thinning properties rosenberger et al 2016 pritchard et al observed that an increase in bulk viscosity during the ultrafiltration of a non newtonian fluid caused an increase in permeate flux this effect was attributed to the maximum shear stress taking place at the membrane surface implying lower viscosities at the membrane interface when shear thinning fluids are filtrated howell et al 1996 pritchard et al 1995 in view of the complexity of fouling processes in mbrs the present work aims to provide a systematic approach to characterize fouling occurring in immersed flat sheet membranes by considering interactions between fluid rheology membrane pore sizes and physical cleaning procedures a special emphasis is given to effects of backwash filtration on the development of critical fouling phenomena to this end for the first time a novel flux step method including intermediate backwash steps is developed and compared to the ifsm procedure effects on hydraulic resistance critical flux and irreversibility of fouling are assessed for membranes with different pore size distributions and for a variety of solutions having newtonian and non newtonian behavior in consequence the principal objective of this work is to identify interactions between different process parameters which are relevant for fouling development in mbrs given the variety and often contradictory conclusions drawn from different studies across the literature drews 2010 we aim at providing a clear interpretation to the correlation between these parameters and their influence on the performance of immersed mbrs 2 experimental 2 1 materials two different commercial ultrafiltration membranes were selected for conducting the present study the membrane up150 microdyn nadir germany from here on referred to as up and the membrane ly100 synder filtration united states referred as ly the active layer of both membranes is made of polyethersulfone pes while the backing material is polypropylene for up and polyester for ly the up membrane has a molecular weight cut off mwco specification of 150 kda whereas the ly has a mwco of 100 kda the contact angle at the active layer is 55 86 3 27 for up and 72 72 3 29 for ly a synthetic model wastewater sww resembling the typical composition of wastewater was selected for the present investigation the type of compounds and their concentrations were selected based on previous studies xing et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 sodium alginate 50 mg l glucose 100 mg l and bsa 10 mg l were selected as typical polysaccharides and proteins respectively which are also the most typical model foulants for eps sodium bicarbonate 100 mg l magnesium sulfate 30 mg l and calcium chloride 111 mg l were selected in order to set constant ionic environment for all experiments for the sake of comparison other solutions with different rheological behavior were also investigated the same compounds and concentrations were used with a 30 v v glycerin water mixture high viscosity wastewater hv sww with the aim of simulating fouling under viscosity conditions close to those found in mbr sludges finally the results were also contrasted with activated sludge taken from a real mbr treating wastewaters generated in the food industry the sludge had a mlss concentration of 15 g l and the mbr was operated with a sludge retention time of approximately 28 days in order to ensure constant conditions of the sludge samples throughout the experiments and to avoid further microbial growth as well as degradation of potential foulants sodium azide nan3 was added to the samples with a concentration of 0 02 w w additionally the samples were stored at a temperature below 5 c 2 2 setups and procedures the rheological behavior of the three different samples was obtained using a rheometer mcr 102 anton paar with a double gap cylinder dg42 measuring system at a controlled temperature of 25 c this type of measurement system is composed of a concentric cylinder which has relatively larger surface areas and lower gap distances as compared to other measuring systems this makes double gap cylinders more appropriate for liquids with low viscosities and avoids the early onset of turbulences at low shear rates flow curves ranging from shear rates of 1 s 1 up to 2000 s 1 were registered chromatographic measurements of pre filtered mbr sludge were performed in order to obtain the molecular characterization of different compounds present in it additionally the feed wastewater and mbr permeate were also analyzed these samples were vacuum filtered to remove suspended solids employing a regenerated cellulose filter with a pore size of 0 45 μ m the different samples were injected in volumes from 20 μ l to 100 μ l in a hplc 1100 instrument agilent applying a flow rate of 1 ml min the separation was performed using the columns suprema 10 μ m and suprema 30 a 10 μ m from polymer standards service gmbh the detection was carried out utilizing a diode array detector at a wavelength of 254 nm in combination with a refractive index detector in order to calibrate the molecular weight distribution with the elution volume times different dextran standards were injected and analyzed having peak maximums corresponding to the following molecular weights 180 342 1080 4400 9900 21400 124000 and 401000 da a preliminary characterization of the membrane structure was conducted for both membranes scanning electron microscopy sem images of both membranes were taken and pore size characterization was conducted by means of mwco measurements for the mwco measurements a stirred dead end filtration unit was used at a tmp of 0 5 bar the solution filtered was a mixture of different dextran standards with a total concentration of 2 5 g l 0 5 g l dextran 40 kda 1 g l dextran 100 kda and 1 g l dextran 500 kda the concentrations of dextrans of different molecular weight in feed and permeate were determined by size exclusion chromatography sec using a refractive index detector dextrans have different affinity to the column depending on their molecular weight so that the evolution of the strength of the refractive index signal provides the molecular weight distribution of the different samples accordingly the rejection curves can be obtained by calculating 1 w p w f for each molecular weight where w p and w f represent the mass fraction of dextrans in permeate and feed respectively the mwco90 which corresponds to a 90 of solute rejection was then calculated for both membranes the membrane filtration experiments were conducted using a setup described in detail in a previous publication martí calatayud and wessling 2017 in which a panel with two flat sheet membranes clamped at both its sides was immersed into the reactor and it was aerated via two blowers placed below the filtration module the permeate was extracted via a peristaltic pump ismatec reglo the speed of which was regulated and automated using a data logger and control system based on the software dasylab the pressure at the permeate side was measured by using a pressure sensor wika type d 10 wika and was registered in order to calculate the tmp by means of the following equation 1 t m p p f e e d p p e r m e a t e where p f e e d was taken as the atmospheric pressure the aeration in the membrane reactor was supplied by an air compressor aquaforte v60 the aeration flow was set constant at 1 l min the volume capacity of the reactor is 3 3 l and the effective membrane area was 126 cm2 fig 1 shows comparison between the so called improved flux step method ifsm introduced by van der marel et al van der marel et al 2009 and the novel backwash step method bwsm designed and implemented for the first time in the present article as mentioned above the permeate flux j p in the cfsm is increased step wise until the maximum is reached and then decreased again in a descending phase the ifsm fig 1 a includes a relaxation step after each filtration period and prior to implementing a subsequent flux increase here it is to be noted that the relaxation step is not a complete cessation of filtration but an intermediate filtration step at a very low flux where aeration is maintained in the present work we introduce a new method for characterizing membrane filtration with intermediate backwash cleaning as can be seen in fig 1 b at the start of the filtration function the flux is small so it is impractical to apply very high backwash fluxes and consume more permeate than that produced during the previous filtration in such case a compromise between backwash duration and intensity was found where the backwash was selected to be half of the previous filtration flux 2 j b w j p 2 within the central part of the bwsm function a standard maximum backwash flux j b w m a x was implemented the selected value along with the backwash duration 2 min was optimized during preliminary experiments so as to ensure effective membrane cleaning an additional feature common to the flux step methods implemented in the present work is that all of them count with an uprising phase where the flux is gradually increased and a symmetrical descending phase which is used in order to identify hysteresis phenomena indicative of irreversible fouling the conduction of ifsm and bwsm is used in order to identify changes in membrane permeability after different types of physical cleaning for a wide range of operating fluxes the filtration steps were increased by 5 lmh until they reached a maximum flux j p m a x slightly above 100 lmh for the experiments conducted with sww due to the higher viscosity of mbr sludge and hv sww the maximum flux was set to 30 lmh for these solutions and the step increase was selected to be 2 5 lmh 3 results 3 1 rheology of used solutions and membrane characterization the viscosity of mbr activated sludge and of sww were measured in order to check the disparity between the samples subsequently the viscosity of the sludge was taken as a reference in order to prepare hv sww the viscosity at high shear rates of 1000 s 1 0 0032 pa s was considered to determine the proportion of glycerin to be used and prepare hv sww based on the formulas provided by cheng for water glycerin mixtures cheng 2008 fig 2 shows the dependency of viscosity on shear rate for the three solutions considered in line with the rheological calculations of sludge samples reported in previous studies rosenberger et al 2016 the mbr activated sludge clearly shows shear thinning properties since viscosity significantly decreases at increasing shear rates the viscosity of sww at high shear rates 1000 s 1 0 00109 pa s is close to that of water hence indicating that addition of foulants does not significantly alter the solution viscosity in this range of shear rates however the addition of foulants imparts non newtonian behavior to the mixture the dependency of viscosity on shear rates is very similar to that observed for the sludge here it must be mentioned that the increase in viscosity observed for higher shear rates 1000 s 1 is caused by taylor vortices occurring in the rheometer which should not be taken into account ratkovich et al 2013 the viscosity of hv sww solutions at a shear rate of 1000 s 1 prepared with 30 v v glycerin practically coincides as expected with that of the sludge however their rheological behavior notably differs from that of sww and mbr sludge hv sww basically showcases a newtonian behavior and it only shows noticeable variations at shear rates lower than 10 s 1 the rheogram of fig 2 b confirms these observations mbr sludge and sww exhibit an attenuating increase in shear stress at increasing shear rates on the contrary hv sww shows a linear trend the rheograms were fitted to the herschel bulkley model commonly used for modeling activated sludge rheology rosenberger et al 2016 3 τ τ 0 k γ n where τ represents the shear stress p a s τ 0 the yield stress p a k the flow consistency index p a s n and n the cross rate constant the exponent n takes values lower than 1 for shear thinning fluids 1 for newtonian fluids and higher values for shear thickening fluids the fittings obtained for mbr sludge and sww were τ 0 144 0 028 γ 0 69 and τ 0 018 0 002 γ 0 89 respectively consequently the cross rate constants of 0 69 for mbr sludge and 0 89 for sww corroborate their non newtonian properties on the contrary the rheological behavior of hv sww could be fitted with the power law function τ 0 003 γ 0 99 which confirms its newtonian properties regarding the membrane characterization sec retention curves calculated for both membranes are presented in fig 3 a the experimental mwco values determined were 186 kda and 1615 kda for the ly and up membrane respectively this difference implies a significant disparity between the pore sizes of both membranes in addition to this the range of pore sizes of the up membrane is significantly broader as it encloses values from around 1 kda to above 104 kda sem pictures of the surface of both membranes also illustrate substantial differences regarding the pore sizes ly pores are very difficult to be seen in the picture due to their small width while the active layer of up has larger pores and in general less uniform pore sizes throughout the membrane surface lower porosity of the ly membrane can also be inferred from the pictures 3 2 fouling tests with the improved flux step method fig 4 shows one of the results obtained after applying the ifsm procedure for sww solutions schematic determinations of the critical flux j c r and the critical flux for irreversibility j c r i r r are included in the graph tmp increases during the filtration steps with different slopes depending on the level of permeate flux in the ascending phase at low fluxes a steady tmp value is reached whereas at higher fluxes the tmp increase is more acute drawing two lines connecting the last tmp values registered during the filtration steps at low and high fluxes allows us to calculate an approximate estimation of the j c r which in the example figure takes a value of 65 lmh the response in the descending part of the graph shows a significant asymmetry compared to the ascending part which gives an indication of cohesive fouling occurring during the experiment thus membrane permeability cannot be restored to its initial values just by decreasing flux an additional feature of the ifsm protocol is the profile of tmps registered during the relaxation steps here also the final tmp values rely strongly on the previously applied flux at low fluxes tmp reaches almost the same residual value however at fluxes higher than j c r the tmp value remaining before the beginning of new filtration steps increases considerably and does not recover the initial value registered for low fluxes the trends of tmp during relaxation after applying high and low fluxes were also fitted to visually indicate the calculation of j c r i r r as in van der marel et al taking a value of 80 lmh for the case presented in the graph j c r i r r exceeds j c r significantly van der marel et al 2009 these results indicate that at fluxes slightly higher than j c r the development of fouling has a reversible character and thus can be removed by intermediate relaxation cycles however at fluxes higher than j c r i r r the efficacy of relaxation decreases a possible reason for this difference could be the transition between the deposition of loosely attached fouling and the development of cohesive fouling caused by the compression of fouling deposits the access of foulants to the pores at higher driving forces or the growth of thicker gel layers on the membrane surface could also explain the differences between j c r and j c r i r r indeed the formation of a gel layer on the membrane surface was verified at the end of each experiment the values of j c r and j c r i r r were calculated accurately by treating the data from the ifsm experiments and representing t m p j p against see fig 5 1 j p these plots are analogous to the cowan brown plots used in electrodialysis for determining limiting currents baker 2004 martí calatayud et al 2013 basically t m p j p is proportional to the hydraulic resistance and is represented against the inverse of the permeate flux after t m p j p reaches a minimum the j c r is exceeded and the resistance of the system grows abruptly therefore the permeate flux corresponding to the minimum in the plots can be used to directly extract the values of j c r and j c r i r r from their respective curves the same procedure was employed with all membrane systems for all repetitions the average values of both types of critical flux are summarized in table 1 the values obtained for both membranes are strongly dependent on the type of solution used while the differences between both membranes are small dependency between critical fluxes and solution viscosity can be observed since the values obtained for sww are by far the highest yet the values obtained for hv sww and mbr sludge differ significantly on the basis of the rheological properties of the samples alone these differences were in principle not expected as both solutions have the same viscosity at high shear rates and the viscosity at low shear rates is even lower for hv sww cf fig 2 another remarkable fact is that as exemplified in fig 4 in all cases j c r i r r exceeds j c r considerably thus the intermediate regime where fouling develops faster but can still be removed by intermediate relaxation is common to all membrane and solution combinations the representation of flux against the last tmp values of each filtration step for all membrane solution combinations tested are presented in fig 6 regarding the differences between both membranes it can be seen that in general the permeability of up is higher than that of ly these differences are mostly determined by the membrane porosity although the higher hydrophilicity of up may also contribute to the higher permeabilities obtained for this membrane the slight differences in j c r between both membranes seem to be caused also by the differences regarding the size and distribution of pores the attainment of a sufficiently high local flux at some small pores can boost colloid colloid interactions and initiate their coagulation at the pore entrance consequently some parts of the membrane surface become impermeable and the local flux at the remaining permeable parts intensifies leading to the strong increase in resistance after exceeding j c r with the ly membrane the lower density of pores implies higher local fluxes hence leading to lower values of j c r besides membrane permeability and critical fluxes the differences between the ascending and descending phase of ifsm experiments also give an idea of fouling reversibility the same permeate flux causes higher tmp values at the descending phase due to irreversible fouling deposited during the previous flux steps accordingly the area between the j p tmp curves registered in the ascending and descending phases provides an estimation of the irreversible character of fouling taking place during the measurement in fig 6 all curves except for the system up sludge exhibit a hysteresis loop indicating that irreversible fouling has occurred during the measurements conversely in the case of up sludge the ascending and descending phases of the ifsm measurement coincide as fouling deposited during each filtration step is removed during the intermediate relaxation these results are also in agreement with the fact that no j c r i r r could be obtained from the data treatment see table 1 as long as j c r i r r is not exceeded the influence of fouling history is practically absent in the curves 3 3 fouling tests with the backwash step method the bwsm was implemented for the same solutions and membranes as the ifsm fig 7 shows an example of the evolution of tmp obtained during these experiments the first observable fact is the almost symmetrical evolution of tmp in the ascending and descending phases which already gives an idea of the reversible nature of fouling deposited during the experiment intermediate backwash steps are able to remove fouling before it turns into irreversible the tmp evolution during a filtration step is similar to that during normal ifsm experiments however the evolution during the backwash is remarkably different the attainment of negative pressures indicates the effective change of the direction of flux through the membranes taking place during the physical cleanings since the permeate pressure sensor is only able to measure values up to 110 mbar it was not possible to register higher tmp values during backwash as seen from the graph backwash is mostly effective in removing foulants since the increase in tmp during a subsequent filtration step is substantially attenuated fig 8 shows a comparison between the fouling curves obtained from ifsm and bwsm experiments with sww and hv sww solutions all cases show the same behavior at fluxes below j c r the curves obtained from both methods are similar whereas at higher fluxes the change in permeability for the bwsm curves is very smooth compared to that observed for ifsm where the increase in membrane resistance is very notorious backwash intercalated between filtration steps induces a delay or attenuation of fouling within the range of fluxes tested which is not achieved by means of relaxation in view of these results backwash demonstrated to be capable to remove more cohesive fouling than relaxation thus preventing or rather postponing the attainment of a j c r this effect is also evident from the hysteresis observed with ifsm which is absent in the case of the bwsm despite the apparently similar permeability obtained from both methods at low fluxes the values calculated indicate substantial differences in some cases which are not directly observable from the graph due to the used scales table 2 summarizes the permeability of each system with ifsm and bwsm protocols the values shown are the averages of the different repetitions conducted in each case as already seen in section 3 2 the permeability of ly is smaller compared to that of up in all cases again these results correspond with the low density of pores observed for the ly membrane in fig 3 b with regard to the different solutions the trends follow the decreasing order sww mbr sludge hv sww curiously the permeability obtained with mbr sludge is close to the one obtained with sww although both solutions differ in terms of viscosity significantly regarding the differences between membrane permeability obtained with intermediate relaxation and intermediate backwash steps the performance of the up membrane seems to be more influenced by the type of physical cleaning it seems that the up membrane is more affected by pore clogging even at low permeate fluxes while ly gets clogged only when high tmp values are applied and foulants get trapped or form a gel layer 4 discussion the results obtained showed different trends depending on the type of membrane material and on the solution characteristics a remarkable observation is the low permeability of the ly membrane caused by the low density of pores available for the transport of water however this membrane showed low fouling propensity at undercritical fluxes as revealed by the modest change in permeability when applying intermediate relaxation or backwash the small pore size of ly makes this membrane less susceptible to pore clogging as foulants are rejected to a higher extent and their access to the internal membrane structure is hindered this hindrance is only overcome when high driving forces are applied concentration polarization is intensified and j c r is attained compared to relaxation the application of backwash at undercritical fluxes does not provide a significant improvement in fouling removal regardless of solution viscosity under conditions of low flux and small pore sizes implementation of relaxation would suffice to remove the loosely attached fouling and backwash would only imply a loss of permeate production on the contrary applying of backwash to membranes with a broader pore size distribution like up can be advantageous already at low fluxes as internal fouling may develop even at low fluxes when solutes and pore sizes are similar the results obtained are in agreement with the observations of le clech et al narrow pore size distributions reduce the inhomogeneous flow distribution between pores that lead to preferential deposition and blockage of membranes with large pores le clech et al 2006 in the regime of high fluxes the advantages of using backwash are generalized for both membranes the values of j c r and j c r i r r calculated with intermediate relaxations do not correspond with the development of critical fouling when physical cleaning is conducted by backwash in this regard intermediate backwash is able to suppress or delay the attainment of a critical flux in addition to this the curves obtained in the ascending and descending phase of the bwsm experiments are overlapping and verify the lack of hysteresis accordingly a high degree of reversibility of fouling can be ensured by backwash as the j p tmp evolution remains independent of the membrane filtration history these observations indicate that formation of gel layers may be the main phenomenon originating critical fluxes in the present work formation of gel layers contrary to pore clogging may evolve similarly for both types of membranes as it is not as much affected by the pore size unexpected phenomena have also been observed regarding the role of solution viscosity on membrane performance the permeability of both membranes when filtering mbr sludge is in the same range as for sww although the viscosity of the sludge is threefold higher the viscosity of activated sludge increases with the sludge mlss and has been attributed a relevant role on causing increased fouling rates laera et al 2007 rosenberger et al 2002 higher mlss concentrations are also related to higher production of eps in this respect numerous studies have been conducted to assess effects of viscosity sludge retention times and mlss concentration of mbr sludge on membrane fouling and permeability meng et al 2007 wu et al 2007 moreau et al 2009 nonetheless conclusions drawn across different studies are frequently contradictory the complexity of sludge matrices makes it especially difficult to extract clear trends from different experimental results often some specific sludge properties are the focus of research while other relevant factors are overlooked in order to elucidate the reason for the relatively high permeabilities obtained with mbr sludge compared to hv sww solutions a deeper investigation of the fractions present in the mbr sludge was performed the filtrate of mbr sludge using a filter with pore size of 0 45 μ m was characterized by means of sec in order to obtain an estimation of the fractions of molecular weights present in the sludge fig 9 shows the molecular characterization of the sludge filtrate mbr feed wastewater and mbr permeate compounds with high molecular weights appear at low elution volumes while smaller molecules are detected at larger elution volumes the verticals drawn in the graph correspond to the characteristic peak maximums detected when dextran standards were injected they serve as a reference to assign certain molecular weights with different elution volumes given the assumption that they interact similarly with the column as the sludge filtrate molecular weight bands appearing at elution volumes lower than 6 2 ml thus correspond with high molecular weight bio polymers these compounds are not present in the incoming mbr wastewater so that they are related to biomass growth in the bioreactor the peak appearing at 7 8 7 9 ml is common to the three samples analyzed hence it is probably associated with polysaccharides present in the wastewater and also with eps with a molecular weight ranging from 350 da up to 4 4 kda finally the last peak corresponds to nan3 added to the samples in order to prevent microbial growth in the measuring devices the chromatograms indicate that the fraction of bio polymers rejected by the membrane is probably the principal contribution to the high sludge viscosity in order to corroborate this hypothesis the viscosities of permeate samples obtained when filtering the three solutions considered were also measured the values obtained at a shear rate of 1000 s 1 were 0 898 2 502 and 0 903 m p a s for sww hv sww and mbr sludge respectively detailed graphs of the rheological behavior of different permeates can be found in the appendix these results confirm that the viscosity of mbr sludge permeate is very close to that obtained for sww which is in agreement with the similar permeability obtained for both solutions conversely the viscosity of hv sww permeate is very close to that of the original hv sww 3 2 m p a s consequently the transport of permeate through the membrane pores seems to be the phenomenon inducing a low permeability in the case of hv sww effects caused by mbr sludge viscosity are conversely only relevant at the membrane feed side if the viscosity of the corresponding permeate is used to calculate the membrane hydraulic resistance from the permeability reported in table 2 the values obtained for the different solutions become quite similar the role of fluid flow resistance inside the membrane porous network and the relevance of membrane selective properties on mbr performance has not been given special attention in the literature in this regard it is important to mention that rosenberger et al already highlighted the importance of the sludge organic liquid fractions on membrane fouling rosenberger et al 2016 nonetheless the role of permeate viscosity was not treated in detail using a different approach moreau et al reviewed the effects of sludge viscosity on membrane fouling and concluded that viscosity played a secondary role on membrane performance moreau et al 2009 it is obvious that microfiltration membranes are not able to reject high molecular viscous solutes as efficiently as ultrafiltration does indeed most of the studies reporting significant effects of mlss concentration and sludge viscosity on fouling were conducted with microfiltration membranes meng et al 2007 wu et al 2007 wang et al 2006 consequently distinguishing between the removal efficiency of organic fractions of high molecular weight by ultrafiltration and microfiltration in mbrs would be helpful in order to explain the divergent conclusions drawn regarding the effect of viscosity on fouling in mbrs across the literature contrary to the irrelevant role of sludge viscosity on membrane permeability when the fractions of high molecular weight are efficiently rejected it was found that viscosity does affect fouling phenomena taking place at the membrane surface this is evidenced by the change in j c r and j c r i r r observed when treating sww and hv sww higher viscosities at the feed side intensify concentration polarization and thus gelation of colloids at the membrane surface takes place at low flux levels in view of these results investigation of higher and lower aeration intensities at the feed side could provide more information on the relevance of shear thinning effects on j c r and j c r i r r this question is beyond the scope of the present study although we are confident that our results will motivate further research in this direction apart from this applying backwash has been demonstrated to delay the attainment of critical fouling events also when used with highly viscous fluids it seems that reversing the flux in intermediate physical cleanings is able to disintegrate gel layers at the initial deposition stages and prevent formation of dense cake layers similar results were also reported by sabia et al where backwash was demonstrated to be effective in alleviating fouling associated with cake layer formation on the membrane surface sabia et al 2014 5 conclusions the interplay between sludge rheology membrane properties and type of physical cleaning during fouling development in mbrs has been investigated in the present study the improvement in fouling removal by backwash as compared to relaxation in immersed flat sheet membranes has been demonstrated by comparing the ifsm with the bwsm procedure which has been developed and presented in this work the main conclusions of the present paper are summarized as follows i backwash has been demonstrated to avoid or delay attainment of critical fluxes it is efficient already at undercritical fluxes when applied to membranes with a wide pore size distribution however backwash does not imply further advantages compared to relaxation for membranes with narrow pores as internal fouling is not relevant for these membranes at fluxes below j c r ii in agreement with previous works j c r i r r exceeds in all cases j c r this result implies the existence of a range of fluxes above j c r where fouling irreversibility is low thus extending the range of fluxes where operation of mbrs is sustainable iii high fluid viscosities are strongly related to manifestation of critical fouling at low fluxes the high shear stress predominating near the membrane surface intensifies concentration polarization so that gelation or condensation of colloidal matter at the membrane surface occurs at lower fluxes as compared with low viscous solutions iv as long as critical fouling does not manifest and high molecular weight organic fractions are rejected by the membrane sludge viscosity does not play a significant role on membrane permeability on the contrary membranes with broader pore sizes may suffer from the access into the pores of highly viscous organic fractions the increased mass transfer resistance in the pores can easily exceed the resistance of cake layers and concentration polarization thus decreasing the membrane permeability all in all combination of ifsm and bwsm for the investigation of fouling in mbrs has been demonstrated to serve not only to find optimum conditions for operating mbrs but also to improve the understanding about the nature of fouling phenomena and the role of several factors on it in this respect the newly introduced bwsm can serve as a useful tool for selection of best membrane during plant design and for optimization of the operation mode during plant operation acknowledgments m w

19258,fouling is one of the most pressing limitations during operation of membrane bioreactors as it increases operating costs and is the cause of short membrane lifespans conducting effective physical cleanings is thus essential for keeping membrane operation above viable performance limits the nature of organic foulants present in the sludge and the membrane properties are among the most influential factors determining fouling development and thus efficiency of fouling mitigation approaches the role of other factors like sludge viscosity on fouling is still unclear given that contradictory effects have been reported in the literature in the present study we use a new research approach by which the complex interplay between fouling type levels of permeate flux membrane material and feed properties is analyzed and the influence of these factors on critical flux and membrane permeability is evaluated a variety of systems including activated sludge and model solutions with distinct rheological behavior has been investigated for two membranes differing in pore size distribution we present a novel method for assessing the efficiency of fouling removal by backwash and compare it with the efficiency achieved by means of relaxation results obtained have proven that backwash delays development of critical fouling as compared with relaxation and reduces fouling irreversibility regardless of fluid rheology it was shown that backwash is especially effective for membranes for which internal fouling is the main cause of loss in permeability nonetheless we found out that for membranes with tight pores both relaxation and backwash are equally effective the critical flux decreases significantly for high viscosity fluids such as activated sludge this effect is mainly caused by an intensified concentration polarization at the feed side rather than by internal fouling events however membrane permeability has been proven to rely more on the permeate viscosity than on the feed viscosity poor rejection of organic fractions showcasing high viscosity causes an acute decline in membrane permeability as a consequence of increased shear stress inside the membrane

integration of membrane separation units with the biochemical degradation of pollutants in membrane bioreactors mbrs makes feasible operating wastewater treatment systems at high biomass concentrations this is done without compromising the effluent quality owing to the high solid liquid separation efficiency yielded by the membranes mbr technology is particularly appropriate for the implementation of water reuse schemes in areas of acute water stress the advantages of mbrs compared to conventional activated sludge processes such as their robust performance high effluent quality and reduced footprint holloway et al 2015 meng et al 2017 together with the progress achieved in this field during the last years have contributed to expand their implementation nonetheless membrane fouling is an unavoidable outcome of membrane filtration that still poses to be the most serious challenge in mbrs as it ultimately entails an increase in operating costs zhang et al 2014 the accumulation of matter on the membrane surface and inside the porous membrane network results in increased transmembrane pressures tmp and or decreased permeate fluxes j p thus diminishing the specific process throughput a critical fouling phenomenon is the manifestation of an acute tmp jump when a specific permeate flux usually called critical flux j c r is surpassed or when mbr systems are operated at demanding conditions for long periods fouling in immersed mbrs is caused by different types of species i e inorganic compounds microbial flocs or organic molecules among them extracellular polymeric substances eps are considered to be one of the major fouling initiators eps is a term which comprises organic macromolecules that are released by microorganisms including mainly polysaccharides and proteins but also other compounds such as nucleic acids and lipids lin et al 2014 eps show a three dimensional gelatinous matrix which provides cell to cell scaffolding bar zeev et al 2015 gel layers can seriously compromise the operability of mbrs especially when aggravated by interactions taking place with inorganic foulants wei et al 2011 besides the nature of the foulants operating conditions and membrane properties have a crucial impact on fouling development in immersed membrane filtration diverse studies have found correlations between fouling propensity and membrane properties such as hydrophilicity roughness or pore size hashino et al 2011 kochkodan and hilal 2015 meng et al 2017 as evident from the above discussion fouling mitigation strategies in mbr systems are indispensable they are usually classified into a physical and b chemical cleaning the former implies the utilization of relaxation and backwash procedures which are able to effectively remove gross solids attached to the membrane and even detach loosely formed cake the latter involves the use of chemical reagents in order to remove the physically irreversible fouling which refers to fouling that cannot be removed by using physical cleaning wang et al 2014 the two prevailing chemicals used are sodium hypochlorite for the organic fouling and citric acid for the inorganic fouling these chemicals attack the interactions between the different foulants as well as between the foulants and the membrane although chemical cleaning has proven to be a highly effective method for fouling removal its frequency should ideally be limited to a minimum level as when applied repeatedly it reduces the lifespan of the membranes le clech et al 2006 meng et al 2009 accordingly physical cleaning is usually preferred as it does not imply chemical degradation of membranes and can be implemented more frequently both relaxation and backwash have been extensively applied to hollow fiber membranes where backwash has been demonstrated to be more effective in keeping low irreversible fouling rates zsirai et al 2012 yet the application of backwash is not as practical for polymeric flat sheet membranes as it can induce delamination of the active layers or membrane detachment from the panels le clech et al 2006 wang et al 2014 nevertheless backwashable flat sheet membranes with enhanced mechanical integrity have recently been introduced such membranes are based on pocket configurations or on the integration of spacer fabrics between two flat sheet membranes doyen et al 2010 wang et al 2014 fouling phenomena are commonly investigated by utilizing flux stepping protocols which serve for assessing the evolution of permeability at different flux levels and for determining critical permeate fluxes the simplest flux stepping method called here conventional flux step method cfsm is based on filtrating during short periods with stepwise increments of the flux level the tmp transients induced by an increased deposition of foulants occurring after each step transition are then evaluated van der marel et al modified the cfsm by introducing relaxation steps between each flux increase van der marel et al 2009 in such a way they calculated critical fluxes with intercalated physical cleanings as it is usually practiced in mbrs additionally the permeability of the membranes measured after each cleaning step allows calculating the critical flux for irreversibility j c r i r r which is defined as the flux at which fouling cannot be removed by intermediate physical cleanings they coined this method with the term improved flux step method or shortly ifsm the efficiency of the intermediate physical cleaning may however vary depending on the cleaning procedure applied in this vein backwash is expected to be more effective in removing cohesive fouling than relaxation although at the expense of reducing water production rates nevertheless there is no clear knowledge about to which extent backwash is more effective than relaxation and whether there are specific cases where one of both physical cleanings is preferred comparison of efficiency of both physical cleaning methods in flat sheet membranes is necessary in order to find optimum operating conditions for mbrs the peculiar rheology of biological activated sludge increases complexity of fouling in mbrs activated sludge is usually highly viscous due to the presence of biological flocs eps and suspended solids this effect is even intensified in the case of mbr sludge owing to its high concentration in mixed liquor suspended solids mlss high viscosities may turn into considerably high energy costs because of higher demands of aeration for both oxygen transfer and membrane scouring as well as for permeate pumping laera et al 2007 on the one hand as solution viscosity varies within diffusion boundary layers a high viscosity is expected at the membrane surface thus intensifying concentration polarization and decreasing mass transfer rates charcosset and choplin 1995 on the other hand activated sludge is also known to exhibit shear thinning properties rosenberger et al 2016 pritchard et al observed that an increase in bulk viscosity during the ultrafiltration of a non newtonian fluid caused an increase in permeate flux this effect was attributed to the maximum shear stress taking place at the membrane surface implying lower viscosities at the membrane interface when shear thinning fluids are filtrated howell et al 1996 pritchard et al 1995 in view of the complexity of fouling processes in mbrs the present work aims to provide a systematic approach to characterize fouling occurring in immersed flat sheet membranes by considering interactions between fluid rheology membrane pore sizes and physical cleaning procedures a special emphasis is given to effects of backwash filtration on the development of critical fouling phenomena to this end for the first time a novel flux step method including intermediate backwash steps is developed and compared to the ifsm procedure effects on hydraulic resistance critical flux and irreversibility of fouling are assessed for membranes with different pore size distributions and for a variety of solutions having newtonian and non newtonian behavior in consequence the principal objective of this work is to identify interactions between different process parameters which are relevant for fouling development in mbrs given the variety and often contradictory conclusions drawn from different studies across the literature drews 2010 we aim at providing a clear interpretation to the correlation between these parameters and their influence on the performance of immersed mbrs 2 experimental 2 1 materials two different commercial ultrafiltration membranes were selected for conducting the present study the membrane up150 microdyn nadir germany from here on referred to as up and the membrane ly100 synder filtration united states referred as ly the active layer of both membranes is made of polyethersulfone pes while the backing material is polypropylene for up and polyester for ly the up membrane has a molecular weight cut off mwco specification of 150 kda whereas the ly has a mwco of 100 kda the contact angle at the active layer is 55 86 3 27 for up and 72 72 3 29 for ly a synthetic model wastewater sww resembling the typical composition of wastewater was selected for the present investigation the type of compounds and their concentrations were selected based on previous studies xing et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 sodium alginate 50 mg l glucose 100 mg l and bsa 10 mg l were selected as typical polysaccharides and proteins respectively which are also the most typical model foulants for eps sodium bicarbonate 100 mg l magnesium sulfate 30 mg l and calcium chloride 111 mg l were selected in order to set constant ionic environment for all experiments for the sake of comparison other solutions with different rheological behavior were also investigated the same compounds and concentrations were used with a 30 v v glycerin water mixture high viscosity wastewater hv sww with the aim of simulating fouling under viscosity conditions close to those found in mbr sludges finally the results were also contrasted with activated sludge taken from a real mbr treating wastewaters generated in the food industry the sludge had a mlss concentration of 15 g l and the mbr was operated with a sludge retention time of approximately 28 days in order to ensure constant conditions of the sludge samples throughout the experiments and to avoid further microbial growth as well as degradation of potential foulants sodium azide nan3 was added to the samples with a concentration of 0 02 w w additionally the samples were stored at a temperature below 5 c 2 2 setups and procedures the rheological behavior of the three different samples was obtained using a rheometer mcr 102 anton paar with a double gap cylinder dg42 measuring system at a controlled temperature of 25 c this type of measurement system is composed of a concentric cylinder which has relatively larger surface areas and lower gap distances as compared to other measuring systems this makes double gap cylinders more appropriate for liquids with low viscosities and avoids the early onset of turbulences at low shear rates flow curves ranging from shear rates of 1 s 1 up to 2000 s 1 were registered chromatographic measurements of pre filtered mbr sludge were performed in order to obtain the molecular characterization of different compounds present in it additionally the feed wastewater and mbr permeate were also analyzed these samples were vacuum filtered to remove suspended solids employing a regenerated cellulose filter with a pore size of 0 45 μ m the different samples were injected in volumes from 20 μ l to 100 μ l in a hplc 1100 instrument agilent applying a flow rate of 1 ml min the separation was performed using the columns suprema 10 μ m and suprema 30 a 10 μ m from polymer standards service gmbh the detection was carried out utilizing a diode array detector at a wavelength of 254 nm in combination with a refractive index detector in order to calibrate the molecular weight distribution with the elution volume times different dextran standards were injected and analyzed having peak maximums corresponding to the following molecular weights 180 342 1080 4400 9900 21400 124000 and 401000 da a preliminary characterization of the membrane structure was conducted for both membranes scanning electron microscopy sem images of both membranes were taken and pore size characterization was conducted by means of mwco measurements for the mwco measurements a stirred dead end filtration unit was used at a tmp of 0 5 bar the solution filtered was a mixture of different dextran standards with a total concentration of 2 5 g l 0 5 g l dextran 40 kda 1 g l dextran 100 kda and 1 g l dextran 500 kda the concentrations of dextrans of different molecular weight in feed and permeate were determined by size exclusion chromatography sec using a refractive index detector dextrans have different affinity to the column depending on their molecular weight so that the evolution of the strength of the refractive index signal provides the molecular weight distribution of the different samples accordingly the rejection curves can be obtained by calculating 1 w p w f for each molecular weight where w p and w f represent the mass fraction of dextrans in permeate and feed respectively the mwco90 which corresponds to a 90 of solute rejection was then calculated for both membranes the membrane filtration experiments were conducted using a setup described in detail in a previous publication martí calatayud and wessling 2017 in which a panel with two flat sheet membranes clamped at both its sides was immersed into the reactor and it was aerated via two blowers placed below the filtration module the permeate was extracted via a peristaltic pump ismatec reglo the speed of which was regulated and automated using a data logger and control system based on the software dasylab the pressure at the permeate side was measured by using a pressure sensor wika type d 10 wika and was registered in order to calculate the tmp by means of the following equation 1 t m p p f e e d p p e r m e a t e where p f e e d was taken as the atmospheric pressure the aeration in the membrane reactor was supplied by an air compressor aquaforte v60 the aeration flow was set constant at 1 l min the volume capacity of the reactor is 3 3 l and the effective membrane area was 126 cm2 fig 1 shows comparison between the so called improved flux step method ifsm introduced by van der marel et al van der marel et al 2009 and the novel backwash step method bwsm designed and implemented for the first time in the present article as mentioned above the permeate flux j p in the cfsm is increased step wise until the maximum is reached and then decreased again in a descending phase the ifsm fig 1 a includes a relaxation step after each filtration period and prior to implementing a subsequent flux increase here it is to be noted that the relaxation step is not a complete cessation of filtration but an intermediate filtration step at a very low flux where aeration is maintained in the present work we introduce a new method for characterizing membrane filtration with intermediate backwash cleaning as can be seen in fig 1 b at the start of the filtration function the flux is small so it is impractical to apply very high backwash fluxes and consume more permeate than that produced during the previous filtration in such case a compromise between backwash duration and intensity was found where the backwash was selected to be half of the previous filtration flux 2 j b w j p 2 within the central part of the bwsm function a standard maximum backwash flux j b w m a x was implemented the selected value along with the backwash duration 2 min was optimized during preliminary experiments so as to ensure effective membrane cleaning an additional feature common to the flux step methods implemented in the present work is that all of them count with an uprising phase where the flux is gradually increased and a symmetrical descending phase which is used in order to identify hysteresis phenomena indicative of irreversible fouling the conduction of ifsm and bwsm is used in order to identify changes in membrane permeability after different types of physical cleaning for a wide range of operating fluxes the filtration steps were increased by 5 lmh until they reached a maximum flux j p m a x slightly above 100 lmh for the experiments conducted with sww due to the higher viscosity of mbr sludge and hv sww the maximum flux was set to 30 lmh for these solutions and the step increase was selected to be 2 5 lmh 3 results 3 1 rheology of used solutions and membrane characterization the viscosity of mbr activated sludge and of sww were measured in order to check the disparity between the samples subsequently the viscosity of the sludge was taken as a reference in order to prepare hv sww the viscosity at high shear rates of 1000 s 1 0 0032 pa s was considered to determine the proportion of glycerin to be used and prepare hv sww based on the formulas provided by cheng for water glycerin mixtures cheng 2008 fig 2 shows the dependency of viscosity on shear rate for the three solutions considered in line with the rheological calculations of sludge samples reported in previous studies rosenberger et al 2016 the mbr activated sludge clearly shows shear thinning properties since viscosity significantly decreases at increasing shear rates the viscosity of sww at high shear rates 1000 s 1 0 00109 pa s is close to that of water hence indicating that addition of foulants does not significantly alter the solution viscosity in this range of shear rates however the addition of foulants imparts non newtonian behavior to the mixture the dependency of viscosity on shear rates is very similar to that observed for the sludge here it must be mentioned that the increase in viscosity observed for higher shear rates 1000 s 1 is caused by taylor vortices occurring in the rheometer which should not be taken into account ratkovich et al 2013 the viscosity of hv sww solutions at a shear rate of 1000 s 1 prepared with 30 v v glycerin practically coincides as expected with that of the sludge however their rheological behavior notably differs from that of sww and mbr sludge hv sww basically showcases a newtonian behavior and it only shows noticeable variations at shear rates lower than 10 s 1 the rheogram of fig 2 b confirms these observations mbr sludge and sww exhibit an attenuating increase in shear stress at increasing shear rates on the contrary hv sww shows a linear trend the rheograms were fitted to the herschel bulkley model commonly used for modeling activated sludge rheology rosenberger et al 2016 3 τ τ 0 k γ n where τ represents the shear stress p a s τ 0 the yield stress p a k the flow consistency index p a s n and n the cross rate constant the exponent n takes values lower than 1 for shear thinning fluids 1 for newtonian fluids and higher values for shear thickening fluids the fittings obtained for mbr sludge and sww were τ 0 144 0 028 γ 0 69 and τ 0 018 0 002 γ 0 89 respectively consequently the cross rate constants of 0 69 for mbr sludge and 0 89 for sww corroborate their non newtonian properties on the contrary the rheological behavior of hv sww could be fitted with the power law function τ 0 003 γ 0 99 which confirms its newtonian properties regarding the membrane characterization sec retention curves calculated for both membranes are presented in fig 3 a the experimental mwco values determined were 186 kda and 1615 kda for the ly and up membrane respectively this difference implies a significant disparity between the pore sizes of both membranes in addition to this the range of pore sizes of the up membrane is significantly broader as it encloses values from around 1 kda to above 104 kda sem pictures of the surface of both membranes also illustrate substantial differences regarding the pore sizes ly pores are very difficult to be seen in the picture due to their small width while the active layer of up has larger pores and in general less uniform pore sizes throughout the membrane surface lower porosity of the ly membrane can also be inferred from the pictures 3 2 fouling tests with the improved flux step method fig 4 shows one of the results obtained after applying the ifsm procedure for sww solutions schematic determinations of the critical flux j c r and the critical flux for irreversibility j c r i r r are included in the graph tmp increases during the filtration steps with different slopes depending on the level of permeate flux in the ascending phase at low fluxes a steady tmp value is reached whereas at higher fluxes the tmp increase is more acute drawing two lines connecting the last tmp values registered during the filtration steps at low and high fluxes allows us to calculate an approximate estimation of the j c r which in the example figure takes a value of 65 lmh the response in the descending part of the graph shows a significant asymmetry compared to the ascending part which gives an indication of cohesive fouling occurring during the experiment thus membrane permeability cannot be restored to its initial values just by decreasing flux an additional feature of the ifsm protocol is the profile of tmps registered during the relaxation steps here also the final tmp values rely strongly on the previously applied flux at low fluxes tmp reaches almost the same residual value however at fluxes higher than j c r the tmp value remaining before the beginning of new filtration steps increases considerably and does not recover the initial value registered for low fluxes the trends of tmp during relaxation after applying high and low fluxes were also fitted to visually indicate the calculation of j c r i r r as in van der marel et al taking a value of 80 lmh for the case presented in the graph j c r i r r exceeds j c r significantly van der marel et al 2009 these results indicate that at fluxes slightly higher than j c r the development of fouling has a reversible character and thus can be removed by intermediate relaxation cycles however at fluxes higher than j c r i r r the efficacy of relaxation decreases a possible reason for this difference could be the transition between the deposition of loosely attached fouling and the development of cohesive fouling caused by the compression of fouling deposits the access of foulants to the pores at higher driving forces or the growth of thicker gel layers on the membrane surface could also explain the differences between j c r and j c r i r r indeed the formation of a gel layer on the membrane surface was verified at the end of each experiment the values of j c r and j c r i r r were calculated accurately by treating the data from the ifsm experiments and representing t m p j p against see fig 5 1 j p these plots are analogous to the cowan brown plots used in electrodialysis for determining limiting currents baker 2004 martí calatayud et al 2013 basically t m p j p is proportional to the hydraulic resistance and is represented against the inverse of the permeate flux after t m p j p reaches a minimum the j c r is exceeded and the resistance of the system grows abruptly therefore the permeate flux corresponding to the minimum in the plots can be used to directly extract the values of j c r and j c r i r r from their respective curves the same procedure was employed with all membrane systems for all repetitions the average values of both types of critical flux are summarized in table 1 the values obtained for both membranes are strongly dependent on the type of solution used while the differences between both membranes are small dependency between critical fluxes and solution viscosity can be observed since the values obtained for sww are by far the highest yet the values obtained for hv sww and mbr sludge differ significantly on the basis of the rheological properties of the samples alone these differences were in principle not expected as both solutions have the same viscosity at high shear rates and the viscosity at low shear rates is even lower for hv sww cf fig 2 another remarkable fact is that as exemplified in fig 4 in all cases j c r i r r exceeds j c r considerably thus the intermediate regime where fouling develops faster but can still be removed by intermediate relaxation is common to all membrane and solution combinations the representation of flux against the last tmp values of each filtration step for all membrane solution combinations tested are presented in fig 6 regarding the differences between both membranes it can be seen that in general the permeability of up is higher than that of ly these differences are mostly determined by the membrane porosity although the higher hydrophilicity of up may also contribute to the higher permeabilities obtained for this membrane the slight differences in j c r between both membranes seem to be caused also by the differences regarding the size and distribution of pores the attainment of a sufficiently high local flux at some small pores can boost colloid colloid interactions and initiate their coagulation at the pore entrance consequently some parts of the membrane surface become impermeable and the local flux at the remaining permeable parts intensifies leading to the strong increase in resistance after exceeding j c r with the ly membrane the lower density of pores implies higher local fluxes hence leading to lower values of j c r besides membrane permeability and critical fluxes the differences between the ascending and descending phase of ifsm experiments also give an idea of fouling reversibility the same permeate flux causes higher tmp values at the descending phase due to irreversible fouling deposited during the previous flux steps accordingly the area between the j p tmp curves registered in the ascending and descending phases provides an estimation of the irreversible character of fouling taking place during the measurement in fig 6 all curves except for the system up sludge exhibit a hysteresis loop indicating that irreversible fouling has occurred during the measurements conversely in the case of up sludge the ascending and descending phases of the ifsm measurement coincide as fouling deposited during each filtration step is removed during the intermediate relaxation these results are also in agreement with the fact that no j c r i r r could be obtained from the data treatment see table 1 as long as j c r i r r is not exceeded the influence of fouling history is practically absent in the curves 3 3 fouling tests with the backwash step method the bwsm was implemented for the same solutions and membranes as the ifsm fig 7 shows an example of the evolution of tmp obtained during these experiments the first observable fact is the almost symmetrical evolution of tmp in the ascending and descending phases which already gives an idea of the reversible nature of fouling deposited during the experiment intermediate backwash steps are able to remove fouling before it turns into irreversible the tmp evolution during a filtration step is similar to that during normal ifsm experiments however the evolution during the backwash is remarkably different the attainment of negative pressures indicates the effective change of the direction of flux through the membranes taking place during the physical cleanings since the permeate pressure sensor is only able to measure values up to 110 mbar it was not possible to register higher tmp values during backwash as seen from the graph backwash is mostly effective in removing foulants since the increase in tmp during a subsequent filtration step is substantially attenuated fig 8 shows a comparison between the fouling curves obtained from ifsm and bwsm experiments with sww and hv sww solutions all cases show the same behavior at fluxes below j c r the curves obtained from both methods are similar whereas at higher fluxes the change in permeability for the bwsm curves is very smooth compared to that observed for ifsm where the increase in membrane resistance is very notorious backwash intercalated between filtration steps induces a delay or attenuation of fouling within the range of fluxes tested which is not achieved by means of relaxation in view of these results backwash demonstrated to be capable to remove more cohesive fouling than relaxation thus preventing or rather postponing the attainment of a j c r this effect is also evident from the hysteresis observed with ifsm which is absent in the case of the bwsm despite the apparently similar permeability obtained from both methods at low fluxes the values calculated indicate substantial differences in some cases which are not directly observable from the graph due to the used scales table 2 summarizes the permeability of each system with ifsm and bwsm protocols the values shown are the averages of the different repetitions conducted in each case as already seen in section 3 2 the permeability of ly is smaller compared to that of up in all cases again these results correspond with the low density of pores observed for the ly membrane in fig 3 b with regard to the different solutions the trends follow the decreasing order sww mbr sludge hv sww curiously the permeability obtained with mbr sludge is close to the one obtained with sww although both solutions differ in terms of viscosity significantly regarding the differences between membrane permeability obtained with intermediate relaxation and intermediate backwash steps the performance of the up membrane seems to be more influenced by the type of physical cleaning it seems that the up membrane is more affected by pore clogging even at low permeate fluxes while ly gets clogged only when high tmp values are applied and foulants get trapped or form a gel layer 4 discussion the results obtained showed different trends depending on the type of membrane material and on the solution characteristics a remarkable observation is the low permeability of the ly membrane caused by the low density of pores available for the transport of water however this membrane showed low fouling propensity at undercritical fluxes as revealed by the modest change in permeability when applying intermediate relaxation or backwash the small pore size of ly makes this membrane less susceptible to pore clogging as foulants are rejected to a higher extent and their access to the internal membrane structure is hindered this hindrance is only overcome when high driving forces are applied concentration polarization is intensified and j c r is attained compared to relaxation the application of backwash at undercritical fluxes does not provide a significant improvement in fouling removal regardless of solution viscosity under conditions of low flux and small pore sizes implementation of relaxation would suffice to remove the loosely attached fouling and backwash would only imply a loss of permeate production on the contrary applying of backwash to membranes with a broader pore size distribution like up can be advantageous already at low fluxes as internal fouling may develop even at low fluxes when solutes and pore sizes are similar the results obtained are in agreement with the observations of le clech et al narrow pore size distributions reduce the inhomogeneous flow distribution between pores that lead to preferential deposition and blockage of membranes with large pores le clech et al 2006 in the regime of high fluxes the advantages of using backwash are generalized for both membranes the values of j c r and j c r i r r calculated with intermediate relaxations do not correspond with the development of critical fouling when physical cleaning is conducted by backwash in this regard intermediate backwash is able to suppress or delay the attainment of a critical flux in addition to this the curves obtained in the ascending and descending phase of the bwsm experiments are overlapping and verify the lack of hysteresis accordingly a high degree of reversibility of fouling can be ensured by backwash as the j p tmp evolution remains independent of the membrane filtration history these observations indicate that formation of gel layers may be the main phenomenon originating critical fluxes in the present work formation of gel layers contrary to pore clogging may evolve similarly for both types of membranes as it is not as much affected by the pore size unexpected phenomena have also been observed regarding the role of solution viscosity on membrane performance the permeability of both membranes when filtering mbr sludge is in the same range as for sww although the viscosity of the sludge is threefold higher the viscosity of activated sludge increases with the sludge mlss and has been attributed a relevant role on causing increased fouling rates laera et al 2007 rosenberger et al 2002 higher mlss concentrations are also related to higher production of eps in this respect numerous studies have been conducted to assess effects of viscosity sludge retention times and mlss concentration of mbr sludge on membrane fouling and permeability meng et al 2007 wu et al 2007 moreau et al 2009 nonetheless conclusions drawn across different studies are frequently contradictory the complexity of sludge matrices makes it especially difficult to extract clear trends from different experimental results often some specific sludge properties are the focus of research while other relevant factors are overlooked in order to elucidate the reason for the relatively high permeabilities obtained with mbr sludge compared to hv sww solutions a deeper investigation of the fractions present in the mbr sludge was performed the filtrate of mbr sludge using a filter with pore size of 0 45 μ m was characterized by means of sec in order to obtain an estimation of the fractions of molecular weights present in the sludge fig 9 shows the molecular characterization of the sludge filtrate mbr feed wastewater and mbr permeate compounds with high molecular weights appear at low elution volumes while smaller molecules are detected at larger elution volumes the verticals drawn in the graph correspond to the characteristic peak maximums detected when dextran standards were injected they serve as a reference to assign certain molecular weights with different elution volumes given the assumption that they interact similarly with the column as the sludge filtrate molecular weight bands appearing at elution volumes lower than 6 2 ml thus correspond with high molecular weight bio polymers these compounds are not present in the incoming mbr wastewater so that they are related to biomass growth in the bioreactor the peak appearing at 7 8 7 9 ml is common to the three samples analyzed hence it is probably associated with polysaccharides present in the wastewater and also with eps with a molecular weight ranging from 350 da up to 4 4 kda finally the last peak corresponds to nan3 added to the samples in order to prevent microbial growth in the measuring devices the chromatograms indicate that the fraction of bio polymers rejected by the membrane is probably the principal contribution to the high sludge viscosity in order to corroborate this hypothesis the viscosities of permeate samples obtained when filtering the three solutions considered were also measured the values obtained at a shear rate of 1000 s 1 were 0 898 2 502 and 0 903 m p a s for sww hv sww and mbr sludge respectively detailed graphs of the rheological behavior of different permeates can be found in the appendix these results confirm that the viscosity of mbr sludge permeate is very close to that obtained for sww which is in agreement with the similar permeability obtained for both solutions conversely the viscosity of hv sww permeate is very close to that of the original hv sww 3 2 m p a s consequently the transport of permeate through the membrane pores seems to be the phenomenon inducing a low permeability in the case of hv sww effects caused by mbr sludge viscosity are conversely only relevant at the membrane feed side if the viscosity of the corresponding permeate is used to calculate the membrane hydraulic resistance from the permeability reported in table 2 the values obtained for the different solutions become quite similar the role of fluid flow resistance inside the membrane porous network and the relevance of membrane selective properties on mbr performance has not been given special attention in the literature in this regard it is important to mention that rosenberger et al already highlighted the importance of the sludge organic liquid fractions on membrane fouling rosenberger et al 2016 nonetheless the role of permeate viscosity was not treated in detail using a different approach moreau et al reviewed the effects of sludge viscosity on membrane fouling and concluded that viscosity played a secondary role on membrane performance moreau et al 2009 it is obvious that microfiltration membranes are not able to reject high molecular viscous solutes as efficiently as ultrafiltration does indeed most of the studies reporting significant effects of mlss concentration and sludge viscosity on fouling were conducted with microfiltration membranes meng et al 2007 wu et al 2007 wang et al 2006 consequently distinguishing between the removal efficiency of organic fractions of high molecular weight by ultrafiltration and microfiltration in mbrs would be helpful in order to explain the divergent conclusions drawn regarding the effect of viscosity on fouling in mbrs across the literature contrary to the irrelevant role of sludge viscosity on membrane permeability when the fractions of high molecular weight are efficiently rejected it was found that viscosity does affect fouling phenomena taking place at the membrane surface this is evidenced by the change in j c r and j c r i r r observed when treating sww and hv sww higher viscosities at the feed side intensify concentration polarization and thus gelation of colloids at the membrane surface takes place at low flux levels in view of these results investigation of higher and lower aeration intensities at the feed side could provide more information on the relevance of shear thinning effects on j c r and j c r i r r this question is beyond the scope of the present study although we are confident that our results will motivate further research in this direction apart from this applying backwash has been demonstrated to delay the attainment of critical fouling events also when used with highly viscous fluids it seems that reversing the flux in intermediate physical cleanings is able to disintegrate gel layers at the initial deposition stages and prevent formation of dense cake layers similar results were also reported by sabia et al where backwash was demonstrated to be effective in alleviating fouling associated with cake layer formation on the membrane surface sabia et al 2014 5 conclusions the interplay between sludge rheology membrane properties and type of physical cleaning during fouling development in mbrs has been investigated in the present study the improvement in fouling removal by backwash as compared to relaxation in immersed flat sheet membranes has been demonstrated by comparing the ifsm with the bwsm procedure which has been developed and presented in this work the main conclusions of the present paper are summarized as follows i backwash has been demonstrated to avoid or delay attainment of critical fluxes it is efficient already at undercritical fluxes when applied to membranes with a wide pore size distribution however backwash does not imply further advantages compared to relaxation for membranes with narrow pores as internal fouling is not relevant for these membranes at fluxes below j c r ii in agreement with previous works j c r i r r exceeds in all cases j c r this result implies the existence of a range of fluxes above j c r where fouling irreversibility is low thus extending the range of fluxes where operation of mbrs is sustainable iii high fluid viscosities are strongly related to manifestation of critical fouling at low fluxes the high shear stress predominating near the membrane surface intensifies concentration polarization so that gelation or condensation of colloidal matter at the membrane surface occurs at lower fluxes as compared with low viscous solutions iv as long as critical fouling does not manifest and high molecular weight organic fractions are rejected by the membrane sludge viscosity does not play a significant role on membrane permeability on the contrary membranes with broader pore sizes may suffer from the access into the pores of highly viscous organic fractions the increased mass transfer resistance in the pores can easily exceed the resistance of cake layers and concentration polarization thus decreasing the membrane permeability all in all combination of ifsm and bwsm for the investigation of fouling in mbrs has been demonstrated to serve not only to find optimum conditions for operating mbrs but also to improve the understanding about the nature of fouling phenomena and the role of several factors on it in this respect the newly introduced bwsm can serve as a useful tool for selection of best membrane during plant design and for optimization of the operation mode during plant operation acknowledgments m w

19259,to determine whether the addition of conductive materials could enhance methane production by direct interspecies electron transfer diet we operated three anaerobic reactors amended with non conductive ceramic or conductive materials anthracite and granular activated carbon gac throughout eight months of operation ethanol was consistently detected as the major fermentation product the specific yield in the anthracite and gac added reactors increased by 31 5 and 43 3 respectively compared to the ceramic added reactor 16s rrna gene sequencing results indicated geobacter was dominant up to 55 of total sequences whereas acids degrading syntrophic bacteria were low in abundance 2 using metagenomic analysis the draft genome of the dominant geobacter population bin gac1 was reconstructed and observed to possess genetic abilities of ethanol oxidation hydrogen production and extracellular electron transfer and represented a phylogenetically novel geobacter species while methanosaeta was the dominant methanogen reactors containing conductive materials harbored more diverse and abundant archaeal populations as revealed by fish qpcr and metagenomics our findings suggested that a novel geobacter population could oxidize ethanol and employed both hydrogen transfer and diet depending on the accessibility of conductive materials thermodynamic advantages of diet over hydrogen production could lead to enhanced methane production in reactors with conductive materials graphical abstract image 1 keywords novel geobacter diverse methanogens conductive materials direct interspecies electron transfer 1 introduction in anaerobic environments organic compounds are metabolized through cooperative interactions between different groups of microorganisms hydrogen and other molecules like formate and cysteine are known to mediate interspecies electron transfer under anaerobic conditions schink and stams 2006 recently a new route of electron exchange i e direct interspecies electron transfer diet was discovered between two geobacter species summers et al 2010 where a co culture of geobacter metallireducens and geobacter sulfurreducens carried out ethanol metabolism by forming electrically conductive aggregates this phenomenon was later observed in methanogenic systems where methanosaeta the obligate aceticlastic methanogens directly accepted electrons from g metallireducens to reduce co2 and produce methane rotaru et al 2014b geobacter is known for its ability to perform extracellular electron transfer and has been used as an indicator of diet lovley 2017 however not all cultured geobacter species are able to perform diet different geobacter species have distinct extracellular electron transfer capacity kato et al 2013 and only three species i e g metallireducens g sulfurreducens and geobacter hydrogenophilus have been clearly documented to perform diet based on evidences of genetic potential gene expression and physiological traits lovley 2017 thus detecting geobacter species in methanogenic environments without careful inspection of the phylogenetic affiliation and physiological traits does not warrant the occurrence of diet on the other hand the fact that many microorganisms could interact with electrodes via extracellular electron transfer implies that the spectrum of bacteria conducting diet can be broader than current understanding koch and harnisch 2016 furthermore while most studies primarily focused on geobacter s diet capacity little is known about the ecological relevance of its hydrogen production capacity in anaerobic systems geobacter genomes contain multiple bidirectional hydrogenases coppi 2005 and g sulfurreducens could produce hydrogen cord ruwisch et al 1998 which suggest geobacter may also utilize hydrogen to share electrons with its counter partners being able to utilize diet and hydrogen for electron transfer provides ecological flexibility to grow under different anaerobic conditions likewise the diversity of methanogens involved in diet is not well understood only two methanogens methanosaeta and methanosarcina from methanosarcinales are demonstrated to participate in diet lovley 2017 however various methanogenic taxa were highly abundant in environments where diet was believed to occur these non methanosarcinales methanogens include methanoregula zhang and lu 2016 methanoculleus methanomassillicoccus dang et al 2017 methanospirillum and methanolinea lee et al 2016 and their roles in diet remain elusive moreover the extracellular electron contacts for instance cytochrome that allow methanogens to accept electron via diet are not known rotaru et al 2014a an increasing number of studies have reported that adding conductive materials such as biochar chen et al 2014b carbon cloth chen et al 2014a and granular activated carbon gac liu et al 2012 could facilitate diet and enhance anaerobic metabolism efficiency however many studies concluded the occurrence of diet by comparing to a reactor without the addition of any materials and by observing the presence of geobacter using 16s rrna gene sequencing such experimental design can be improved by including a control reactor with non conductive materials and inspecting the enriched populations with additional ecological tools to assess the effect of conductive materials on methane production and the potential hydrogen transfer or diet driven microbial ecology this study operated three packed bed reactors treating synthetic wastewater produced from soft drink industry three common packing

months by gradually decreasing hrt from 6 days to 3 days then 2 days all reactors showed high cod removal efficiencies 95 one sample t test p 0 001 fig s1a with r3 slightly higher than r1 and r2 two sample paired t test p 0 001 soluble toc measurement exhibited the similar trends fig s1b ethanol was detected as the key product from fructose and polyethylene glycol fermentation 87 of influent cod in the reactor effluent averaged at 0 67 mm in r1 0 58 mm in r2 and 0 62 mm in r3 fig 1 a short chain fatty acids including formate acetate propionate butyrate and lactate were seldom detected fig s1c most ph values of the three reactors were within 6 5 6 9 as a result of bicarbonate buffer in the influent fig s1d fig 1b indicates that r3 had the highest total biogas production rate in all three hrt periods 0 47 0 86 and 1 36 l d followed by r2 0 37 0 73 and 1 21 l d and r1 0 30 0 59 and 0 63 l d fig 1b also shows apparent differences in methane concentrations where r3 had the highest average concentration in all hrts 24 70 30 19 and 38 28 mmol l followed by r2 12 77 22 80 and 32 91 mmol l and r1 6 08 11 72 and 14 85 mmol l fig 1c indicates higher vss concentration in r1 effluent 0 301 g l than in r2 0 063 g l and r3 0 057 g l inspecting biomass attached to material surface by sem revealed that the ceramic material had less microbial colonization and more exposed surface area fig s2a whereas anthracite fig s2b and gac fig s2c were mostly covered by thick layer of biomass although the three reactors were inoculated with the same amount of seed sludge the differences in biomass washout and surface colonization led to in distinctive biomass inventory retained in reactors at the end of the operation r1 contained 7 3 g vss whereas r2 and r3 contained 23 8 g and 28 6 g respectively using the data obtained from the last hrt period at 2 days the average specific yield was 1 27 mmol ch4 g vss d in r1 and increased by 31 5 to 1 67 in r2 and by 43 3 to 1 82 in r3 we also calculated cod mass balance by subtracting influent cod with cod in effluent biomass loss and methane production table s2 reactor 1 had a large proportion of cod that could not be explained whereas r2 and r3 had less values in each hrt period 3 2 microbial population dynamics based on 16s rrna gene 16s rrna gene amplicon analysis suggested that geobacter related populations representing 0 1 of total sequences in the seed anaerobic digester sludge were highly enriched during reactor operation 15 55 of total sequences fig 2 other abundant bacterial populations are likely fermenters including the uncultured sa 8 clade in spirochaetes up to 19 in relative abundance ignavibacterium in chlorobi up to 12 and anaerolinaceae in chloroflexi up to 20 known fatty acids degrading syntrophs such as syntrophus syntrophomonas smithella and syntrophobacter were detected at an abundance 2 the relative abundance of archaea in total sequences was low i e 1 2 in r1 2 8 in r2 and 1 7 in r3 on average fig 3 a methanosaeta was the most dominant methanogen accounting for 1 1 2 1 and 1 4 of total sequences in r1 r2 and r3 on average respectively other methanogens were present at lower abundance 0 5 methanogens abundance was further analyzed using qpcr with taxa specific primers fig 3b in comparison to 16s amplicon sequencing results the relative abundances of archaea in the microbial community bacteria archaea in r2 8 8 and r3 13 5 were higher than in r1 1 3 methanosaeta was dominant representing 1 2 7 3 and 6 7 of total 16s rrna gene copy number in r1 r2 and r3 on average respectively other methanogens including methanomicrobiales and methanobacteriales were more abundant in r2 and r3 than in r1 the methanogens diversity residing in r2 and r3 was further confirmed by fish using 16s rrna oligoprobes targeting different taxa fig s3 among archaeal populations that were hybridized by probe arc915 methanosaeta like cells targeted by probe mx825 in rod shape were abundant in r1 meanwhile many coccus like archaeal cells hybridized by probe arc915 but not probe mx825 were observed in r2 and r3 table s3 3 3 function of uncultured geobacter and diversity of methanogens revealed by metagenomics metagenomic analysis was performed on samples taken from the three reactors on day 106 the average assembled contig sizes approximated to 3 kb and the reads mapping percentages were 90 table s4 the draft genome of the most abundant population designated as bin gac1 was recovered using the differential coverage binning strategy fig s4 it had 90 genome completeness and 7 contamination based on two independent approaches checkm and miga table s5 16s rrna gene based phylogenetic analysis revealed that bin gac1 was closely affiliated to the dominant otu 50569 determined by 16s rrna amplicon sequencing fig 4 a they were distantly related to any cultured geobacter species and other genera in the family geobacteraceae but were clustered together with environmental clones retrieved from anaerobic bioreactors such as anaerobic digesters amended with conductive materials expanded granular sludge bed reactors and microbial fuel cells phylogenomic analysis indicated bin gac1 did not closely affiliate to cultured geobacter species fig 4b miga analysis based on whole genome average amino acids identity aai supported that bin gac1 is a member of the genus geobacter p value 0 179 but not represented by any cultured species p value 0 00385 gene annotation suggested that of bin gac1 could oxidize ethanol and transport electrons by both direct electron transfer and hydrogen production it contained two adjacent genes coding nadh dependent alcohol dehydrogenase adh and ferredoxin dependent aldehyde oxidoreductase aor which were highly similar to well known ethanol oxidizers such as g metallireducens and pelobacter carbinolicus fig 5 a table s6 bin gac1 also contained genes encoding nadh ubiquinone dehydrogenase and ubiquinone cytochrome c oxidoreductase that could transfer electrons from nadh to quinones and cytochromes further thirty eight coding sequences that potentially encoded c type cytochromes were identified one was highly similar to the gene coding periplasmic c type cytochrome ppca bin gac1 also possessed the gene cluster for type iv pili pila pilr pils pilc pilt and pilb fig s5a as the pila gene was longer than the truncated pila genes in g metallireducens and g sulfurreducens the pili of bin gac1 were likely similar to those low conductive pili found in geobacter uraniireducens and geobacter daltonii fig s5b bin gac1 further exhibited the capacity of hydrogen production the ech cluster echa echb echc echd eche and echf coding the energy conserving nife hydrogenase complex was highly similar to those in desulfovibrio spp methanosarcina spp and another uncultured geobacter species m18 fig 5b the ech cluster in bin gac1 was structurally different from a similar but functionally unknown cluster ech related complex ehr found in other cultured geobacter species including g sulfurreducens g metallireducens g pickeringii and g soli alignment of the n and c termini of ech and ehr large subunits confirmed that bin gac1 encoded two nife centre binding cysteine residues that were critical for hydrogen production and conserved among ech complex but not ehr complex fig s6a phylogenetic analysis of the conserved ech and ehr small subunit further suggested bin gac1 encoded a different complex from g sulfurreducens and g metallireducens fig s6b meanwhile bin gac1 contained two more hydrogenases the cytoplasmic bidirectional nad reducing hoxplsufe complex and the periplasmically oriented membrane bound hyaslbp complex both were likely involved in converting excess reducing equivalents to hydrogen bin gac1 did not possess genes coding the fefe bifurcating hydrogenase hyd nad ferredoxin reductase rnf trans hydrogenase nfn methyl viologen reducing hydrogenase mvh nife heterodimeric hydrogenase hyn and nifese heterodimeric hydrogenase hys for archaea a total of 21 bins were recovered using maxbin fig s7 by mapping each bin back to the trimmed reads the total abundance of all archaeal bins was calculated to be 2 9 in r1 3 4 in r2 and 4 6 in r3 fig 3c like 16s rrna gene analysis bins associated with methanosaeta were the most abundant ten bins with max abundance 1 7 these bins all had multiple copies of gene for cytochrome c biogenesis proteins that were similar 50 identity and 50 coverage to those in methanosaeta harundinacea 6ac which is the well documented methanosaeta species capable of diet they also all had a gene potentially coding cytochrome c class i with 50 amino acids identity but low coverage 23 to the counterpart in m harundinacea 6ac mhar 1883 eleven bins max abundance 1 0 associated with other methanogenic populations were also detected including taxa related to methanomicrobiales methanobacteriales and uncultured euryarchaeota clade methanogens diversity was also estimated by calculating img annotated phylogenetic distribution of genes in each assembly fig 3d the abundance of genes that were associated to archaea was much higher in r2 13 7 and r3 9 2 than in r1 3 1 while methanosaeta was dominant genes associated with other methanogens were abundantly detected in r2 and r3 4 discussion in studying diet based methanogenesis conductive materials are often added into reactors to observe whether methane production is enhanced compared to a reference reactor without material addition table s7 such a comparison could be improved by including a control reactor added with non conductive materials because any materials regardless of conductivity could theoretically promote cell aggregation and biofilm development offer protective barriers and enhance sorption of organic compounds flemming and wingender 2010 the ability to retain active biomass in a reactor could also impact reactor performance yoda and nishimura 1997 which is neglected by many studies table s6 thus this study compared reactors added with conductive or nonconductive materials and calculated the methane production rate based on the total biomass retained in individual reactors the normalized methane production based on cod removed and retained biomass was 29 and 40 higher in reactors added with anthracite and gac respectively than with ceramic sem observations and vss measurement indicated that conductive materials could support better biomass colonization which might be attributed to the advantage of diet as discussed below during the reactor operation ethanol instead of short chain acids was constantly detected in the effluent suggesting that ethanol was the major product during fructose and polyethylene glycol fermentation this was supported by the microbial community analysis where known populations that could ferment fructose to ethanol were observed including the uncultured sa 8 clade in spirochaetes koelschbach et al 2017 ignavibacterium in chlorobi iino et al 2010 and anaerolinaceae in chloroflexi yamada and sekiguchi 2009 we also observed bacteroidetes populations that could potentially ferment peg to ethanol dwyer and tiedje 1986 however this could not be further confirmed metagenomically as no study have reported the genomes of known peg fermenters or the sequences of the key enzyme peg aldehyde lyase kawai 2002 accordingly known acids degrading syntrophic bacteria such as syntrophobacter syntrophomonas smithella and syntrophus were not abundant instead geobacter was the most dominant population extensive studies have reported that geobacter species can oxidize ethanol in pure culture using ferric iron as the electron acceptor table s8 in co culture with methanogens rotaru et al 2014a 2014b and in methanogenic granules treating ethanol rich brewery wastewater morita et al 2011 increasing number of studies have suggested the presence of ethanol as substrate could stimulate and enrich geobacter species li et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 2017a which are in line with our observation that geobacter is enriched in reactors containing conductive or nonconductive materials in contrast geobacter might not be enriched if the substrate recipe lacks ethanol even when conductive materials are present reported previously peng et al 2017 poirier et al 2018 yin et al 2017 upon the observation of enriched geobacter most studies focused on the capacity to directly transfer electron and few studies investigated whether geobacter could produce hydrogen our metagenomic analysis showed that bin gac1 could oxidize ethanol using alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidoreductase and transfer electrons to methanogens via both hydrogen production and direct electron transfer for hydrogen production bin gac1 contains the ech cluster that is not found in any cultured geobacter species but in many microbes capable of hydrogen production such as rhodospirillum rubrum and carboxidothermus hydrogenoformans buckel and thauer 2013 to achieve hydrogen mediated electron transfer the ech hydrogenase can couple the oxidation of reduced ferredoxin generated during the oxidation of acetaldehyde to the reduction of proton bin gac1 also possesses hya and hox hydrogenases that can convert excess nadh to hydrogen coppi 2005 such capacity allows bin gac1 to syntrophically oxidize ethanol to acetate by transferring hydrogen to methanogens especially when diet is not possible in the nonconductive ceramic reactor during direct interspecies electron transfer cytochrome is shown to play the key role liu et al 2018 abundant genes coding c type cytochromes were identified in bin gac1 including a gene encoding a periplasmic c type cytochrome ppca that has been shown to serve as an intermediary electron carrier to outer membrane acceptors lloyd et al 2003 bin gac1 does not contain other well studied cytochromes used by g sulfurreducens for fe iii reduction or growth on electrode including maca omcb omce omcf omcg omch omcs omct omcx and omcz this was expected as cytochromes are very poorly conserved 14 in different geobacter species butler et al 2010 in addition bin gac1 exhibits the ability to synthesize type iv pili found in many other geobacter species although it does not have a truncated pila gene as observed in g sulfurreducens and g metallireducens a recent study demonstrated that pilin monomers much larger than those of g sulfurreducens could also generate electrically conductive pili walker et al 2017 many evidences have also ruled out the possibility of electron transport along the length of pili and alternative strategies are proposed for extracellular electron transfer including direct contact with conductive surface and utilization of soluble electron carrier tan et al 2016 thus we speculate that bin gac1 can shift from hydrogen production towards diet when conductive surface is accessible during which cytochromes are involved but not the low conductive pili using diet for electron transfer can provide a bacterium multiple advantages over hydrogen transfer first production of hydrogen by oxidizing nadh and reducing proton is energetically difficult eo h h2 414 mv eo nad nadh 320 mv stams and plugge 2009 fig 6 indicates that the overall ethanol oxidation is thermodynamically more favorable by diet than hydrogen production even only half of the electrons generated in ethanol oxidation and carried by nadh are transferred via diet a 30 kj mol more energy is available comparing to complete hydrogen production second it has been experimentally determined that a large fraction of hydrogen produced from biological fermentation could escape from a methanogenic upflow sludge bed reactor in the gas phase due to low mass transfer coefficients pauss et al 1990 this could explain the low methane production and high cod loss observed in the ceramic reactor although we were not able to monitor the hydrogen losses the relatively loose biofilm on ceramic revealed by sem suggests interspecies hydrogen transfer efficiency might be poor in addition diet can reduce electrochemical loss and this can contribute to enhanced methane production lohner et al 2014 other advantage of diet include faster electron transfer rates storck et al 2016 less energy investment by avoiding synthesizing conductive pili li et al 2014 and alleviating environmental stress lü et al 2016 so far only g sulfurreducens g metallireducens and g hydrogenophilus are conclusively demonstrated to perform diet lovley 2017 our findings demonstrated bin gac1 could be another diet candidate in the genus geobacter phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses revealed that bin gac1 was not associated with any cultured geobacter species but affiliated with an uncultured geobacter clade containing populations found in methanogenic reactors with conductive materials zhao et al 2016 2017b in addition analysis of the ech cluster also revealed significant differences on operon structure and subunit sequences with known geobacter species coppi 2005 orellana 2014 supporting its capacity to produce hydrogen and form syntrophic association with methanogens when diet is not feasible so far most geobacter species were isolated from oligotrophic environments such as subsurface freshwater sediments and no geobacter culture has been isolated from eutrophic ecosystems such as high strength wastewater treating bioreactors table s7 based on these novel traits we propose to name bin gac1 as candidatus geobacter eutrophica sp nov eu tro phi ca gr adj eu rich gr adj trophikos one who feeds n l fem adj eutrophica one that feeds on rich nutrients as it resides in eutrophic anaerobic environments with high organic loadings future research effort can focus on isolating geobacter species from eutrophic environments like wastewater treatment systems to learn more about its physiological trait related to diet and hydrogen transfer with regard to methanogens methanosaeta was dominant in the reactors operated in this study and in a number of methanogenic communities observed with diet table s6 for example the addition of single wall carbon nanotubes stimulated the abundance of methanosaeta in a reactor treating sucrose li et al 2015 and methanosaeta co occurred with geobacter in biochar amended reactors treating propionate and butyrate zhao et al 2016 its dominance suggests the ability to take up both acetate and possibly electrons produced by geobacter owing to the advantages of conductive materials mediated diet higher abundance of methanosaeta in r2 and r3 were observed by qpcr together with higher methane production rate besides methanosaeta the fish qpcr and metagenomics results clearly revealed that reactors containing conductive materials harbored more diverse and abundant archaeal populations than determined by 16s amplicon sequencing possibly due to biases associated with the universal primer used in pcr amplification takahashi et al 2014 the association of methanogens other than methanosaeta with enhanced methane production by conductive materials have been suggested for example hydrogenase independent methane production from cathodic electrons was observed with methanococcus maripaludis lohner et al 2014 conductive materials could also enhance methane production even in pure culture of hydrogenotrophic methanogens salvador et al 2017 the use of dna stable isotope probing technique revealed methanobacteriales was specifically enriched by adding conductive nano fe3o4 in rice paddy soil li et al 2014 methanoregula was enriched and was shown to produce methane via cathode reaction in an electrochemical system chen et al 2016 other methanogens associated with conductive materials include methanospirillum methanolinea lee et al 2016 methanoculleus and methanomassillicoccus dang et al 2017 compared to geobacter the participation of methanogens in diet needs further investigations in diet occurring methanogenic systems 5 conclusion in conclusion by operating reactors amended with conductive or nonconductive materials we observed a novel geobacter species as the dominant population metagenomic analysis revealed that it could oxidize ethanol and transfer the electrons to methanogenic counter partners via hydrogen transfer or diet depending on whether conductive surface is accessible by performing diet with diverse methanogens facilitated by conductive materials geobacter and diverse methanogens could obtain multiple advantages during ethanol oxidation which could lead to enhanced the methane production compared

19259,to determine whether the addition of conductive materials could enhance methane production by direct interspecies electron transfer diet we operated three anaerobic reactors amended with non conductive ceramic or conductive materials anthracite and granular activated carbon gac throughout eight months of operation ethanol was consistently detected as the major fermentation product the specific yield in the anthracite and gac added reactors increased by 31 5 and 43 3 respectively compared to the ceramic added reactor 16s rrna gene sequencing results indicated geobacter was dominant up to 55 of total sequences whereas acids degrading syntrophic bacteria were low in abundance 2 using metagenomic analysis the draft genome of the dominant geobacter population bin gac1 was reconstructed and observed to possess genetic abilities of ethanol oxidation hydrogen production and extracellular electron transfer and represented a phylogenetically novel geobacter species while methanosaeta was the dominant methanogen reactors containing conductive materials harbored more diverse and abundant archaeal populations as revealed by fish qpcr and metagenomics our findings suggested that a novel geobacter population could oxidize ethanol and employed both hydrogen transfer and diet depending on the accessibility of conductive materials thermodynamic advantages of diet over hydrogen production could lead to enhanced methane production in reactors with conductive materials graphical abstract image 1 keywords novel geobacter diverse methanogens conductive materials direct interspecies electron transfer 1 introduction in anaerobic environments organic compounds are metabolized through cooperative interactions between different groups of microorganisms hydrogen and other molecules like formate and cysteine are known to mediate interspecies electron transfer under anaerobic conditions schink and stams 2006 recently a new route of electron exchange i e direct interspecies electron transfer diet was discovered between two geobacter species summers et al 2010 where a co culture of geobacter metallireducens and geobacter sulfurreducens carried out ethanol metabolism by forming electrically conductive aggregates this phenomenon was later observed in methanogenic systems where methanosaeta the obligate aceticlastic methanogens directly accepted electrons from g metallireducens to reduce co2 and produce methane rotaru et al 2014b geobacter is known for its ability to perform extracellular electron transfer and has been used as an indicator of diet lovley 2017 however not all cultured geobacter species are able to perform diet different geobacter species have distinct extracellular electron transfer capacity kato et al 2013 and only three species i e g metallireducens g sulfurreducens and geobacter hydrogenophilus have been clearly documented to perform diet based on evidences of genetic potential gene expression and physiological traits lovley 2017 thus detecting geobacter species in methanogenic environments without careful inspection of the phylogenetic affiliation and physiological traits does not warrant the occurrence of diet on the other hand the fact that many microorganisms could interact with electrodes via extracellular electron transfer implies that the spectrum of bacteria conducting diet can be broader than current understanding koch and harnisch 2016 furthermore while most studies primarily focused on geobacter s diet capacity little is known about the ecological relevance of its hydrogen production capacity in anaerobic systems geobacter genomes contain multiple bidirectional hydrogenases coppi 2005 and g sulfurreducens could produce hydrogen cord ruwisch et al 1998 which suggest geobacter may also utilize hydrogen to share electrons with its counter partners being able to utilize diet and hydrogen for electron transfer provides ecological flexibility to grow under different anaerobic conditions likewise the diversity of methanogens involved in diet is not well understood only two methanogens methanosaeta and methanosarcina from methanosarcinales are demonstrated to participate in diet lovley 2017 however various methanogenic taxa were highly abundant in environments where diet was believed to occur these non methanosarcinales methanogens include methanoregula zhang and lu 2016 methanoculleus methanomassillicoccus dang et al 2017 methanospirillum and methanolinea lee et al 2016 and their roles in diet remain elusive moreover the extracellular electron contacts for instance cytochrome that allow methanogens to accept electron via diet are not known rotaru et al 2014a an increasing number of studies have reported that adding conductive materials such as biochar chen et al 2014b carbon cloth chen et al 2014a and granular activated carbon gac liu et al 2012 could facilitate diet and enhance anaerobic metabolism efficiency however many studies concluded the occurrence of diet by comparing to a reactor without the addition of any materials and by observing the presence of geobacter using 16s rrna gene sequencing such experimental design can be improved by including a control reactor with non conductive materials and inspecting the enriched populations with additional ecological tools to assess the effect of conductive materials on methane production and the potential hydrogen transfer or diet driven microbial ecology this study operated three packed bed reactors treating synthetic wastewater produced from soft drink industry three common packing

months by gradually decreasing hrt from 6 days to 3 days then 2 days all reactors showed high cod removal efficiencies 95 one sample t test p 0 001 fig s1a with r3 slightly higher than r1 and r2 two sample paired t test p 0 001 soluble toc measurement exhibited the similar trends fig s1b ethanol was detected as the key product from fructose and polyethylene glycol fermentation 87 of influent cod in the reactor effluent averaged at 0 67 mm in r1 0 58 mm in r2 and 0 62 mm in r3 fig 1 a short chain fatty acids including formate acetate propionate butyrate and lactate were seldom detected fig s1c most ph values of the three reactors were within 6 5 6 9 as a result of bicarbonate buffer in the influent fig s1d fig 1b indicates that r3 had the highest total biogas production rate in all three hrt periods 0 47 0 86 and 1 36 l d followed by r2 0 37 0 73 and 1 21 l d and r1 0 30 0 59 and 0 63 l d fig 1b also shows apparent differences in methane concentrations where r3 had the highest average concentration in all hrts 24 70 30 19 and 38 28 mmol l followed by r2 12 77 22 80 and 32 91 mmol l and r1 6 08 11 72 and 14 85 mmol l fig 1c indicates higher vss concentration in r1 effluent 0 301 g l than in r2 0 063 g l and r3 0 057 g l inspecting biomass attached to material surface by sem revealed that the ceramic material had less microbial colonization and more exposed surface area fig s2a whereas anthracite fig s2b and gac fig s2c were mostly covered by thick layer of biomass although the three reactors were inoculated with the same amount of seed sludge the differences in biomass washout and surface colonization led to in distinctive biomass inventory retained in reactors at the end of the operation r1 contained 7 3 g vss whereas r2 and r3 contained 23 8 g and 28 6 g respectively using the data obtained from the last hrt period at 2 days the average specific yield was 1 27 mmol ch4 g vss d in r1 and increased by 31 5 to 1 67 in r2 and by 43 3 to 1 82 in r3 we also calculated cod mass balance by subtracting influent cod with cod in effluent biomass loss and methane production table s2 reactor 1 had a large proportion of cod that could not be explained whereas r2 and r3 had less values in each hrt period 3 2 microbial population dynamics based on 16s rrna gene 16s rrna gene amplicon analysis suggested that geobacter related populations representing 0 1 of total sequences in the seed anaerobic digester sludge were highly enriched during reactor operation 15 55 of total sequences fig 2 other abundant bacterial populations are likely fermenters including the uncultured sa 8 clade in spirochaetes up to 19 in relative abundance ignavibacterium in chlorobi up to 12 and anaerolinaceae in chloroflexi up to 20 known fatty acids degrading syntrophs such as syntrophus syntrophomonas smithella and syntrophobacter were detected at an abundance 2 the relative abundance of archaea in total sequences was low i e 1 2 in r1 2 8 in r2 and 1 7 in r3 on average fig 3 a methanosaeta was the most dominant methanogen accounting for 1 1 2 1 and 1 4 of total sequences in r1 r2 and r3 on average respectively other methanogens were present at lower abundance 0 5 methanogens abundance was further analyzed using qpcr with taxa specific primers fig 3b in comparison to 16s amplicon sequencing results the relative abundances of archaea in the microbial community bacteria archaea in r2 8 8 and r3 13 5 were higher than in r1 1 3 methanosaeta was dominant representing 1 2 7 3 and 6 7 of total 16s rrna gene copy number in r1 r2 and r3 on average respectively other methanogens including methanomicrobiales and methanobacteriales were more abundant in r2 and r3 than in r1 the methanogens diversity residing in r2 and r3 was further confirmed by fish using 16s rrna oligoprobes targeting different taxa fig s3 among archaeal populations that were hybridized by probe arc915 methanosaeta like cells targeted by probe mx825 in rod shape were abundant in r1 meanwhile many coccus like archaeal cells hybridized by probe arc915 but not probe mx825 were observed in r2 and r3 table s3 3 3 function of uncultured geobacter and diversity of methanogens revealed by metagenomics metagenomic analysis was performed on samples taken from the three reactors on day 106 the average assembled contig sizes approximated to 3 kb and the reads mapping percentages were 90 table s4 the draft genome of the most abundant population designated as bin gac1 was recovered using the differential coverage binning strategy fig s4 it had 90 genome completeness and 7 contamination based on two independent approaches checkm and miga table s5 16s rrna gene based phylogenetic analysis revealed that bin gac1 was closely affiliated to the dominant otu 50569 determined by 16s rrna amplicon sequencing fig 4 a they were distantly related to any cultured geobacter species and other genera in the family geobacteraceae but were clustered together with environmental clones retrieved from anaerobic bioreactors such as anaerobic digesters amended with conductive materials expanded granular sludge bed reactors and microbial fuel cells phylogenomic analysis indicated bin gac1 did not closely affiliate to cultured geobacter species fig 4b miga analysis based on whole genome average amino acids identity aai supported that bin gac1 is a member of the genus geobacter p value 0 179 but not represented by any cultured species p value 0 00385 gene annotation suggested that of bin gac1 could oxidize ethanol and transport electrons by both direct electron transfer and hydrogen production it contained two adjacent genes coding nadh dependent alcohol dehydrogenase adh and ferredoxin dependent aldehyde oxidoreductase aor which were highly similar to well known ethanol oxidizers such as g metallireducens and pelobacter carbinolicus fig 5 a table s6 bin gac1 also contained genes encoding nadh ubiquinone dehydrogenase and ubiquinone cytochrome c oxidoreductase that could transfer electrons from nadh to quinones and cytochromes further thirty eight coding sequences that potentially encoded c type cytochromes were identified one was highly similar to the gene coding periplasmic c type cytochrome ppca bin gac1 also possessed the gene cluster for type iv pili pila pilr pils pilc pilt and pilb fig s5a as the pila gene was longer than the truncated pila genes in g metallireducens and g sulfurreducens the pili of bin gac1 were likely similar to those low conductive pili found in geobacter uraniireducens and geobacter daltonii fig s5b bin gac1 further exhibited the capacity of hydrogen production the ech cluster echa echb echc echd eche and echf coding the energy conserving nife hydrogenase complex was highly similar to those in desulfovibrio spp methanosarcina spp and another uncultured geobacter species m18 fig 5b the ech cluster in bin gac1 was structurally different from a similar but functionally unknown cluster ech related complex ehr found in other cultured geobacter species including g sulfurreducens g metallireducens g pickeringii and g soli alignment of the n and c termini of ech and ehr large subunits confirmed that bin gac1 encoded two nife centre binding cysteine residues that were critical for hydrogen production and conserved among ech complex but not ehr complex fig s6a phylogenetic analysis of the conserved ech and ehr small subunit further suggested bin gac1 encoded a different complex from g sulfurreducens and g metallireducens fig s6b meanwhile bin gac1 contained two more hydrogenases the cytoplasmic bidirectional nad reducing hoxplsufe complex and the periplasmically oriented membrane bound hyaslbp complex both were likely involved in converting excess reducing equivalents to hydrogen bin gac1 did not possess genes coding the fefe bifurcating hydrogenase hyd nad ferredoxin reductase rnf trans hydrogenase nfn methyl viologen reducing hydrogenase mvh nife heterodimeric hydrogenase hyn and nifese heterodimeric hydrogenase hys for archaea a total of 21 bins were recovered using maxbin fig s7 by mapping each bin back to the trimmed reads the total abundance of all archaeal bins was calculated to be 2 9 in r1 3 4 in r2 and 4 6 in r3 fig 3c like 16s rrna gene analysis bins associated with methanosaeta were the most abundant ten bins with max abundance 1 7 these bins all had multiple copies of gene for cytochrome c biogenesis proteins that were similar 50 identity and 50 coverage to those in methanosaeta harundinacea 6ac which is the well documented methanosaeta species capable of diet they also all had a gene potentially coding cytochrome c class i with 50 amino acids identity but low coverage 23 to the counterpart in m harundinacea 6ac mhar 1883 eleven bins max abundance 1 0 associated with other methanogenic populations were also detected including taxa related to methanomicrobiales methanobacteriales and uncultured euryarchaeota clade methanogens diversity was also estimated by calculating img annotated phylogenetic distribution of genes in each assembly fig 3d the abundance of genes that were associated to archaea was much higher in r2 13 7 and r3 9 2 than in r1 3 1 while methanosaeta was dominant genes associated with other methanogens were abundantly detected in r2 and r3 4 discussion in studying diet based methanogenesis conductive materials are often added into reactors to observe whether methane production is enhanced compared to a reference reactor without material addition table s7 such a comparison could be improved by including a control reactor added with non conductive materials because any materials regardless of conductivity could theoretically promote cell aggregation and biofilm development offer protective barriers and enhance sorption of organic compounds flemming and wingender 2010 the ability to retain active biomass in a reactor could also impact reactor performance yoda and nishimura 1997 which is neglected by many studies table s6 thus this study compared reactors added with conductive or nonconductive materials and calculated the methane production rate based on the total biomass retained in individual reactors the normalized methane production based on cod removed and retained biomass was 29 and 40 higher in reactors added with anthracite and gac respectively than with ceramic sem observations and vss measurement indicated that conductive materials could support better biomass colonization which might be attributed to the advantage of diet as discussed below during the reactor operation ethanol instead of short chain acids was constantly detected in the effluent suggesting that ethanol was the major product during fructose and polyethylene glycol fermentation this was supported by the microbial community analysis where known populations that could ferment fructose to ethanol were observed including the uncultured sa 8 clade in spirochaetes koelschbach et al 2017 ignavibacterium in chlorobi iino et al 2010 and anaerolinaceae in chloroflexi yamada and sekiguchi 2009 we also observed bacteroidetes populations that could potentially ferment peg to ethanol dwyer and tiedje 1986 however this could not be further confirmed metagenomically as no study have reported the genomes of known peg fermenters or the sequences of the key enzyme peg aldehyde lyase kawai 2002 accordingly known acids degrading syntrophic bacteria such as syntrophobacter syntrophomonas smithella and syntrophus were not abundant instead geobacter was the most dominant population extensive studies have reported that geobacter species can oxidize ethanol in pure culture using ferric iron as the electron acceptor table s8 in co culture with methanogens rotaru et al 2014a 2014b and in methanogenic granules treating ethanol rich brewery wastewater morita et al 2011 increasing number of studies have suggested the presence of ethanol as substrate could stimulate and enrich geobacter species li et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 2017a which are in line with our observation that geobacter is enriched in reactors containing conductive or nonconductive materials in contrast geobacter might not be enriched if the substrate recipe lacks ethanol even when conductive materials are present reported previously peng et al 2017 poirier et al 2018 yin et al 2017 upon the observation of enriched geobacter most studies focused on the capacity to directly transfer electron and few studies investigated whether geobacter could produce hydrogen our metagenomic analysis showed that bin gac1 could oxidize ethanol using alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidoreductase and transfer electrons to methanogens via both hydrogen production and direct electron transfer for hydrogen production bin gac1 contains the ech cluster that is not found in any cultured geobacter species but in many microbes capable of hydrogen production such as rhodospirillum rubrum and carboxidothermus hydrogenoformans buckel and thauer 2013 to achieve hydrogen mediated electron transfer the ech hydrogenase can couple the oxidation of reduced ferredoxin generated during the oxidation of acetaldehyde to the reduction of proton bin gac1 also possesses hya and hox hydrogenases that can convert excess nadh to hydrogen coppi 2005 such capacity allows bin gac1 to syntrophically oxidize ethanol to acetate by transferring hydrogen to methanogens especially when diet is not possible in the nonconductive ceramic reactor during direct interspecies electron transfer cytochrome is shown to play the key role liu et al 2018 abundant genes coding c type cytochromes were identified in bin gac1 including a gene encoding a periplasmic c type cytochrome ppca that has been shown to serve as an intermediary electron carrier to outer membrane acceptors lloyd et al 2003 bin gac1 does not contain other well studied cytochromes used by g sulfurreducens for fe iii reduction or growth on electrode including maca omcb omce omcf omcg omch omcs omct omcx and omcz this was expected as cytochromes are very poorly conserved 14 in different geobacter species butler et al 2010 in addition bin gac1 exhibits the ability to synthesize type iv pili found in many other geobacter species although it does not have a truncated pila gene as observed in g sulfurreducens and g metallireducens a recent study demonstrated that pilin monomers much larger than those of g sulfurreducens could also generate electrically conductive pili walker et al 2017 many evidences have also ruled out the possibility of electron transport along the length of pili and alternative strategies are proposed for extracellular electron transfer including direct contact with conductive surface and utilization of soluble electron carrier tan et al 2016 thus we speculate that bin gac1 can shift from hydrogen production towards diet when conductive surface is accessible during which cytochromes are involved but not the low conductive pili using diet for electron transfer can provide a bacterium multiple advantages over hydrogen transfer first production of hydrogen by oxidizing nadh and reducing proton is energetically difficult eo h h2 414 mv eo nad nadh 320 mv stams and plugge 2009 fig 6 indicates that the overall ethanol oxidation is thermodynamically more favorable by diet than hydrogen production even only half of the electrons generated in ethanol oxidation and carried by nadh are transferred via diet a 30 kj mol more energy is available comparing to complete hydrogen production second it has been experimentally determined that a large fraction of hydrogen produced from biological fermentation could escape from a methanogenic upflow sludge bed reactor in the gas phase due to low mass transfer coefficients pauss et al 1990 this could explain the low methane production and high cod loss observed in the ceramic reactor although we were not able to monitor the hydrogen losses the relatively loose biofilm on ceramic revealed by sem suggests interspecies hydrogen transfer efficiency might be poor in addition diet can reduce electrochemical loss and this can contribute to enhanced methane production lohner et al 2014 other advantage of diet include faster electron transfer rates storck et al 2016 less energy investment by avoiding synthesizing conductive pili li et al 2014 and alleviating environmental stress lü et al 2016 so far only g sulfurreducens g metallireducens and g hydrogenophilus are conclusively demonstrated to perform diet lovley 2017 our findings demonstrated bin gac1 could be another diet candidate in the genus geobacter phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses revealed that bin gac1 was not associated with any cultured geobacter species but affiliated with an uncultured geobacter clade containing populations found in methanogenic reactors with conductive materials zhao et al 2016 2017b in addition analysis of the ech cluster also revealed significant differences on operon structure and subunit sequences with known geobacter species coppi 2005 orellana 2014 supporting its capacity to produce hydrogen and form syntrophic association with methanogens when diet is not feasible so far most geobacter species were isolated from oligotrophic environments such as subsurface freshwater sediments and no geobacter culture has been isolated from eutrophic ecosystems such as high strength wastewater treating bioreactors table s7 based on these novel traits we propose to name bin gac1 as candidatus geobacter eutrophica sp nov eu tro phi ca gr adj eu rich gr adj trophikos one who feeds n l fem adj eutrophica one that feeds on rich nutrients as it resides in eutrophic anaerobic environments with high organic loadings future research effort can focus on isolating geobacter species from eutrophic environments like wastewater treatment systems to learn more about its physiological trait related to diet and hydrogen transfer with regard to methanogens methanosaeta was dominant in the reactors operated in this study and in a number of methanogenic communities observed with diet table s6 for example the addition of single wall carbon nanotubes stimulated the abundance of methanosaeta in a reactor treating sucrose li et al 2015 and methanosaeta co occurred with geobacter in biochar amended reactors treating propionate and butyrate zhao et al 2016 its dominance suggests the ability to take up both acetate and possibly electrons produced by geobacter owing to the advantages of conductive materials mediated diet higher abundance of methanosaeta in r2 and r3 were observed by qpcr together with higher methane production rate besides methanosaeta the fish qpcr and metagenomics results clearly revealed that reactors containing conductive materials harbored more diverse and abundant archaeal populations than determined by 16s amplicon sequencing possibly due to biases associated with the universal primer used in pcr amplification takahashi et al 2014 the association of methanogens other than methanosaeta with enhanced methane production by conductive materials have been suggested for example hydrogenase independent methane production from cathodic electrons was observed with methanococcus maripaludis lohner et al 2014 conductive materials could also enhance methane production even in pure culture of hydrogenotrophic methanogens salvador et al 2017 the use of dna stable isotope probing technique revealed methanobacteriales was specifically enriched by adding conductive nano fe3o4 in rice paddy soil li et al 2014 methanoregula was enriched and was shown to produce methane via cathode reaction in an electrochemical system chen et al 2016 other methanogens associated with conductive materials include methanospirillum methanolinea lee et al 2016 methanoculleus and methanomassillicoccus dang et al 2017 compared to geobacter the participation of methanogens in diet needs further investigations in diet occurring methanogenic systems 5 conclusion in conclusion by operating reactors amended with conductive or nonconductive materials we observed a novel geobacter species as the dominant population metagenomic analysis revealed that it could oxidize ethanol and transfer the electrons to methanogenic counter partners via hydrogen transfer or diet depending on whether conductive surface is accessible by performing diet with diverse methanogens facilitated by conductive materials geobacter and diverse methanogens could obtain multiple advantages during ethanol oxidation which could lead to enhanced the methane production compared to the reactor with nonconductive materials acknowledgements we are grateful to na kyung kim and kyohei kuroda at uiuc for inspiring discussion and to zhiqiang zhao at dalian university of technology
