5565,soil water content swc is critical for the health and sustainability of the ecosystem in water limited areas characterized by low precipitation and deep groundwater the chinese loess plateau clp has experienced intensive agricultural and revegetation activities for a period long enough to alter the state of swc to the extent that can affect plant growth and water cycle knowledge of long term swc dynamics under land use change is therefore important for optimal water management and vegetation restoration in this water scarce region this study simulated and analyzed long term 1970 2060 variations in swc in the top 4 m soil layer in response to land use change on clp using the hydrus 1d model soil and plant parameters required for the model were validated using in situ swc data for different land use types exotic grass m sativa exotic shrub c korshinskii arable crop s italica or v radiata and natural grass s bungeana five phases of swc dynamics driven by land use change were identified i fluctuation of swc with rainfall during arable cropping period ii rapid drop of swc after exotic plant establishment iii period of no change for which swc remained low and stable iv gradual recovery of swc after conversion of exotic vegetation into natural grass and v fluctuation of swc with rainfall under natural grass particularly swc decreased rapidly with the planting of m sativa and c korshinskii and water depletion depth increased with plant growth after revegetation dry soil layer dsl began to develop below 1 m after 3 years of growth of m sativa or c korshinskii also swc at depth below 1 m remained low and unavailable for plant growth compared with arable cropland swc in the 1 4 m soil layer decreased by 33 under both exotic grass and shrub during vegetation restoration period however it took 7 8 years for soil water to recover in the 0 4 m soil layer after 13 year 2004 2016 exotic grass or shrub was converted to natural grass this suggested that dsl in the 4 m soil depth can fully recover by changing vegetation type we concluded that planting m sativa and c korshinskii on arable cropland could enhance dsl formation in deep soil profile but can gradually disappear upon land use change the results provided useful information for the prediction of long term dynamics of soil water with land use change this is critical for the management of soil water in water limited areas keywords soil water dynamics dry soil layer land use change hydrus 1d model chinese loess plateau 1 introduction soil water content swc is a key variable for land surface hydrological processes controlling water and energy fluxes in the soil koster et al 2004 oki and kanae 2006 hu et al 2013 it is also a critical parameter for the health and sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems in water limited regions and in regions with seasonal water shortage seneviratne et al 2010 vereecken et al 2015 jia et al 2020 swc dynamics is related to climatic conditions and land use type seneviratne et al 2010 hirschi et al 2011 wang et al 2011 changes in climate and land use could alter the state of swc in both shallow feng et al 2017 and deep jia et al 2017 soil layers this can in turn affect plant growth solute transport and biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems breshears et al 2005 oki and kanae 2006 jia et al 2020 thus understanding long term variations in swc under land use change is useful for water management especially in water scarce regions due to long term agricultural activities and poor management practices li 1983 wine et al 2012a the chinese loess plateau clp has become one of the most severely eroded areas in the world here severe soil erosion and water loss have increased the fragility of the ecosystem shi and shao 2000 thus vegetation restoration measures have been done since the 1950s to control soil erosion and improve ecosystem services in the region the landscape has changed visibly with about 10 8 of agricultural land reconverted to forest shrubland and grassland feng et al 2016 based on remote sensing images vegetation cover on clp has increased from 32 in 1999 to 60 in 2013 chen et al 2015 however to ensure high biomass and economic benefits local farmers have planted vast areas with exotic plant species e g robinia pseudoacacia caragana korshinskii and medicago sativa etc that grow rapidly with deep root penetration shao et al 2018 these high water demanding species have decreased swc that has aggravated soil water shortage in both the shallow and deep soil layers further endangering the health of the ecosystem and groundwater recharge fang et al 2016 jia et al 2017 turkeltaub et al 2018 hu et al 2019 for example zhang et al 2018a found that deep rooted vegetation prevent groundwater recharge in highland regions of clp by excessive uptake of deep soil water model sensitivity analysis also shows that rooting depth is the most important plant related factor affecting soil water balance wine et al 2015 the current vegetation cover on clp exceeds the state of climate defined equilibrium zhang et al 2018b and the net primary productivity is approaching the threshold defined by sustainable water resource feng et al 2016 the introduction of exotic high water consumption plants and or high density planting has caused deep 1 m below land surface soil water deficit that has led to the formation of dry soil layers dsls on clp wang et al 2010a 2011 jia et al 2017 2019b 2020 dsl is a desiccated soil layer of certain thickness that occurs at a certain depth in the soil profile which alters the equilibrium between root water uptake and soil water supply chen et al 2008 wang et al 2011 dsl occurs widely across clp with a mean formation depth of 270 cm and thickness of 160 cm wang et al 2010a the occurrence of dsl or deep soil desiccation can interfere with water cycle in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac by preventing water flow between top and deep soil layers gao et al 2018 hu et al 2019 in addition dsl can cause land degradation tree die off and aridity of local climatic environment breshears et al 2005 chen et al 2015 feng et al 2017 consequently limiting ecosystem sustainability in arid and semi arid regions since dsl was first observed on clp in the 1960s in a high yield farmland in drought affected pucheng and chengcheng counties li 1983 numerous studies have been conducted on dsl in the plateau region the research topics have included the formation and evolution of dsl wang et al 2010b jia et al 2015 2019b spatial distribution and driving factors of dsl wang et al 2010a 2011 jia et al 2020 and effects of dsl on eco hydrological processes shangguan 2007 chen et al 2008 zhang et al 2018a b however few studies have been done in connection with long term variations in swc of dsls in response to land use change this can further broaden existing understanding on soil water dynamics under dsl conditions various mathematical models have been used to predict soil water dynamics water balance and soil desiccation processes in clp region wang et al 2008 2010b 2012 liu and shao 2015 for example using the one dimensional simultaneous heat and water transfer shaw model to simulate the recovery of dsl in the 0 10 m soil layer huang and gallichand 2006 found that the average duration of soil water recovery was 13 7 years after conversion of 30 year old apple orchard land to winter wheat land in southern clp region the shaw model was also used to assess the consumption of soil water with growth of c korshinskii and m sativa and the optimal carrying capacity in northern clp region liu and shao 2015 these results show that dsl starts to develop below the 1 m soil layer after 5 years of c korshinskii and 3 years of m sativa cultivation wang et al 2012 used the environmental policy integrated climate epic model to simulate dsl dynamics and suggested that m sativa should be planted for less than 10 years in semi humid loess regions the hydrus 1d model was also used to assess the long term impact of land use change on soil water balance components in a typical loess tableland on clp li et al 2019 it was noted that the conversion of farmland to apple orchard reduced soil water storage and groundwater recharge threatening the sustainability of water resources and agriculture in the plateau region li et al 2019 most of the model based studies however have only focused on soil water dynamics under one or two land use types this has limited our understanding of the long term variations in soil hydrologic processes including the formation evolution and recovery of dsl on clp with land use change the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate soil water movement soil water dynamics and water budget on clp yi and fan 2016 turkeltaub et al 2018 li et al 2019 hu et al 2019 from which variations in spac was determined here the physically based hydrus 1d model was used to simulate long term variations in soil water and the related response to land use change in the northern region of clp uncertainty analysis of modeling results is required to deal with inherent uncertainties in hydrological predictions beven 2008 although there are unavoidable uncertainties in predicting long term soil hydrologic processes by hydrus 1d model it is still necessary to predict swc dynamics in response to land use change on a longer time scale the prediction results are critical for understanding long term changes in soil water supply and the possibility of dsl recovery under land use change and or climate change information on long term swc dynamics can provide scientific basis for the regulation and sustainable management of soil water in the water limited plateau region the specific objectives of this study were to 1 simulate and characterize long term 1970 2060 swc dynamics in the 0 4 m soil profile under land use change 2 determine the formation and evolution processes of dsl under m sativa and c korshinskii and 3 assess soil water recovery after conversion of m sativa and c korshinskii fields to natural grassland in the water limited area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in liudaogou catchment lat 38 46 38 51 n lon 110 21 110 23 e 1248 m a s l 14 km west of shenmu county which is situated in the water wind erosion crisscross of northern clp fig 1 liudaogou catchment is characterized by deep gullies and undulating slopes the climate is semi arid temperate with a mean annual temperature of 9 0 c 1961 2016 data from local weather station the average annual precipitation is 427 mm with significant seasonal and inter annual variations in the effort to control soil erosion and land degradation widespread vegetation restoration measures have been implemented in the region since the 1990s the most common vegetation restoration in the study area includes m sativa c korshinskii or fallow land for natural vegetation recovery c korshinskii and m sativa were introduced because of their strong drought resistance high survival soil nutrient improvement ability and fast growth the dominant native grass species is stipa bungeana the main arable crops include setaria italica or vigna radiata cultivated in rotation without irrigation the soil in the study area belongs to aeolian loess of calcaric regosol fao unesco soil classification system comprising 45 51 sand 30 45 silt and 11 14 clay usda soil textural classification liu and shao 2014 the soil texture is relatively homogeneous in the vertical direction 2 2 field measurements to monitor temporal patterns of swc under different land use types in the northern clp permanent plots were established for continuous profile swc measurement in the catchment four plots 61 m 5 m were established in 2003 to represent four land use types exotic grass m sativa exotic shrub c korshinskii arable crop s italica or v radiata in rotation and natural grass s bungeana on a uniformly cultivated slope 12 facing northwest fig 2 fertilizer was applied on the arable crops at the rate of 120 kg ha 1 n and 60 kg ha 1 p2o5 per annum as recommended by the local framers thus we presumed that the plots had similar initial chemical and physical conditions and were not replicated a concrete wall of height 0 2 m above the ground and 0 3 m below the ground was constructed around each of the plots to prevent lateral surface and subsurface flow of water from one plot to the other a total of 11 aluminum neutron probe access tubes 4 2 m in length were installed at 5 m intervals along the middle of each plot during the growing seasons from july 2004 to october 2016 volumetric swc was measured fortnightly or monthly to the depth of 4 m at 10 cm intervals for the 0 1 m soil profile and at 20 cm intervals for the depth below 1 m using a calibrated neutron probe cnc beijing china during the period 2004 2016 swc was measured 92 times and the data used to calibrate and validate the hydrus 1d model for analyzing temporal variations in swc after planting exotic grass and shrubs further details on the plots and swc measurement are documented by liu and shao 2014 2 3 model description in the study hydrus 1d šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 šimůnek et al 2008 was used to simulate long term dynamics of swc under different land use types the modified richards equation for one dimensional unsaturated water flow richards 1931 van genuchten 1980 was used a sink term was added to richards equation to account for water uptake by plant roots because vertical permeability is much higher than horizontal one in the loess soil parsons et al 2009 yi and fan 2016 lateral subsurface flow in the study area was not considered i e zero flux boundary condition especially when soil water remained low after vegetation restoration yi and fan 2016 hu et al 2019 a standard atmospheric boundary was the upper boundary condition and ponding depth on the soil surface was zero the lower boundary was defined by a unit vertical hydraulic gradient simulating free drainage from a relatively deep soil profile because the water table was much deeper 30 m than the domain of interest water flow simulation in response to land use change was implemented daily for the period 1961 2060 the whole simulation profile for each vegetation type was discretized into 10 nodes i e 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 0 8 1 0 1 0 1 6 1 6 2 0 2 0 3 0 and 3 0 4 0 m a higher density of nodes was placed near the top of the soil profile where strong hydraulic gradients can occur to limit mass balance errors below 1 0 table s1 wine et al 2015 the initial profile distribution of pressure head was set to increase linearly from the top 600 cm to the bottom 300 cm with a unit gradient a spin up was done to get initial conditions to a dynamic equilibrium which was reached at a maximum of 9 years to drive the relative error to below 1 0 for the swc at 4 m depth to minimize the effect of initial conditions the simulation results for 1961 1969 were removed for data analysis hu et al 2019 2 4 data sources 2 4 1 meteorological parameters daily meteorological data including daily precipitation p maximum air temperature tmax minimum air temperature tmin relative humidity rh wind speed ws and sunshine hours sh were obtained for 1961 2016 from an automatic weather station near the liudaogou catchment study area a total of six steps were taken to ensure that the meteorological data were of an adequately high quality i climatic limit value or allowable value check ii station extreme value check iii internal consistency check between fixed time value daily mean value and daily extreme value iv time consistency check v spatial consistency check and vi manual verification and correction potential radiation was the radiation term relative humidity represented the vapor pressure input and radiation extinction coefficient based on canopy structure taken as 0 463 meteorological data for 2017 2060 were randomly generated from the period 1961 2016 using rand function huang and gallichand 2006 for each julian day in 2017 2060 meteorological data were randomly selected from the same julian day in 1961 2016 there were no significant difference in seasonal or inter annual variations in precipitation among the datasets for 1961 2016 2017 2060 and 1961 2060 for example the mean precipitation values for spring summer autumn and winter in 2017 2060 were 59 5 258 3 91 3 and 7 7 mm then for 1961 2016 the values were 58 6 266 9 92 8 and 8 5 mm respectively the coefficients of variation cvs of annual precipitation were the same for 1961 2016 30 5 2017 2060 27 4 and 1961 2060 29 3 therefore the historic seasonal and inter annual precipitation patterns were fully captured in the future climate scenario by the rand function because the duration of 55 years of recorded data was five times longer than the single climate cycle duration which is 11 years observed in the region shen 1991 note that this study did not consider the effect of future climate change at the local scale although future climate change was well recognized daily temperature and rainfall for 2004 2016 are plotted in fig s1 2 4 2 plant parameters different plant biological characteristics lead to different relationships among root water uptake rate and pressure head conditions using feddes model the small grains grass and alfalfa options were used for root water uptake by arable crops natural grass and exotic grass respectively the alfalfa option was also used for exotic shrub with feddes parameters based on the studies by xia 2008 and cheng et al 2013 plant height lai and root depth were all set at measured values as documented in the literature xia and shao 2008 she et al 2009 liu and shao 2015 hu et al 2019 time series data for plant parameters were reconstructed based on the years of vegetation in the northern clp region root distribution for exotic grass m sativa and shrub c korshinskii was obtained from the studies by cheng et al 2007 2009 2013 root distribution characteristics for different vegetation types used in the simulation are shown in fig s2 the plant parameters during the spinning up periods 1961 1969 were assumed to be consistent with those in 1970 2060 for arable crops 2 4 3 soil hydraulic parameters at each site 10 soil cores were collected using soil auger 5 cm in diameter for measuring soil particle composition of various soil layers i e 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 0 8 1 0 1 0 1 5 1 5 2 0 2 0 3 0 and 3 0 4 0 m the disturbed soil samples were air dried and passed through a 1 mm mesh the particle composition of the samples was measured by laser diffraction using the mastersizer2000 malvern instruments malvern england furthermore undisturbed soil cores were excavated at 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 and 0 2 0 4 m soil depths to measure saturated hydraulic conductivity ks bulk density bd saturated swc θs and field capacity fc the soil hydraulic parameters required for the hydrus 1d included ks θs residual swc θr and the van genuchten model shape parameters α and n ks was determined using the constant head method klute et al 1986 and bd determined from volume dry mass relationship for each soil core sample soil water retention function and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity were estimated by the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 the shape parameters of α n and θr were estimated using the rosetta pedotransfer function jana and mohanty 2012 field capacity fc was defined as swc at soil suction of 33 kpa the hydrus 1d inverse solution module was used to optimize soil hydraulic parameters n and α for modeling simplicity hysteresis was not considered in the study the initial soil parameters for the rosetta model and optimized parameters are shown in tables 1 and 2 2 5 model calibration and validation the soil parameters were calibrated by measured swc data under exotic grass and the plant parameters calibrated for each vegetation type using swc data measured in 2004 2009 and then validated using data for 2010 2016 before calibration a sensitivity analysis based on morris screening method was used to analyze uncertainty in all the input parameters a total of 67 parameters were analyzed in the study the input parameters were then adjusted according to the uncertainty analysis 2 6 soil water under two land use change scenarios based on the changes in land use pattern in the experimental plots and the trends in succession of local vegetation types in the study area two scenarios were set i arable crop to exotic grass to natural grass and ii arable crop to exotic shrub to natural grass among these s italica or v radiata was cultivated under arable crop in 1970 2003 and the feddes model set for small grains the vegetation restoration period was 2004 2016 with vegetation types including exotic grass and exotic shrub and the feddes model set for alfalfa natural grass stage for 2017 2060 was completely removed for exotic vegetation and converted into natural grass and the feddes model set for grass thus soil water movement and the formation development and recovery of dry soil layer under the land use change were investigated 2 7 dry soil layer characterization dry soil layer dsl was characterized as swc lower than stable field capacity sfc and distribution below mean annual infiltration depth in the soil profile shao et al 2018 from li 1983 sfc represents the original soil water regime below the typical depth of rainwater infiltration without the influence of soil evaporation and root water uptake which is highly dependent on soil texture and equivalent to 50 75 of field capacity fc studies show that the depth of rainwater infiltration was generally within 1 m for m sativa and c korshinskii and the maximum depth was within 2 m for extreme wet years fu et al 2012 the top 1 m soil tends to be replenished by rainwater infiltration wang et al 2010a b thus a depth of 1 m was assigned as the upper boundary of dsl in this study the sfc is generally assumed to be 60 of fc shao et al 2018 based on soil texture in the northern clp region a layer with swc lower than sfc is considered as dsl with this sfc of 12 0 was used in the study 2 8 statistical analyses the performances of the hydrus 1d model for the different land use types were evaluated using statistical analyses the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percent error mape were used to assess the agreement between simulated and observed values hu et al 2013 jia et al 2019a the indices were calculated as follows 1 nse 1 t 1 n θ i t obs θ i t sim 2 t 1 n θ i t obs θ i obs 2 2 rmse t 1 n θ i t obs θ i t sim 2 n 3 mape 1 n t 1 n θ i t obs θ i t sim θ i t obs 100 where θt obs and θt sim are observed and simulated values at time t and depth i respectively and n is the number of observations nse was used to measure the goodness of fit the closer the model efficiency was to 1 0 the more accurate the model was lower values of rmse and mape indicated higher accuracy of the swc simulation 3 results and discussions 3 1 model calibration and validation 3 1 1 uncertainty analysis there are various sources of model uncertainty related to model structures parameter inputs and boundary conditions beven 2008 pathak et al 2012 in this study the uncertainty of the main model parameters e g soil plant and meteorological data was estimated via sensitivity analysis wine et al 2015 a total of 67 parameters were analyzed table s2 and readers can refer to li et al 2003 2018 for details on specific steps sensitivity analysis suggested that swc dynamics was most sensitive to climate moderate sensitive to soil hydraulic parameters and least sensitive to plant related parameters agreeing partly with the results of wine et al 2015 the relative importance of the van genuchten hydraulic model parameters considered are given in decreasing order as n θs α θr and ks li et al 2018 hu et al 2019 the most important plant related parameters were plant height the feddes parameters root water uptake parameters for the feddes model and root depth as meteorological related parameters were measured in the study area and passed quality control test the soil hydraulic and plant related parameters were estimated and adjusted in the order of sensitivity to improve model performances 3 1 2 model evaluation the hydrus 1d model was run in daily step for the period from july 2004 through october 2009 for model calibration and april 2010 through october 2016 for validation daily simulated and observed swc for the 0 1 and 1 4 m soil layers are plotted in figs 3 and 4 respectively the model performance was examined by linear regression of the simulated and observed swc for different soil layers figs 5 and 6 the simulated and observed soil water storage sws in the 0 1 m profile matched well for the four vegetation types with nse of 0 54 0 25 0 71 and 0 56 for arable crops natural grass exotic grass and exotic shrubs respectively fig 5 note that some measured and simulated values had relatively large errors in the shallow layers particularly for the upper 0 6 m soil layer figs s3 s6 and table s3 there are several possible explanations for the poor simulations in the shallow soil layers first macro pore flow could be critical for soil water movement in the shallow soil layer beven and germann 1982 but not fully captured in the simulation especially for exotic grass or shrubs preferential flow via decayed roots in shallow layers for exotic grass and shrubs can increase soil water infiltration and supply guo et al 2019 also rainstorms are pulsed or episodic in the study area contrary to the slow drip simulation by hydrus 1d in daily time step there is the issue of hydrophobicity in the topsoil doerr et al 2000 wine et al 2012b which is difficult to simulate furthermore soils exhibit hysteresis which could cause differences between measured and observed swc the higher measurement errors of neutron probe for shallow soil water than for deep soil water could be another reason for the poor simulation in the shallow soil she et al 2014 yi and fan 2016 compared with shallow soil layers the model performance for the 1 4 m soil layer was much better with nse of 0 31 0 38 0 93 and 0 94 for arable crops natural grass exotic grass and exotic shrubs respectively fig 6 the model results for deeper soil layers were better than for shallow layers consistent with the findings by liu and shao 2015 therefore the hydrus 1d was considered suitable for the simulation of long term variations in swc in response to land use change in the study area the model was further evaluated via rmse and mape analyses with respective values of 47 87 mm and 8 34 for arable crops 57 47 mm and 8 29 for natural grass 40 94 mm and 11 46 for exotic grass and 42 21 mm and 10 61 for exotic shrubs for the 1 4 m soil layer fig 6 from the above the prediction of the hydrus 1d model was best for exotic grass and exotic shrubs followed by arable crops and then natural grass this was because annual crop growth and herbaceous plant growth were highly influenced by meteorological conditions i e rainfall and temperature and plant parameterization i e plant height root depth and distribution etc causing considerable changes in root water uptake under arable crops and natural grass m sativa and c korshinskii had rather deep root system taking water from deep soil layer where the effects of rainfall and temperature are limited in addition the errors between the mean values of measured and simulated soil water for exotic grass and shrubs were generally lower than those of arable crops and natural grass despite the lower precision during validation the error range was consistent or even lower than that reported in other modeling studies huang and gallichand 2006 fu et al 2012 wang et al 2012 liu and shao 2015 yi and fan 2016 the results suggested that the performance of the hydrus 1d model in terms of swc dynamics was acceptable for the four land use types the hydrus 1d model was therefore considered to robustly predict swc dynamics under different vegetation types in the study area 3 2 swc dynamics under land use change daily swc dynamics in the 0 4 m soil layer for 1970 2060 under land use change in northern clp region was simulated using the validated hydrus 1d model the simulation was divided into three periods arable cropping period 1970 2003 artificial vegetation restoration period 2004 2016 and natural grass period 2017 2060 the simulated long term variations in swc under the different land use types are shown in figs 7 and 8 in general swc dynamics in 1970 2060 can be divided into five different phases table 3 phase i fluctuating swc with rainfall during arable cropping period where average sws was relatively stable phase ii rapidly decreasing swc after planting exotic grass and shrubs phase iii stagnating swc at low and constant amount where deep 1 m below land surface soil water was unavailable and not absorbable by plant roots phase iv gradually recovering swc after conversion of exotic grass and shrubs to natural grass phase v generally fluctuating swc with rainfall during natural grass period where soil water supply was relatively high during arable cropping period 1970 2003 swc variation in the 0 4 m soil profile was within 0 163 0 215 cm3 cm 3 closely related to the rainfall mean sws in the 0 4 m soil layer for arable cropping period was 729 48 mm after conversion of arable crop land into exotic grass fig 7 and shrub land fig 8 swc sharply dropped during early vegetation restoration period sws in the 0 4 m soil profile dropped at the rates of 46 and 63 mm yr 1 for exotic grass 2004 2011 and exotic shrubs 2004 2010 respectively the variation patterns were similar for exotic grass and shrubs consistent with the results of jia et al 2019b using arable crops as the control water consumption rate by exotic grass 81 mm yr 1 was much higher than that by exotic shrubs 73 mm yr 1 in 2004 2007 in contrast water consumption rate by exotic shrubs was higher 23 mm yr 1 than that by exotic grass 22 mm yr 1 in 2007 2011 m sativa exotic grass is a perennial herbaceous plant and c korshinskii exotic shrub perennial shrub the early growth rate of m sativa was greater than that of c korshinskii jia et al 2019b whereas m sativa biomass was smaller than c korshinskii when c korshinskii biomass exceeded a certain critical value its water consumption exceeded that of m sativa canopy density of c korshinskii was higher than that of m sativa resulting in a higher canopy interception than m sativa and preventing rainfall from reaching the ground baldissera et al 2014 jia et al 2019b then swc in the 0 4 m soil profile remained at 0 10 cm3 cm 3 and sws of 0 4 m was 405 and 406 mm respectively for exotic grass and shrubs in 2012 2016 soil water was hardly accessible to plant root during this period jia et al 2017 shao et al 2018 therefore swc in the 0 4 m soil layer generally decreased with time and deep soil water was increasingly depleted with plant growth after the introduction of exotic grass and shrubs she et al 2014 noted that high evapotranspiration by c korshinskii and m sativa led to more water loss to than precipitation input water stored in deep soils was therefore used to meet evapotranspiration requirement because of consistent profile soil texture climatic conditions and micro topography in the four land use types the significant difference in long term variation of swc was attributed to the differences in vegetation type after the conversion of exotic grass and shrubs to natural grass 2017 2060 profile swc gradually increased and then fluctuated with rainfall sws in the 0 4 m soil layer increased respectively at the rate of 46 mm yr 1 and 44 mm yr 1 after the conversion of exotic grass 2017 2024 or shrubs 2017 2023 to natural grass profile swc and sws in the 0 4 m soil layer reached 0 186 cm3 cm 3 and 723 46 mm 2025 2060 respectively different from exotic grass and shrubs natural grass had relatively low biomass and shallow root and therefore low water use niu et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 furthermore the conversion of exotic grass and shrubs into natural grass increased rainfall infiltration due to decreased leaf interception and root water uptake jia et al 2019b therefore the coversion of artificial vegetation to natural grass enhanced soil water supply in the study area 3 3 dsl formation and recovery under land use change 3 3 1 dsl formation under vegetation restoration there was no dsl at the start of the plot implying that dsl formation only started after growing exotic grass and shrubs in the study area and continued to increase with time the lower boundary of dsl was 1 2 3 and 4 m respectively after 3 4 5 and 8 years of growth of exotic grass and with similar trends reported for exotic shrubs wang et al 2010b the results showed that planting exotic grass and exotic shrubs induced the formation of dsl in the region she et al 2014 jia et al 2019a 2020 dsl formed earlier under exotic grass than exotic shrubs but the rate of development was faster under exotic shrubs after 3 years of growth this was attributed to the differences in biological characteristics the vigorous growth period of exotic grass came earlier than exotic shrubs resulting in stronger evapotranspiration in exotic grassland than shrubland the periods of fast growth were not the same for the grass and shrub species for the same vegetation root distribution varied with growth over time however roots of exotic shrubs were more extensive with higher water uptake than exotic grass wang et al 2010b therefore unlike exotic shrubs exotic grass gradually degenerated after a certain number of years thus significant difference in transpiration during different growth periods she et al 2009 liu and shao 2015 jia et al 2019b noted that dsl and non dsl alternatively existed in the vertical soil profile which was called sandwiched dsl the simulated swc clearly showed sandwiching during 2004 2016 figs 7 and 8 this phenomenon was more frequent in the late than in the early stage of dsl formation also the depth of non dsl did not exceed 2 5 m sandwiched dsl was linked with water transfer in dsl an indication of rainfall and the resulting infiltration not exceeding 2 5 m deep in 2004 2016 thus swc variability in the shallow layer 0 1 m under exotic grass and shrubs was larger than that in the deep soil layers 1 4 m fig 9 based on annual precipitation in 1961 2016 in the study area the empirical frequency of precipitation in 2004 2016 was 5 91 and the return period was 1 19 years in other words non dsl cannot spread to the depth of 2 5 m in years with annual precipitation less than 743 mm which occurs once in 19 years the ranges of swc in dsl under exotic grass and shrubs were 0 093 0 126 cm3 cm 3 cv 5 9 and 0 094 0 124 cm3 cm 3 cv 4 5 respectively the mean swc of dsl 1 4 m under both exotic grass and shrubs was 0 096 cm3 cm 3 close to that of permanent wilting point 0 079 cm3 cm 3 it suggested then that soil water in dsl was unavailable for root uptake by exotic grass and shrubs jia et al 2017 after dsl formation heavy rains increased swc in the shallow soil layer for a short time especially after october and it then tapered out jia et al 2019b the vertical mean swc in the 0 4 m soil profile after vegetation restoration is shown in fig 9 generally exotic grass and shrub fields had lower swc than arable crop and natural grass lands in the study area a large difference was also noted between the four plots in terms of profile swc swc under arable crops and natural grass increased in the 0 0 5 m soil layer before it remained constant while swc increased in the 0 0 25 m soil layer under exotic grass and shrubs it decreased in the 0 25 1 0 m soil layer and then finally stagnated the soil layer with low swc below 1 0 m was called dsl for exotic grass and shrubs fu et al 2012 this indicated that dsl did not exist under arable crops and natural grass after cultivation of exotic grass and shrubs however soil water consumption was large leading to dsl formation compared with 1970 2003 arable cropping period annual precipitation during 2004 2011 revegetation period slightly decreased 3 9 again compared with arable crops during 2004 2011 revegetation period sws in the dsl decreased by 150 and 146 mm respectively under exotic grass and shrubs fig 10 in general the mean swc for the 1 4 m soil profile under exotic grass and shrubs were respectively 34 1 and 32 3 lower than that under arable crops and natural grass this was due to high water consumption and rainfall interception by exotic grass and shrubs natural grass can therefore be more suitable in the northern clp region for vegetation restoration to improve the eco environment and maintain water balance wang et al 2010b yi and fan 2016 3 3 2 dsl recovery under land use change except for the formation and development of dsls knowledge on recovery of soil desiccation is needed for successful vegetation restoration modeling of swc dynamics for 2017 2060 showed that it gradually increased after the conversion of exotic vegetation into natural grass swc within dsl generally improved to the level of that under natural grass in the 1 4 m soil profile in 8 years of conversion of exotic grass and 7 years of conversion of exotic shrubs natural grass biomass was much lower than that of exotic grass and shrubs the root system and canopy density were weak and small to allow rainfall to fully penetrate the canopy and reach the ground for infiltration and replenishment of soil water soil water availability therefore gradually enhanced after the conversion of exotic grass and shrubs into natural grass studies on the time required for dsl recovery based on long term soil water measurement show that this is the general trend huang and gallichand 2006 li et al 2004 2007 this can be roughly divided into dsl recovery under exotic grass and other crops the repeated cultivation of winter wheat or spring maize for a long time caused dsl formation at the depth of 1 3 m although it did not deepen or recovered on the southern flange of clp li et al 2004 2007 in the case of land use conversion to winter wheat t aestivum after 30 years of apple orchard growth the duration of soil moisture recovery in the 0 10 m soil layer was 6 5 19 5 years mean of 13 7 years and 4 4 8 4 years mean of 7 3 years in the top 0 3 m soil layer in the southern flange of clp huang and gallichand 2006 wang et al 2007 noted that soil desiccation in the 0 5 m soil layer recovered partly by the cultivation of grain crop after m sativa in the western flange of clp however wan et al 2007 2008 noted that soil desiccation in the 3 10 m soil layer never recovered under m sativa in the central flange of the plateau liu et al 2010a showed that soil desiccation could recover after 18 years if m sativa is removed in the central flange of clp dsl in the 2 3 m soil layer under all existing cropping systems except m sativa fully recovers at least once in a decade liu et al 2010b the degree of recovery of dsl therefore depended on the species of crop and rotation sequence wang et al 2011 in addition dsl recovery time or degree depends on seasonal variation in rainfall and location shao et al 2018 after 13 years of conversion of exotic grass and shrubs into natural grass in the northern flange of clp it took 7 8 years for dsl in the 1 4 m soil zone to fully recover while dsl in this location exceeded 4 m jia et al 2017 2019b shao et al 2018 the recovery time of dsl across the entire soil profile under exotic grass and shrubs was much longer than that obtained in this study in the simulation scenario natural grass was planted during the eradication of exotic grass or shrubs if the natural restoration of natural grass after exotic grass or shrub eradication was neglected the recovery time was shorter than reported in other studies after dsl recovery soil water generally fluctuated with rainfall events under natural grass as the only source of soil water in the region is rainfall ning et al 2013 dsl formation weakened yearly from the upper to the lower soil layers also in dry years dsl recurred in shallow soil layers but only temporary and never affected soil water replenishment this suggested that natural grass was suitable for vegetation restoration in the northern flange of clp dsl recovery can occur by land use change in the region on 100 year scale 1970 2060 dsl formation due to unreasonable vegetation restoration was transient and changeable 4 conclusions the study simulated long term 1970 2060 dynamics of swc in the 0 4 m soil profile under land use changes using the hydrus 1d model and analyzed the effects of land use change on dsl formation and recovery in northern clp region based on regular observations of swc profile in 2004 2016 under different land use types the hydrus 1d successfully simulated the long term dynamics of swc in the study area five phases of swc were identified under the effect of land use change the introduction of exotic grass or shrubs obviously intensified deep soil water loss resulting in the formation of dsl the downward extension of dsl reached the depth of 4 m only after 8 years of exotic grass or 7 years of exotic shrub growth the duration of soil water recovery was 7 8 years in the upper 4 m soil layer after 13 years of growth of exotic grass or shrub conversion to natural grassland indicating that dsl in the 4 m depth soil profile can fully recover by changing the vegetation type the findings from the long term swc dynamics and dsl formation and recovery could broaden the understanding of long term variations in soil water availability under land use change in clp region further research is needed on the combined effects of climate and land use change on long term

5565,soil water content swc is critical for the health and sustainability of the ecosystem in water limited areas characterized by low precipitation and deep groundwater the chinese loess plateau clp has experienced intensive agricultural and revegetation activities for a period long enough to alter the state of swc to the extent that can affect plant growth and water cycle knowledge of long term swc dynamics under land use change is therefore important for optimal water management and vegetation restoration in this water scarce region this study simulated and analyzed long term 1970 2060 variations in swc in the top 4 m soil layer in response to land use change on clp using the hydrus 1d model soil and plant parameters required for the model were validated using in situ swc data for different land use types exotic grass m sativa exotic shrub c korshinskii arable crop s italica or v radiata and natural grass s bungeana five phases of swc dynamics driven by land use change were identified i fluctuation of swc with rainfall during arable cropping period ii rapid drop of swc after exotic plant establishment iii period of no change for which swc remained low and stable iv gradual recovery of swc after conversion of exotic vegetation into natural grass and v fluctuation of swc with rainfall under natural grass particularly swc decreased rapidly with the planting of m sativa and c korshinskii and water depletion depth increased with plant growth after revegetation dry soil layer dsl began to develop below 1 m after 3 years of growth of m sativa or c korshinskii also swc at depth below 1 m remained low and unavailable for plant growth compared with arable cropland swc in the 1 4 m soil layer decreased by 33 under both exotic grass and shrub during vegetation restoration period however it took 7 8 years for soil water to recover in the 0 4 m soil layer after 13 year 2004 2016 exotic grass or shrub was converted to natural grass this suggested that dsl in the 4 m soil depth can fully recover by changing vegetation type we concluded that planting m sativa and c korshinskii on arable cropland could enhance dsl formation in deep soil profile but can gradually disappear upon land use change the results provided useful information for the prediction of long term dynamics of soil water with land use change this is critical for the management of soil water in water limited areas keywords soil water dynamics dry soil layer land use change hydrus 1d model chinese loess plateau 1 introduction soil water content swc is a key variable for land surface hydrological processes controlling water and energy fluxes in the soil koster et al 2004 oki and kanae 2006 hu et al 2013 it is also a critical parameter for the health and sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems in water limited regions and in regions with seasonal water shortage seneviratne et al 2010 vereecken et al 2015 jia et al 2020 swc dynamics is related to climatic conditions and land use type seneviratne et al 2010 hirschi et al 2011 wang et al 2011 changes in climate and land use could alter the state of swc in both shallow feng et al 2017 and deep jia et al 2017 soil layers this can in turn affect plant growth solute transport and biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems breshears et al 2005 oki and kanae 2006 jia et al 2020 thus understanding long term variations in swc under land use change is useful for water management especially in water scarce regions due to long term agricultural activities and poor management practices li 1983 wine et al 2012a the chinese loess plateau clp has become one of the most severely eroded areas in the world here severe soil erosion and water loss have increased the fragility of the ecosystem shi and shao 2000 thus vegetation restoration measures have been done since the 1950s to control soil erosion and improve ecosystem services in the region the landscape has changed visibly with about 10 8 of agricultural land reconverted to forest shrubland and grassland feng et al 2016 based on remote sensing images vegetation cover on clp has increased from 32 in 1999 to 60 in 2013 chen et al 2015 however to ensure high biomass and economic benefits local farmers have planted vast areas with exotic plant species e g robinia pseudoacacia caragana korshinskii and medicago sativa etc that grow rapidly with deep root penetration shao et al 2018 these high water demanding species have decreased swc that has aggravated soil water shortage in both the shallow and deep soil layers further endangering the health of the ecosystem and groundwater recharge fang et al 2016 jia et al 2017 turkeltaub et al 2018 hu et al 2019 for example zhang et al 2018a found that deep rooted vegetation prevent groundwater recharge in highland regions of clp by excessive uptake of deep soil water model sensitivity analysis also shows that rooting depth is the most important plant related factor affecting soil water balance wine et al 2015 the current vegetation cover on clp exceeds the state of climate defined equilibrium zhang et al 2018b and the net primary productivity is approaching the threshold defined by sustainable water resource feng et al 2016 the introduction of exotic high water consumption plants and or high density planting has caused deep 1 m below land surface soil water deficit that has led to the formation of dry soil layers dsls on clp wang et al 2010a 2011 jia et al 2017 2019b 2020 dsl is a desiccated soil layer of certain thickness that occurs at a certain depth in the soil profile which alters the equilibrium between root water uptake and soil water supply chen et al 2008 wang et al 2011 dsl occurs widely across clp with a mean formation depth of 270 cm and thickness of 160 cm wang et al 2010a the occurrence of dsl or deep soil desiccation can interfere with water cycle in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac by preventing water flow between top and deep soil layers gao et al 2018 hu et al 2019 in addition dsl can cause land degradation tree die off and aridity of local climatic environment breshears et al 2005 chen et al 2015 feng et al 2017 consequently limiting ecosystem sustainability in arid and semi arid regions since dsl was first observed on clp in the 1960s in a high yield farmland in drought affected pucheng and chengcheng counties li 1983 numerous studies have been conducted on dsl in the plateau region the research topics have included the formation and evolution of dsl wang et al 2010b jia et al 2015 2019b spatial distribution and driving factors of dsl wang et al 2010a 2011 jia et al 2020 and effects of dsl on eco hydrological processes shangguan 2007 chen et al 2008 zhang et al 2018a b however few studies have been done in connection with long term variations in swc of dsls in response to land use change this can further broaden existing understanding on soil water dynamics under dsl conditions various mathematical models have been used to predict soil water dynamics water balance and soil desiccation processes in clp region wang et al 2008 2010b 2012 liu and shao 2015 for example using the one dimensional simultaneous heat and water transfer shaw model to simulate the recovery of dsl in the 0 10 m soil layer huang and gallichand 2006 found that the average duration of soil water recovery was 13 7 years after conversion of 30 year old apple orchard land to winter wheat land in southern clp region the shaw model was also used to assess the consumption of soil water with growth of c korshinskii and m sativa and the optimal carrying capacity in northern clp region liu and shao 2015 these results show that dsl starts to develop below the 1 m soil layer after 5 years of c korshinskii and 3 years of m sativa cultivation wang et al 2012 used the environmental policy integrated climate epic model to simulate dsl dynamics and suggested that m sativa should be planted for less than 10 years in semi humid loess regions the hydrus 1d model was also used to assess the long term impact of land use change on soil water balance components in a typical loess tableland on clp li et al 2019 it was noted that the conversion of farmland to apple orchard reduced soil water storage and groundwater recharge threatening the sustainability of water resources and agriculture in the plateau region li et al 2019 most of the model based studies however have only focused on soil water dynamics under one or two land use types this has limited our understanding of the long term variations in soil hydrologic processes including the formation evolution and recovery of dsl on clp with land use change the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate soil water movement soil water dynamics and water budget on clp yi and fan 2016 turkeltaub et al 2018 li et al 2019 hu et al 2019 from which variations in spac was determined here the physically based hydrus 1d model was used to simulate long term variations in soil water and the related response to land use change in the northern region of clp uncertainty analysis of modeling results is required to deal with inherent uncertainties in hydrological predictions beven 2008 although there are unavoidable uncertainties in predicting long term soil hydrologic processes by hydrus 1d model it is still necessary to predict swc dynamics in response to land use change on a longer time scale the prediction results are critical for understanding long term changes in soil water supply and the possibility of dsl recovery under land use change and or climate change information on long term swc dynamics can provide scientific basis for the regulation and sustainable management of soil water in the water limited plateau region the specific objectives of this study were to 1 simulate and characterize long term 1970 2060 swc dynamics in the 0 4 m soil profile under land use change 2 determine the formation and evolution processes of dsl under m sativa and c korshinskii and 3 assess soil water recovery after conversion of m sativa and c korshinskii fields to natural grassland in the water limited area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in liudaogou catchment lat 38 46 38 51 n lon 110 21 110 23 e 1248 m a s l 14 km west of shenmu county which is situated in the water wind erosion crisscross of northern clp fig 1 liudaogou catchment is characterized by deep gullies and undulating slopes the climate is semi arid temperate with a mean annual temperature of 9 0 c 1961 2016 data from local weather station the average annual precipitation is 427 mm with significant seasonal and inter annual variations in the effort to control soil erosion and land degradation widespread vegetation restoration measures have been implemented in the region since the 1990s the most common vegetation restoration in the study area includes m sativa c korshinskii or fallow land for natural vegetation recovery c korshinskii and m sativa were introduced because of their strong drought resistance high survival soil nutrient improvement ability and fast growth the dominant native grass species is stipa bungeana the main arable crops include setaria italica or vigna radiata cultivated in rotation without irrigation the soil in the study area belongs to aeolian loess of calcaric regosol fao unesco soil classification system comprising 45 51 sand 30 45 silt and 11 14 clay usda soil textural classification liu and shao 2014 the soil texture is relatively homogeneous in the vertical direction 2 2 field measurements to monitor temporal patterns of swc under different land use types in the northern clp permanent plots were established for continuous profile swc measurement in the catchment four plots 61 m 5 m were established in 2003 to represent four land use types exotic grass m sativa exotic shrub c korshinskii arable crop s italica or v radiata in rotation and natural grass s bungeana on a uniformly cultivated slope 12 facing northwest fig 2 fertilizer was applied on the arable crops at the rate of 120 kg ha 1 n and 60 kg ha 1 p2o5 per annum as recommended by the local framers thus we presumed that the plots had similar initial chemical and physical conditions and were not replicated a concrete wall of height 0 2 m above the ground and 0 3 m below the ground was constructed around each of the plots to prevent lateral surface and subsurface flow of water from one plot to the other a total of 11 aluminum neutron probe access tubes 4 2 m in length were installed at 5 m intervals along the middle of each plot during the growing seasons from july 2004 to october 2016 volumetric swc was measured fortnightly or monthly to the depth of 4 m at 10 cm intervals for the 0 1 m soil profile and at 20 cm intervals for the depth below 1 m using a calibrated neutron probe cnc beijing china during the period 2004 2016 swc was measured 92 times and the data used to calibrate and validate the hydrus 1d model for analyzing temporal variations in swc after planting exotic grass and shrubs further details on the plots and swc measurement are documented by liu and shao 2014 2 3 model description in the study hydrus 1d šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 šimůnek et al 2008 was used to simulate long term dynamics of swc under different land use types the modified richards equation for one dimensional unsaturated water flow richards 1931 van genuchten 1980 was used a sink term was added to richards equation to account for water uptake by plant roots because vertical permeability is much higher than horizontal one in the loess soil parsons et al 2009 yi and fan 2016 lateral subsurface flow in the study area was not considered i e zero flux boundary condition especially when soil water remained low after vegetation restoration yi and fan 2016 hu et al 2019 a standard atmospheric boundary was the upper boundary condition and ponding depth on the soil surface was zero the lower boundary was defined by a unit vertical hydraulic gradient simulating free drainage from a relatively deep soil profile because the water table was much deeper 30 m than the domain of interest water flow simulation in response to land use change was implemented daily for the period 1961 2060 the whole simulation profile for each vegetation type was discretized into 10 nodes i e 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 0 8 1 0 1 0 1 6 1 6 2 0 2 0 3 0 and 3 0 4 0 m a higher density of nodes was placed near the top of the soil profile where strong hydraulic gradients can occur to limit mass balance errors below 1 0 table s1 wine et al 2015 the initial profile distribution of pressure head was set to increase linearly from the top 600 cm to the bottom 300 cm with a unit gradient a spin up was done to get initial conditions to a dynamic equilibrium which was reached at a maximum of 9 years to drive the relative error to below 1 0 for the swc at 4 m depth to minimize the effect of initial conditions the simulation results for 1961 1969 were removed for data analysis hu et al 2019 2 4 data sources 2 4 1 meteorological parameters daily meteorological data including daily precipitation p maximum air temperature tmax minimum air temperature tmin relative humidity rh wind speed ws and sunshine hours sh were obtained for 1961 2016 from an automatic weather station near the liudaogou catchment study area a total of six steps were taken to ensure that the meteorological data were of an adequately high quality i climatic limit value or allowable value check ii station extreme value check iii internal consistency check between fixed time value daily mean value and daily extreme value iv time consistency check v spatial consistency check and vi manual verification and correction potential radiation was the radiation term relative humidity represented the vapor pressure input and radiation extinction coefficient based on canopy structure taken as 0 463 meteorological data for 2017 2060 were randomly generated from the period 1961 2016 using rand function huang and gallichand 2006 for each julian day in 2017 2060 meteorological data were randomly selected from the same julian day in 1961 2016 there were no significant difference in seasonal or inter annual variations in precipitation among the datasets for 1961 2016 2017 2060 and 1961 2060 for example the mean precipitation values for spring summer autumn and winter in 2017 2060 were 59 5 258 3 91 3 and 7 7 mm then for 1961 2016 the values were 58 6 266 9 92 8 and 8 5 mm respectively the coefficients of variation cvs of annual precipitation were the same for 1961 2016 30 5 2017 2060 27 4 and 1961 2060 29 3 therefore the historic seasonal and inter annual precipitation patterns were fully captured in the future climate scenario by the rand function because the duration of 55 years of recorded data was five times longer than the single climate cycle duration which is 11 years observed in the region shen 1991 note that this study did not consider the effect of future climate change at the local scale although future climate change was well recognized daily temperature and rainfall for 2004 2016 are plotted in fig s1 2 4 2 plant parameters different plant biological characteristics lead to different relationships among root water uptake rate and pressure head conditions using feddes model the small grains grass and alfalfa options were used for root water uptake by arable crops natural grass and exotic grass respectively the alfalfa option was also used for exotic shrub with feddes parameters based on the studies by xia 2008 and cheng et al 2013 plant height lai and root depth were all set at measured values as documented in the literature xia and shao 2008 she et al 2009 liu and shao 2015 hu et al 2019 time series data for plant parameters were reconstructed based on the years of vegetation in the northern clp region root distribution for exotic grass m sativa and shrub c korshinskii was obtained from the studies by cheng et al 2007 2009 2013 root distribution characteristics for different vegetation types used in the simulation are shown in fig s2 the plant parameters during the spinning up periods 1961 1969 were assumed to be consistent with those in 1970 2060 for arable crops 2 4 3 soil hydraulic parameters at each site 10 soil cores were collected using soil auger 5 cm in diameter for measuring soil particle composition of various soil layers i e 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 0 8 1 0 1 0 1 5 1 5 2 0 2 0 3 0 and 3 0 4 0 m the disturbed soil samples were air dried and passed through a 1 mm mesh the particle composition of the samples was measured by laser diffraction using the mastersizer2000 malvern instruments malvern england furthermore undisturbed soil cores were excavated at 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 and 0 2 0 4 m soil depths to measure saturated hydraulic conductivity ks bulk density bd saturated swc θs and field capacity fc the soil hydraulic parameters required for the hydrus 1d included ks θs residual swc θr and the van genuchten model shape parameters α and n ks was determined using the constant head method klute et al 1986 and bd determined from volume dry mass relationship for each soil core sample soil water retention function and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity were estimated by the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 the shape parameters of α n and θr were estimated using the rosetta pedotransfer function jana and mohanty 2012 field capacity fc was defined as swc at soil suction of 33 kpa the hydrus 1d inverse solution module was used to optimize soil hydraulic parameters n and α for modeling simplicity hysteresis was not considered in the study the initial soil parameters for the rosetta model and optimized parameters are shown in tables 1 and 2 2 5 model calibration and validation the soil parameters were calibrated by measured swc data under exotic grass and the plant parameters calibrated for each vegetation type using swc data measured in 2004 2009 and then validated using data for 2010 2016 before calibration a sensitivity analysis based on morris screening method was used to analyze uncertainty in all the input parameters a total of 67 parameters were analyzed in the study the input parameters were then adjusted according to the uncertainty analysis 2 6 soil water under two land use change scenarios based on the changes in land use pattern in the experimental plots and the trends in succession of local vegetation types in the study area two scenarios were set i arable crop to exotic grass to natural grass and ii arable crop to exotic shrub to natural grass among these s italica or v radiata was cultivated under arable crop in 1970 2003 and the feddes model set for small grains the vegetation restoration period was 2004 2016 with vegetation types including exotic grass and exotic shrub and the feddes model set for alfalfa natural grass stage for 2017 2060 was completely removed for exotic vegetation and converted into natural grass and the feddes model set for grass thus soil water movement and the formation development and recovery of dry soil layer under the land use change were investigated 2 7 dry soil layer characterization dry soil layer dsl was characterized as swc lower than stable field capacity sfc and distribution below mean annual infiltration depth in the soil profile shao et al 2018 from li 1983 sfc represents the original soil water regime below the typical depth of rainwater infiltration without the influence of soil evaporation and root water uptake which is highly dependent on soil texture and equivalent to 50 75 of field capacity fc studies show that the depth of rainwater infiltration was generally within 1 m for m sativa and c korshinskii and the maximum depth was within 2 m for extreme wet years fu et al 2012 the top 1 m soil tends to be replenished by rainwater infiltration wang et al 2010a b thus a depth of 1 m was assigned as the upper boundary of dsl in this study the sfc is generally assumed to be 60 of fc shao et al 2018 based on soil texture in the northern clp region a layer with swc lower than sfc is considered as dsl with this sfc of 12 0 was used in the study 2 8 statistical analyses the performances of the hydrus 1d model for the different land use types were evaluated using statistical analyses the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percent error mape were used to assess the agreement between simulated and observed values hu et al 2013 jia et al 2019a the indices were calculated as follows 1 nse 1 t 1 n θ i t obs θ i t sim 2 t 1 n θ i t obs θ i obs 2 2 rmse t 1 n θ i t obs θ i t sim 2 n 3 mape 1 n t 1 n θ i t obs θ i t sim θ i t obs 100 where θt obs and θt sim are observed and simulated values at time t and depth i respectively and n is the number of observations nse was used to measure the goodness of fit the closer the model efficiency was to 1 0 the more accurate the model was lower values of rmse and mape indicated higher accuracy of the swc simulation 3 results and discussions 3 1 model calibration and validation 3 1 1 uncertainty analysis there are various sources of model uncertainty related to model structures

analysis wine et al 2015 a total of 67 parameters were analyzed table s2 and readers can refer to li et al 2003 2018 for details on specific steps sensitivity analysis suggested that swc dynamics was most sensitive to climate moderate sensitive to soil hydraulic parameters and least sensitive to plant related parameters agreeing partly with the results of wine et al 2015 the relative importance of the van genuchten hydraulic model parameters considered are given in decreasing order as n θs α θr and ks li et al 2018 hu et al 2019 the most important plant related parameters were plant height the feddes parameters root water uptake parameters for the feddes model and root depth as meteorological related parameters were measured in the study area and passed quality control test the soil hydraulic and plant related parameters were estimated and adjusted in the order of sensitivity to improve model performances 3 1 2 model evaluation the hydrus 1d model was run in daily step for the period from july 2004 through october 2009 for model calibration and april 2010 through october 2016 for validation daily simulated and observed swc for the 0 1 and 1 4 m soil layers are plotted in figs 3 and 4 respectively the model performance was examined by linear regression of the simulated and observed swc for different soil layers figs 5 and 6 the simulated and observed soil water storage sws in the 0 1 m profile matched well for the four vegetation types with nse of 0 54 0 25 0 71 and 0 56 for arable crops natural grass exotic grass and exotic shrubs respectively fig 5 note that some measured and simulated values had relatively large errors in the shallow layers particularly for the upper 0 6 m soil layer figs s3 s6 and table s3 there are several possible explanations for the poor simulations in the shallow soil layers first macro pore flow could be critical for soil water movement in the shallow soil layer beven and germann 1982 but not fully captured in the simulation especially for exotic grass or shrubs preferential flow via decayed roots in shallow layers for exotic grass and shrubs can increase soil water infiltration and supply guo et al 2019 also rainstorms are pulsed or episodic in the study area contrary to the slow drip simulation by hydrus 1d in daily time step there is the issue of hydrophobicity in the topsoil doerr et al 2000 wine et al 2012b which is difficult to simulate furthermore soils exhibit hysteresis which could cause differences between measured and observed swc the higher measurement errors of neutron probe for shallow soil water than for deep soil water could be another reason for the poor simulation in the shallow soil she et al 2014 yi and fan 2016 compared with shallow soil layers the model performance for the 1 4 m soil layer was much better with nse of 0 31 0 38 0 93 and 0 94 for arable crops natural grass exotic grass and exotic shrubs respectively fig 6 the model results for deeper soil layers were better than for shallow layers consistent with the findings by liu and shao 2015 therefore the hydrus 1d was considered suitable for the simulation of long term variations in swc in response to land use change in the study area the model was further evaluated via rmse and mape analyses with respective values of 47 87 mm and 8 34 for arable crops 57 47 mm and 8 29 for natural grass 40 94 mm and 11 46 for exotic grass and 42 21 mm and 10 61 for exotic shrubs for the 1 4 m soil layer fig 6 from the above the prediction of the hydrus 1d model was best for exotic grass and exotic shrubs followed by arable crops and then natural grass this was because annual crop growth and herbaceous plant growth were highly influenced by meteorological conditions i e rainfall and temperature and plant parameterization i e plant height root depth and distribution etc causing considerable changes in root water uptake under arable crops and natural grass m sativa and c korshinskii had rather deep root system taking water from deep soil layer where the effects of rainfall and temperature are limited in addition the errors between the mean values of measured and simulated soil water for exotic grass and shrubs were generally lower than those of arable crops and natural grass despite the lower precision during validation the error range was consistent or even lower than that reported in other modeling studies huang and gallichand 2006 fu et al 2012 wang et al 2012 liu and shao 2015 yi and fan 2016 the results suggested that the performance of the hydrus 1d model in terms of swc dynamics was acceptable for the four land use types the hydrus 1d model was therefore considered to robustly predict swc dynamics under different vegetation types in the study area 3 2 swc dynamics under land use change daily swc dynamics in the 0 4 m soil layer for 1970 2060 under land use change in northern clp region was simulated using the validated hydrus 1d model the simulation was divided into three periods arable cropping period 1970 2003 artificial vegetation restoration period 2004 2016 and natural grass period 2017 2060 the simulated long term variations in swc under the different land use types are shown in figs 7 and 8 in general swc dynamics in 1970 2060 can be divided into five different phases table 3 phase i fluctuating swc with rainfall during arable cropping period where average sws was relatively stable phase ii rapidly decreasing swc after planting exotic grass and shrubs phase iii stagnating swc at low and constant amount where deep 1 m below land surface soil water was unavailable and not absorbable by plant roots phase iv gradually recovering swc after conversion of exotic grass and shrubs to natural grass phase v generally fluctuating swc with rainfall during natural grass period where soil water supply was relatively high during arable cropping period 1970 2003 swc variation in the 0 4 m soil profile was within 0 163 0 215 cm3 cm 3 closely related to the rainfall mean sws in the 0 4 m soil layer for arable cropping period was 729 48 mm after conversion of arable crop land into exotic grass fig 7 and shrub land fig 8 swc sharply dropped during early vegetation restoration period sws in the 0 4 m soil profile dropped at the rates of 46 and 63 mm yr 1 for exotic grass 2004 2011 and exotic shrubs 2004 2010 respectively the variation patterns were similar for exotic grass and shrubs consistent with the results of jia et al 2019b using arable crops as the control water consumption rate by exotic grass 81 mm yr 1 was much higher than that by exotic shrubs 73 mm yr 1 in 2004 2007 in contrast water consumption rate by exotic shrubs was higher 23 mm yr 1 than that by exotic grass 22 mm yr 1 in 2007 2011 m sativa exotic grass is a perennial herbaceous plant and c korshinskii exotic shrub perennial shrub the early growth rate of m sativa was greater than that of c korshinskii jia et al 2019b whereas m sativa biomass was smaller than c korshinskii when c korshinskii biomass exceeded a certain critical value its water consumption exceeded that of m sativa canopy density of c korshinskii was higher than that of m sativa resulting in a higher canopy interception than m sativa and preventing rainfall from reaching the ground baldissera et al 2014 jia et al 2019b then swc in the 0 4 m soil profile remained at 0 10 cm3 cm 3 and sws of 0 4 m was 405 and 406 mm respectively for exotic grass and shrubs in 2012 2016 soil water was hardly accessible to plant root during this period jia et al 2017 shao et al 2018 therefore swc in the 0 4 m soil layer generally decreased with time and deep soil water was increasingly depleted with plant growth after the introduction of exotic grass and shrubs she et al 2014 noted that high evapotranspiration by c korshinskii and m sativa led to more water loss to than precipitation input water stored in deep soils was therefore used to meet evapotranspiration requirement because of consistent profile soil texture climatic conditions and micro topography in the four land use types the significant difference in long term variation of swc was attributed to the differences in vegetation type after the conversion of exotic grass and shrubs to natural grass 2017 2060 profile swc gradually increased and then fluctuated with rainfall sws in the 0 4 m soil layer increased respectively at the rate of 46 mm yr 1 and 44 mm yr 1 after the conversion of exotic grass 2017 2024 or shrubs 2017 2023 to natural grass profile swc and sws in the 0 4 m soil layer reached 0 186 cm3 cm 3 and 723 46 mm 2025 2060 respectively different from exotic grass and shrubs natural grass had relatively low biomass and shallow root and therefore low water use niu et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 furthermore the conversion of exotic grass and shrubs into natural grass increased rainfall infiltration due to decreased leaf interception and root water uptake jia et al 2019b therefore the coversion of artificial vegetation to natural grass enhanced soil water supply in the study area 3 3 dsl formation and recovery under land use change 3 3 1 dsl formation under vegetation restoration there was no dsl at the start of the plot implying that dsl formation only started after growing exotic grass and shrubs in the study area and continued to increase with time the lower boundary of dsl was 1 2 3 and 4 m respectively after 3 4 5 and 8 years of growth of exotic grass and with similar trends reported for exotic shrubs wang et al 2010b the results showed that planting exotic grass and exotic shrubs induced the formation of dsl in the region she et al 2014 jia et al 2019a 2020 dsl formed earlier under exotic grass than exotic shrubs but the rate of development was faster under exotic shrubs after 3 years of growth this was attributed to the differences in biological characteristics the vigorous growth period of exotic grass came earlier than exotic shrubs resulting in stronger evapotranspiration in exotic grassland than shrubland the periods of fast growth were not the same for the grass and shrub species for the same vegetation root distribution varied with growth over time however roots of exotic shrubs were more extensive with higher water uptake than exotic grass wang et al 2010b therefore unlike exotic shrubs exotic grass gradually degenerated after a certain number of years thus significant difference in transpiration during different growth periods she et al 2009 liu and shao 2015 jia et al 2019b noted that dsl and non dsl alternatively existed in the vertical soil profile which was called sandwiched dsl the simulated swc clearly showed sandwiching during 2004 2016 figs 7 and 8 this phenomenon was more frequent in the late than in the early stage of dsl formation also the depth of non dsl did not exceed 2 5 m sandwiched dsl was linked with water transfer in dsl an indication of rainfall and the resulting infiltration not exceeding 2 5 m deep in 2004 2016 thus swc variability in the shallow layer 0 1 m under exotic grass and shrubs was larger than that in the deep soil layers 1 4 m fig 9 based on annual precipitation in 1961 2016 in the study area the empirical frequency of precipitation in 2004 2016 was 5 91 and the return period was 1 19 years in other words non dsl cannot spread to the depth of 2 5 m in years with annual precipitation less than 743 mm which occurs once in 19 years the ranges of swc in dsl under exotic grass and shrubs were 0 093 0 126 cm3 cm 3 cv 5 9 and 0 094 0 124 cm3 cm 3 cv 4 5 respectively the mean swc of dsl 1 4 m under both exotic grass and shrubs was 0 096 cm3 cm 3 close to that of permanent wilting point 0 079 cm3 cm 3 it suggested then that soil water in dsl was unavailable for root uptake by exotic grass and shrubs jia et al 2017 after dsl formation heavy rains increased swc in the shallow soil layer for a short time especially after october and it then tapered out jia et al 2019b the vertical mean swc in the 0 4 m soil profile after vegetation restoration is shown in fig 9 generally exotic grass and shrub fields had lower swc than arable crop and natural grass lands in the study area a large difference was also noted between the four plots in terms of profile swc swc under arable crops and natural grass increased in the 0 0 5 m soil layer before it remained constant while swc increased in the 0 0 25 m soil layer under exotic grass and shrubs it decreased in the 0 25 1 0 m soil layer and then finally stagnated the soil layer with low swc below 1 0 m was called dsl for exotic grass and shrubs fu et al 2012 this indicated that dsl did not exist under arable crops and natural grass after cultivation of exotic grass and shrubs however soil water consumption was large leading to dsl formation compared with 1970 2003 arable cropping period annual precipitation during 2004 2011 revegetation period slightly decreased 3 9 again compared with arable crops during 2004 2011 revegetation period sws in the dsl decreased by 150 and 146 mm respectively under exotic grass and shrubs fig 10 in general the mean swc for the 1 4 m soil profile under exotic grass and shrubs were respectively 34 1 and 32 3 lower than that under arable crops and natural grass this was due to high water consumption and rainfall interception by exotic grass and shrubs natural grass can therefore be more suitable in the northern clp region for vegetation restoration to improve the eco environment and maintain water balance wang et al 2010b yi and fan 2016 3 3 2 dsl recovery under land use change except for the formation and development of dsls knowledge on recovery of soil desiccation is needed for successful vegetation restoration modeling of swc dynamics for 2017 2060 showed that it gradually increased after the conversion of exotic vegetation into natural grass swc within dsl generally improved to the level of that under natural grass in the 1 4 m soil profile in 8 years of conversion of exotic grass and 7 years of conversion of exotic shrubs natural grass biomass was much lower than that of exotic grass and shrubs the root system and canopy density were weak and small to allow rainfall to fully penetrate the canopy and reach the ground for infiltration and replenishment of soil water soil water availability therefore gradually enhanced after the conversion of exotic grass and shrubs into natural grass studies on the time required for dsl recovery based on long term soil water measurement show that this is the general trend huang and gallichand 2006 li et al 2004 2007 this can be roughly divided into dsl recovery under exotic grass and other crops the repeated cultivation of winter wheat or spring maize for a long time caused dsl formation at the depth of 1 3 m although it did not deepen or recovered on the southern flange of clp li et al 2004 2007 in the case of land use conversion to winter wheat t aestivum after 30 years of apple orchard growth the duration of soil moisture recovery in the 0 10 m soil layer was 6 5 19 5 years mean of 13 7 years and 4 4 8 4 years mean of 7 3 years in the top 0 3 m soil layer in the southern flange of clp huang and gallichand 2006 wang et al 2007 noted that soil desiccation in the 0 5 m soil layer recovered partly by the cultivation of grain crop after m sativa in the western flange of clp however wan et al 2007 2008 noted that soil desiccation in the 3 10 m soil layer never recovered under m sativa in the central flange of the plateau liu et al 2010a showed that soil desiccation could recover after 18 years if m sativa is removed in the central flange of clp dsl in the 2 3 m soil layer under all existing cropping systems except m sativa fully recovers at least once in a decade liu et al 2010b the degree of recovery of dsl therefore depended on the species of crop and rotation sequence wang et al 2011 in addition dsl recovery time or degree depends on seasonal variation in rainfall and location shao et al 2018 after 13 years of conversion of exotic grass and shrubs into natural grass in the northern flange of clp it took 7 8 years for dsl in the 1 4 m soil zone to fully recover while dsl in this location exceeded 4 m jia et al 2017 2019b shao et al 2018 the recovery time of dsl across the entire soil profile under exotic grass and shrubs was much longer than that obtained in this study in the simulation scenario natural grass was planted during the eradication of exotic grass or shrubs if the natural restoration of natural grass after exotic grass or shrub eradication was neglected the recovery time was shorter than reported in other studies after dsl recovery soil water generally fluctuated with rainfall events under natural grass as the only source of soil water in the region is rainfall ning et al 2013 dsl formation weakened yearly from the upper to the lower soil layers also in dry years dsl recurred in shallow soil layers but only temporary and never affected soil water replenishment this suggested that natural grass was suitable for vegetation restoration in the northern flange of clp dsl recovery can occur by land use change in the region on 100 year scale 1970 2060 dsl formation due to unreasonable vegetation restoration was transient and changeable 4 conclusions the study simulated long term 1970 2060 dynamics of swc in the 0 4 m soil profile under land use changes using the hydrus 1d model and analyzed the effects of land use change on dsl formation and recovery in northern clp region based on regular observations of swc profile in 2004 2016 under different land use types the hydrus 1d successfully simulated the long term dynamics of swc in the study area five phases of swc were identified under the effect of land use change the introduction of exotic grass or shrubs obviously intensified deep soil water loss resulting in the formation of dsl the downward extension of dsl reached the depth of 4 m only after 8 years of exotic grass or 7 years of exotic shrub growth the duration of soil water recovery was 7 8 years in the upper 4 m soil layer after 13 years of growth of exotic grass or shrub conversion to natural grassland indicating that dsl in the 4 m depth soil profile can fully recover by changing the vegetation type the findings from the long term swc dynamics and dsl formation and recovery could broaden the understanding of long term variations in soil water availability under land use change in clp region further research is needed on the combined effects of climate and land use change on long term variations in swc and soil desiccation on clp credit authorship contribution statement xiao bai methodology software writing original draft xiaoxu jia conceptualization supervision visualization

5566,snow cover plays a vital role in the climate system because it is related to climate hydrological cycle and ecosystem on this basis deriving a long term and large scale snow depth sd time series and monitoring its temporal and spatial variations are crucial passive microwave remote sensing data in combination with in situ sd data have long been used to retrieve sd however the retrieval accuracy is limited in case of sparse meteorological stations and the high quality applications of retrieval results are hindered in specific areas the ground based global navigation satellite system reflectometry gnss r method is currently a potential way to monitor sd variations with a high degree of accuracy but has a limited spatial coverage in this study a deep learning based approach which displays a stronger nonlinear expressiveness capability than conventional neural networks was applied to estimate sd by combining satellite observations in situ data and gnss r estimates the model was trained and tested with data obtained in alaska between 2008 and 2017 results show that the proposed deep belief network model performs better than linear methods and conventional neural network models and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining gnss r estimation with increased cross validation r of 0 85 and decreased rmse of 15 40 cm the predicted sd distribution indicates that the variations in mean sd in alaska for march and april between 2008 and 2017 were associated with the climate anomalies and air temperature overall the proposed deep learning based method is a promising approach in the satellite retrieved sd field keywords deep learning multisource data gnss r brightness temperature alaska snow depth 1 introduction snow is a crucial component of a climate system and directly affects the energy balance of the earth s surface due to its heat insulation effect and high albedo che et al 2016 dietz et al 2012 wu et al 2018 snow also plays a prominent role in the water cycle and snowmelt runoff is a stable and reliable water source in many water scarce regions kang et al 2014 shi et al 2015 tedesco et al 2015 wang et al 2015 extensive and continuous snow can also cause natural disasters such as avalanches which can lead to considerable loss of life and property snow depth sd data can provide quantitative information about the material and energy of snow thus obtaining accurate sd information is crucial for the research on climatology and hydrology conventional sd measurement methods can measure sd through in situ devices with a high degree of accuracy rasmussen et al 2012 however these methods cannot capture the spatiotemporal sd variation characteristics under sparse distribution of observation stations over the past four decades passive microwave pm remote sensing has exhibited the ability to acquire long term and large scale sd datasets with the rapid evolution of satellite remote sensing armstrong and brodzik 2002 liu et al 2018 rostosky et al 2018 pm remote sensing has become an effective way to estimate sd given that it can provide all day and all weather monitoring and spatially continuous information of sd variation with high temporal resolution gu et al 2014 li et al 2019 pm remote sensing observation is based on the assumption that the electromagnetic radiation characteristics of snow have a strong dependence on sd rosenfeld and grody 2000 in snow covered areas the microwave radiometer carried by a satellite records the microwave radiation energy from the ground in the form of brightness temperature tb which includes two main components one is the radiation from the snow cover and the other is that from the ground beneath the brightness temperature decreases with the increase in sd because of the volume scattering of snow particles dai et al 2012 mashtayeva et al 2016 the scattering effect is directly proportional to the microwave frequency thus the brightness temperature of the high frequency channel is lower than that of the low frequency channel shi et al 2016 ulaby and stiles 1980 therefore sd retrieval based on pm remote sensing is often to establish the functional relationship between sd and brightness temperature several algorithms have been developed to estimate sd by combining remote sensing data and station observations the most common method is to establish the linear relationship between sd and brightness temperature by utilizing the difference between the horizontally polarized brightness temperatures of 19 and 37 ghz and the ground measured sd in many studies chang algorithm chang et al 1987 has been modified by considering the parameters that affect the sd retrieval accuracy such as forest and terrain foster et al 1997 langlois et al 2011 however linear methods cannot exactly describe the nonlinear relationship between sd and brightness temperature and tend to underestimate sd gan et al 2013 therefore nonlinear methods such as artificial neural networks anns have emerged to establish the nonlinear relationship between the input variables brightness temperature and auxiliary data and sd for instance anns have been trained to retrieve sd by combining in situ measurements and brightness temperatures observed by using pm sensors cao et al 2008 santi et al 2012 tabari et al 2010 tedesco et al 2004 anns have also been trained with model simulations for the estimation of sd chang and tsang 1992 davis et al 1993 tedesco et al 2004 brightness temperatures are simulated on the basis of radiative transfer model by using some snow properties and the simulated brightness temperature and sd are taken as the input and output of ann models respectively moreover some auxiliary parameters e g forest cover fraction and elevation have been regarded as input parameters of ann models to improve the retrieval accuracy under the influence of forest and terrain bair et al 2018 evora et al 2008 gan et al 2009 santi et al 2014 used amsr e equivalent brightness temperature corrected for the effects of orography and forest coverage instead of the original brightness temperature as inputs of ann model to estimate sd and demonstrated the improvement of retrieval accuracy these nonlinear methods have shown great advantages in estimating sd and have higher precision than linear methods the ground based global navigation satellite system reflectometry gnss r method is currently a new way of monitoring sd variation at the spatial scale of approximately 1000 m2 which is larger than the spatial scale of in situ measurements with high temporal and spatial resolution larson et al 2009 first estimated sd on the basis of signal to noise ratio snr because the multipath reflection component of the snr observations is associated with sd the reliability and accuracy of the snr based method have been proven at sites with three land cover types nievinski and larson 2014 tabibi et al 2017 analyzed the sd estimated using different frequency bands of global positioning system gps and glonass and found that accurate results can be obtained using gps l2c and glonass snr observations the solutions of sd measurement in different interference environments have been proposed to address the signal interference problem of snr based methods in complex terrain environment by analyzing the interference factors vey et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 a gnss r network pbo h2o network based on gnss stations has also been developed on the western coast of the usa and alaska larson and nievinski 2013 where gnss r sd is directly available through open access the accuracy of the gnss r sd product has been validated and has shown a precision of a few centimeters larson and nievinski 2013 mccreight et al 2014 the gnss r product from pbo h2o network has been used as the true value of sd to validate other sd products boniface et al 2015 in summary the gnss r method not only can monitor sd with the advantage of an all day and all weather ability but also can estimate sd with a high degree of accuracy however gnss r observation is also restricted to a limited spatial scale and gnss r stations are sparsely distributed deep learning which displays a stronger nonlinear expressiveness capability than conventional neural networks has achieved great success in geoscience inversion including fine particulate matter li et al 2017 and soil moisture jia et al 2019 song et al 2016 however deep learning has rarely been applied to retrieve sd to date thus this study aimed to establish a deep learning based model for estimating sd however the sparsely distributed samples from combining only satellite and sparsely distributed in situ observations may limit the accuracy of sd retrieval in this study the sds estimated by the gnss r method were taken as true values and combined with in situ observations to increase the station density of the sample data for the following two reasons one is that the accuracy of the gnss r method in sd retrieval is high and the other is that the spatial scale of the gnss r technique nearly 1000 m2 is better than the point scale 1 m2 in situ measurements xu et al 2018 in terms of brightness temperature data therefore the proposed deep learning based sd retrieval model was constructed and evaluated on the basis of the combination of satellite observations in situ data and gnss r estimation alaska was selected as the study region because it has an abundance of snow and has a mature gnss r sd product that is available through open access by connecting to the pbo h2o network the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the study region and data used are described section 3 introduces the deep learning based sd retrieval method that is the deep belief network dbn model developed here and the indicators used for the evaluation in section 4 the performance evaluation of this model against daily ground measured sd data are described and we compare the results with those of four other sd retrieval models namely chang multiple linear regression mlr back propagation neural network bpnn and generalized regression neural network grnn the former two are linear models and the latter two are nonlinear ones on the basis of the derived sd distribution from 2008 to 2017 we analyze the variation in sd in alaska over this time period and its response to climate anomalies and air temperature finally our work is summarized in section 5 2 study region and data 2 1 study region alaska which is in the latitude and longitude range of 54 n 71 n and 130 w 173 w was chosen as the study region fig 1 the study period was from 2008 to 2017 alaska is located at high latitudes thus most parts of this region are cold all year round alaska experiences abundant precipitation as a result of being surrounded by three oceans the north pacific ocean the bering sea and the arctic ocean therefore this region has an abundance of snow cover typically north alaska has a polar cold and dry climate with the air temperature below zero all year round central alaska has a continental climate with an average annual temperature of 2 47 c and an average annual precipitation of 275 mm at fairbanks while southern alaska has a temperate maritime climate with an average temperature of 3 7 c and an average annual precipitation of 617 mm at homer mature gnss r sd products as well as conventional in situ and satellite observations are available in alaska the above mentioned considerations indicate that alaska is ideal for the research on snow cover using integrated multi source data 2 2 data 2 2 1 satellite observations the special sensor microwave imager sounder ssmis is a satellite borne microwave radiometer onboard the u s defense meteorological satellite program f17 the brightness temperature data observed by ssmis gridded to the ease grid with daily temporal resolution and 25 km spatial resolution armstrong et al 1994 brodzik 2002 have been available at the national snow and ice data center https nsidc org since december 2006 and contain four frequencies namely 19 22 37 and 91 ghz except for 22 ghz which is only vertically polarized i e tb22v the other frequencies have horizontal and vertical polarization modes i e tb19h tb19v tb37h tb37v tb91h and tb91v thus seven channels of brightness temperature are available the daily ssmis brightness temperature data from 2008 to 2017 were downloaded from the national snow and ice data center in this study descending overpass observations during early morning were used given that liquid water could be existing in the snow during the afternoon satellite overpass and the sd could not be retrieved in the case of wet snow che et al 2008 kelly and chang 2003 2 2 2 in situ sd the global historical climate network ghcn https www ncdc noaa gov snow and ice integrates daily climate datasets from meteorological stations around the world and provides in situ sd datasets for daily temporal resolution the daily sd datasets include the information of location measuring time and sd daily in situ sd data of 155 sites within the study region from 2008 to 2017 were obtained from ghcn and utilized for the construction and performance evaluation of the sd retrieval model tsutsui and maeda 2017 2 2 3 gnss r estimation the daily gnss r sd product data can be obtained from the pbo h2o data portal https gnssh2o jpl nasa gov index php product snow which uses a traditional geodetic gps signal receiving station to monitor the change in snr for long time series and then estimates the sd based on gnss r with a high precision of a few centimeters larson et al 2009 larson and nievinski 2013 a total of 25 gnss r stations are present in alaska fig 1 and the daily gnss r sd data from 2008 to 2017 were taken as the actual sd together with the in situ measurements to establish and evaluate the sd retrieval model 2 2 4 forest cover fraction data forest cover fraction data were also used considering the potential impact of forest on sd retrieval the mod44b version 6 vegetation continuous fields vcf product is a global representation of surface vegetation cover that can continuously and quantitatively portray land surface cover at a pixel resolution of 250 m forest cover fraction data fig 2 were obtained from the mod44b modis terra vcf yearly l3 global 250 m sin grid v006 product https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov search order 1 mod44b 6 2 2 5 topographic data elevation parameter was utilized as auxiliary data to consider the effect of topographic parameters on the sd retrieval accuracy the etopo1 global relief model was used as elevation data and its spatial resolution is 1 arc minute or approximately 2 km amante and eakins 2009 these model data fig 3 can be downloaded from http www ngdc noaa gov mgg global 2 3 data matching and processing first the elevation and forest cover fraction data were regridded to the ease grid and the mean values of the forest cover fraction and elevation were calculated for the corresponding ease grid to match the brightness temperature data in addition the sd data from multiple in situ and gnss r stations were averaged for each ease grid then sd measurements from ghcn and pbo h2o network were associated with the satellite observations and ancillary data second we applied grody s decision tree method che et al 2008 grody and basist 1996 to distinguish snow from other scattering signals given the resemblance of the microwave radiation characteristic of snow to that of frozen ground cold desert and precipitation

wet snow and other scattering signals were excluded and 11 447 dry snow samples were identified 3 methodology 3 1 structure of the dbn model the dbn model proposed in 2006 is a typical deep learning model hinton et al 2006 the model can be utilized to solve prediction and classification problems chen et al 2015 huang et al 2014 consequently the sd retrieval model in this study was established on the basis of dbn model the dbn model is composed of a back propagation bp layer and several restricted boltzmann machine rbm layers for instance fig 4 shows the structure of a dbn model with two rbm layers an rbm is made up of a visible layer v used to input training data and a hidden layer h used to extract data features with the visible and hidden layers being bidirectionally linked the first rbm s hidden layer is the second rbm s visible layer the training process for a dbn model consists of two main steps the first step is to train the rbms when data are transmitted from v to h in the first rbm the opening probability of every neuron in the hidden layer can be calculated according to eq 2 2 p h j 1 v σ i 1 m ω ij v i c j where i and j respectively indicate the number of the ith visible neuron and the jth hidden neuron ω ij denotes the weight between visible neuron i and hidden neuron j while c j refers to the bias of the jth hidden neuron sigmoid function σ acts as the transfer function the calculated opening probability of each hidden neuron is compared with the random value μ extracted from the 0 1 uniform distribution and the hidden neurons are updated to 0 or 1 in accordance with eq 3 3 h j 1 p h j 1 v μ 0 p h j 1 v μ μ u 0 1 so is the calculation process from hidden layer to visible layer in general the contrastive divergence algorithm hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 is utilized to train an rbm the neurons weights and bias are then updated as the following formula until v is approximately equal to v 1 4 ω ω ε h t v h 1 t v 1 b b ε v v 1 c c ε h t v h 1 t v 1 where ε refers to the learning rate h h 1 are obtained from v v 1 using eqs 2 and 3 v 1 is reconstructed from the hidden layer h and b and c respectively indicate the bias for the visible and hidden neurons the rbms are pretrained one after another without supervision and the weights obtained through this unsupervised pretraining are used to initialize the multilayer network the second step of the training process of the dbn is to fine tune the coefficients between layers using a supervised bp algorithm 3 2 sd retrieval model based on a dbn in our case the dbn model is adopted to learn the relationship between the input variables and sd through learning from the sample datasets 5 sd g t b 19 h t b 19 v t b 37 h t b 37 v l a t l o n e l e v a t i o n f t i m e where g means the estimation function lat lon and elevation represent 3d localization and f indicates the forest cover fraction fig 5 shows the schematic of the dbn model used to retrieve sd the input variables are pm horizontal and vertical polarization brightness temperatures of 19and 37 ghz latitude longitude elevation forest cover fraction and time we apply two hidden layers two rbms where the amount of neurons in every hidden layer is 16 following the two rbms is a bp layer with one neuron sd the specific process of the dbn model for sd modeling consists of three steps as shown in fig 6 first the variables of horizontal and vertical polarimetric brightness temperatures of 19 and 37 ghz latitude longitude elevation forest cover fraction and time are input into the model in this step only the input data are used to pretrain the dbn model which indicates that the initial coefficients of this model are trained from input data meanwhile actual sd is not utilized for tuning the coefficients in such process second we can estimate the sd value from the dbn model subsequently the mean square error mse between the actual and retrieved sd is calculated and returned to fine tune the coefficients of the model by utilizing the bp algorithm rumelhart et al 1988 this procedure is repeated until the dbn model achieves a satisfactory performance then the relationship between sd and satellite brightness temperature can be effectively established through this step finally this model is validated and then applied to estimate the sd where no ground stations exist accordingly we can acquire the spatially continuous distribution of the sd we used three statistical indicators namely the correlation coefficient r the mean absolute error mae cm and the root mean square error rmse cm to quantitatively evaluate the model performance we adopted a 10 fold cross validation technique to test the over fitting and predictive power of the model rodriguez et al 2010 all the sample data were divided into 10 subsets equally and randomly one of the subsets was selected as validation samples in turn while the others were utilized for model fitting then 10 results were averaged to evaluate the performance of the dbn model small differences between the model fitting and cross validation statistics suggest non overfitting hu et al 2013 in addition among the 10 models the one which performed best with the highest validation r the lowest validation mae and the lowest validation rmse was selected to retrieve sd over the whole of alaska 3 3 other sd retrieval algorithms for comparison bpnn rumelhart et al 1988 tedesco et al 2004 grnn specht 1991 chang algorithm chang et al 1987 and mlr xiao et al 2018 were utilized to construct sd retrieval models on the basis of the same samples used by the dbn model for better assessing the performance of the deep learning based sd retrieval model the performances of these methods were compared with those of the dbn model 3 3 1 linear methods chang algorithm is a linear method used to estimate sd through performing linear regression for the difference in the brightness temperature using 18 and 36 ghz horizontal polarization and sd 6 sd 1 59 t b 18 h t b 36 h where sd is estimated in centimeters tb18h and tb36h denote the horizontal polarization brightness temperatures of 18 and 36 ghz which were replaced with ssmis horizontal polarization brightness temperatures of 19 and 37 ghz in this study xiao et al 2018 in addition an sd retrieval model based on the mlr method was established using nine parameters the same as the dbn model for predicting sd 7 sd α 0 α 1 l a t α 2 l o n α 3 e l e v a t i o n α 4 t b 19 h α 5 t b 19 v α 6 t b 37 h α 7 t b 37 v α 8 f α 9 t i m e 3 3 2 nonlinear method as with the dbn model bpnn and grnn are data driven learning models the same input and output parameters were again used in the two neural networks however the bpnn model fig 7 a has a relatively simple structure with three layers input hidden and output layers and the grnn model fig 7b uses several hidden layer neurons to achieve function approximation instead the dbn model not only has a more complex structure but also initializes through unsupervised pretraining 4 results and analysis 4 1 evaluation of model performance 4 1 1 performance of dbn modeling primarily remote sensing data auxiliary data and in situ observations were integrated to generate the sample datasets for the dbn model and the four alternative methods mentioned above as presented in table 2 the two kinds of linear methods namely chang algorithm and the mlr method perform the worst cross validation r of 0 15 0 47 mae of 22 33 19 12 cm and rmse of 35 36 26 91 cm as expected owing to that the nonlinear relationship between sd and brightness temperature is described as linear in consideration of the nonlinear relationship between the input variables and sd bpnn and grnn perform better than the linear models cross validation r of 0 78 0 68 mae of 12 80 15 17 cm and rmse of 19 01 22 33 cm the dbn model which is a complex learning model can better fit the nonlinear relationship and obtains the best performance cross validation r of 0 81 mae of 11 15 cm and rmse of 17 96 cm among the other models fig 8 presents the scatter plots of actual sd and estimated value retrieved by the five algorithms the underestimates and overestimates of sd retrieved by the dbn model are less than those of the grnn and bpnn models as presented in fig 8e c and d these results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning based sd retrieval model with a more complicated structure and a layer by layer unsupervised pretraining technique can estimate sd with a higher degree of accuracy the two linear methods as shown in fig 8a and b tend to underestimate sd when the actual sd value exceeds 50 cm this phenomenon can be due to the saturation of the difference in the brightness temperature the results of mlr are better than those of chang algorithm this result may be due to that more parameters that correspond to snow properties are used in mlr the sd retrieval models in this section were established without combining the high precision gnss r estimates thus we used high precision gnss r estimates as independent evaluation data to validate the retrieval accuracy of the dbn model and four other models for further verifying whether the dbn model performs best among the five compared methods fig 9 shows the scatter plots of gnss r sd and estimated values retrieved by the five algorithms the performances of the two linear methods remain the worst validation r of 0 45 0 56 although the mlr method can consider more parameters it cannot map the complex nonlinear relationship between input parameters and sd on the contrary grnn and bpnn can fit this nonlinear relationship and perform better than linear methods with validation r of 0 64 0 69 furthermore the dbn model remains the best performing model with validation r of 0 76 given its stronger ability for nonlinear mapping in summary the nonlinear methods bpnn grnn and dbn are superior to the linear methods while the proposed dbn sd retrieval model performs the best among all compared models 4 1 2 effect of the added gnss r sd estimation in this study gnss r sd estimates were taken as the actual sd together with the in situ sd data to increase the station density of the sample data we compared the results of the models combining satellite observations in situ observations and gnss r estimates with those of sd retrieval models combining only satellite observations and in situ observations as described in section 4 1 1 to prove the effect of the addition of gnss r estimates table 3 lists the accuracy of the five sd retrieval models combining satellite observations in situ observations and gnss r estimates fig 10 presents the scatter plots of the actual sd value and the estimated sd retrieved by the five algorithms the dbn sd retrieval model and the four models based on combining satellite observations in situ observations and gnss r estimates all show higher accuracy in estimating sd than the sd retrieval models based on combining satellite observations and in situ observations this result demonstrates that considering the gnss r sd estimates to increase the density of the sample data contributes to improving the sd retrieval accuracy the dbn model also performs best when gnss r sd estimates are considered to increase the station density of the sample data this model has cross validation r of 0 85 mae of 9 55 cm and rmse of 15 40 cm 4 2 analysis of variations in sd in alaska based on the proposed dbn sd retrieval model described in section 4 1 2 the variables of longitude latitude elevation brightness temperature of four channels the forest cover fraction of each grid cell in alaska and time were taken as input data the daily sd in alaska from 2008 to 2017 was finally predicted snow in alaska is relatively stable from march to april when the sd value nearly reaches the maximum value in a year liu et al 2013 thus the mean sd from march to april each year was calculated to analyze the variation in average sd for march and april from 2008 to 2017 taking the sd distribution maps of alaska in 2008 as an example fig 11 it can be seen that the snow of alaska presents certain spatial distribution characteristics and significant regional differences the north of alaska has the greatest sd this condition may be due to the cold and sub temperate continental climate of this region meanwhile the overall climate of this region is humid but cold because of its low terrain and closeness to the arctic sea in addition the average sd in the inland regions is greater than that in the southwest part of alaska the sd anomalies for march and april each year were calculated by subtracting the overall average sd for march and april in this decade fig 12 red represents an increase in sd while blue represents a decrease in sd we can find that from 2011 to 2013 as well as 2009 and 2017 sd anomalies manifest as increase in most area of alaska especially in southwest alaska in addition the increase in sd over alaska was most apparent in 2012 on the contrary sd anomalies manifest as decrease in most areas of alaska from 2014 to 2016 as well as 2010 in the context of global warming climate anomalies such as el niño and la niña would intensify ham 2018 the change in sd during the decade may be a response to the change in temperature and climate anomalies el niño occurs when water temperatures in the equatorial sea area of the eastern and central pacific ocean continue to warm abnormally which causes a corresponding change in the global climate la niña is the opposite of el niño and often follows it el niño and la niña greatly influence global climate fig 13 a presents the el niño southern oscillation enso intensities in the multivariate enso index mei during this period which are available at www esrl noaa gov psd enso mei table html positive mei values denote el niño while negative mei values indicate la niña wang et al 2018 then the sd anomalies in fig 12 were averaged over alaska for each year and plotted with the enso intensities in fig 13a comparing the change in sd with the occurrence of these climate anomalies fig 13a we can find that the changes in sd in alaska have been generally consistent with the climate anomalies over the past decade from 2008 to 2009 and from 2011 to 2013 as well as 2017 la niña occurred in march and april and the sd increased correspondingly by contrast from 2014 to 2016 as well as 2010 el niño occurred and the sd decreased correspondingly the degree of sd change is not completely proportional to the intensity of climate anomalies especially in 2012 2013 and 2017 the change in sd may be also related to air temperature except for the climate anomalies air temperature data from noaa ghcn cams land temperature analysis https www esrl noaa gov psd data were used the air temperature anomalies for march and april each year in this decade were averaged over alaska and shown with the mean sd anomalies in fig 13b we can find that in 2013 la niña was weak and correspondingly the increase in sd anomalies should be small however the significant decrease in air temperature in 2013 resulted in a larger increase in sd the case in 2017 is also similar to that in 2013 besides the la niña phenomenon was stronger in 2011 than in 2012 but due to the air temperature was lower in 2012 resulting in the sd in 2012 larger than that in 2011 therefore the change in sd is mainly affected by the combination of the change in temperature and climate anomalies in addition to the influence of climate anomalies and temperature some other factors that may affect the change in sd such as ocean currents and terrain etc require further discussion 5 conclusions in this study we innovatively introduced a deep learning network to improve the precision of satellite derived sd in addition high precision gnss r sd product data were utilized as the actual value of the sd together with ground measured sd data to increase the station density of the sample data the results showed that the dbn sd retrieval model estimates sd more accurately than linear methods and conventional neural network models furthermore the effectiveness of combining gnss r estimates for increasing the station density of the sample data was demonstrated specifically r increased from 0 81 to 0 85 mae decreased from 11 15 cm to 9 55 cm and rmse decreased from 17 96 cm to 15 40 cm finally the daily sd over the whole of alaska was predicted using the proposed dbn sd retrieval model the results displayed that the variation in sd for march and april between 2008 and 2017 in alaska is mainly associated with the occurrence of climate anomalies and the change in air temperature over this time period there is still room for improvement of the proposed approach and for further study on the one hand the current spatial resolution of estimated sd is coarse 25 km 25 km which would limit its application in operational hydrological modeling and snow caused disaster monitoring thus enhancing the spatial resolution of the sd data is required on the other hand we only applied a deep learning network the dbn model to establish the relationship between brightness temperature and sd whether other deep learning models can better handle this issue is worth investigating credit authorship contribution statement jiwen wang conceptualization methodology software

5566,snow cover plays a vital role in the climate system because it is related to climate hydrological cycle and ecosystem on this basis deriving a long term and large scale snow depth sd time series and monitoring its temporal and spatial variations are crucial passive microwave remote sensing data in combination with in situ sd data have long been used to retrieve sd however the retrieval accuracy is limited in case of sparse meteorological stations and the high quality applications of retrieval results are hindered in specific areas the ground based global navigation satellite system reflectometry gnss r method is currently a potential way to monitor sd variations with a high degree of accuracy but has a limited spatial coverage in this study a deep learning based approach which displays a stronger nonlinear expressiveness capability than conventional neural networks was applied to estimate sd by combining satellite observations in situ data and gnss r estimates the model was trained and tested with data obtained in alaska between 2008 and 2017 results show that the proposed deep belief network model performs better than linear methods and conventional neural network models and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining gnss r estimation with increased cross validation r of 0 85 and decreased rmse of 15 40 cm the predicted sd distribution indicates that the variations in mean sd in alaska for march and april between 2008 and 2017 were associated with the climate anomalies and air temperature overall the proposed deep learning based method is a promising approach in the satellite retrieved sd field keywords deep learning multisource data gnss r brightness temperature alaska snow depth 1 introduction snow is a crucial component of a climate system and directly affects the energy balance of the earth s surface due to its heat insulation effect and high albedo che et al 2016 dietz et al 2012 wu et al 2018 snow also plays a prominent role in the water cycle and snowmelt runoff is a stable and reliable water source in many water scarce regions kang et al 2014 shi et al 2015 tedesco et al 2015 wang et al 2015 extensive and continuous snow can also cause natural disasters such as avalanches which can lead to considerable loss of life and property snow depth sd data can provide quantitative information about the material and energy of snow thus obtaining accurate sd information is crucial for the research on climatology and hydrology conventional sd measurement methods can measure sd through in situ devices with a high degree of accuracy rasmussen et al 2012 however these methods cannot capture the spatiotemporal sd variation characteristics under sparse distribution of observation stations over the past four decades passive microwave pm remote sensing has exhibited the ability to acquire long term and large scale sd datasets with the rapid evolution of satellite remote sensing armstrong and brodzik 2002 liu et al 2018 rostosky et al 2018 pm remote sensing has become an effective way to estimate sd given that it can provide all day and all weather monitoring and spatially continuous information of sd variation with high temporal resolution gu et al 2014 li et al 2019 pm remote sensing observation is based on the assumption that the electromagnetic radiation characteristics of snow have a strong dependence on sd rosenfeld and grody 2000 in snow covered areas the microwave radiometer carried by a satellite records the microwave radiation energy from the ground in the form of brightness temperature tb which includes two main components one is the radiation from the snow cover and the other is that from the ground beneath the brightness temperature decreases with the increase in sd because of the volume scattering of snow particles dai et al 2012 mashtayeva et al 2016 the scattering effect is directly proportional to the microwave frequency thus the brightness temperature of the high frequency channel is lower than that of the low frequency channel shi et al 2016 ulaby and stiles 1980 therefore sd retrieval based on pm remote sensing is often to establish the functional relationship between sd and brightness temperature several algorithms have been developed to estimate sd by combining remote sensing data and station observations the most common method is to establish the linear relationship between sd and brightness temperature by utilizing the difference between the horizontally polarized brightness temperatures of 19 and 37 ghz and the ground measured sd in many studies chang algorithm chang et al 1987 has been modified by considering the parameters that affect the sd retrieval accuracy such as forest and terrain foster et al 1997 langlois et al 2011 however linear methods cannot exactly describe the nonlinear relationship between sd and brightness temperature and tend to underestimate sd gan et al 2013 therefore nonlinear methods such as artificial neural networks anns have emerged to establish the nonlinear relationship between the input variables brightness temperature and auxiliary data and sd for instance anns have been trained to retrieve sd by combining in situ measurements and brightness temperatures observed by using pm sensors cao et al 2008 santi et al 2012 tabari et al 2010 tedesco et al 2004 anns have also been trained with model simulations for the estimation of sd chang and tsang 1992 davis et al 1993 tedesco et al 2004 brightness temperatures are simulated on the basis of radiative transfer model by using some snow properties and the simulated brightness temperature and sd are taken as the input and output of ann models respectively moreover some auxiliary parameters e g forest cover fraction and elevation have been regarded as input parameters of ann models to improve the retrieval accuracy under the influence of forest and terrain bair et al 2018 evora et al 2008 gan et al 2009 santi et al 2014 used amsr e equivalent brightness temperature corrected for the effects of orography and forest coverage instead of the original brightness temperature as inputs of ann model to estimate sd and demonstrated the improvement of retrieval accuracy these nonlinear methods have shown great advantages in estimating sd and have higher precision than linear methods the ground based global navigation satellite system reflectometry gnss r method is currently a new way of monitoring sd variation at the spatial scale of approximately 1000 m2 which is larger than the spatial scale of in situ measurements with high temporal and spatial resolution larson et al 2009 first estimated sd on the basis of signal to noise ratio snr because the multipath reflection component of the snr observations is associated with sd the reliability and accuracy of the snr based method have been proven at sites with three land cover types nievinski and larson 2014 tabibi et al 2017 analyzed the sd estimated using different frequency bands of global positioning system gps and glonass and found that accurate results can be obtained using gps l2c and glonass snr observations the solutions of sd measurement in different interference environments have been proposed to address the signal interference problem of snr based methods in complex terrain environment by analyzing the interference factors vey et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 a gnss r network pbo h2o network based on gnss stations has also been developed on the western coast of the usa and alaska larson and nievinski 2013 where gnss r sd is directly available through open access the accuracy of the gnss r sd product has been validated and has shown a precision of a few centimeters larson and nievinski 2013 mccreight et al 2014 the gnss r product from pbo h2o network has been used as the true value of sd to validate other sd products boniface et al 2015 in summary the gnss r method not only can monitor sd with the advantage of an all day and all weather ability but also can estimate sd with a high degree of accuracy however gnss r observation is also restricted to a limited spatial scale and gnss r stations are sparsely distributed deep learning which displays a stronger nonlinear expressiveness capability than conventional neural networks has achieved great success in geoscience inversion including fine particulate matter li et al 2017 and soil moisture jia et al 2019 song et al 2016 however deep learning has rarely been applied to retrieve sd to date thus this study aimed to establish a deep learning based model for estimating sd however the sparsely distributed samples from combining only satellite and sparsely distributed in situ observations may limit the accuracy of sd retrieval in this study the sds estimated by the gnss r method were taken as true values and combined with in situ observations to increase the station density of the sample data for the following two reasons one is that the accuracy of the gnss r method in sd retrieval is high and the other is that the spatial scale of the gnss r technique nearly 1000 m2 is better than the point scale 1 m2 in situ measurements xu et al 2018 in terms of brightness temperature data therefore the proposed deep learning based sd retrieval model was constructed and evaluated on the basis of the combination of satellite observations in situ data and gnss r estimation alaska was selected as the study region because it has an abundance of snow and has a mature gnss r sd product that is available through open access by connecting to the pbo h2o network the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the study region and data used are described section 3 introduces the deep learning based sd retrieval method that is the deep belief network dbn model developed here and the indicators used for the evaluation in section 4 the performance evaluation of this model against daily ground measured sd data are described and we compare the results with those of four other sd retrieval models namely chang multiple linear regression mlr back propagation neural network bpnn and generalized regression neural network grnn the former two are linear models and the latter two are nonlinear ones on the basis of the derived sd distribution from 2008 to 2017 we analyze the variation in sd in alaska over this time period and its response to climate anomalies and air temperature finally our work is summarized in section 5 2 study region and data 2 1 study region alaska which is in the latitude and longitude range of 54 n 71 n and 130 w 173 w was chosen as the study region fig 1 the study period was from 2008 to 2017 alaska is located at high latitudes thus most parts of this region are cold all year round alaska experiences abundant precipitation as a result of being surrounded by three oceans the north pacific ocean the bering sea and the arctic ocean therefore this region has an abundance of snow cover typically north alaska has a polar cold and dry climate with the air temperature below zero all year round central alaska has a continental climate with an average annual temperature of 2 47 c and an average annual precipitation of 275 mm at fairbanks while southern alaska has a temperate maritime climate with an average temperature of 3 7 c and an average annual precipitation of 617 mm at homer mature gnss r sd products as well as conventional in situ and satellite observations are available in alaska the above mentioned considerations indicate that alaska is ideal for the research on snow cover using integrated multi source data 2 2 data 2 2 1 satellite observations the special sensor microwave imager sounder ssmis is a satellite borne microwave radiometer onboard the u s defense meteorological satellite program f17 the brightness temperature data observed by ssmis gridded to the ease grid with daily temporal resolution and 25 km spatial resolution armstrong et al 1994 brodzik 2002 have been available at the national snow and ice data center https nsidc org since december 2006 and contain four frequencies namely 19 22 37 and 91 ghz except for 22 ghz which is only vertically polarized i e tb22v the other frequencies have horizontal and vertical polarization modes i e tb19h tb19v tb37h tb37v tb91h and tb91v thus seven channels of brightness temperature are available the daily ssmis brightness temperature data from 2008 to 2017 were downloaded from the national snow and ice data center in this study descending overpass observations during early morning were used given that liquid water could be existing in the snow during the afternoon satellite overpass and the sd could not be retrieved in the case of wet snow che et al 2008 kelly and chang 2003 2 2 2 in situ sd the global historical climate network ghcn https www ncdc noaa gov snow and ice integrates daily climate datasets from meteorological stations around the world and provides in situ sd datasets for daily temporal resolution the daily sd datasets include the information of location measuring time and sd daily in situ sd data of 155 sites within the study region from 2008 to 2017 were obtained from ghcn and utilized for the construction and performance evaluation of the sd retrieval model tsutsui and maeda 2017 2 2 3 gnss r estimation the daily gnss r sd product data can be obtained from the pbo h2o data portal https gnssh2o jpl nasa gov index php product snow which uses a traditional geodetic gps signal receiving station to monitor the change in snr for long time series and then estimates the sd based on gnss r with a high precision of a few centimeters larson et al 2009 larson and nievinski 2013 a total of 25 gnss r stations are present in alaska fig 1 and the daily gnss r sd data from 2008 to 2017 were taken as the actual sd together with the in situ measurements to establish and evaluate the sd retrieval model 2 2 4 forest cover fraction data forest cover fraction data were also used considering the potential impact of forest on sd retrieval the mod44b version 6 vegetation continuous fields vcf product is a global representation of surface vegetation cover that can continuously and quantitatively portray land surface cover at a pixel resolution of 250 m forest cover fraction data fig 2 were obtained from the mod44b modis terra vcf yearly l3 global 250 m sin grid v006 product https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov search order 1 mod44b 6 2 2 5 topographic data elevation parameter was utilized as auxiliary data to consider the effect of topographic parameters on the sd retrieval accuracy the etopo1 global relief model was used as elevation data and its spatial resolution is 1 arc minute or approximately 2 km amante and eakins 2009 these model data fig 3 can be downloaded from http www ngdc noaa gov mgg global 2 3 data matching and processing first the elevation and forest cover fraction data were regridded to the ease grid and the mean values of the forest cover fraction and elevation were calculated for the corresponding ease grid to match the brightness temperature data in addition the sd data from multiple in situ and gnss r stations were averaged for each ease grid then sd measurements from ghcn and pbo h2o network were associated with the satellite observations and ancillary data second we applied grody s decision tree method che et al 2008 grody and basist 1996 to distinguish snow from other scattering signals given the resemblance of the microwave radiation characteristic of snow to that of frozen ground cold desert and precipitation

model hinton et al 2006 the model can be utilized to solve prediction and classification problems chen et al 2015 huang et al 2014 consequently the sd retrieval model in this study was established on the basis of dbn model the dbn model is composed of a back propagation bp layer and several restricted boltzmann machine rbm layers for instance fig 4 shows the structure of a dbn model with two rbm layers an rbm is made up of a visible layer v used to input training data and a hidden layer h used to extract data features with the visible and hidden layers being bidirectionally linked the first rbm s hidden layer is the second rbm s visible layer the training process for a dbn model consists of two main steps the first step is to train the rbms when data are transmitted from v to h in the first rbm the opening probability of every neuron in the hidden layer can be calculated according to eq 2 2 p h j 1 v σ i 1 m ω ij v i c j where i and j respectively indicate the number of the ith visible neuron and the jth hidden neuron ω ij denotes the weight between visible neuron i and hidden neuron j while c j refers to the bias of the jth hidden neuron sigmoid function σ acts as the transfer function the calculated opening probability of each hidden neuron is compared with the random value μ extracted from the 0 1 uniform distribution and the hidden neurons are updated to 0 or 1 in accordance with eq 3 3 h j 1 p h j 1 v μ 0 p h j 1 v μ μ u 0 1 so is the calculation process from hidden layer to visible layer in general the contrastive divergence algorithm hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 is utilized to train an rbm the neurons weights and bias are then updated as the following formula until v is approximately equal to v 1 4 ω ω ε h t v h 1 t v 1 b b ε v v 1 c c ε h t v h 1 t v 1 where ε refers to the learning rate h h 1 are obtained from v v 1 using eqs 2 and 3 v 1 is reconstructed from the hidden layer h and b and c respectively indicate the bias for the visible and hidden neurons the rbms are pretrained one after another without supervision and the weights obtained through this unsupervised pretraining are used to initialize the multilayer network the second step of the training process of the dbn is to fine tune the coefficients between layers using a supervised bp algorithm 3 2 sd retrieval model based on a dbn in our case the dbn model is adopted to learn the relationship between the input variables and sd through learning from the sample datasets 5 sd g t b 19 h t b 19 v t b 37 h t b 37 v l a t l o n e l e v a t i o n f t i m e where g means the estimation function lat lon and elevation represent 3d localization and f indicates the forest cover fraction fig 5 shows the schematic of the dbn model used to retrieve sd the input variables are pm horizontal and vertical polarization brightness temperatures of 19and 37 ghz latitude longitude elevation forest cover fraction and time we apply two hidden layers two rbms where the amount of neurons in every hidden layer is 16 following the two rbms is a bp layer with one neuron sd the specific process of the dbn model for sd modeling consists of three steps as shown in fig 6 first the variables of horizontal and vertical polarimetric brightness temperatures of 19 and 37 ghz latitude longitude elevation forest cover fraction and time are input into the model in this step only the input data are used to pretrain the dbn model which indicates that the initial coefficients of this model are trained from input data meanwhile actual sd is not utilized for tuning the coefficients in such process second we can estimate the sd value from the dbn model subsequently the mean square error mse between the actual and retrieved sd is calculated and returned to fine tune the coefficients of the model by utilizing the bp algorithm rumelhart et al 1988 this procedure is repeated until the dbn model achieves a satisfactory performance then the relationship between sd and satellite brightness temperature can be effectively established through this step finally this model is validated and then applied to estimate the sd where no ground stations exist accordingly we can acquire the spatially continuous distribution of the sd we used three statistical indicators namely the correlation coefficient r the mean absolute error mae cm and the root mean square error rmse cm to quantitatively evaluate the model performance we adopted a 10 fold cross validation technique to test the over fitting and predictive power of the model rodriguez et al 2010 all the sample data were divided into 10 subsets equally and randomly one of the subsets was selected as validation samples in turn while the others were utilized for model fitting then 10 results were averaged to evaluate the performance of the dbn model small differences between the model fitting and cross validation statistics suggest non overfitting hu et al 2013 in addition among the 10 models the one which performed best with the highest validation r the lowest validation mae and the lowest validation rmse was selected to retrieve sd over the whole of alaska 3 3 other sd retrieval algorithms for comparison bpnn rumelhart et al 1988 tedesco et al 2004 grnn specht 1991 chang algorithm chang et al 1987 and mlr xiao et al 2018 were utilized to construct sd retrieval models on the basis of the same samples used by the dbn model for better assessing the performance of the deep learning based sd retrieval model the performances of these methods were compared with those of the dbn model 3 3 1 linear methods chang algorithm is a linear method used to estimate sd through performing linear regression for the difference in the brightness temperature using 18 and 36 ghz horizontal polarization and sd 6 sd 1 59 t b 18 h t b 36 h where sd is estimated in centimeters tb18h and tb36h denote the horizontal polarization brightness temperatures of 18 and 36 ghz which were replaced with ssmis horizontal polarization brightness temperatures of 19 and 37 ghz in this study xiao et al 2018 in addition an sd retrieval model based on the mlr method was established using nine parameters the same as the dbn model for predicting sd 7 sd α 0 α 1 l a t α 2 l o n α 3 e l e v a t i o n α 4 t b 19 h α 5 t b 19 v α 6 t b 37 h α 7 t b 37 v α 8 f α 9 t i m e 3 3 2 nonlinear method as with the dbn model bpnn and grnn are data driven learning models the same input and output parameters were again used in the two neural networks however the bpnn model fig 7 a has a relatively simple structure with three layers input hidden and output layers and the grnn model fig 7b uses several hidden layer neurons to achieve function approximation instead the dbn model not only has a more complex structure but also initializes through unsupervised pretraining 4 results and analysis 4 1 evaluation of model performance 4 1 1 performance of dbn modeling primarily remote sensing data auxiliary data and in situ observations were integrated to generate the sample datasets for the dbn model and the four alternative methods mentioned above as presented in table 2 the two kinds of linear methods namely chang algorithm and the mlr method perform the worst cross validation r of 0 15 0 47 mae of 22 33 19 12 cm and rmse of 35 36 26 91 cm as expected owing to that the nonlinear relationship between sd and brightness temperature is described as linear in consideration of the nonlinear relationship between the input variables and sd bpnn and grnn perform better than the linear models cross validation r of 0 78 0 68 mae of 12 80 15 17 cm and rmse of 19 01 22 33 cm the dbn model which is a complex learning model can better fit the nonlinear relationship and obtains the best performance cross validation r of 0 81 mae of 11 15 cm and rmse of 17 96 cm among the other models fig 8 presents the scatter plots of actual sd and estimated value retrieved by the five algorithms the underestimates and overestimates of sd retrieved by the dbn model are less than those of the grnn and bpnn models as presented in fig 8e c and d these results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning based sd retrieval model with a more complicated structure and a layer by layer unsupervised pretraining technique can estimate sd with a higher degree of accuracy the two linear methods as shown in fig 8a and b tend to underestimate sd when the actual sd value exceeds 50 cm this phenomenon can be due to the saturation of the difference in the brightness temperature the results of mlr are better than those of chang algorithm this result may be due to that more parameters that correspond to snow properties are used in mlr the sd retrieval models in this section were established without combining the high precision gnss r estimates thus we used high precision gnss r estimates as independent evaluation data to validate the retrieval accuracy of the dbn model and four other models for further verifying whether the dbn model performs best among the five compared methods fig 9 shows the scatter plots of gnss r sd and estimated values retrieved by the five algorithms the performances of the two linear methods remain the worst validation r of 0 45 0 56 although the mlr method can consider more parameters it cannot map the complex nonlinear relationship between input parameters and sd on the contrary grnn and bpnn can fit this nonlinear relationship and perform better than linear methods with validation r of 0 64 0 69 furthermore the dbn model remains the best performing model with validation r of 0 76 given its stronger ability for nonlinear mapping in summary the nonlinear methods bpnn grnn and dbn are superior to the linear methods while the proposed dbn sd retrieval model performs the best among all compared models 4 1 2 effect of the added gnss r sd estimation in this study gnss r sd estimates were taken as the actual sd together with the in situ sd data to increase the station density of the sample data we compared the results of the models combining satellite observations in situ observations and gnss r estimates with those of sd retrieval models combining only satellite observations and in situ observations as described in section 4 1 1 to prove the effect of the addition of gnss r estimates table 3 lists the accuracy of the five sd retrieval models combining satellite observations in situ observations and gnss r estimates fig 10 presents the scatter plots of the actual sd value and the estimated sd retrieved by the five algorithms the dbn sd retrieval model and the four models based on combining satellite observations in situ observations and gnss r estimates all show higher accuracy in estimating sd than the sd retrieval models based on combining satellite observations and in situ observations this result demonstrates that considering the gnss r sd estimates to increase the density of the sample data contributes to improving the sd retrieval accuracy the dbn model also performs best when gnss r sd estimates are considered to increase the station density of the sample data this model has cross validation r of 0 85 mae of 9 55 cm and rmse of 15 40 cm 4 2 analysis of variations in sd in alaska based on the proposed dbn sd retrieval model described in section 4 1 2 the variables of longitude latitude elevation brightness temperature of four channels the forest cover fraction of each grid cell in alaska and time were taken as input data the daily sd in alaska from 2008 to 2017 was finally predicted snow in alaska is relatively stable from march to april when the sd value nearly reaches the maximum value in a year liu et al 2013 thus the mean sd from march to april each year was calculated to analyze the variation in average sd for march and april from 2008 to 2017 taking the sd distribution maps of alaska in 2008 as an example fig 11 it can be seen that the snow of alaska presents certain spatial distribution characteristics and significant regional differences the north of alaska has the greatest sd this condition may be due to the cold and sub temperate continental climate of this region meanwhile the overall climate of this region is humid but cold because of its low terrain and closeness to the arctic sea in addition the average sd in the inland regions is greater than that in the southwest part of alaska the sd anomalies for march and april each year were calculated by subtracting the overall average sd for march and april in this decade fig 12 red represents an increase in sd while blue represents a decrease in sd we can find that from 2011 to 2013 as well as 2009 and 2017 sd anomalies manifest as increase in most area of alaska especially in southwest alaska in addition the increase in sd over alaska was most apparent in 2012 on the contrary sd anomalies manifest as decrease in most areas of alaska from 2014 to 2016 as well as 2010 in the context of global warming climate anomalies such as el niño and la niña would intensify ham 2018 the change in sd during the decade may be a response to the change in temperature and climate anomalies el niño occurs when water temperatures in the equatorial sea area of the eastern and central pacific ocean continue to warm abnormally which causes a corresponding change in the global climate la niña is the opposite of el niño and often follows it el niño and la niña greatly influence global climate fig 13 a presents the el niño southern oscillation enso intensities in the multivariate enso index mei during this period which are available at www esrl noaa gov psd enso mei table html positive mei values denote el niño while negative mei values indicate la niña wang et al 2018 then the sd anomalies in fig 12 were averaged over alaska for each year and plotted with the enso intensities in fig 13a comparing the change in sd with the occurrence of these climate anomalies fig 13a we can find that the changes in sd in alaska have been generally consistent with the climate anomalies over the past decade from 2008 to 2009 and from 2011 to 2013 as well as 2017 la niña occurred in march and april and the sd increased correspondingly by contrast from 2014 to 2016 as well as 2010 el niño occurred and the sd decreased correspondingly the degree of sd change is not completely proportional to the intensity of climate anomalies especially in 2012 2013 and 2017 the change in sd may be also related to air temperature except for the climate anomalies air temperature data from noaa ghcn cams land temperature analysis https www esrl noaa gov psd data were used the air temperature anomalies for march and april each year in this decade were averaged over alaska and shown with the mean sd anomalies in fig 13b we can find that in 2013 la niña was weak and correspondingly the increase in sd anomalies should be small however the significant decrease in air temperature in 2013 resulted in a larger increase in sd the case in 2017 is also similar to that in 2013 besides the la niña phenomenon was stronger in 2011 than in 2012 but due to the air temperature was lower in 2012 resulting in the sd in 2012 larger than that in 2011 therefore the change in sd is mainly affected by the combination of the change in temperature and climate anomalies in addition to the influence of climate anomalies and temperature some other factors that may affect the change in sd such as ocean currents and terrain etc require further discussion 5 conclusions in this study we innovatively introduced a deep learning network to improve the precision of satellite derived sd in addition high precision gnss r sd product data were utilized as the actual value of the sd together with ground measured sd data to increase the station density of the sample data the results showed that the dbn sd retrieval model estimates sd more accurately than linear methods and conventional neural network models furthermore the effectiveness of combining gnss r estimates for increasing the station density of the sample data was demonstrated specifically r increased from 0 81 to 0 85 mae decreased from 11 15 cm to 9 55 cm and rmse decreased from 17 96 cm to 15 40 cm finally the daily sd over the whole of alaska was predicted using the proposed dbn sd retrieval model the results displayed that the variation in sd for march and april between 2008 and 2017 in alaska is mainly associated with the occurrence of climate anomalies and the change in air temperature over this time period there is still room for improvement of the proposed approach and for further study on the one hand the current spatial resolution of estimated sd is coarse 25 km 25 km which would limit its application in operational hydrological modeling and snow caused disaster monitoring thus enhancing the spatial resolution of the sd data is required on the other hand we only applied a deep learning network the dbn model to establish the relationship between brightness temperature and sd whether other deep learning models can better handle this issue is worth investigating credit authorship contribution statement jiwen wang conceptualization methodology software

5567,along with gradually controlled point source discharges diffuse nitrogen pollution has become an important cause of eutrophication diffuse nitrogen export from forests is an inherent characteristic and increasing human disturbance aggravates this process to control diffuse nitrogen pollution effectively it is of great significance to determine the source transport path and removal method of diffuse nitrogen export in forest dominated watersheds long term variations in the nitrogen concentrations indicate that nitrate and dissolved organic nitrogen don are the main diffuse nitrogen export forms in the buerhatong river watershed brw thus the soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model is conducted to simulate diffuse nitrate and don export first main source of diffuse nitrate and don export is determined by the fitting results of nitrogen contribution and forest farmland cover then the relationship between nitrogen export from forest farmland and main hydrologic streamflow is explored finally the role of wetlands in the diffuse nitrogen load removal is analyzed and sensitivity results by monte carlo simulation of nitrogen export from wetlands forests and farmlands are compared the average annual diffuse nitrate and don export values are 1 19 and 0 43 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively from 2014 to 2017 when forest cover and farmland cover are higher than 70 and 5 farmlands and forests are the main sources of diffuse nitrate and don export respectively lateral flow is the dominant transport path of don export from forests and nitrate export from farmlands with correlation coefficient of 0 73 and proportion of 98 respectively wetlands have the ability to reduce the diffuse nitrogen load and their efficiency is related to the relative geographic location the in situ experimental results show that the nitrate and don removal rates by wetlands are 24 46 and 11 71 respectively the sensitivity of forest and wetland for diffuse nitrate and don load removal is 0 31 0 12 and 0 2 0 21 respectively returning forests to wetlands is a good method for diffuse nitrogen removal with food production taken into consideration abbreviations don

nitrogen is continuity diffuse nitrogen pollution has become a main threat to water quality along with gradually controlled point source discharges carpenter et al 1998 d arcy and frost 2001 in current studies farmland is often considered to contribute most of the diffuse nitrogen load due to excessive inputs of chemical fertilizers ongley et al 2010 ouyang et al 2010 the diffuse nitrogen export from forests is always ignored and even considered a nitrogen sink martínez et al 2009 however it is unreasonable to neglect the contribution of the diffuse nitrogen load from forests at the watershed scale brookshire et al 2012 moreover diffuse nitrogen export from forests is becoming substantial with the aggravation of human activities and global nitrogen deposition schlesinger 2009 liu et al 2016 shinozuka et al 2017 diffuse nitrogen export from forests is not only a transient phenomenon but also an inherent characteristic and the increasing human disturbance on the atmosphere climate system aggravates this process brookshire et al 2012 aber et al 2003 nitrate and dissolved organic nitrogen don are important forms of diffuse nitrogen export from forests nitrate is the most mobile form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and could constitute 81 of the total dissolved nitrogen in some montane tropical forests spoelstra et al 2010 sebilo et al 2013 don is also an important constituent of dissolved nitrogen and may contain thousands of organic molecules ranging from simple to complex compounds which are highly correlated with bioavailability lusk and toor 2016 the hydrologic export of don dominates over nitrate in some unpolluted old growth forests across southern chile and argentina perakis and hedin 2002 brookshire et al 2005 in addition ammonium also plays an important role in nitrogen transformation for different forms in forest soils yu et al 2017 diffuse nitrogen export from forests is caused by internal plant soil nitrogen cycles and influenced by diverse factors such as tree species temperature zones and hydrologic paths brookshire et al 2012 aber et al 2003 different species of trees have different patterns of nitrogen cycling the degradability of don extracts is different and increases in the following order birch spruce and pine kiikkilä et al 2005 the forms and intensity of diffuse nitrogen export from forest watersheds located in different temperature zones are different for example the freezing thawing process is a very common phenomenon in mid high latitude areas and has been shown to have a great influence on diffuse nitrogen export ouyang et al 2018 the hydrologic transport paths of diffuse nitrogen export in a forest watershed mainly consist of three streamflows surface flow lateral flow and groundwater flow arnold et al 1993 topographic features were able to explain nitrate export paths from forest sub watersheds in ontario slope also has a significant effect on nitrogen export from forests because it is a key factor in topography creed and band 1998 ziadat and taimeh 2013 kuriqi et al 2019a in addition hydropower plant has been developed in a montane forest dominated watershed with renewable energy generation and low carbon emissions it has impacts on the river integrity and diffuse nitrogen export kuriqi et al 2019b the forest dominated watershed in this study is defined by the composition of land use in which forest is the main land use type while the remaining types such as farmland and wetland account for minor proportions diffuse nitrogen export in a forest dominated watershed is influenced by multiple interactions among land use types and factors the spatial distribution of multiple land use types can influence the diffuse nitrogen load in forest dominated watersheds wetlands have a higher nitrogen removal ability and are widely used to remove nitrogen in through flowing flows verhoeven et al 2006 hansen et al 2018 diffuse nitrogen export is also influenced by soil properties and hydrologic conditions soil organic carbon and clay are important physical chemical soil indicators that have been shown to have a significant correlation with nitrogen export meghdadi 2018 jardine et al 1989 kalbitz et al 2000 some precipitation and snowmelt move downwards percolates through cracks joint and pores in soil and rocks until it reaches the water table and becomes groundwater percolation plays a crucial role in hydrologic cycles and can make up a large part of the total rainfall in early spring compared to that in the growing season which also has a close connection with diffuse nitrogen export lin et al 2015 it is of great significance for diffuse nitrogen pollution control to illustrate the source transport and removal of nitrogen export in the forest dominated watershed based on the above analysis the following research questions are proposed what is the main contribution source for diffuse nitrogen export in terms of surface flow lateral flow and groundwater flow which is the dominant transport path what role does wetland play in the removal of diffuse nitrogen load however to the best of our knowledge relevant studies have rarely been discussed in the literature knowledge gaps about the source transport and removal of diffuse nitrogen export in this special watershed still exist therefore the swat model is adopted to simulate the diffuse nitrogen export in a forest dominated watershed the objectives of this paper are i to identify the main source and dominant transport path of diffuse nitrogen export and ii to figure out the role of wetland in nitrogen removal and explore the optimum diffuse nitrogen load removal mode 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the tumen river is the national boundary of china north korea and russia its total length is 525 km and it finally flows into the japan sea fig 1 a the tumen river basin trb covers 33400 km2 and two thirds of it belongs to china its geographic coordinates range from 41 59 47 to 44 30 42 n and 127 27 43 to 131 18 33 e it is in the middle high latitudes and the climate is the humid monsoon in the middle temperate zone the average annual precipitation and temperature from 1958 to 2017 are 526 mm and 5 5 c respectively its freeze thaw period ranges from november to march the buerhatong river is an important tributary of the tumen river based on the acquired data and representation of the trb the upstream section of the buerhatong river is chosen as the study area detailed spatial distribution of forest and farmland cover in brw and trb was depicted in fig s1 although some of the southwestern mountains in trb are about 2000 m most of the northeastern mountains are below 1000 m fig s2 according to the influence of vertical zonality forest spatial heterogeneity in trb is not so high as those high mountains such as the himalayas andes whittaker and niering 1975 this can also be verified by fig s3 where the broad leaved forests are dominant while coniferous forests are minority in trb within china the brw is a 1560 km2 sub basin of the trb and contains six weather stations and the yushuchuan ysc hydrological station fig 1 the brw is in a montane forest dominated area with elevations ranging from 272 to 1057 m high the average elevation and slope are 488 0 m and 24 03 respectively according to the land use map of 2017 the brw contains three main land use types forest farmland and wetland and their proportions are 81 97 13 48 and 1 36 respectively the forest type is coniferous deciduous broadleaved mixed the coniferous forests are mainly distributed at higher altitudes and represented by dominant pinus koraiensis the deciduous broadleaved forests are mainly distributed at lower altitudes which mainly contains ulmus pumila quercus mongolica and betula platyphylla dryland and paddy fields are the main farmland types based on field investigations although the wetland cover is low 1 33 it is widely distributed in the brw wetlands have been shown to have great potential to remove nitrogen which also provides a new perspective for diffuse nitrogen export removal in this watershed 2 2 field samples samples of near surface water at the center of the stream channel were collected on a monthly basis in march may june and july 2019 which contained wet normal and dry seasons four sample sites were located upstream and downstream of the main buerhatong river channel the remaining ten sample sites were located in its two major tributaries fig 2 a to validate the nitrogen removal performance by wetlands a typical research plot containing forests and wetlands was selected and the streamflow from forest flows through the wetland was determined water samples of the inflow and outflow in the wetlands were collected on june 11 2019 fig 2b at each sample site 500 ml of water from three independent bottles was collected in different locations to guarantee their representation of water

land management practices on water quantity and quality in complex watersheds arnold et al 1998 it is based on the strong physical mechanism and integrates the advantages of multiple hydrological models neitsch et al 2011 these advantages have made swat one of the most popular hydrological models around the world el khoury et al 2015 ouyang et al 2017 the parameters and data adopted in the

streams and rivers this model can be used to estimate the pollutant transport load at different scales by a regression equation that is built by continuous flow and finite discrete water quality data runkel et al 2004 butman et al 2015 the estimation results are widely used in the calibration and validation process to improve the simulation accuracy of the swat model jha et al 2007 the nitrate and bod5 concentration data of the ysc hydrological station ranging from 2000 to 2003 were provided by the ecological environment bureau of yanbian korean autonomous prefecture http hbj yanbian gov cn because don concentration data are scarce they were estimated by the empirical equations of don and bod5 li et al 2016 the yanbian bureau of hydrology of water resources http slt jl gov cn provided flow data for the ysc station ranging from 1995 to 2003 although some data were discontinuous the regression equation of daily nitrate and don load and flow from 1995 to 2003 was calculated by the loadest model the following equation was selected to illustrate their relationship and detailed fitting information can be found in table s2 a ln load a 0 a 1 ln q a 2 where load is the daily pollutant load kg day q is the daily flow data in the corresponding sample time ft3 s parameters a0 and a1 are calculated by adjusted maximum likelihood estimation and a2 is the center of ln q 2 5 calibration and validation the calibration and validation data of monthly hydrology and water quality in the swat model were based on the ysc hydrological station parameters adopted in the swat simulation processes were calibrated and validated by using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup version 2019 the model performance was evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe simulation efficiency nse ei khoury et al 2015 modeling results are generally considered satisfactory if r2 and nse values are higher than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 the land use type in a specific watershed always changes drastically after a long period therefore the whole time series of 1969 2017 was divided into three periods 1969 1981 1995 2003 and 2014 2017 with land use maps of 1980 2000 and 2017 respectively the acquired measured monthly flow and sand data of the ysc station ranged from 1969 to 1981 data from 1978 to 1981 and 1969 to 1977 were used in the calibration and validation periods respectively the corresponding results for monthly flow and sand are presented in fig 3a and b respectively the acquired monthly nitrate and don load data of the ysc station ranging from 1995 to 2003 were calculated by the loadest model the data from 2000 to 2003 were used for calibration while the data from 1995 to 1999 were used for validation the final calibration and validation results of nitrate and don are shown in fig 3c and d due to the hydropower plants have been built vigorously in brw and exert impacts on the river integrity the monthly flow and nitrogen loads were underestimated in extremely flows while the monthly sand loads were overestimated kuriqi et al 2019b all the r2 and nse values were still higher than 0 55 except for the validation period of the monthly sand load which had corresponding values of 0 46 and 0 42 respectively this result indicated that convincing simulation results would be acquired by using the calibrated parameters in the swat model detailed calibrated parameters are given in the supplementary file table s3 fig 3 because nitrate and don concentration data could only be obtained by the ysc hydrological station the time ranges were from 1995 to 2003 to further validate the performance of the swat model the monthly observed nitrogen load was calculated by the loadest model based on the measured concentrations of water samples section 2 2 the monthly nitrate and don data of 2014 to 2017 were simulated by adopting the calibrated parameters of 1995 to 2003 detailed regression equation information and the spatial distribution of the samples are shown in table s2 b and fig 2 respectively the correlation coefficients of monthly simulated and observed nitrate and don loads were 0 50 and 0 95 respectively indicating that the calibrated parameters in swat could be used to simulate the diffuse nitrate and don load in the brw fig 4 2 6 statistical analysis long term variations in nitrogen concentrations from 1972 to 2019 in the ysc were analyzed and the main diffuse nitrogen export forms are nitrate and don in this watershed the spatial distribution of average annual diffuse nitrate and don export was depicted by arcgis 10 2 for desktop esri usa from 2014 to 2017 the don export values had a strong connection with the spatial distribution of forests and farmlands then regression analysis was conducted to fit the relationship between nitrogen export and forest farmland area linear regression curves had better fitting performance indicating diffuse nitrogen export mainly from farmlands and forests a redundancy analysis rda between the five factors and nitrogen export was conducted by canoco 5 0 microcomputer power ithaca usa to further determine the main explanatory factors house and denison 2002 the scatters of diffuse nitrogen contribution from forest farmland and forest farmland cover were fitted by an exponential model to determine the main source of nitrate and don export in the brw to determine the main transport path of don a correlation coefficient between diffuse don export and the main streamflow was conducted by using the package corrplot of r statistical software v 3 6 1 nitrate export from farmland in lateral and groundwater flow was also compared then regression analysis between lateral flow and slope was conducted to determine the most influential factor of the nitrogen transport path finally the relationship between slope and perc in forests and farmlands was also analyzed to compare the transport differences for nitrate and don the changing trend between nitrogen load removal and wetland area was analyzed among sub watersheds consisting of forest farmland and wetland given the roles of diffuse nitrogen sources for forests and farmland nitrogen load removal by wetlands was obtained by the difference between the nitrogen export and load an in situ experiment was also conducted to confirm the nitrogen removal role of wetlands to minimize the uncertainty of diffuse nitrogen export per unit area from forests farmlands and wetlands monte carlo simulation was applied to explore the optimum nitrogen removal method by using the software crystal ball 11 1 2 4 yang et al 2014 the simulation selected a value of each variable based on its distribution function randomly and ran for 50 000 iterations all methods were summarized as a flowchart to illustrate the whole analyzing processes fig 5 the fitting plots were conducted by origin 2018b originlab northampton usa one way analysis of variance anova was conducted to determine the significance of wetland nitrogen removal by spss 20 0 software spss inc usa a p value less than 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results 3 1 relationship between forest farmland and diffuse nitrogen export the average annual diffuse nitrate and don export values were 1 19 and 0 43 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively among 137 sub watersheds from 2014 to 2017 fig 6 a and b high diffuse nitrate export values were within the ranges of 1 50 to 3 00 kg ha 1 yr 1 and concentrated near the river channels which had high coincidence with the spatial distribution of high farmland cover low diffuse nitrate export values were below 0 60 kg ha 1 yr 1 and were mainly distributed in high forest cover areas similarly the riverside area also contained high don export sub watersheds with values ranging from 0 50 to 0 8 kg ha 1 yr 1 high and low don export zones mainly belonged to the high farmland and forest cover areas respectively however the spatial distribution of diffuse nitrate export was more diversified than that of diffuse don export the average annual diffuse nitrogen export values had a significant linear correlation with forest and farmland areas fig 6c and d regression slopes between diffuse nitrate export and forest farmland area were 713 20 25 56 obviously the diffuse nitrate export from farmland was higher than that from forest because the regression slope could act as the nitrate export per unit area the regression slopes between diffuse don export and forest farmland area were 95 66 34 58 diffuse don exports from forests per unit area were on the same order of magnitude as farmland which had some difference from diffuse nitrate export rda was conducted between five factors and diffuse nitrogen export among 137 sub watersheds fig 6e and f these factors were forest cover farmland cover soc clay and perc covering several aspects of land use type soil property and hydrology according to the positive or negative correlation between these factors and nitrogen export the rda was divided into two groups forest cover and clay had a negative correlation with diffuse nitrate export with explanatory scores of 53 0 and 0 1 respectively farmland cover soc and perc all had positive correlations with diffuse nitrogen export with explanatory scores of 58 1 14 1 and 7 1 respectively 3 2 contribution of diffuse nitrogen export from forest farmland the contribution of diffuse nitrogen export from forest farmland and forest farmland cover had a significant exponential relationship among the 137 sub watersheds fig 7 the contribution of nitrate from forests exceeded 50 when the forest cover was higher than 95 when the forest cover was higher than 70 the contribution of don from forest cover exceeded 50 in addition when farmland cover was higher than 5 and 30 the contributions of nitrate and don respectively from farmland exceeded 50 a detailed statistical summary of the regression analysis parameters is given in the supplementary file table s4 the forest and farmland cover in the brw were 81 97 and 13 48 indicating that its main source of diffuse nitrate and don export was farmland and forest respectively 3 3 relationship among diffuse nitrogen export from forest farmland and multiple factors diffuse don export from forests had a significant positive correlation with lateral flow with a correlation coefficient of 0 73 it had a significant negative correlation with groundwater flow and no significant correlation with surface runoff with correlation coefficients of 0 04 and 0 26 respectively fig 8 a in terms of farmland diffuse nitrate from lateral flow was much higher than that from groundwater flow among 121 sub watersheds fig 8b the nitrate export from lateral flow has a proportion of 98 since nitrate export from surface runoff in the simulation results was close to zero and was not considered in the analysis the slope had a significant positive linear relationship with lateral flow in forests and farmland although the lateral flow in forests was higher than that in farmland under the same slope the regression slope between slope and lateral flow in farmland was larger than that in forests with values of 3 85 and 2 06 respectively fig 8c contrary to lateral flow the slope had a significant negative linear relationship with percolation in forests and farmlands the percolation in farmland was higher than that in forests similarly the absolute regression slope between slope and percolation in farmland was larger than that in forests with values of 2 29 and 0 50 respectively fig 8d 3 4 diffuse nitrogen load removal and sensitivity analysis by wetland diffuse nitrogen load removal by wetlands did not have a linear increase along with the increase in wetland area fig 9 a sub watersheds a b and c have similar areas of 7 75 9 61 and 11 25 ha respectively the relative geographical locations of the wetlands were different to explore their influence on diffuse nitrogen load removal diffuse nitrate and don load removal were 28 98 37 74 5 72 2 69 and 14 27 5 01 kg yr 1 while their wetland areas were 15 58 25 27 and 54 57 ha respectively comparison results of a and b showed that the wetland located in the farmland had higher removal efficiency than that in the forest while the results of a and c showed that the relative geographical location of the wetland was more influential than the area on diffuse nitrogen load removal nitrogen concentrations in wetland inflow and outflow were measured to validate nitrogen removal performance by wetland and detailed pictures are shown in fig 2b the average nitrate concentrations in wetland inflow and outflow were 0 233 and 0 176 mg l 1 respectively there was an extremely significant difference p 0 01 the average don concentrations in wetland inflow and outflow were 0 948 and 0 837 mg l 1 respectively similarly a significant difference was observed p 0 05 fig 9b this result indicated that wetlands had a significant impact on the nitrogen concentrations in the streams flowing through them monte carlo simulation was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of diffuse nitrogen load from wetlands farmlands and forests fig 9c the sensitivity values of the diffuse don load from wetlands farmlands and forests were 0 21 0 91 and 0 2 respectively while their diffuse nitrate load sensitivity values were 0 12 0 89 and 0 31 respectively obviously farmland area was the most sensitive variable for diffuse nitrogen load wetlands had a higher sensitivity of diffuse don load removal than that of nitrate 4 discussion 4 1 source identification of diffuse nitrogen export long term variations in the nitrogen concentrations of nitrate don and ammonium at the ysc station are compared from 1972 to 2019 the average concentration proportions of nitrate don and ammonium are 36 50 18 54 and 44 96 respectively this indicates that the dominant nitrogen export forms are nitrate and don in the brw due to weak farming activities and atmospheric nitrogen deposition during 1972 and 1973 the disturbance of forests by timber harvesting may be an important reason for high nitrate concentrations in this period which is mainly caused by reduced plant uptake and increased rates of nitrogen mineralization and nitrification in upland soils rhoades et al 2013 bernhardt et al 2003 the main sources for diffuse nitrate and don export are farmlands and forests in the brw respectively fig 7 first the spatial distribution of diffuse nitrate and don export is highly consistent with farmland and forest areas which demonstrates that a close connection may exist fig 6a and b second a significant linear relationship is observed between diffuse nitrogen export and forest farmland area which indicates that nitrogen export mainly comes from forests and farmland farmland is the main source for diffuse nitrate export due to intensive human activity which introduces much fertilizer van breeman 2002 which can also be confirmed by much higher nitrate export per unit area from farmlands than from forests although diffuse don export per unit area from forests is also lower than that from farmlands forests contribute more diffuse don in this watershed due to their dominant areal extent fig 6 therefore more attention should be paid to diffuse don export in forest dominated watersheds except for land use type diffuse nitrogen export is also influenced by soil properties and hydrological features such as soc clay and perc which creates some uncertainty about the above conclusion therefore rda was conducted between diffuse nitrogen export and these factors to exclude these uncertainties baeten et al 2009 forest and farmland cover have much higher explanatory scores than soc clay and perc fig 6c and d this shows that land use type is the dominant factor for diffuse nitrogen export and that source identification in this watershed is reliable in addition this result also shows that the effect of forest spatial heterogeneity on diffuse nitrogen export in brw is not dominant because the forest cover in brw and trb is similar the analysis of diffuse nitrogen export in brw is highly representative of trb fig s1 4 2 transport of diffuse nitrogen export from forests and farmland lateral flow is the dominant transport path for diffuse don export from forests and nitrate export from farmland the slope has a significant positive influence on lateral flow in both land use types indicating that diffuse nitrogen export in the high slope areas is larger fig 8 this is mainly because steep slopes are more vulnerable to erosion under the same meteorological and hydrological conditions which could greatly increase soil loss weintraub et al 2015 kateb et al 2013 to investigate the difference in streamflow generation in forests and farmlands regression analysis between slope and percolation was conducted fig 8d higher percolation is found in farmland because intensive tillage activities have increased macropore density in the topsoil macropore continuity in the forest is reduced because of horizontally oriented roots bachmair et al 2009 this also explains why higher lateral flow is generated in forests than that in farmlands under the same terrain slope the transport path through groundwater flow for diffuse don export is not dominant because it can be strongly adsorbed into the soil and rarely leaches below the rooting zone fahey et al 1985 the weak and lack of correlation between the perc and clay can also verify this point fig 6e although lateral flow is also the dominant transport path for diffuse nitrate export it has some difference from that of diffuse don export the significant positive correlation between diffuse nitrate export from farmland and perc demonstrates that percolation is an important process for nitrate transport krysanova et al 1998 this is attributed to the high mobility of nitrate a significant negative correlation between diffuse nitrate export from farmland and clay indicates that clay minerals are important adsorbents for nitrate meghdadi 2018 the dominant transport path of diffuse nitrate export in the brw is lateral flow since the deep soil layer of dominant dark brown soil has a high clay content table s1 because the black soil on the surface is porous in this watershed it is vulnerable to leaching during the snowmelt and rainy seasons therefore surface runoff is difficult to generate and has little influence on diffuse nitrogen export ouyang et al 2013a b 4 3 exploration of the optimum diffuse nitrogen load removal method the runoff and associated dissolved nitrogen transported from forests always flows through wetlands which have great potential for diffuse nitrogen removal especially for nitrate hansen et al 2018 wetlands can convert some inorganic nitrogen into organic forms by microbial immobilization lindau et al 1994 in this study however the diffuse nitrogen removal load did not increase linearly with increasing wetland area this phenomenon demonstrates that nitrogen removal by wetlands must be influenced by multiple factors for example the relative geographical location of wetlands has an important influence on diffuse nitrogen removal efficiency fig 9a when the wetland is located in the farmland higher removal efficiency would be observed which might be due to the farmland having higher diffuse nitrogen export per unit area than that of forests the in situ experimental results show that wetlands have nitrate and don removal rates of 24 26 and 11 71 respectively fig 9b this confirms the nitrogen removal role of wetlands in this watershed from an experimental point of view wetlands in the forest dominated watershed may play the similar role of membrane bioreactors mbr in the nitrogen transformation process such as ammonification nitrification sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 compared with that of constructed wetlands the removal rate is not high low nitrogen concentrations and bioavailability of don in the wetland inflow may be important reasons liang et al 2020 lusk and toor 2016 in addition alkalinity in the water provides reaction substrate for ammoniating and nitrifying bacteria and regulate nitrogen transformation chen et al 2006 thus low alkalinity may also be a reason for low nitrogen removal rate further studies of the removal mechanisms by wetlands are needed according to the results of diffuse nitrogen loads from forests farmlands and wetlands monte carlo simulation is applied fig 9c farmland is the most positive sensitive variable of diffuse nitrogen load while wetlands have negative sensitive values obviously returning farmlands to wetlands is the most efficient diffuse nitrogen load removal method returning forest to wetlands is also a good method for diffuse nitrogen load removal with food production taken into consideration payn et al 2015 5 conclusions long term variations in nitrogen concentrations at the ysc station from 1972 to 2019 indicate that nitrate and don are the main forms of diffuse nitrogen export in this watershed the swat model is adopted to simulate diffuse nitrate and don export in the brw the average annual diffuse nitrate and don export values were 1 19 and 0 43 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively from 2014 to 2017 forests are the main source for diffuse don export when the forest cover is higher than 70 farmland is the main source for diffuse nitrate export when the farmland cover is higher than 5 lateral flow is the dominant transport path of diffuse don export from forests and of nitrate export from farmland with correlation coefficient of 0 73 and proportion of 98 respectively wetlands can reduce diffuse nitrogen load and wetland efficiency is related to the relative geographic location the in situ experimental results show that the nitrate and don removal rates by wetlands are 24 46 and 11 71 respectively returning farmlands to wetland is the most efficient diffuse nitrogen load removal method while returning forest to wetland is also a good method with food production taken into consideration credit authorship contribution statement pengtao wang writing

5567,along with gradually controlled point source discharges diffuse nitrogen pollution has become an important cause of eutrophication diffuse nitrogen export from forests is an inherent characteristic and increasing human disturbance aggravates this process to control diffuse nitrogen pollution effectively it is of great significance to determine the source transport path and removal method of diffuse nitrogen export in forest dominated watersheds long term variations in the nitrogen concentrations indicate that nitrate and dissolved organic nitrogen don are the main diffuse nitrogen export forms in the buerhatong river watershed brw thus the soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model is conducted to simulate diffuse nitrate and don export first main source of diffuse nitrate and don export is determined by the fitting results of nitrogen contribution and forest farmland cover then the relationship between nitrogen export from forest farmland and main hydrologic streamflow is explored finally the role of wetlands in the diffuse nitrogen load removal is analyzed and sensitivity results by monte carlo simulation of nitrogen export from wetlands forests and farmlands are compared the average annual diffuse nitrate and don export values are 1 19 and 0 43 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively from 2014 to 2017 when forest cover and farmland cover are higher than 70 and 5 farmlands and forests are the main sources of diffuse nitrate and don export respectively lateral flow is the dominant transport path of don export from forests and nitrate export from farmlands with correlation coefficient of 0 73 and proportion of 98 respectively wetlands have the ability to reduce the diffuse nitrogen load and their efficiency is related to the relative geographic location the in situ experimental results show that the nitrate and don removal rates by wetlands are 24 46 and 11 71 respectively the sensitivity of forest and wetland for diffuse nitrate and don load removal is 0 31 0 12 and 0 2 0 21 respectively returning forests to wetlands is a good method for diffuse nitrogen removal with food production taken into consideration abbreviations don

nitrogen is continuity diffuse nitrogen pollution has become a main threat to water quality along with gradually controlled point source discharges carpenter et al 1998 d arcy and frost 2001 in current studies farmland is often considered to contribute most of the diffuse nitrogen load due to excessive inputs of chemical fertilizers ongley et al 2010 ouyang et al 2010 the diffuse nitrogen export from forests is always ignored and even considered a nitrogen sink martínez et al 2009 however it is unreasonable to neglect the contribution of the diffuse nitrogen load from forests at the watershed scale brookshire et al 2012 moreover diffuse nitrogen export from forests is becoming substantial with the aggravation of human activities and global nitrogen deposition schlesinger 2009 liu et al 2016 shinozuka et al 2017 diffuse nitrogen export from forests is not only a transient phenomenon but also an inherent characteristic and the increasing human disturbance on the atmosphere climate system aggravates this process brookshire et al 2012 aber et al 2003 nitrate and dissolved organic nitrogen don are important forms of diffuse nitrogen export from forests nitrate is the most mobile form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and could constitute 81 of the total dissolved nitrogen in some montane tropical forests spoelstra et al 2010 sebilo et al 2013 don is also an important constituent of dissolved nitrogen and may contain thousands of organic molecules ranging from simple to complex compounds which are highly correlated with bioavailability lusk and toor 2016 the hydrologic export of don dominates over nitrate in some unpolluted old growth forests across southern chile and argentina perakis and hedin 2002 brookshire et al 2005 in addition ammonium also plays an important role in nitrogen transformation for different forms in forest soils yu et al 2017 diffuse nitrogen export from forests is caused by internal plant soil nitrogen cycles and influenced by diverse factors such as tree species temperature zones and hydrologic paths brookshire et al 2012 aber et al 2003 different species of trees have different patterns of nitrogen cycling the degradability of don extracts is different and increases in the following order birch spruce and pine kiikkilä et al 2005 the forms and intensity of diffuse nitrogen export from forest watersheds located in different temperature zones are different for example the freezing thawing process is a very common phenomenon in mid high latitude areas and has been shown to have a great influence on diffuse nitrogen export ouyang et al 2018 the hydrologic transport paths of diffuse nitrogen export in a forest watershed mainly consist of three streamflows surface flow lateral flow and groundwater flow arnold et al 1993 topographic features were able to explain nitrate export paths from forest sub watersheds in ontario slope also has a significant effect on nitrogen export from forests because it is a key factor in topography creed and band 1998 ziadat and taimeh 2013 kuriqi et al 2019a in addition hydropower plant has been developed in a montane forest dominated watershed with renewable energy generation and low carbon emissions it has impacts on the river integrity and diffuse nitrogen export kuriqi et al 2019b the forest dominated watershed in this study is defined by the composition of land use in which forest is the main land use type while the remaining types such as farmland and wetland account for minor proportions diffuse nitrogen export in a forest dominated watershed is influenced by multiple interactions among land use types and factors the spatial distribution of multiple land use types can influence the diffuse nitrogen load in forest dominated watersheds wetlands have a higher nitrogen removal ability and are widely used to remove nitrogen in through flowing flows verhoeven et al 2006 hansen et al 2018 diffuse nitrogen export is also influenced by soil properties and hydrologic conditions soil organic carbon and clay are important physical chemical soil indicators that have been shown to have a significant correlation with nitrogen export meghdadi 2018 jardine et al 1989 kalbitz et al 2000 some precipitation and snowmelt move downwards percolates through cracks joint and pores in soil and rocks until it reaches the water table and becomes groundwater percolation plays a crucial role in hydrologic cycles and can make up a large part of the total rainfall in early spring compared to that in the growing season which also has a close connection with diffuse nitrogen export lin et al 2015 it is of great significance for diffuse nitrogen pollution control to illustrate the source transport and removal of nitrogen export in the forest dominated watershed based on the above analysis the following research questions are proposed what is the main contribution source for diffuse nitrogen export in terms of surface flow lateral flow and groundwater flow which is the dominant transport path what role does wetland play in the removal of diffuse nitrogen load however to the best of our knowledge relevant studies have rarely been discussed in the literature knowledge gaps about the source transport and removal of diffuse nitrogen export in this special watershed still exist therefore the swat model is adopted to simulate the diffuse nitrogen export in a forest dominated watershed the objectives of this paper are i to identify the main source and dominant transport path of diffuse nitrogen export and ii to figure out the role of wetland in nitrogen removal and explore the optimum diffuse nitrogen load removal mode 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the tumen river is the national boundary of china north korea and russia its total length is 525 km and it finally flows into the japan sea fig 1 a the tumen river basin trb covers 33400 km2 and two thirds of it belongs to china its geographic coordinates range from 41 59 47 to 44 30 42 n and 127 27 43 to 131 18 33 e it is in the middle high latitudes and the climate is the humid monsoon in the middle temperate zone the average annual precipitation and temperature from 1958 to 2017 are 526 mm and 5 5 c respectively its freeze thaw period ranges from november to march the buerhatong river is an important tributary of the tumen river based on the acquired data and representation of the trb the upstream section of the buerhatong river is chosen as the study area detailed spatial distribution of forest and farmland cover in brw and trb was depicted in fig s1 although some of the southwestern mountains in trb are about 2000 m most of the northeastern mountains are below 1000 m fig s2 according to the influence of vertical zonality forest spatial heterogeneity in trb is not so high as those high mountains such as the himalayas andes whittaker and niering 1975 this can also be verified by fig s3 where the broad leaved forests are dominant while coniferous forests are minority in trb within china the brw is a 1560 km2 sub basin of the trb and contains six weather stations and the yushuchuan ysc hydrological station fig 1 the brw is in a montane forest dominated area with elevations ranging from 272 to 1057 m high the average elevation and slope are 488 0 m and 24 03 respectively according to the land use map of 2017 the brw contains three main land use types forest farmland and wetland and their proportions are 81 97 13 48 and 1 36 respectively the forest type is coniferous deciduous broadleaved mixed the coniferous forests are mainly distributed at higher altitudes and represented by dominant pinus koraiensis the deciduous broadleaved forests are mainly distributed at lower altitudes which mainly contains ulmus pumila quercus mongolica and betula platyphylla dryland and paddy fields are the main farmland types based on field investigations although the wetland cover is low 1 33 it is widely distributed in the brw wetlands have been shown to have great potential to remove nitrogen which also provides a new perspective for diffuse nitrogen export removal in this watershed 2 2 field samples samples of near surface water at the center of the stream channel were collected on a monthly basis in march may june and july 2019 which contained wet normal and dry seasons four sample sites were located upstream and downstream of the main buerhatong river channel the remaining ten sample sites were located in its two major tributaries fig 2 a to validate the nitrogen removal performance by wetlands a typical research plot containing forests and wetlands was selected and the streamflow from forest flows through the wetland was determined water samples of the inflow and outflow in the wetlands were collected on june 11 2019 fig 2b at each sample site 500 ml of water from three independent bottles was collected in different locations to guarantee their representation of water quality these collected samples were placed in a portable refrigerator and quickly transported to the laboratory and then kept in a cold store at 20 c until analysis the water samples were passed through acid washed gff 0 45 μm filters whatman usa for dissolved inorganic nitrogen nh4 no3 and total dissolved nitrogen tdn analysis don was determined by the difference between tdn and din the din and tdn concentrations were measured by using a continuous flowing analyzer seal aa3 germany 2 3 model set up the swat model a distributed hydrological model is designed to estimate the impacts of land management practices on water quantity and quality in complex watersheds arnold et al 1998 it is based on the strong physical mechanism and integrates the advantages of multiple hydrological models neitsch et al 2011 these advantages have made swat one of the most popular hydrological models around the world el khoury et al 2015 ouyang et al 2017 the parameters and data adopted in the swat model are described in the following a digital elevation model 30 m digital elevation model dem data were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn the dem is derived from the

harvest per year the management operation and application of fertilizer parameters of corn and rice are also based on field investigations e watershed and hydrological response units hrus the brw was divided into 137 sub watersheds by the swat model based on the dem data detailed spatial distribution of each sub watershed was marked with corresponding number fig 2a the land use soil and slope classification thresholds were all set to 2 and 1379 hrus were finally generated in total 2 4 nitrogen load calculation load estimator loadest is a fortran program for estimating constituent loads in streams and rivers this model can be used to estimate the pollutant transport load at different scales by a regression equation that is built by continuous flow and finite discrete water quality data runkel et al 2004 butman et al 2015 the estimation results are widely used in the calibration and validation process to improve the simulation accuracy of the swat model jha et al 2007 the nitrate and bod5 concentration data of the ysc hydrological station ranging from 2000 to 2003 were provided by the ecological environment bureau of yanbian korean autonomous prefecture http hbj yanbian gov cn because don concentration data are scarce they were estimated by the empirical equations of don and bod5 li et al 2016 the yanbian bureau of hydrology of water resources http slt jl gov cn provided flow data for the ysc station ranging from 1995 to 2003 although some data were discontinuous the regression equation of daily nitrate and don load and flow from 1995 to 2003 was calculated by the loadest model the following equation was selected to illustrate their relationship and detailed fitting information can be found in table s2 a ln load a 0 a 1 ln q a 2 where load is the daily pollutant load kg day q is the daily flow data in the corresponding sample time ft3 s parameters a0 and a1 are calculated by adjusted maximum likelihood estimation and a2 is the center of ln q 2 5 calibration and validation the calibration and validation data of monthly hydrology and water quality in the swat model were based on the ysc hydrological station parameters adopted in the swat simulation processes were calibrated and validated by using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup version 2019 the model performance was evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe simulation efficiency nse ei khoury et al 2015 modeling results are generally considered satisfactory if r2 and nse values are higher than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 the land use type in a specific watershed always changes drastically after a long period therefore the whole time series of 1969 2017 was divided into three periods 1969 1981 1995 2003 and 2014 2017 with land use maps of 1980 2000 and 2017 respectively the acquired measured monthly flow and sand data of the ysc station ranged from 1969 to 1981 data from 1978 to 1981 and 1969 to 1977 were used in the calibration and validation periods respectively the corresponding results for monthly flow and sand are presented in fig 3a and b respectively the acquired monthly nitrate and don load data of the ysc station ranging from 1995 to 2003 were calculated by the loadest model the data from 2000 to 2003 were used for calibration while the data from 1995 to 1999 were used for validation the final calibration and validation results of nitrate and don are shown in fig 3c and d due to the hydropower plants have been built vigorously in brw and exert impacts on the river integrity the monthly flow and nitrogen loads were underestimated in extremely flows while the monthly sand loads were overestimated kuriqi et al 2019b all the r2 and nse values were still higher than 0 55 except for the validation period of the monthly sand load which had corresponding values of 0 46 and 0 42 respectively this result indicated that convincing simulation results would be acquired by using the calibrated parameters in the swat model detailed calibrated parameters are given in the supplementary file table s3 fig 3 because nitrate and don concentration data could only be obtained by the ysc hydrological station the time ranges were from 1995 to 2003 to further validate the performance of the swat model the monthly observed nitrogen load was calculated by the loadest model based on the measured concentrations of water samples section 2 2 the monthly nitrate and don data of 2014 to 2017 were simulated by adopting the calibrated parameters of 1995 to 2003 detailed regression equation information and the spatial distribution of the samples are shown in table s2 b and fig 2 respectively the correlation coefficients of monthly simulated and observed nitrate and don loads were 0 50 and 0 95 respectively indicating that the calibrated parameters in swat could be used to simulate the diffuse nitrate and don load in the brw fig 4 2 6 statistical analysis long term variations in nitrogen concentrations from 1972 to 2019 in the ysc were analyzed and the main diffuse nitrogen export forms are nitrate and don in this watershed the spatial distribution of average annual diffuse nitrate and don export was depicted by arcgis 10 2 for desktop esri usa from 2014 to 2017 the don export values had a strong connection with the spatial distribution of forests and farmlands then regression analysis was conducted to fit the relationship between nitrogen export and forest farmland area linear regression curves had better fitting performance indicating diffuse nitrogen export mainly from farmlands and forests a redundancy analysis rda between the five factors and nitrogen export was conducted by canoco 5 0 microcomputer power ithaca usa to further determine the main explanatory factors house and denison 2002 the scatters of diffuse nitrogen contribution from forest farmland and forest farmland cover were fitted by an exponential model to determine the main source of nitrate and don export in the brw to determine the main transport path of don a correlation coefficient between diffuse don export and the main streamflow was conducted by using the package corrplot of r statistical software v 3 6 1 nitrate export from farmland in lateral and groundwater flow was also compared then regression analysis between lateral flow and slope was conducted to determine the most influential factor of the nitrogen transport path finally the relationship between slope and perc in forests and farmlands was also analyzed to compare the transport differences for nitrate and don the changing trend between nitrogen load removal and wetland area was analyzed among sub watersheds consisting of forest farmland and wetland given the roles of diffuse nitrogen sources for forests and farmland nitrogen load removal by wetlands was obtained by the difference between the nitrogen export and load an in situ experiment was also conducted to confirm the nitrogen removal role of wetlands to minimize the uncertainty of diffuse nitrogen export per unit area from forests farmlands and wetlands monte carlo simulation was applied to explore the optimum nitrogen removal method by using the software crystal ball 11 1 2 4 yang et al 2014 the simulation selected a value of each variable based on its distribution function randomly and ran for 50 000 iterations all methods were summarized as a flowchart to illustrate the whole analyzing processes fig 5 the fitting plots were conducted by origin 2018b originlab northampton usa one way analysis of variance anova was conducted to determine the significance of wetland nitrogen removal by spss 20 0 software spss inc usa a p value less than 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results 3 1 relationship between forest farmland and diffuse nitrogen export the average annual diffuse nitrate and don export values were 1 19 and 0 43 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively among 137 sub watersheds from 2014 to 2017 fig 6 a and b high diffuse nitrate export values were within the ranges of 1 50 to 3 00 kg ha 1 yr 1 and concentrated near the river channels which had high coincidence with the spatial distribution of high farmland cover low diffuse nitrate export values were below 0 60 kg ha 1 yr 1 and were mainly distributed in high forest cover areas similarly the riverside area also contained high don export sub watersheds with values ranging from 0 50 to 0 8 kg ha 1 yr 1 high and low don export zones mainly belonged to the high farmland and forest cover areas respectively however the spatial distribution of diffuse nitrate export was more diversified than that of diffuse don export the average annual diffuse nitrogen export values had a significant linear correlation with forest and farmland areas fig 6c and d regression slopes between diffuse nitrate export and forest farmland area were 713 20 25 56 obviously the diffuse nitrate export from farmland was higher than that from forest because the regression slope could act as the nitrate export per unit area the regression slopes between diffuse don export and forest farmland area were 95 66 34 58 diffuse don exports from forests per unit area were on the same order of magnitude as farmland which had some difference from diffuse nitrate export rda was conducted between five factors and diffuse nitrogen export among 137 sub watersheds fig 6e and f these factors were forest cover farmland cover soc clay and perc covering several aspects of land use type soil property and hydrology according to the positive or negative correlation between these factors and nitrogen export the rda was divided into two groups forest cover and clay had a negative correlation with diffuse nitrate export with explanatory scores of 53 0 and 0 1 respectively farmland cover soc and perc all had positive correlations with diffuse nitrogen export with explanatory scores of 58 1 14 1 and 7 1 respectively 3 2 contribution of diffuse nitrogen export from forest farmland the contribution of diffuse nitrogen export from forest farmland and forest farmland cover had a significant exponential relationship among the 137 sub watersheds fig 7 the contribution of nitrate from forests exceeded 50 when the forest cover was higher than 95 when the forest cover was higher than 70 the contribution of don from forest cover exceeded 50 in addition when farmland cover was higher than 5 and 30 the contributions of nitrate and don respectively from farmland exceeded 50 a detailed statistical summary of the regression analysis parameters is given in the supplementary file table s4 the forest and farmland cover in the brw were 81 97 and 13 48 indicating that its main source of diffuse nitrate and don export was farmland and forest respectively 3 3 relationship among diffuse nitrogen export from forest farmland and multiple factors diffuse don export from forests had a significant positive correlation with lateral flow with a correlation coefficient of 0 73 it had a significant negative correlation with groundwater flow and no significant correlation with surface runoff with correlation coefficients of 0 04 and 0 26 respectively fig 8 a in terms of farmland diffuse nitrate from lateral flow was much higher than that from groundwater flow among 121 sub watersheds fig 8b the nitrate export from lateral flow has a proportion of 98 since nitrate export from surface runoff in the simulation results was close to zero and was not considered in the analysis the slope had a significant positive linear relationship with lateral flow in forests and farmland although the lateral flow in forests was higher than that in farmland under the same slope the regression slope between slope and lateral flow in farmland was larger than that in forests with values of 3 85 and 2 06 respectively fig 8c contrary to lateral flow the slope had a significant negative linear relationship with percolation in forests and farmlands the percolation in farmland was higher than that in forests similarly the absolute regression slope between slope and percolation in farmland was larger than that in forests with values of 2 29 and 0 50 respectively fig 8d 3 4 diffuse nitrogen load removal and sensitivity analysis by wetland diffuse nitrogen load removal by wetlands did not have a linear increase along with the increase in wetland area fig 9 a sub watersheds a b and c have similar areas of 7 75 9 61 and 11 25 ha respectively the relative geographical locations of the wetlands were different to explore their influence on diffuse nitrogen load removal diffuse nitrate and don load removal were 28 98 37 74 5 72 2 69 and 14 27 5 01 kg yr 1 while their wetland areas were 15 58 25 27 and 54 57 ha respectively comparison results of a and b showed that the wetland located in the farmland had higher removal efficiency than that in the forest while the results of a and c showed that the relative geographical location of the wetland was more influential than the area on diffuse nitrogen load removal nitrogen concentrations in wetland inflow and outflow were measured to validate nitrogen removal performance by wetland and detailed pictures are shown in fig 2b the average nitrate concentrations in wetland inflow and outflow were 0 233 and 0 176 mg l 1 respectively there was an extremely significant difference p 0 01 the average don concentrations in wetland inflow and outflow were 0 948 and 0 837 mg l 1 respectively similarly a significant difference was observed p 0 05 fig 9b this result indicated that wetlands had a significant impact on the nitrogen concentrations in the streams flowing through them monte carlo simulation was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of diffuse nitrogen load from wetlands farmlands and forests fig 9c the sensitivity values of the diffuse don load from wetlands farmlands and forests were 0 21 0 91 and 0 2 respectively while their diffuse nitrate load sensitivity values were 0 12 0 89 and 0 31 respectively obviously farmland area was the most sensitive variable for diffuse nitrogen load wetlands had a higher sensitivity of diffuse don load removal than that of nitrate 4 discussion 4 1 source identification of diffuse nitrogen export long term variations in the nitrogen concentrations of nitrate don and ammonium at the ysc station are compared from 1972 to 2019 the average concentration proportions of nitrate don and ammonium are 36 50 18 54 and 44 96 respectively this indicates that the dominant nitrogen export forms are nitrate and don in the brw due to weak farming activities and atmospheric nitrogen deposition during 1972 and 1973 the disturbance of forests by timber harvesting may be an important reason for high nitrate concentrations in this period which is mainly caused by reduced plant uptake and increased rates of nitrogen mineralization and nitrification in upland soils rhoades et al 2013 bernhardt et al 2003 the main sources for diffuse nitrate and don export are farmlands and forests in the brw respectively fig 7 first the spatial distribution of diffuse nitrate and don export is highly consistent with farmland and forest areas which demonstrates that a close connection may exist fig 6a and b second a significant linear relationship is observed between diffuse nitrogen export and forest farmland area which indicates that nitrogen export mainly comes from forests and farmland farmland is the main source for diffuse nitrate export due to intensive human activity which introduces much fertilizer van breeman 2002 which can also be confirmed by much higher nitrate export per unit area from farmlands than from forests although diffuse don export per unit area from forests is also lower than that from farmlands forests contribute more diffuse don in this watershed due to their dominant areal extent fig 6 therefore more attention should be paid to diffuse don export in forest dominated watersheds except for land use type diffuse nitrogen export is also influenced by soil properties and hydrological features such as soc clay and perc which creates some uncertainty about the above conclusion therefore rda was conducted between diffuse nitrogen export and these factors to exclude these uncertainties baeten et al 2009 forest and farmland cover have much higher explanatory scores than soc clay and perc fig 6c and d this shows that land use type is the dominant factor for diffuse nitrogen export and that source identification in this watershed is reliable in addition this result also shows that the effect of forest spatial heterogeneity on diffuse nitrogen export in brw is not dominant because the forest cover in brw and trb is similar the analysis of diffuse nitrogen export in brw is highly representative of trb fig s1 4 2 transport of diffuse nitrogen export from forests and farmland lateral flow is the dominant transport path for diffuse don export from forests and nitrate export from farmland the slope has a significant positive influence on lateral flow in both land use types indicating that diffuse nitrogen export in the high slope areas is larger fig 8 this is mainly because steep slopes are more vulnerable to erosion under the same meteorological and hydrological conditions which could greatly increase soil loss weintraub et al 2015 kateb et al 2013 to investigate the difference in streamflow generation in forests and farmlands regression analysis between slope and percolation was conducted fig 8d higher percolation is found in farmland because intensive tillage activities have increased macropore density in the topsoil macropore continuity in the forest is reduced because of horizontally oriented roots bachmair et al 2009 this also explains why higher lateral flow is generated in forests than that in farmlands under the same terrain slope the transport path through groundwater flow for diffuse don export is not dominant because it can be strongly adsorbed into the soil and rarely leaches below the rooting zone fahey et al 1985 the weak and lack of correlation between the perc and clay can also verify this point fig 6e although lateral flow is also the dominant transport path for diffuse nitrate export it has some difference from that of diffuse don export the significant positive correlation between diffuse nitrate export from farmland and perc demonstrates that percolation is an important process for nitrate transport krysanova et al 1998 this is attributed to the high mobility of nitrate a significant negative correlation between diffuse nitrate export from farmland and clay indicates that clay minerals are important adsorbents for nitrate meghdadi 2018 the dominant transport path of diffuse nitrate export in the brw is lateral flow since the deep soil layer of dominant dark brown soil has a high clay content table s1 because the black soil on the surface is porous in this watershed it is vulnerable to leaching during the snowmelt and rainy seasons therefore surface runoff is difficult to generate and has little influence on diffuse nitrogen export ouyang et al 2013a b 4 3 exploration of the optimum diffuse nitrogen load removal method the runoff and associated dissolved nitrogen transported from forests always flows through wetlands which have great potential for diffuse nitrogen removal especially for nitrate hansen et al 2018 wetlands can convert some inorganic nitrogen into organic forms by microbial immobilization lindau et al 1994 in this study however the diffuse nitrogen removal load did not increase linearly with increasing wetland area this phenomenon demonstrates that nitrogen removal by wetlands must be influenced by multiple factors for example the relative geographical location of wetlands has an important influence on diffuse nitrogen removal efficiency fig 9a when the wetland is located in the farmland higher removal efficiency would be observed which might be due to the farmland having higher diffuse nitrogen export per unit area than that of forests the in situ experimental results show that wetlands have nitrate and don removal rates of 24 26 and 11 71 respectively fig 9b this confirms the nitrogen removal role of wetlands in this watershed from an experimental point of view wetlands in the forest dominated watershed may play the similar role of membrane bioreactors mbr in the nitrogen transformation process such as ammonification nitrification sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 compared with that of constructed wetlands the removal rate is not high low nitrogen concentrations and bioavailability of don in the wetland inflow may be important reasons liang et al 2020 lusk and toor 2016 in addition alkalinity in the water provides reaction substrate for ammoniating and nitrifying bacteria and regulate nitrogen transformation chen et al 2006 thus low alkalinity may also be a reason for low nitrogen removal rate further studies of the removal mechanisms by wetlands are needed according to the results of diffuse nitrogen loads from forests farmlands and wetlands monte carlo simulation is applied fig 9c farmland is the most positive sensitive variable of diffuse nitrogen load while wetlands have negative sensitive values obviously returning farmlands to wetlands is the most efficient diffuse nitrogen load removal method returning forest to wetlands is also a good method for diffuse nitrogen load removal with food production taken into consideration payn et al 2015 5 conclusions long term variations in nitrogen concentrations at the ysc station from 1972 to 2019 indicate that nitrate and don are the main forms of diffuse nitrogen export in this watershed the swat model is adopted to simulate diffuse nitrate and don export in the brw the average annual diffuse nitrate and don export values were 1 19 and 0 43 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively from 2014 to 2017 forests are the main source for diffuse don export when the forest cover is higher than 70 farmland is the main source for diffuse nitrate export when the farmland cover is higher than 5 lateral flow is the dominant transport path of diffuse don export from forests and of nitrate export from farmland with correlation coefficient of 0 73 and proportion of 98 respectively wetlands can reduce diffuse nitrogen load and wetland efficiency is related to the relative geographic location the in situ experimental results show that the nitrate and don removal rates by wetlands are 24 46 and 11 71 respectively returning farmlands to wetland is the most efficient diffuse nitrogen load removal method while returning forest to wetland is also a good method with food production taken into consideration credit authorship contribution statement pengtao wang writing

5568,for a better understanding of the spatial variability of the hydrological response of catchments to flood events the hydrological indicators obtained from annual water balances can be regionalized however many natural catchments are non conservative essentially due to interbasin groundwater flow igf that hinders the application of water balances with traditional terms only such as precipitation streamflow and evapotranspiration we thus carried out annual water balances including igf on both conservative and non conservative catchments of medium size 100 500 km2 subject to karst processes to this end we adapted the l vovich annual water balance to account for igf including hydrograph separation and coupled it to a geomorphological analysis water balances were done at the elementary catchment scale here either a headwater catchment or an intermediate catchment delimited by two gauging stations we applied this approach to 120 elementary catchments for which daily rainfall and runoff data were available these catchments belong to 12 french drainage basins located in partially or totally karstified regions cévennes jura normandy subject to variable igf depending on the extent of karst units first our results show that igf can represent a significant part of the annual water balance and that accounting for this component substantially improves the understanding of catchment processes second several study sites showed correlations between hydrological and geomorphological parameters providing interesting perspectives in terms of regionalization in particular regarding ungauged basins our results provide a better understanding of the gains and losses affecting stormflow and baseflow components in catchments prone to important igf 1 introduction catchments are generally considered as self contained hydrological units without exchange with their neighbours in this way traditional water balance methods allow estimating the not so easily measured evapotranspiration term e by measuring two other ones rainfall p and streamflow q among the earliest and most influential of these methods can be cited the works of budyko 1974 l vovich 1979 l vovich 1979 introduced the idea of two stage annual water balance partitioning at the catchment scale suggesting that in a first step precipitation is partitioned into surface runoff and wetting and that subsequently the wetting is partitioned into evapotranspiration and underground flow this kind of approach allows convenient regionalization of water balances for example ponce and shetty 1995 proposed mathematical formulations for the l vovich concept and sivapalan et al 2011 adapted them to numerous catchments in the usa such water balance theories are based on the strong assumption that every catchment is conservative by considering that p is the sum of q and e for this reason authors using this framework often explicitly discard non conservative catchments e g laaha and blöschl 2006 however hardly or not measurable flows can noticeably influence water balance such as water abstraction by pumping ladouche et al 2014 charlier et al 2015a overbank flow phenomena bates and de roo 2000 moussa and bocquillon 2009 or interbasin groundwater flow igf eakin 1966 among these igf is certainly the most common and important as an example the recent publication of fan 2019 gathers evidence from mass balance that catchments across the globe can exhibit leakages through their topographic divides igf has been shown to occur in sedimentary volcanic or karst system catchments genereux et al 2002 2005 schaller and fan 2009 charlier et al 2011 even if not directly measurable igf can be identified with hydrogeochemical methods based on major dissolved elements isotopes electrical conductivity and water temperature monitoring genereux and jordan 2006 carrillo rivera et al 1996 2000 or through hydrogeological studies of groundwater flow paths thyne et al 1999 conceptually igfs reflect the non superposition of topographic and hydrogeological catchment areas they generally involve a gaining catchment with its hydrogeological boundaries extending inside the topographic boundaries of a neighbouring losing catchment as such a water budget approach can also assume the possible influence of igf as an example pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2014 applied a semi distributed lumped model for quantifying igfs in a spanish catchment in france andréassian and perrin 2012 plotted 2300 catchments in a budyko type diagram and showed that over 20 of them fall outside the conservative zone defined by p q e with 0 e e0 e0 being the potential evapotranspiration bouaziz et al 2018 also linked igf to budyko diagrams in the meuse basin with similar results some studies le moine et al 2007 lebecherel et al 2013 fan 2019 noticed that many non conservative catchments lie in karst areas without further investigating this issue indeed igfs are very common in karst catchments due to their high infiltration capacity promoting groundwater flow and to the non coincidence of topographic and hydrogeological catchment boundaries karstification is the product of carbonate rock dissolution enlarging fissures and creating voids that considerably reduce drainage density going even as far as an absent drainage network with so called dry valleys and favours groundwater flow through conduit networks bakalowicz 2005 consequently different loss and gain processes affect streamflow where rivers cross karst areas bailly comte et al 2009 charlier et al 2015b 2019 such processes are subject to fluctuations depending upon karstification degree water table level changes and surface water groundwater interactions bailly comte et al 2009 charlier et al 2019 for instance an estavelle typical karst orifice can serve as a sinkhole or a spring depending on karst aquifer saturation lópez chicano et al 2002 mayaud et al 2019 moreover igf affects both quick and slow flow components storm flow and baseflow for example charlier et al 2015b showed the important role of karst springs on flood flow in the tarn river maréchal et al 2008 showed that groundwater may represent 60 of the river flow during a flood recession and charlier et al 2019 showed the importance of river losses on attenuating the flood component due to infiltration in karst accounting for igf in water balance approaches is thus essential in karst catchments which cover around 30 of the european land surface chen et al 2017 the aim of this paper is to develop a framework to apply water balances to a wide range of natural catchments including non conservative ones such as those located in karst areas that are prone to igf to estimate this additional igf component actual evapotranspiration is assessed using independent data regardless of rainfall runoff relationships igf is considered as the difference between catchments input p and outputs q and e this equivalence assumes that igf is the only source of non conservativeness of the water balance we adopted this assumption here as we also assumed that anthropogenic influence withdrawals and overbank phenomena can be neglected compared to igf in most large to medium scale catchments 50 km2 and because time series spanning several years allow neglecting the interannual water volume variation in this study we thus drew up annual water balances including igf for conservative and non conservative catchments having outcrops of karst formations knowing that igf affects streams during both high and low flow stages maréchal et al 2008 charlier et al 2015b an adapted model integrating hydrograph decomposition was needed to this end we developed an annual l vovich model adapted to non conservative catchments in order to obtain a better resolution of the spatial variability we applied it to the scale of the river reaches and their corresponding elementary catchments this allowed us identifying their hydrological flood response and linking it to easily estimated geomorphological parameters in order to assess the transferability of our results to ungauged basins we applied this approach to 120 elementary catchments having an average area of 100 500 km2 the three main original features of our work are that annual water balance methods i are applied to non conservative catchments ii include a hydrograph decomposition that allows describing the flood catchment response and iii are performed at the elementary catchment scale and linked to geomorphological parameters 2 methodology 2 1 adaptation of the l vovich water balance method to account for interbasin groundwater flow 2 1 1 initial l vovich water balance for conservative catchments l vovich 1979 introduced the idea of a two stage annual water balance partitioning at the catchment scale suggesting that as a first step precipitation p is partitioned into surface runoff s and wetting w and that in a second step w is further partitioned into evapotranspiration e and underground flow u this theory shown on fig 1 a allows writing the following equations corresponding to the two stages of precipitation partitioning applicable at the annual scale eqs 1 and 2 and to baseflow separation eq 3 1 p w s 2 w e u 3 q s u of these terms p and q are measured and s and u are obtained by hydrograph separation on daily data time series eqs 1 and 2 provide annual values of w and e respectively this water balance method can be done through simple graphical hydrograph decomposition as well as with numerical models e g eckhardt 2005 tang and carey 2017 more details on this aspect are given in section 2 1 3 this theory implies that every catchment lies on a watertight substratum without igf and that annual precipitation is completely recovered when adding annual evapotranspiration and streamflow eq 4 4 p q e 2 1 2 adapted l vovich water balance for non conservative catchments in order to write a consistent water balance for all catchments including non conservative ones we propose to account for the annual igf component as shown in eq 5 to account for i independent data sets are necessary to assess actual evapotranspiration e section 2 1 4 5 i p q e the obtained i values can be positive representing an igf outflow or negative for igf inflow fig 1b the annual calculation of igf allows separating the measured streamflow q into catchment runoff production q and groundwater gains or losses i q is obtained by operating an igf compensation on q as follows 6 q q i as eq 5 is not applicable at a daily time step due to the transfer time of p in soil or canopy before contributing to e or q i is calculated annually despite some residence times in matrix ranging from 100 to 300 days this assessment remains reliable the final igf value being a pluri annual mean obtained from time series of around 10 hydrological years this allows redressing annual water balances by capturing the potential water storing and releasing over hydrological years since preliminary results show that both s and u are affected by i igf is compensated for both s and u obtained with the initial l vovich model the new variables s and u are representative of the surface quick runoff and slow underground runoff before igf influence whereas s and u are the respective quick and slow components of a signal composed of catchment runoff and the associated igf fig 1b since igf affects surface and underground runoff in complementary volumes that vary depending on the catchments a site dependent α coefficient is defined for describing the distribution of the igf impact on both streamflow components eqs 7 and 8 7 s s i α 8 u u i 1 α if igf is the main cause of non conservativeness the water balances calculated with s and u should be conservative thus for each catchment α is calibrated in order to minimize the number of non conservative annual water balances on the available data time series non conservativeness can occur at each of the precipitation partitioning stages first if s p or s 0 and second if u w or u 0 a trial and error method is applied to each elementary catchment the selected α value being the one minimizing the criteria function fc α defined as the number of non conservative annual water balances obtained when calculating s and u with α incrementation of α is made at steps of 0 01 between 1 and 2 preliminary work having shown that α is never found outside this range with any larger investigated interval where a range of α values minimize the criteria function fc α the value is selected as the centre of this range ten types of catchments were defined by different igf influences and corresponding to specific i and α values types 1 to 5 are catchments with negative annual water balances water loss positive i sign and with respective α value ranges of 1 0 0 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 1 and 1 2 types 6 to 10 are catchments with positive annual water balances water gain negative i sign and with the same α value ranges as types 1 to 5 respectively fig 2 shows simplified processes associated with the main values taken by the parameter pair i α positive i values corresponding to losses are on the left and negative i values corresponding to gains are on the right values of α vary from 1 to 2 from top to bottom the choice of a classification into ten types following these α values was driven by the associated hydrological processes which are specific to each type first catchments with α values outside the 0 1 range exhibit compensating processes negative α values correspond to strong igf affecting the slow flow component u associated to opposite direction igf affecting the quick flow component s in a similar way α values comprised between 1 and 2 correspond to strong igf affecting s associated to opposite direction igf affecting u second the catchments with α values inside the 0 1 range are divided into three groups those with α values close to 0 are prone to igf affecting u and those with α values close to 1 are prone to igf affecting s finally catchments with α values around 0 5 from 0 4 to 0 6 are prone to igf affecting s and u in similar fashion this results in five groups each being split in two following the main direction of igf gain or loss depending on the i sign in terms of hydrological and hydrogeological processes outgoing igf affecting u can be due to diffuse river loss through the riverbed and incoming igf affecting u can correspond to loss from a neighbouring catchment feeding baseflow outgoing igf affecting s can be due to localized river loss through sinkholes and incoming igf affecting s can correspond to loss from a neighbouring catchment activating a karst spring 2 1 3 hydrograph separation at each gauging station daily q values are filtered in order to separate the quick and slow flow components the slow one is traditionally interpreted as baseflow which is the part of streamflow corresponding to aquifer drainage quick flow corresponds to surface runoff in the specific case of karst systems quick flow may also include a quick component from the springs that feed the river several baseflow separation methods exist traditional ones are based on graphical analysis like the fixed interval sliding interval local minimum or wallingford methods gustard et al 1992 sloto and crouse 1996 rutledge 1998 piggott et al 2005 numerical approaches have also been developed e g lyne and hollick 1979 eckhardt 2005 we used an automation of the one parameter recursive digital filter proposed by lyne and hollick 1979 implemented in the hydrun package tang and carey 2017 the filter equation is as follows 9 s t β s t 1 1 β 2 q t q t 1 with st and qt the filtered quick flow component and total streamflow at time t respectively and β the filter parameter we chose this method as it provides consistent results similar to those obtained with graphical approaches results not shown it can easily be automated and has only one β parameter fixed at 0 91 after a trial and error analysis on the studied catchments and considering the results of nathan and mcmahon 1990 on 186 catchments 2 1 4 assessment of evapotranspiration here we distinguish between the two terms of actual evapotranspiration e and e e is estimated by the standard l vovich method eq 4 and e is assessed using independent data time series at a daily time step using three different approaches in order to provide a range for this component characterized by major uncertainties the three approaches respectively based on the methods of thornthwaite 1948 dingman 2002 and the gr4j model edijatno et al 1999 are described in appendix the final e value is the mean of those three methods 2 2 spatial subdivision and hydro geomorphologic parameters 2 2 1 spatial subdivision the water balance method described above is applied to the corresponding elementary catchment at each gauging station covino et al 2011 mallard et al 2014 if the station is the most upstream one on the river the elementary catchment corresponds to the ordinary topographic catchment otherwise the elementary catchment is an intermediate one corresponding to the portion of the basin drained between two gauging stations for an intermediate catchment the streamflow q is calculated as the difference between outlet flow qo and incoming upstream flow qi eq 10 this is equivalent to considering qi and p as the two incoming flows for the intermediate catchment water balance the s and u components are also obtained from the difference of inputs and outputs eqs 11 and 12 for intermediate catchments the associated uncertainties are twice as important as those of measured flows 10 q q o q i 11 s s o s i 12 u u o u i several studies tóth 1963 schaller and fan 2009 bouaziz et al 2018 fan 2019 showed the influence of catchment size on igf to investigate the scale effect of catchment aggregation on igf we analysed the evolution of some hydrological indexes along nested topographic catchments as complementary information for this we used the example of the doubs river basin that has the highest number of successive gauging stations results of this analysis are presented in section 5 3 2 2 2 hydrological and geomorphological parameters hydrological and geomorphological parameters are calculated for studying their correlations at the elementary catchment scale the studied hydrological parameters are s p and s p part of the quick flow component normalized by rainfall obtained without and with igf compensation respectively s q and s q proportion of the quick component within total streamflow obtained without and with igf compensation respectively q p and q p conventional runoff coefficients obtained without and with igf compensation respectively i and i igf magnitude respectively considering and ignoring the direction gain or loss α relative impact of igf on surface and underground flow components since s is obtained from hydrograph separation of daily data time series its value is mainly driven by flood events thus s p and s q are good indicators of catchment response after rainfall events whereas q p indicates their global hydrological behaviour the geomorphological parameters are selected to be representative of the terrain tendency for infiltrating precipitation or producing runoff and of the potential karstification of underlying geological formations the computed parameters are the drainage density ratio of river length to catchment area the proportion of endorheism ratio of endorheic areas to catchment area and the median value of the index of development and persistency of river networks idpr e g gay et al 2016 idpr is an index quantifying the connectivity of the terrain to the river

was applied to three regions in france representing a total area of 25 000 km2 see fig 3 for location and table 1 for more details all three regions are totally or partially karstified and have different geological and hydro meteorological settings the studied zones belong from south to north to the cévennes mountains the jura mountains and normandy in the cévennes region six drainage basins were studied including 51 gauging stations the six are mostly binary karst basins with head catchments on exposed hardrock receiving around 1500 mm year precipitation and downstream parts consisting of limestone plateaux with around 1000 mm year rainfall the jura mountains region corresponds to the doubs river basin a few kilometres upstream from its confluence with the saône river and includes 39 gauging stations bedrock mostly consists of jurassic limestone and siltstone that is extensively karstified except in the far northern and western parts of the study area precipitation follows a strong elevation gradient with annual values ranging from 1700 mm in upstream catchments at heights of up to 1400 m a s l to 1200 mm at the outlet at elevations around 200 m a s l in normandy five drainage basins were studied including 30 gauging stations the two eastern basins are tributaries of the seine river and the other three are coastal basins the climate is maritime and annual rainfall ranges from 700 to 1000 mm rivers of the eastern part of the zone drain chalky limestone with karst covered by clay the mid western zone is underlain by jurassic limestone corresponding to the western border of the paris basin and the western part overlies the eastern border of the armorican massif with older hardrock fig 3 shows the twelve drainage basins with the potential karst aquifers a and

it is thus representative of the capacity of terrains to be connected to the drainage network 4 results 4 1 l vovich water balance 4 1 1 application of the initial l vovich model three elementary catchments belonging to the doubs river basin are taken as examples to show water balance results representative of three different configurations of catchments gaining losing and conservative the selected catchments 1 2 and 3 on fig 3 are part of a well known system of losses of the doubs river in its upstream part feeding the loue river spring e g charlier et al 2014 values of water balance terms for those catchments are provided in a supplementary material fig 4 shows the results of the initial l vovich annual water balance method as applied to the 120 elementary catchments graphs a and b represent the first stage partitioning of p into s and w most non karstified elementary catchments fall in the conservative zone i e 0 s p and 0 w p confirming the suitability of this approach for what we consider to be conservative catchments though some annual water balances for non karstified catchments fall outside this zone this shows that they too can be affected by igf or reflect data uncertainties however many karstified and mixed elementary catchments fall outside this conservative zone some annual s values reach twice the rainfall amount or are below 1000 mm yr indicating that the annual cumulated quick streamflow component between two consecutive gauging stations can either decrease or increase by an amount higher than the precipitation over the elementary catchment this confirms the occurrence of igf in karstified catchments highlighting their impact on the quick flow component through either gains or losses since w is calculated by the difference of p and s it also reflects this phenomenon and can be negative or higher than p which is physically impossible regarding the second stage partitioning of precipitation fig 4c d the same pattern is seen with karstified elementary catchments falling outside the conservative zone u values being negative or higher than w this shows the occurrence of igf in karstified catchments which may occur as river loss or groundwater inflow impacting not only stormflow s but also baseflow u consequently the e term calculated as the difference of w and u eq 2 shows inconsistent annual values mostly ranging from 4000 to 4000 mm yr application of the initial l vovich water balance method to karstified zones sheds light on their hydrological response it allows identifying the reaches or years with gaining or losing igfs it also shows that igf can affect streamflow in both its quick s and slow u components nevertheless these first results are insufficient as igf is not quantified being integrated into the traditional water balance terms this provides unrealistic values of some terms and especially of evapotranspiration that compensates the non expressed igf 4 1 2 integration of igf into the l vovich model in order to obtain consistent water balances and to quantify annually the main hydrological processes at the elementary catchment scale igf was estimated with eq 5 fig 5 a shows the cumulative distribution of all 1636 annual i values for the 120 elementary catchments despite some years showing igf magnitudes of several thousands of millimetres 90 of the annual values range between 1000 and 850 mm with a median value of 30 mm fig 5b shows that in an i vs q graph the points are aligned along the line of equation i q b with b corresponding to p e eq 2 ranging between 0 and 2000 mm yr non karstified elementary catchments form a group of points defined by q values ranging between 0 and about 2500 mm year and i values ranging between 2000 to 1000 mm year karstified elementary catchments show a broader range of q values 2000 to 6000 mm year associated with high i values of 4000 to 3000 mm year highlighting the specific case of karst catchments where igf occurs the order of magnitude of annual igf being 1000 mm it confirms our hypothesis that the potential interannual stock variation of water in the soil reservoir can be neglected compared to igf the order of magnitude of the available water capacity in the studied areas is around 100 mm according to le bas 2018 water balance terms values obtained with the adapted l vovich method are presented in the supplementary material are also provided the graphs for the criteria function fc α as explained in section 2 1 2 fig 6 shows the adapted l vovich water balance graphs with annual terms corrected by the corresponding estimated igf values the quick and slow streamflow components s and u are obtained with eqs 7 and 8 and w is recalculated accordingly compared to the initial l vovich results p remains the same whereas e is now estimated with an independent data time series as explained in section 2 1 4 the first stage partitioning fig 6a b shows consistent results with very few values falling outside the conservative zone and a limited vertical dispersion most annual s and w values being below 2000 mm yr regarding the second stage partitioning fig 6c d e is quite stable for all elementary catchments karstified or not centred on a mean value of 500 mm yr u has variable values from 1000 to 2000 mm yr with most non karstified catchments in the conservative zone 4 2 relationships between morphometric and hydrological indices 4 2 1 overview in order to investigate the relationship between hydrological response and morphological parameters of the catchments several indices were defined and calculated see section 2 2 2 each morphometric parameter was plotted as a function of each hydrological index for the 120 elementary catchments differentiated by the main geology or by geographic location global regressions on the 120 catchments gave weak correlations showing that each site has a hydro meteorological specificity as they have very different geological and climatic mediterranean continental mountainous and oceanic settings operating regressions on catchments grouped by geology slightly increased the correlation strength the best results were obtained by operating regressions on elementary catchments grouped by geographic location table2 shows the values of obtained determination coefficients r2 and p values for the different linear regressions on catchments grouped by study site analysis of the correlation coefficient values shows that no systematic correlation exists between investigated parameters but some trends are visible and significative at a 0 05 probability level the proportion of endorheism shows no correlation with any of the selected hydrological indexes and neither relative nor absolute values of i correlate with any geomorphological parameter regarding the three defined hydrological indexes s p shows the best correlations with drainage density and idpr the latter being a slightly better indicator use of the terms corrected for i provided better results with higher correlations and at a higher significant level especially for the s p vs idpr correlation generally the normandy catchments show the best correlations r2 0 52 and the jura catchments show the poorest ones most r2 0 1 fig 7 shows the scatter plots of s p as a function of mean idpr for the 120 elementary catchments the determination coefficients are 0 52 for normandy catchments 0 22 for cévennes ones and 0 012 for jura catchments the weak correlation for the jura ones might be explained by the fact that drainage density in such a purely karstic context is mostly low leading to low idpr values gaining and losing catchments mostly have idpr values 1000 which does not allow a good definition of the hydrological response by idpr 4 2 2 relationships between geomorphology and α coefficient fig 8 shows the mean pluriannual values of the parameter pair i α for the 120 elementary catchments karstified and mixed elementary catchments are slightly more likely to be influenced by important igf with a stronger vertical dispersion more noticeable is the lateral dispersion of karstified and mixed catchments though most non karstified catchments show α values between 0 and 1 several karstified and mixed catchments have α values outside this range this shows the specificity of karstified catchments as sites of compensating hydrological processes such processes seem to show a pattern with low α values associated with positive i values and high α values associated with negative i values see supplementary material for 3 examples of α in contrasted reaches in the doubs river this highlights the fact that igf losses mostly affect the baseflow component igf gains mostly affecting stormflow it should be noted that α values are chosen as described in section 2 1 2 and that some catchments show a range of satisfying α values a different selection method might thus lead to slightly modified α values and locally to a change in catchment type nevertheless the only arbitrary thresholds are those neighbouring 0 5 where igf affect both u and s they have been fixed at 0 4 and 0 6 as shown in fig 8 karstified mixt and non karstified catchments are present in similar proportions in this central zone of the graph for this reason different thresholds would not have led to significantly different results the relationships between α values and geomorphological parameters were investigated as well showing no significant correlations 4 2 3 the case of highly karstified catchments the case of the jura mountains catchments seems to be atypical with no evident relationship between morphological parameters and hydrological indices this region is well known to be highly karstified overall for instance of all the numerous springs draining the carbonate plateau the loue and lison springs are the third and the fourth biggest springs of france with inter annual flow of about 10 and 8 m3 s at the same time however some rivers like the doubs are known to be totally dry in summer fig 9 a presents the mean interannual igf values for each elementary catchment of this zone showing both positive orange and red and negative light and dark green values this means that some catchments are prone to streamflow loss while others gain groundwater moreover the amount of igf 1685 to 2860 mm yr can be similar to that of precipitation about 1300 1600 mm yr or streamflow this can cause poor correlation between the s p hydrological index and morphological parameters as the latter probably cannot capture the impact of igf influence when streamflow is too high the southern part of the jura mountains presents interesting igf values with the strongly deficient doubs river elementary catchments next to the highly gaining loue river ones fig 9b a zoom of this region shows positive artificial tracing tests surface injection in river losses sinkholes and recovery in springs it appears that groundwater flow connections highlighted by tracing tests are consistent with the igf values estimated by pluriannual water balances main injection points are in catchments with high igf values i e groundwater losses whereas the main restitution points are in elementary catchments with low igf values i e groundwater gains here they correspond to doubs river losses feeding the loue basin via groundwater flow to the loue spring charlier et al 2014 this confirms our assumption that igf is the main cause of non conservativeness of the studied catchments 5 discussion 5 1 on the interest of accounting for igf in the l vovich model accounting for igf in the l vovich water balance allows all its components to have less dispersed and more consistent values providing reliable results for annual water balances the new terms s and u describe quick surface runoff and slow underground runoff without igf respectively whereas the initial s and u are the quick and slow components of a signal composed of catchment runoff and associated igf yet some values still fall outside the conservative zones showing that a better allocation of igf between quick and slow flow components is possible or that other secondary phenomena such as anthropogenic pressure may influence the water cycle accounting for igf in water balances was earlier done by bouaziz et al 2018 for example using the budyko framework and showed interesting results in terms of partitioning precipitation into streamflow and evapotranspiration we have pushed this investigation further by integrating igf in the process based l vovich model that includes hydrograph decomposition this allows investigating the influence of igf on specific hydrological processes such as stormflow and baseflow in our case it showed that igf affects both stormflow and baseflow in a significant way notably in a karst aquifer context fig 4a and b show that many annual s values are non conservative for karst and mixed catchments meaning that stormflow is affected by incoming or outgoing igf even when karst only partially affects the carbonate rocks fig 4c also shows inconsistent negative or several thousands of millimetres u values meaning that baseflow in such catchments is affected by incoming or outgoing igf some non karstified elementary catchments also have baseflow values higher than soil wetting showing that igf can occur because of other geological features than karst drains such as fractured bedrock our method provides a framework for better understanding the influence of igf on the different hydrological processes from a perspective of improving the conceptual and digital hydrological models for catchments prone to igf it is useful to assess the spatial and temporal variability of igf and of its influence on both stormflow and baseflow previous work on improving digital modelling of non conservative catchments e g le moine et al 2007 showed that explicitly accounting for igf provides better modelling performance than using scaling factors e g scaling of rainfall or catchment surface moreover such work focused on the influence of igf on the whole streamflow and not only on its slow and fast components that are often separated in global models our approach thus provides an interesting way for improving models that differentiate inflow and outflow from igf in baseflow or stormflow it can be applied on a variety of catchments only requiring standard data sets of rainfall runoff and evapotranspiration regarding regionalization and link with geomorphological indices we advise to account for the main lithology of catchments as our results showed that significant differences exist following geology 5 2 variability of the hydrology geomorphology relationship our method provides a way of estimating several hydrological parameters obtained from annual water balances studied at the elementary catchment scale at the same time as a geomorphological analysis they allow investigating relationships between hydrological processes and physiographical parameters depending upon study sites and investigated parameters our correlations show strong variability weak correlations may be explained by an inability of the geomorphological parameters to describe the diversity of hydrological processes occurring in particular catchments e g extensive karst plateaux as gains and losses can occur in the same elementary catchment charlier et al 2019 nevertheless some trends provide interesting perspectives in terms of regionalization in particular when dealing with ungauged basins these first results could be used for instance for identifying gaining and losing areas for better designing hydrological models structure 5 3 water balance and scale effect fig 10 shows the evolution of several hydrological indexes q p i p e p left graph estimated at gauging stations along the doubs and loue rivers one of its main tributaries as a function of their distance to outlet the i p index represents the interannual igf depth normalized for p it globally decreases downstream along the doubs river going from 0 5 to nearly 0 at the catchment outlet the doubs is thus prone to important streamflow losses half of annual precipitation which decrease and tend to zero at the outlet regarding the loue river that collects most of the doubs river losses see section 4 2 3 at the upstream stations igf is incoming and represents half of annual precipitation before decreasing downstream to reach a close to equilibrium state at the catchment outlet this phenomenon is highlighted on the graph and is confirmed by the nearly conservative water balance at the outlet after the confluence of both rivers these results agree with schaller and fan 2009 who extended the theoretical framework provided by tóth 1963 and found that smaller catchments are more prone to igf than larger ones which tend to be more self containing this decrease of groundwater losses along the doubs is reflected by a higher q p index showing that from upstream to downstream a smaller part of precipitation is converted into losses and a greater part goes into streamflow this is probably slightly limited by the e p index increasing downstream the opposite occurs for the loue river as igf gains decrease q p also decreases from 1 5 where igf gains are important to 0 5 where igf is small the doubs river has major streamflow losses in its upstream part e g charlier et al 2014 this zone blue stripes on fig 10 clearly affects hydrological indexes as we observe an i p increase in this zone showing higher groundwater loss it also corresponds to a q p decrease streamflow being affected by these losses the right graph presents the respective proportions of slow u q and quick s q streamflow components the loss zone has a specific streamflow signal with an increased s q and a decreased u q meaning that the losses affect streamflow mostly in its slow component i e baseflow 6 conclusions we provide a framework for applying traditional annual water balances and adapting them to non conservative catchments those that are prone to gains or losses through interbasin groundwater flow or igf considering that igf is common in karst catchments and increasingly identified in other geological settings it is useful to dispose over consistent water balances in catchments prone to groundwater exchange such adapted water balances applied at the elementary catchment scale allow locating the gaining and losing reaches of streams the updated l vovich model by separating stormflow and baseflow allows studying the influence of igf on both components combined with a geological and geomorphological analysis this approach provides information on the role of physiographical parameters on the occurrence and magnitude of igf we show that karst catchments are strongly influenced by igf with major impacts on the quick and slow flow components of the annual water balance igf losses mostly seem to affect the slow flow component while igf gains mostly affect the quick flow component depending on the study sites significant correlations exist with geomorphological parameters such as drainage density or idpr even if in some cases the latter do not seem to cover all processes involved in igf this innovative approach allows applying consistent water balances over a wide range of natural catchments including non conservative highly karstified ones it provides more reliable results and restores the physical meaning of water balance components in terms of hydrological processes it also helps hydrologists in making safer interpretations based on annual water budgets and opens interesting perspectives for the improvement of hydrological models 7 authors contributions nd rm and jbc were involved in conceptualization

approaches are based on the water budget methods proposed by thornthwaite 1948 and dingman 2002 and by edijatno et al 1999 for the gr4j lumped model all three consider soil as a reservoir used for distributing the input precipitation into evapotranspiration and effective rainfall in the thornthwaite 1948 method water in the soil reservoir is directly available for evapotranspiration and

5568,for a better understanding of the spatial variability of the hydrological response of catchments to flood events the hydrological indicators obtained from annual water balances can be regionalized however many natural catchments are non conservative essentially due to interbasin groundwater flow igf that hinders the application of water balances with traditional terms only such as precipitation streamflow and evapotranspiration we thus carried out annual water balances including igf on both conservative and non conservative catchments of medium size 100 500 km2 subject to karst processes to this end we adapted the l vovich annual water balance to account for igf including hydrograph separation and coupled it to a geomorphological analysis water balances were done at the elementary catchment scale here either a headwater catchment or an intermediate catchment delimited by two gauging stations we applied this approach to 120 elementary catchments for which daily rainfall and runoff data were available these catchments belong to 12 french drainage basins located in partially or totally karstified regions cévennes jura normandy subject to variable igf depending on the extent of karst units first our results show that igf can represent a significant part of the annual water balance and that accounting for this component substantially improves the understanding of catchment processes second several study sites showed correlations between hydrological and geomorphological parameters providing interesting perspectives in terms of regionalization in particular regarding ungauged basins our results provide a better understanding of the gains and losses affecting stormflow and baseflow components in catchments prone to important igf 1 introduction catchments are generally considered as self contained hydrological units without exchange with their neighbours in this way traditional water balance methods allow estimating the not so easily measured evapotranspiration term e by measuring two other ones rainfall p and streamflow q among the earliest and most influential of these methods can be cited the works of budyko 1974 l vovich 1979 l vovich 1979 introduced the idea of two stage annual water balance partitioning at the catchment scale suggesting that in a first step precipitation is partitioned into surface runoff and wetting and that subsequently the wetting is partitioned into evapotranspiration and underground flow this kind of approach allows convenient regionalization of water balances for example ponce and shetty 1995 proposed mathematical formulations for the l vovich concept and sivapalan et al 2011 adapted them to numerous catchments in the usa such water balance theories are based on the strong assumption that every catchment is conservative by considering that p is the sum of q and e for this reason authors using this framework often explicitly discard non conservative catchments e g laaha and blöschl 2006 however hardly or not measurable flows can noticeably influence water balance such as water abstraction by pumping ladouche et al 2014 charlier et al 2015a overbank flow phenomena bates and de roo 2000 moussa and bocquillon 2009 or interbasin groundwater flow igf eakin 1966 among these igf is certainly the most common and important as an example the recent publication of fan 2019 gathers evidence from mass balance that catchments across the globe can exhibit leakages through their topographic divides igf has been shown to occur in sedimentary volcanic or karst system catchments genereux et al 2002 2005 schaller and fan 2009 charlier et al 2011 even if not directly measurable igf can be identified with hydrogeochemical methods based on major dissolved elements isotopes electrical conductivity and water temperature monitoring genereux and jordan 2006 carrillo rivera et al 1996 2000 or through hydrogeological studies of groundwater flow paths thyne et al 1999 conceptually igfs reflect the non superposition of topographic and hydrogeological catchment areas they generally involve a gaining catchment with its hydrogeological boundaries extending inside the topographic boundaries of a neighbouring losing catchment as such a water budget approach can also assume the possible influence of igf as an example pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2014 applied a semi distributed lumped model for quantifying igfs in a spanish catchment in france andréassian and perrin 2012 plotted 2300 catchments in a budyko type diagram and showed that over 20 of them fall outside the conservative zone defined by p q e with 0 e e0 e0 being the potential evapotranspiration bouaziz et al 2018 also linked igf to budyko diagrams in the meuse basin with similar results some studies le moine et al 2007 lebecherel et al 2013 fan 2019 noticed that many non conservative catchments lie in karst areas without further investigating this issue indeed igfs are very common in karst catchments due to their high infiltration capacity promoting groundwater flow and to the non coincidence of topographic and hydrogeological catchment boundaries karstification is the product of carbonate rock dissolution enlarging fissures and creating voids that considerably reduce drainage density going even as far as an absent drainage network with so called dry valleys and favours groundwater flow through conduit networks bakalowicz 2005 consequently different loss and gain processes affect streamflow where rivers cross karst areas bailly comte et al 2009 charlier et al 2015b 2019 such processes are subject to fluctuations depending upon karstification degree water table level changes and surface water groundwater interactions bailly comte et al 2009 charlier et al 2019 for instance an estavelle typical karst orifice can serve as a sinkhole or a spring depending on karst aquifer saturation lópez chicano et al 2002 mayaud et al 2019 moreover igf affects both quick and slow flow components storm flow and baseflow for example charlier et al 2015b showed the important role of karst springs on flood flow in the tarn river maréchal et al 2008 showed that groundwater may represent 60 of the river flow during a flood recession and charlier et al 2019 showed the importance of river losses on attenuating the flood component due to infiltration in karst accounting for igf in water balance approaches is thus essential in karst catchments which cover around 30 of the european land surface chen et al 2017 the aim of this paper is to develop a framework to apply water balances to a wide range of natural catchments including non conservative ones such as those located in karst areas that are prone to igf to estimate this additional igf component actual evapotranspiration is assessed using independent data regardless of rainfall runoff relationships igf is considered as the difference between catchments input p and outputs q and e this equivalence assumes that igf is the only source of non conservativeness of the water balance we adopted this assumption here as we also assumed that anthropogenic influence withdrawals and overbank phenomena can be neglected compared to igf in most large to medium scale catchments 50 km2 and because time series spanning several years allow neglecting the interannual water volume variation in this study we thus drew up annual water balances including igf for conservative and non conservative catchments having outcrops of karst formations knowing that igf affects streams during both high and low flow stages maréchal et al 2008 charlier et al 2015b an adapted model integrating hydrograph decomposition was needed to this end we developed an annual l vovich model adapted to non conservative catchments in order to obtain a better resolution of the spatial variability we applied it to the scale of the river reaches and their corresponding elementary catchments this allowed us identifying their hydrological flood response and linking it to easily estimated geomorphological parameters in order to assess the transferability of our results to ungauged basins we applied this approach to 120 elementary catchments having an average area of 100 500 km2 the three main original features of our work are that annual water balance methods i are applied to non conservative catchments ii include a hydrograph decomposition that allows describing the flood catchment response and iii are performed at the elementary catchment scale and linked to geomorphological parameters 2 methodology 2 1 adaptation of the l vovich water balance method to account for interbasin groundwater flow 2 1 1 initial l vovich water balance for conservative catchments l vovich 1979 introduced the idea of a two stage annual water balance partitioning at the catchment scale suggesting that as a first step precipitation p is partitioned into surface runoff s and wetting w and that in a second step w is further partitioned into evapotranspiration e and underground flow u this theory shown on fig 1 a allows writing the following equations corresponding to the two stages of precipitation partitioning applicable at the annual scale eqs 1 and 2 and to baseflow separation eq 3 1 p w s 2 w e u 3 q s u of these terms p and q are measured and s and u are obtained by hydrograph separation on daily data time series eqs 1 and 2 provide annual values of w and e respectively this water balance method can be done through simple graphical hydrograph decomposition as well as with numerical models e g eckhardt 2005 tang and carey 2017 more details on this aspect are given in section 2 1 3 this theory implies that every catchment lies on a watertight substratum without igf and that annual precipitation is completely recovered when adding annual evapotranspiration and streamflow eq 4 4 p q e 2 1 2 adapted l vovich water balance for non conservative catchments in order to write a consistent water balance for all catchments including non conservative ones we propose to account for the annual igf component as shown in eq 5 to account for i independent data sets are necessary to assess actual evapotranspiration e section 2 1 4 5 i p q e the obtained i values can be positive representing an igf outflow or negative for igf inflow fig 1b the annual calculation of igf allows separating the measured streamflow q into catchment runoff production q and groundwater gains or losses i q is obtained by operating an igf compensation on q as follows 6 q q i as eq 5 is not applicable at a daily time step due to the transfer time of p in soil or canopy before contributing to e or q i is calculated annually despite some residence times in matrix ranging from 100 to 300 days this assessment remains reliable the final igf value being a pluri annual mean obtained from time series of around 10 hydrological years this allows redressing annual water balances by capturing the potential water storing and releasing over hydrological years since preliminary results show that both s and u are affected by i igf is compensated for both s and u obtained with the initial l vovich model the new variables s and u are representative of the surface quick runoff and slow underground runoff before igf influence whereas s and u are the respective quick and slow components of a signal composed of catchment runoff and the associated igf fig 1b since igf affects surface and underground runoff in complementary volumes that vary depending on the catchments a site dependent α coefficient is defined for describing the distribution of the igf impact on both streamflow components eqs 7 and 8 7 s s i α 8 u u i 1 α if igf is the main cause of non conservativeness the water balances calculated with s and u should be conservative thus for each catchment α is calibrated in order to minimize the number of non conservative annual water balances on the available data time series non conservativeness can occur at each of the precipitation partitioning stages first if s p or s 0 and second if u w or u 0 a trial and error method is applied to each elementary catchment the selected α value being the one minimizing the criteria function fc α defined as the number of non conservative annual water balances obtained when calculating s and u with α incrementation of α is made at steps of 0 01 between 1 and 2 preliminary work having shown that α is never found outside this range with any larger investigated interval where a range of α values minimize the criteria function fc α the value is selected as the centre of this range ten types of catchments were defined by different igf influences and corresponding to specific i and α values types 1 to 5 are catchments with negative annual water balances water loss positive i sign and with respective α value ranges of 1 0 0 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 1 and 1 2 types 6 to 10 are catchments with positive annual water balances water gain negative i sign and with the same α value ranges as types 1 to 5 respectively fig 2 shows simplified processes associated with the main values taken by the parameter pair i α positive i values corresponding to losses are on the left and negative i values corresponding to gains are on the right values of α vary from 1 to 2 from top to bottom the choice of a classification into ten types following these α values was driven by the associated hydrological processes which are specific to each type first catchments with α values outside the 0 1 range exhibit compensating processes negative α values correspond to strong igf affecting the slow flow component u associated to opposite direction igf affecting the quick flow component s in a similar way α values comprised between 1 and 2 correspond to strong igf affecting s associated to opposite direction igf affecting u second the catchments with α values inside the 0 1 range are divided into three groups those with α values close to 0 are prone to igf affecting u and those with α values close to 1 are prone to igf affecting s finally catchments with α values around 0 5 from 0 4 to 0 6 are prone to igf affecting s and u in similar fashion this results in five groups each being split in two following the main direction of igf gain or loss depending on the i sign in terms of hydrological and hydrogeological processes outgoing igf affecting u can be due to diffuse river loss through the riverbed and incoming igf affecting u can correspond to loss from a neighbouring catchment feeding baseflow outgoing igf affecting s can be due to localized river loss through sinkholes and incoming igf affecting s can correspond to loss from a neighbouring catchment activating a karst spring 2 1 3 hydrograph separation at each gauging station daily q values are filtered in order to separate the quick and slow flow components the slow one is traditionally interpreted as baseflow which is the part of streamflow corresponding to aquifer drainage quick flow corresponds to surface runoff in the specific case of karst systems quick flow may also include a quick component from the springs that feed the river several baseflow separation methods exist traditional ones are based on graphical analysis like the fixed interval sliding interval local minimum or wallingford methods gustard et al 1992 sloto and crouse 1996 rutledge 1998 piggott et al 2005 numerical approaches have also been developed e g lyne and hollick 1979 eckhardt 2005 we used an automation of the one parameter recursive digital filter proposed by lyne and hollick 1979 implemented in the hydrun package tang and carey 2017 the filter equation is as follows 9 s t β s t 1 1 β 2 q t q t 1 with st and qt the filtered quick flow component and total streamflow at time t respectively and β the filter parameter we chose this method as it provides consistent results similar to those obtained with graphical approaches results not shown it can easily be automated and has only one β parameter fixed at 0 91 after a trial and error analysis on the studied catchments and considering the results of nathan and mcmahon 1990 on 186 catchments 2 1 4 assessment of evapotranspiration here we distinguish between the two terms of actual evapotranspiration e and e e is estimated by the standard l vovich method eq 4 and e is assessed using independent data time series at a daily time step using three different approaches in order to provide a range for this component characterized by major uncertainties the three approaches respectively based on the methods of thornthwaite 1948 dingman 2002 and the gr4j model edijatno et al 1999 are described in appendix the final e value is the mean of those three methods 2 2 spatial subdivision and hydro geomorphologic parameters 2 2 1 spatial subdivision the water balance method described above is applied to the corresponding elementary catchment at each gauging station covino et al 2011 mallard et al 2014 if the station is the most upstream one on the river the elementary catchment corresponds to the ordinary topographic catchment otherwise the elementary catchment is an intermediate one corresponding to the portion of the basin drained between two gauging stations for an intermediate catchment the streamflow q is calculated as the difference between outlet flow qo and incoming upstream flow qi eq 10 this is equivalent to considering qi and p as the two incoming flows for the intermediate catchment water balance the s and u components are also obtained from the difference of inputs and outputs eqs 11 and 12 for intermediate catchments the associated uncertainties are twice as important as those of measured flows 10 q q o q i 11 s s o s i 12 u u o u i several studies tóth 1963 schaller and fan 2009 bouaziz et al 2018 fan 2019 showed the influence of catchment size on igf to investigate the scale effect of catchment aggregation on igf we analysed the evolution of some hydrological indexes along nested topographic catchments as complementary information for this we used the example of the doubs river basin that has the highest number of successive gauging stations results of this analysis are presented in section 5 3 2 2 2 hydrological and geomorphological parameters hydrological and geomorphological parameters are calculated for studying their correlations at the elementary catchment scale the studied hydrological parameters are s p and s p part of the quick flow component normalized by rainfall obtained without and with igf compensation respectively s q and s q proportion of the quick component within total streamflow obtained without and with igf compensation respectively q p and q p conventional runoff coefficients obtained without and with igf compensation respectively i and i igf magnitude respectively considering and ignoring the direction gain or loss α relative impact of igf on surface and underground flow components since s is obtained from hydrograph separation of daily data time series its value is mainly driven by flood events thus s p and s q are good indicators of catchment response after rainfall events whereas q p indicates their global hydrological behaviour the geomorphological parameters are selected to be representative of the terrain tendency for infiltrating precipitation or producing runoff and of the potential karstification of underlying geological formations the computed parameters are the drainage density ratio of river length to catchment area the proportion of endorheism ratio of endorheic areas to catchment area and the median value of the index of development and persistency of river networks idpr e g gay et al 2016 idpr is an index quantifying the connectivity of the terrain to the river network comparing a theoretical river network obtained from thalwegs and the natural drainage network see section 3 2 3 3 study sites and data sets 3 1 study sites the previously described methodology was applied to three regions in france representing a total area of 25 000 km2 see fig 3 for location and table 1 for more details all three regions are totally or partially karstified and have different geological and hydro meteorological settings the studied zones belong from south to north to the cévennes mountains the jura mountains and normandy in the cévennes region six drainage basins were studied including 51 gauging stations the six are mostly binary karst basins with head catchments on exposed hardrock receiving around 1500 mm year precipitation and downstream parts consisting of limestone plateaux with around 1000 mm year rainfall the jura mountains region corresponds to the doubs river basin a few kilometres upstream from its confluence with the saône river and includes 39 gauging stations bedrock mostly consists of jurassic limestone and siltstone that is extensively karstified except in the far northern and western parts of the study area precipitation follows a strong elevation gradient with annual values ranging from 1700 mm in upstream catchments at heights of up to 1400 m a s l to 1200 mm at the outlet at elevations around 200 m a s l in normandy five drainage basins were studied including 30 gauging stations the two eastern basins are tributaries of the seine river and the other three are coastal basins the climate is maritime and annual rainfall ranges from 700 to 1000 mm rivers of the eastern part of the zone drain chalky limestone with karst covered by clay the mid western zone is underlain by jurassic limestone corresponding to the western border of the paris basin and the western part overlies the eastern border of the armorican massif with older hardrock fig 3 shows the twelve drainage basins with the potential karst aquifers a and

to the closest theoretical stream with that to the closest observed stream such values range from 0 to 2000 when the observed stream is farther than the theoretical one the idpr is low and vice versa it is thus representative of the capacity of terrains to be connected to the drainage network 4 results 4 1 l vovich water balance 4 1 1 application of the initial l vovich model three elementary catchments belonging to the doubs river basin are taken as examples to show water balance results representative of three different configurations of catchments gaining losing and conservative the selected catchments 1 2 and 3 on fig 3 are part of a well known system of losses of the doubs river in its upstream part feeding the loue river spring e g charlier et al 2014 values of water balance terms for those catchments are provided in a supplementary material fig 4 shows the results of the initial l vovich annual water balance method as applied to the 120 elementary catchments graphs a and b represent the first stage partitioning of p into s and w most non karstified elementary catchments fall in the conservative zone i e 0 s p and 0 w p confirming the suitability of this approach for what we consider to be conservative catchments though some annual water balances for non karstified catchments fall outside this zone this shows that they too can be affected by igf or reflect data uncertainties however many karstified and mixed elementary catchments fall outside this conservative zone some annual s values reach twice the rainfall amount or are below 1000 mm yr indicating that the annual cumulated quick streamflow component between two consecutive gauging stations can either decrease or increase by an amount higher than the precipitation over the elementary catchment this confirms the occurrence of igf in karstified catchments highlighting their impact on the quick flow component through either gains or losses since w is calculated by the difference of p and s it also reflects this phenomenon and can be negative or higher than p which is physically impossible regarding the second stage partitioning of precipitation fig 4c d the same pattern is seen with karstified elementary catchments falling outside the conservative zone u values being negative or higher than w this shows the occurrence of igf in karstified catchments which may occur as river loss or groundwater inflow impacting not only stormflow s but also baseflow u consequently the e term calculated as the difference of w and u eq 2 shows inconsistent annual values mostly ranging from 4000 to 4000 mm yr application of the initial l vovich water balance method to karstified zones sheds light on their hydrological response it allows identifying the reaches or years with gaining or losing igfs it also shows that igf can affect streamflow in both its quick s and slow u components nevertheless these first results are insufficient as igf is not quantified being integrated into the traditional water balance terms this provides unrealistic values of some terms and especially of evapotranspiration that compensates the non expressed igf 4 1 2 integration of igf into the l vovich model in order to obtain consistent water balances and to quantify annually the main hydrological processes at the elementary catchment scale igf was estimated with eq 5 fig 5 a shows the cumulative distribution of all 1636 annual i values for the 120 elementary catchments despite some years showing igf magnitudes of several thousands of millimetres 90 of the annual values range between 1000 and 850 mm with a median value of 30 mm fig 5b shows that in an i vs q graph the points are aligned along the line of equation i q b with b corresponding to p e eq 2 ranging between 0 and 2000 mm yr non karstified elementary catchments form a group of points defined by q values ranging between 0 and about 2500 mm year and i values ranging between 2000 to 1000 mm year karstified elementary catchments show a broader range of q values 2000 to 6000 mm year associated with high i values of 4000 to 3000 mm year highlighting the specific case of karst catchments where igf occurs the order of magnitude of annual igf being 1000 mm it confirms our hypothesis that the potential interannual stock variation of water in the soil reservoir can be neglected compared to igf the order of magnitude of the available water capacity in the studied areas is around 100 mm according to le bas 2018 water balance terms values obtained with the adapted l vovich method are presented in the supplementary material are also provided the graphs for the criteria function fc α as explained in section 2 1 2 fig 6 shows the adapted l vovich water balance graphs with annual terms corrected by the corresponding estimated igf values the quick and slow streamflow components s and u are obtained with eqs 7 and 8 and w is recalculated accordingly compared to the initial l vovich results p remains the same whereas e is now estimated with an independent data time series as explained in section 2 1 4 the first stage partitioning fig 6a b shows consistent results with very few values falling outside the conservative zone and a limited vertical dispersion most annual s and w values being below 2000 mm yr regarding the second stage partitioning fig 6c d e is quite stable for all elementary catchments karstified or not centred on a mean value of 500 mm yr u has variable values from 1000 to 2000 mm yr with most non karstified catchments in the conservative zone 4 2 relationships between morphometric and hydrological indices 4 2 1 overview in order to investigate the relationship between hydrological response and morphological parameters of the catchments several indices were defined and calculated see section 2 2 2 each morphometric parameter was plotted as a function of each hydrological index for the 120 elementary catchments differentiated by the main geology or by geographic location global regressions on the 120 catchments gave weak correlations showing that each site has a hydro meteorological specificity as they have very different geological and climatic mediterranean continental mountainous and oceanic settings operating regressions on catchments grouped by geology slightly increased the correlation strength the best results were obtained by operating regressions on elementary catchments grouped by geographic location table2 shows the values of obtained determination coefficients r2 and p values for the different linear regressions on catchments grouped by study site analysis of the correlation coefficient values shows that no systematic correlation exists between investigated parameters but some trends are visible and significative at a 0 05 probability level the proportion of endorheism shows no correlation with any of the selected hydrological indexes and neither relative nor absolute values of i correlate with any geomorphological parameter regarding the three defined hydrological indexes s p shows the best correlations with drainage density and idpr the latter being a slightly better indicator use of the terms corrected for i provided better results with higher correlations and at a higher significant level especially for the s p vs idpr correlation generally the normandy catchments show the best correlations r2 0 52 and the jura catchments show the poorest ones most r2 0 1 fig 7 shows the scatter plots of s p as a function of mean idpr for the 120 elementary catchments the determination coefficients are 0 52 for normandy catchments 0 22 for cévennes ones and 0 012 for jura catchments the weak correlation for the jura ones might be explained by the fact that drainage density in such a purely karstic context is mostly low leading to low idpr values gaining and losing catchments mostly have idpr values 1000 which does not allow a good definition of the hydrological response by idpr 4 2 2 relationships between geomorphology and α coefficient fig 8 shows the mean pluriannual values of the parameter pair i α for the 120 elementary catchments karstified and mixed elementary catchments are slightly more likely to be influenced by important igf with a stronger vertical dispersion more noticeable is the lateral dispersion of karstified and mixed catchments though most non karstified catchments show α values between 0 and 1 several karstified and mixed catchments have α values outside this range this shows the specificity of karstified catchments as sites of compensating hydrological processes such processes seem to show a pattern with low α values associated with positive i values and high α values associated with negative i values see supplementary material for 3 examples of α in contrasted reaches in the doubs river this highlights the fact that igf losses mostly affect the baseflow component igf gains mostly affecting stormflow it should be noted that α values are chosen as described in section 2 1 2 and that some catchments show a range of satisfying α values a different selection method might thus lead to slightly modified α values and locally to a change in catchment type nevertheless the only arbitrary thresholds are those neighbouring 0 5 where igf affect both u and s they have been fixed at 0 4 and 0 6 as shown in fig 8 karstified mixt and non karstified catchments are present in similar proportions in this central zone of the graph for this reason different thresholds would not have led to significantly different results the relationships between α values and geomorphological parameters were investigated as well showing no significant correlations 4 2 3 the case of highly karstified catchments the case of the jura mountains catchments seems to be atypical with no evident relationship between morphological parameters and hydrological indices this region is well known to be highly karstified overall for instance of all the numerous springs draining the carbonate plateau the loue and lison springs are the third and the fourth biggest springs of france with inter annual flow of about 10 and 8 m3 s at the same time however some rivers like the doubs are known to be totally dry in summer fig 9 a presents the mean interannual igf values for each elementary catchment of this zone showing both positive orange and red and negative light and dark green values this means that some catchments are prone to streamflow loss while others gain groundwater moreover the amount of igf 1685 to 2860 mm yr can be similar to that of precipitation about 1300 1600 mm yr or streamflow this can cause poor correlation between the s p hydrological index and morphological parameters as the latter probably cannot capture the impact of igf influence when streamflow is too high the southern part of the jura mountains presents interesting igf values with the strongly deficient doubs river elementary catchments next to the highly gaining loue river ones fig 9b a zoom of this region shows positive artificial tracing tests surface injection in river losses sinkholes and recovery in springs it appears that groundwater flow connections highlighted by tracing tests are consistent with the igf values estimated by pluriannual water balances main injection points are in catchments with high igf values i e groundwater losses whereas the main restitution points are in elementary catchments with low igf values i e groundwater gains here they correspond to doubs river losses feeding the loue basin via groundwater flow to the loue spring charlier et al 2014 this confirms our assumption that igf is the main cause of non conservativeness of the studied catchments 5 discussion 5 1 on the interest of accounting for igf in the l vovich model accounting for igf in the l vovich water balance allows all its components to have less dispersed and more consistent values providing reliable results for annual water balances the new terms s and u describe quick surface runoff and slow underground runoff without igf respectively whereas the initial s and u are the quick and slow components of a signal composed of catchment runoff and associated igf yet some values still fall outside the conservative zones showing that a better allocation of igf between quick and slow flow components is possible or that other secondary phenomena such as anthropogenic pressure may influence the water cycle accounting for igf in water balances was earlier done by bouaziz et al 2018 for example using the budyko framework and showed interesting results in terms of partitioning precipitation into streamflow and evapotranspiration we have pushed this investigation further by integrating igf in the process based l vovich model that includes hydrograph decomposition this allows investigating the influence of igf on specific hydrological processes such as stormflow and baseflow in our case it showed that igf affects both stormflow and baseflow in a significant way notably in a karst aquifer context fig 4a and b show that many annual s values are non conservative for karst and mixed catchments meaning that stormflow is affected by incoming or outgoing igf even when karst only partially affects the carbonate rocks fig 4c also shows inconsistent negative or several thousands of millimetres u values meaning that baseflow in such catchments is affected by incoming or outgoing igf some non karstified elementary catchments also have baseflow values higher than soil wetting showing that igf can occur because of other geological features than karst drains such as fractured bedrock our method provides a framework for better understanding the influence of igf on the different hydrological processes from a perspective of improving the conceptual and digital hydrological models for catchments prone to igf it is useful to assess the spatial and temporal variability of igf and of its influence on both stormflow and baseflow previous work on improving digital modelling of non conservative catchments e g le moine et al 2007 showed that explicitly accounting for igf provides better modelling performance than using scaling factors e g scaling of rainfall or catchment surface moreover such work focused on the influence of igf on the whole streamflow and not only on its slow and fast components that are often separated in global models our approach thus provides an interesting way for improving models that differentiate inflow and outflow from igf in baseflow or stormflow it can be applied on a variety of catchments only requiring standard data sets of rainfall runoff and evapotranspiration regarding regionalization and link with geomorphological indices we advise to account for the main lithology of catchments as our results showed that significant differences exist following geology 5 2 variability of the hydrology geomorphology relationship our method provides a way of estimating several hydrological parameters obtained from annual water balances studied at the elementary catchment scale at the same time as a geomorphological analysis they allow investigating relationships between hydrological processes and physiographical parameters depending upon study sites and investigated parameters our correlations show strong variability weak correlations may be explained by an inability of the geomorphological parameters to describe the diversity of hydrological processes occurring in particular catchments e g extensive karst plateaux as gains and losses can occur in the same elementary catchment charlier et al 2019 nevertheless some trends provide interesting perspectives in terms of regionalization in particular when dealing with ungauged basins these first results could be used for instance for identifying gaining and losing areas for better designing hydrological models structure 5 3 water balance and scale effect fig 10 shows the evolution of several hydrological indexes q p i p e p left graph estimated at gauging stations along the doubs and loue rivers one of its main tributaries as a function of their distance to outlet the i p index represents the interannual igf depth normalized for p it globally decreases downstream along the doubs river going from 0 5 to nearly 0 at the catchment outlet the doubs is thus prone to important streamflow losses half of annual precipitation which decrease and tend to zero at the outlet regarding the loue river that collects most of the doubs river losses see section 4 2 3 at the upstream stations igf is incoming and represents half of annual precipitation before decreasing downstream to reach a close to equilibrium state at the catchment outlet this phenomenon is highlighted on the graph and is confirmed by the nearly conservative water balance at the outlet after the confluence of both rivers these results agree with schaller and fan 2009 who extended the theoretical framework provided by tóth 1963 and found that smaller catchments are more prone to igf than larger ones which tend to be more self containing this decrease of groundwater losses along the doubs is reflected by a higher q p index showing that from upstream to downstream a smaller part of precipitation is converted into losses and a greater part goes into streamflow this is probably slightly limited by the e p index increasing downstream the opposite occurs for the loue river as igf gains decrease q p also decreases from 1 5 where igf gains are important to 0 5 where igf is small the doubs river has major streamflow losses in its upstream part e g charlier et al 2014 this zone blue stripes on fig 10 clearly affects hydrological indexes as we observe an i p increase in this zone showing higher groundwater loss it also corresponds to a q p decrease streamflow being affected by these losses the right graph presents the respective proportions of slow u q and quick s q streamflow components the loss zone has a specific streamflow signal with an increased s q and a decreased u q meaning that the losses affect streamflow mostly in its slow component i e baseflow 6 conclusions we provide a framework for applying traditional annual water balances and adapting them to non conservative catchments those that are prone to gains or losses through interbasin groundwater flow or igf considering that igf is common in karst catchments and increasingly identified in other geological settings it is useful to dispose over consistent water balances in catchments prone to groundwater exchange such adapted water balances applied at the elementary catchment scale allow locating the gaining and losing reaches of streams the updated l vovich model by separating stormflow and baseflow allows studying the influence of igf on both components combined with a geological and geomorphological analysis this approach provides information on the role of physiographical parameters on the occurrence and magnitude of igf we show that karst catchments are strongly influenced by igf with major impacts on the quick and slow flow components of the annual water balance igf losses mostly seem to affect the slow flow component while igf gains mostly affect the quick flow component depending on the study sites significant correlations exist with geomorphological parameters such as drainage density or idpr even if in some cases the latter do not seem to cover all processes involved in igf this innovative approach allows applying consistent water balances over a wide range of natural catchments including non conservative highly karstified ones it provides more reliable results and restores the physical meaning of water balance components in terms of hydrological processes it also helps hydrologists in making safer interpretations based on annual water budgets and opens interesting perspectives for the improvement of hydrological models 7 authors contributions nd rm and jbc were involved in conceptualization

estimation of evapotranspiration e is estimated at a daily time step using three different approaches so as to provide a range to this component characterized by major uncertainties the three approaches are based on the water budget methods proposed by thornthwaite 1948 and dingman 2002 and by edijatno et al 1999 for the gr4j lumped model all three consider soil as a reservoir used for distributing the input precipitation into evapotranspiration and effective rainfall in the thornthwaite 1948 method water in the soil reservoir is directly available for evapotranspiration and

5569,probable maximum precipitation pmp is considered as an important design criteria and it is expected to change over time owing to the impacts of climate change and intensification of global hydrological cycle thus reconstruction of pmp map and investigation about its temporal change are very essential in the context of climate change this study develops 1 day pmp map of india for five consecutive time periods two in historical i e 1901 70 1971 2010 and three in future i e 2010 39 2040 69 and 2070 2100 to study its temporal change observed gridded daily precipitation data from india meteorological department imd and outputs from three climate models following two representative concentration pathways rcps are used to develop historical and future pmp maps respectively the modified hershfield method is used for estimation of pmp with an updated method for enveloping technique the results show a clear increasing trend in pmp for most part of india specifically 84 area of indian mainland exhibits an increasing trend in pmp with an average of around 35 increase in post 1970 1971 2010 period as compared to pre 1970 1901 1970 period similarly in the far future period 2071 2100 around 70 80 area is showing an increase with an approximate average increase of 20 35 in pmp across different models with respect to recent past 1971 2010 following rcp 8 5 scenario these observations evidently indicate how significantly pmp is increasing due to climate change and it should be considered in the revised planning and design in water resources engineering keywords annual maximum daily precipitation amdp modified hershfield method enveloping technique frequency factor climate change change in pmp 1 introduction intensification of hydrological cycle is one of the major consequences of climate change jacob and hagemann 2007 allen and ingram 2002 such intensification leads to higher intensity and frequency of precipitation events at global and local scale trenberth et al 2003 giorgi et al 2011 increase in extreme precipitation is being reported in many studies allan and soden 2008 utsumi et al 2011 o gorman 2015 madakumbura et al 2019 as a consequence of such intensification probable maximum precipitation pmp which is defined as the greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration that is physically possible over a given size storm area at a particular geographical location at a certain time of year wmo 1986 is expected to increase with time the usefulness of pmp in hydrologic studies and design ranges from estimation of probable maximum flood pmf fernando and wickramasuriya 2011 to the design of major hydraulic structures such as large dams wmo 2009 to the design of high risk energy infrastructures like nuclear power plants prasad et al 2011 the possible change in pmp will have some serious implications on such structures due to their very long life span 100 500 years and may alter the risk and reliability associated with such structures designed against a stationary estimate of pmp kunkel et al 2013 milly et al 2008 hence the study on temporal change of pmp is of utmost importance in the context of climate change which is the focus of this study possible impact of climate change on the pmp has been reported in the literature at different parts of the world for instance kunkel et al 2013 showed that the pmp is likely to increase in future as indicated by simulation results of various global circulation models gcms due to substantial increase in average and maximum atmospheric moisture content analysing the downscaled climatic projections produced by the canadian regional climate model crcm beauchamp et al 2013 and rouhani and leconte 2016 indicated a tendency of increasing pmp estimates over different watersheds in quebec rastogi et al 2017 projected a significant increase in pmp estimates in later part of 21st century over the alabama coosa tallapoosa act river basin in the south eastern united states using a physics based numerical weather simulation model stratz and hossain 2014 studied on nonstationary pmp recalculations at three large dam sites in the united states and reported a substantial increase in currently accepted pmp values under future climate changes chen et al 2017 also reported an increase in pmp in the pacific northwest pnw region in the usa by about 50 30 around 2099 relative to the 2016 level under the worst climate scenario rcp8 5 likewise many studies have investigated the impact of climate change on pmp and reported a general increasing trend in future around different parts of the world rousseau et al 2014 afrooz et al 2015 klein et al 2016 lee et al 2016 ramak et al 2017 thuy et al 2019 however none of these studies investigated the effect of shift in global climatic regime in 1970s wang et al 2001 zhou et al 2009 sabeerali et al 2012 chen et al 2007 dai et al 2018 dash and maity 2019 on pmp this shift in climatic regime caused by anthropogenic global warming and different other external forcings is found to have significant impacts on several important hydroclimatic variables such as temperature air pressure wind field and rainfall pattern wang 2001 meehl et al 2008 jacques coper and garreaud 2015 nevertheless its effect on precipitation extremes especially on pmp is yet to be explored which motivates the present study to investigate the impact of shift in global climatic regime in 1970s on the spatio temporal variation of pmp considering the entire indian mainland as the study area secondly though there have been several works conducted at different regions basins in india to estimate pmp by different methods mazumder and rangarajan 1966 sharma et al 1975 dhar et al 1981 rakhecha et al 1992 kulkarni 2000 chavan and srinivas 2017 no significant work on future changes in pmp is available currently india has 5264 completed large dams and 437 large dams are under construction available on http www indiaenvironmentportal org in files file nrld 202018 pdf accessed in june 2019 these dams will experience future changes in climate owing to their long life spans these two factors build the motivations of this study i e to investigate the impact of climate change on the spatio temporal variation of pmp in the past to study the impact of global climate regime shift in 1970s and in the future which can be useful for future risk assessment of existing hydrologic structures in india among many methods available in literature e g wiesner 1970 hansen et al 1977 schreiner and riedel 1978 hart 1981 collier and hardaker 1996 hershfield method hershfield 1961 1965 is considered as a convenient and efficient tool for the estimation of pmp particularly for those locations where sufficiently long precipitation records are available but other meteorological data e g dew point temperature wind speed relative and humidity are lacking these meteorological data are essential for other physical methods such as moisture maximization and storm transposition technique wmo 2009 singh et al 2018 with the availability of sufficiently long record of precipitation the pmp estimates by hershfield method are closely comparable to those by other approaches at different parts of the world e g bruce and clark 1966 for canada myers 1967 for the usa eliasson 1997 for iceland and wiesner 1970 for australia the world meteorological organisation wmo has also recommended the hershfield method as one of the methods to estimate pmp in their various manuals and technical publications wmo 2009 considering its benefits the hershfield 1965 method is used for estimating pmp in this study however with a modified enveloping technique discussed elaborately later in brief the overall objective of this study is to investigate the possible spatio temporal change in pmp over india under changing climate to capture this change in pmp 1 day pmp maps are developed for the entire indian mainland for five consecutive time periods spanning over 200 years from past to future two historical periods viz pre 1970 1901 1970 and post 1970 1971 2010 and three future time periods viz near future 2011 2040 future 2041 2070 and far future 2071 2100 following two possible climate change scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 these pmp maps especially the recent one post 1970 and its future projections will serve as an important information for the design engineers and hydro meteorologists for revised planning and designing various major water energy infrastructures in the context of climate change the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows details on the observed and future simulated rainfall data are provided in section 2 following this the methodology along with the proposed modification in the standard enveloping technique for estimation of pmp using hershfield method 1965 is explained in section 3 results in terms of pmp maps in the past and future time periods are presented in section 4 along with associated comparative study finally the conclusions of the study are provided in section 5 2 rainfall data used 2 1 historical observed data from imd daily gridded 0 25 latitude 0 25 longitude rainfall data over entire indian mainland is procured from india meteorological department imd the length of the data is 110 years i e from 1901 to 2010 it is split into two parts pre 1970 1901 1970 and post 1970 1971 2010 to capture the effect of the shift in global climate regime in the 1970s as mentioned before though it is not an equal division of the historical data the data lengths are sufficiently long for both pre and post 1970 periods to estimate pmp next 1 day annual maximum rainfall values are extracted and the series of annual maximum daily precipitation amdp values are prepared at each grid point as an initial checking it is noticed that at some grid points in the north east region the recorded rainfall magnitude is zero throughout the year for many consecutive years it may be due to non availability of data in these regions this is particularly true for the pre 1970 period such cases are ignored from the analysis 2 2 future rcm data from cordex coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex portal supported by world climate research programme wcrp provides the simulation outputs of various climate variables during historical and future time periods at a regional scale nikulin et al 2011 in this study daily simulated precipitation values for the future time period 2011 2100 i e 90 years are obtained for three different regional climate models rcms for two emission scenarios designated by representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 from the cordex database the basic information of the data including its driving model source institute data resolution for those three different model combinations named as m1 m2 and m3 henceforth are shown in table 1 similar to historical data the length of future simulated data i e 90 years is also divided into three equal parts of 30 years namely near future 2011 40 future 2041 70 and far future 2071 2100 to study the change in pmp estimates over time however to use any future climate model output bias with respect to observed data is to be corrected for the bias correction historically simulated daily precipitation values for the concerned climate model are required hence along with future data historical data 1961 2005 are also obtained for m1 m2 and m3 3 methodology initially the daily observed rainfall data undergone some preliminary screening including removal of spurious data e g zero rainfall years as discussed in section 2 1 as explained earlier any simulated climate model output here rcm output may possess significant bias with respect to actual observations in spite of some recent developments in the field jang and kavvas 2015 hence the selection of a suitable bias correction method and application of that on the future simulated rainfall data is a mandatory step in the analysis next the homogeneity of both observed and future amdp series at each grid point is checked by the mann kendall test followed by adjustment of mean and standard deviation for the sample size and observed maximum event finally the estimation of pmp as per the modified hershfield method starts with the evaluation of frequency factor and its upper envelope curve finally a comparative study is carried out between developed pmp maps for the future time periods and recent past to capture the temporal change of pmp the entire methodology starting from data collection to final comparative study is summarised in fig 1 in the form of a flowchart major steps involved in the methodology are discussed in the subsequent sections 3 1 bias correction for future simulated precipitation series most of the existing bias correction techniques correct the bias in mean values only not in extreme values however as the present study involves only annual maximum values a bias correction method for extreme values is required also in case of monsoon dominant country like india consideration of zero rainfall days in the calculation plays a key role in bias correction what most of the bias correction methods ignore maity et al 2019 hence a recently developed copula based bias correction technique developed by maity et al 2019 is used this method is proven to correct the bias in both mean and extreme values and suitable for zero inflated daily simulated precipitation series the method uses copula nelsen 2006 maity 2018 to develop the joint distribution between observed and simulated precipitation in the past over a particular time period then the conditional distribution function obtained from the joint distribution is modified as a mixed distribution with a discrete probability mass at zero in order to account for zero values finally using the future simulated precipitation values as input into the modified conditional distribution function future bias corrected values are simulated and used for subsequent steps for pmp estimation 3 2 checking the homogeneity of data series the use of a long series of annual maximum daily rainfall in the estimation of pmp is suitable only if they show no significant increasing or decreasing trends desa and rakhecha 2007 the presence or absence of trends in the annual maximum rainfall series can be investigated using the mann kendall rank statistics test wmo 1966 or swed eisenhart run test wmo 1966 or turning point test kendall and stuart 1976 the mann kendall rank statistics test is used and the test statistic τ is defined as 1 τ 4 n i n n 1 1 where ni is the number of values larger than the ith value in the series subsequent to its position in the series of n values this statistic τ follows a normal distribution with its expected value zero and variance given by eq 2 2 σ τ 2 4 n 10 9 n n 1 so the standardised variate of τ i e the ratio of τ to the σ τ gives an indication of trend in the data for no trend in the data series this value should lie within the limits of 1 96 at the 5 level of significance and within the limits of 2 576 at the 1 level of significance 3 3 adjustment of mean and standard deviation for the maximum event extreme rainfall amounts of rare magnitude e g rainfall with return periods of 500 years or more are generally considered as an outlier in any data series though these outliers are not ignored from the analysis these values may have some substantial effect on the mean and standard deviation of the data series the magnitude of this effect is less for long records of data than for short records hershfield 1961 studied this by using hypothetical series of varying length and developed mean adjustment factor maf1 and standard deviation adjustment factor saf1 for different data lengths the adjustment factors maf1 and saf1 need to be multiplied with the originally calculated mean and standard deviation to obtain their corresponding adjusted values for each grid point it must be noted that this adjustment considers only the effect of the maximum observed event not other anomalous observations wmo 1986 3 4 adjustment of mean and standard deviation for sample size in general the frequency distribution of extreme rainfall is skewed towards right and hence there is always a greater chance of getting a large extreme event than a smaller extreme with the increase in the length of record wmo 2009 as a result of that the mean and standard deviation of the annual maximum series tend to increase with the length of record hence hershfield 1961 proposed another set of adjustment factors for mean maf2 and standard deviation saf2 for different sample sizes in our study we have evaluated the adjusted values of mean and standard deviation after incorporating these both sets of adjustment factors 3 x n x n m a f 1 m a f 2 4 s n s n s a f 1 s a f 2 where x n and s n are the original mean and standard deviation of the annual maximum time series respectively n is the number of years of data x n and s n are the adjusted mean and standard deviation of data series respectively 3 5 basic equations in hershfield method hershfield 1961 proposed the basic equation for estimation of pmp based on the general frequency equation suggested by chow 1951 as follows 5 x pmp x n k s n where x pmp is the pmp estimate for the station x n is the adjusted mean of the annual maximum series of rainfall data for n years at that station s n is the adjusted standard deviation of the annual maximum series of rainfall data at that station k is the frequency factor for estimating pmp at that station which can be determined from the following equation proposed by hershfield 1961 6 k x m x n 1 s n 1 where x m is the maximum value in annual maximum series of rainfall data at the station x n 1 and s n 1 are the mean and standard deviation of the annual maximum series of rainfall data respectively for n 1 years after removing the year with the maximum value 3 6 development of upper envelop curve of frequency factor judicious estimation of frequency factor k plays a key role in proper estimation of pmp a very high value of k will lead to over estimation of pmp and consequently an uneconomical design on the other hand a lower value of k will lead to under estimation of pmp and any structure designed based on that pmp estimate will be exposed to higher risk so the factor k has to be determined appropriately such that the design based on it have a proper balance of economy and allowable risk for this purpose the upper envelope curve of k is used as proposed by hershfield 1965 from the simple scatter plot between k and x n for 2700 stations 90 in the usa across the globe hershfield 1965 found a general negative trend in the plot i e as x n increases k decreases depending on that one exponential function of k is developed for different duration of rainfall as its upper envelope curve as given below 7 k k a e a x n as per the eq 7 the envelope curve starts at some point ka in the k axis for x n 0 and exponentially decreases and becomes asymptotic towards the higher values of x n hershfield 1965 used 20 as the value of ka after analysing data from 2700 different locations as mentioned earlier but this value may vary for different study areas the slope of the exponentially decreasing curve depends on the factor a which is again a function of study area and duration of the rainfall however in this technique it is noticed that unusually high values may be assigned to the points with lower mean due to the steep nature of the exponential curve towards the left end a typical example of scatter plot is shown in fig 2 where some points on the possible upper envelop are selected shown by orange diamond dots and an exponential curve blue dashed line is fitted to those points this blue dashed exponential curve indicates the envelope curve following hershfield 1965 though the maximum value of k say km is 11 5 here the envelope curve meets the k axis around 19 and thus provides excessive weightage more than the maximum value of k in the study area to the points with lower mean amdp magnitude this may not be a realistic reflection of the data points and thus leading to overestimation of pmp in those low precipitation extreme region hence a modified technique of enveloping is introduced in this study ensuring that no grid point gets assigned with k k m within the study area in this modified enveloping technique instead of a single envelope curve as in the existing hershfield method a composite envelope curve is proposed comprising of a straight line parallel to x axis part and an exponentially decay curve same as the blue dashed line thus the revised envelope curve not only encapsulates all the observed frequency factors but also unusually high values are avoided for the low rainfall regions a typical example of such modified envelope curve is shown as the red line in fig 2 from which it can be seen that the straight line portion and the exponential curve intersects at mean amdp x n x n t t refers to transition point and frequency factor k km where x n t denotes the mean amdp at transition point and km is the highest value of k thus the revised curve is defined by eq 8 as follows 8 k k m 0 x n x n t k m e b x n x n t x n x n t in this revised envelope curve also a factor b is there which determines the slope of the exponentially decreasing portion and is a function of the duration of interest and the study area referring to fig 2 the revised envelope curve consists of a straight line k k m 11 5 here for the mean amdp zero to x n t 153 mm here and an exponentially decaying curve for mean amdp higher than 153 mm finally using the new values of frequency factor from the envelope curve pmp at any location can be estimated using eq 5 3 7 determination of change in pmp over time in order to identify the impact of global shift in climate regime in the 1970s on pmp the pmp map for post 1970 is compared with that of pre 1970 in terms of percentage difference likewise to capture the change in future pmp estimates over time pmp maps developed for three future time spans for three models and two scenarios are compared with the recent past i e post 1970 pmp values at each grid point plotting this percentage change in pmp will provide the spatial distribution of this change throughout india however due to mismatch in the data resolution between observed here 0 25 x0 25 and future 0 5 x0 5 or 0 44 x0 44 period observed data is re gridded by inverse distance weightage idw method to match the corresponding future data for calculating the percentage change in pmp in future with respect to recent past iwd method is a widely used interpolation technique in hydro meteorological studies tang et al 1996 xia et al 1999 de silva et al 2007 chen and liu 2012 which determines the value of a variable at a target location through a linear combination of the values at four surrounding grid intersections by assigning weights inversely proportional to the distance from the target location to the grid intersections 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of bias correction before applying any bias correction technique a comparative study has been conducted between the observed and model simulated from m1 m2 and m3 precipitation series over a common historical period 1961 2005 the results reveal the presence of significant bias in the mean and standard deviation of the extreme values i e amdp here of model simulated precipitation series with respect to that of observed the mean values of amdp from observed records and outputs from three different models are shown in first two panels of fig 3 a and b respectively inter model spatial variations are notable and the existence of bias in the model simulated from m1 m2 and m3 precipitation values is shown in panel d of fig 3 it shows that the model m1 possesses a considerable amount of negative bias i e simulated values are higher than observed in mean amdp along the central belt of india whereas the models m2 and m3 have huge positive bias i e observed values are higher than simulated in the western and some parts of north east india apart from mean standard deviation of amdp series are also compared fig 4 similar observations are made from fig 4 as well which illustrates the difference in the standard deviation between observed and simulated amdp series all over india across the models as discussed in section 3 1 a recently developed copula based bias correction technique maity et al 2019 is used to remove this bias present in the extreme values bias corrected results in terms of mean and standard deviation of amdp 1961 2005 are presented in panel c of figs 3 and 4 respectively the plots showing the residual bias are also presented in panel e of figs 3 and 4 the residual bias is approximately near zero throughout the indian mainland comparing the figures in panel e with those in panel d it is noticed that the bias correction method adopted in this study has effectively debiased the model simulated precipitation in terms of both mean and standard deviation of the amdp series using the same bias correction technique future simulated daily precipitation series are also bias corrected 4 2 mann kendall rank statistic test for detection of trend tables 2a and 2b show the results of the mann kendall test for observed and future simulated amdp series respectively at two levels of significance i e 5 and 1 these results depict that most part of india is not showing any significant trend in amdp series and hence this time series can safely be considered as homogeneous for entire india in subsequent calculations 4 3 determination of frequency factor and its envelope curve using eq 6 frequency factor k is determined for each grid point throughout india for different time spans and models scatter plot of k against mean annual maximum daily rainfall x n for two parts of observed data is shown in fig 5a and the same is shown for three parts of future data for m2 following rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 in fig 5b for brevity results for m1 and m3 are not shown by figure from these scatter plots a general trend of decreasing k with increasing x n is observed moreover it is noticed that the k values are highly skewed towards its lower side in other words the k value falls within a small range of 2 10 for most of the grid points these observations match with the findings of other investigators desa and rakhecha 2007 rakhecha et al 1992 kim and lee 2016 hershfield 1965 for each scatter plot the upper envelope curve for k is developed by applying our proposed technique and eq 8 as discussed in section 3 6 shown by red line in figs 5a and 5b the envelope curves clearly have two different parts as discussed earlier one straight line parallel to x axis with the maximum value of k km and one exponentially decaying curve in order to get the exponential curve some top points from the scatter plot were selected and have been marked by orange diamond markers in the scatter plots however in some cases very few grid points exist with unusually high values of k as compared to the other points in the study area for example in case of post 1970 period few grid points 4 or 5 out of 4951 exist in west central part of india that have very high k values in range of 21 24 whereas k values mostly lie below 16 for other grid points fig 5a now developing the envelope curve considering those unusually high values of k will definitely lead to over estimation of pmp for remaining and most part of india hence those few points are excluded while developing the upper envelope curve however while estimating pmp for those points we have used their actual k values not the one obtained from the envelope curve keeping this in mind the envelope curves for different future time spans across three different models are also prepared the equation of the exponential portion of the envelope curve is shown in the inset of these figures figs 5a and 5b using these envelope curves eq 8 frequency factor at each grid point is re estimated depending on the mean annual maximum daily rainfall x n at that grid point 4 4 development of pmp map using historical data using the adjusted mean and standard deviation of amdp series and the re estimated frequency factor in eq 5 pmp is determined for each grid point in india the spatial distribution of mean and standard deviation of amdp frequency factor and estimated pmp are shown in fig 6 for two parts of observed data viz pre 1970 and post 1970 from the maps of mean and standard deviation in general higher values are observed along the western ghats some parts of north east and east central india comparatively lower values of mean and standard deviation are observed in the rajasthan region peninsular india and kashmir portion these basic observations match with the regular spatial variation of indian rainfall finally the estimated pmp maps for both pre 1970 and post 1970 are provided in the last column in fig 6 it is observed that the pmp is varying from a minimum value of 179 mm to the highest value of 1088 mm for the pre 1970 period whereas for the post 1970 period estimated values of pmp is ranging between 363 mm and 1826 mm iitm 1989 published a pmp atlas for india containing generalized charts of pmp estimates ranging from 300 mm to 1100 mm which is comparable with the pre 1970 period in the present study rakhecha and clark 1999 also developed one pmp map for india based on maximisation and transposition of storm using previous 100 years data with respect to the year of analysis which shows a pmp range of 600 mm to 1700 mm so the pmp estimates obtained in this study are mostly comparable with those results at least in terms of range which validates the applicability of hershfield method and our proposed enveloping technique however the post 1970 pmp estimates are substantially higher compared to the pre 1970 estimates as a possible consequence of climate change and global climatic shift in the 1970s to further investigate the extent of increase and its possible cause the percentage difference of mean and standard deviation of amdp series and the estimated pmp values in post 1970 is calculated with respect to pre 1970 at each grid point and shown in fig 7 a 7b and 7c respectively some basic observations from this fig 7 are given in quantitative terms in tables 3a and 3b from fig 7 and table 3 it is noticed that almost 84 area cyan to purple portion in fig 7c in india shows an increasing trend in pmp the range of change in pmp varies from 47 38 to 318 11 however averaged over entire india the percentage increase in pmp is 35 40 some parts of gujarat rajasthan and meghalaya are also showing significant amount of increase in pmp interestingly extreme north east portion of india in and around arunachal pradesh shows maximum amount of reduction in pmp 47 apart from that portion a few other locations around 16 across the country exhibit a decreasing trend in pmp brown to yellow patches in fig 7c the reason behind the overall increase in pmp is the general trend of increase in the mean and standard deviation of amdp throughout india which is also visually evident from fig 6 moreover compared to mean the standard deviation is showing a higher range in percentage increase as shown in table 3a on average the increase in standard deviation is about 25 whereas the average increase in mean is only about 9 also more grid points 67 59 are showing an increase in standard deviation as compared to mean 61 85 evident from fig 7a and 7b this indicates that not only the average amdp is increasing but also its variability standard deviation is increasing at a higher rate as a consequence there is a change in frequency factor which is visually evident from fig 5a which shows how considerably the scatter points k vs x n have changed during post 1970 with respect to the same during pre 1970 the range of k has increased the scatter plot has become more skewed resulting in a steeper envelope curve for k during post 1970 therefore an overall increase in pmp is noticed which can be considered as a significant impact of global climatic shift in the 1970s and hence of climate change kunkel et al 2013 lee et al 2016 chen et al 2017 rastogi et al 2017 pmp is observed to increase approximately by 35 in past few decades post 1970 as compared to pre 1970 such a level of increase can be highly detrimental for the structures designed against a stationary estimate of pmp 4 5 pmp map using future data and comparison with recent past the pmp maps for entire india is developed using three future projected rcm m1 m2 and m3 data following two scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 and for three future time periods viz near future 2011 2040 future 2041 2070 and far future 2071 2100 figs 8a and 8b show the future pmp maps developed in this study following rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively unlike the previous case of observed data the spatial distribution of mean and standard deviation of amdp series for future periods are not shown here for brevity from these figures gradual increase in pmp magnitude with the passage of time for all three models is clearly visible moreover the pmp estimates are higher in the rcp 8 5 scenario as compared to the rcp 4 5 case being the worst climatic projection such observations under rcp 8 5 are quite reasonable however in order to visually compare these future pmp maps with recent past the pmp map for post 1970 is reproduced in fig 9 in the same colour scale as of these future maps comparing these maps from the future periods with that of the recent past an overall increase in pmp estimates is clearly noticed throughout the country though the spatial distribution of future pmp varies between models a substantial increase of pmp in west central india and parts of north west india is common similarly reduction in pmp estimates in the eastern and southern parts of india is also a common observation across m2 and m3 the m1 model also shows some decreasing trend of pmp in the central portion of india though the reducing trend gradually vanishes towards the end of this century in general the change in pmp is captured by all three models in the future all over india keeping few observations of decreasing trend aside on overall increase in pmp in most parts of india across the models is the key observation from these two figures i e figs 8a and 8b similar to observed data in order to investigate further some quantitative study on percentage difference in mean standard deviation and pmp between different future time periods and post 1970 period is performed in order to do so the pmp map developed for the post 1970 period with resolution 0 25 x 0 25 is transformed to a lower resolution of 0 5 0 5 for m1 and 0 44 0 44 for m2 and m3 by idw method as discussed in section 3 7 the results of the comparative study for pmp are shown in figs 10a and 10b percentage difference in mean and standard deviation are not shown as figure for brevity in the form of spatial distribution throughout india on the other hand table 4 shows quantitative output of this analysis i e average percentage increase of pmp and percentage of grid points showing this increment in india different models show different levels of increase in pmp magnitude towards the end of this century in near future period this overall percentage of increase in pmp varies approximately between 7 and 16 and in future period it ranges between 12 and 24 across different models and scenarios towards the end of this century i e in far future period the increment in pmp varies approximately between 20 and 28 and 29 35 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenario respectively across three models additionally under both scenarios around 70 80 area of india shows this increasing trend across different models in far future period overall a continuous increase in pmp with time is evident from the table 4 for each model all these observations clearly indicate towards a continuous temporal change of pmp throughout india for the rest of the present century reasonably similar extent of increase in pmp was also reported by rastogi et al 2017 where they observed around 20 increase in pmp in the 2021 2050 time period and 44 in the 2071 2100 time periods with respect to 1981 2010 baseline values in the south eastern united states likewise for pacific northwest pnw region in the usa chen et al 2017 observed an increase in pmp by about 50 30 around 2099 relative to the 2016 level following rcp 8 5 in different other parts of the world also similar extent of increase in pmp have been reported in many studies e g lee et al 2016 projected around 30 increase under rcp 8 5 scenario in south korea afrooz et al 2015 estimated pmp to increase up to 18 2 and 27 3 in southern iran across different gcms toward the end of the century w r t 1971 2000 base period hence though unavailability of study on future changes in pmp in india limits us to compare our results to that reasonably similar results from different other portions of the world support us to infer that similar to different parts of the world pmp is also expected to increase in future at a significant rate in india table 4 also shows the average percentage increase and percentage of area showing that increase for mean and standard deviation along with pmp observing the numbers reported there the gradual increase in mean and standard deviation with time can be identified also their spatial extent of increase increases with time in general we observe around 15 to 33 increase in mean in far future period under the rcp 4 5 scenario across the models whereas the same for standard deviation is around 20 to 37 specifically we observe higher extent of increase in standard deviation in most of the cases as compared to mean so similar to the observed data set it can also be inferred here that not only the mean amdp but their variability is also increasing sometimes even in a faster rate which is eventually causing a substantial increase in pmp throughout india in future in a nutshell comparative study between different pmp maps developed from future simulated and observed precipitation we can summarise that pmp estimates throughout india are showing substantial change with time pmp was increasing in the last century and it will continue to increase over the future period too with almost similar rate though the projection of spatial variation and extent is different all the models considered in this study depicts similar results this can be considered as a possible consequence of changing climate which is intensifying the global hydrological cycle and altering the regular spatio temporal variation of precipitation all over india krishnamurthy et al 2009 mishra and liu 2014 loo et al 2015 as a result of that extreme rainfalls of high intensity are expected to occur in most parts of the country causing an overall increase in mean and std dev in amdp series ali and mishra 2017 mukherjee et al 2018 which in turn is resulting in such an extent of increase in pmp 5 conclusions in this study the likely spatio temporal change mostly increase in pmp under changing climate is established across indian mainland using observed records and model simulated precipitation values 1 day pmp maps for two different time periods from the past and three time periods from the future period are developed and compared future simulated precipitation values are the simulations outputs from three different gcm rcm combinations to construct the future pmp maps under two rcp scenarios these maps especially the maps based on recent observations and future data are expected to be highly informative for the hydrologists and policy makers following specific conclusions are drawn from the study by comparing two pmp maps for historical periods an increasing trend of pmp with an average increase of around 35 in magnitude is noticed during the post 1970 period as compared to the pre 1970 period it is true for the most part of india 84 of the total area this indicates a serious and significant impact of shift in global climate regime in the 1970s on pmp in india similar to the historical period the increasing trends persist in the future also all three models considered in this study show an agreement on this observation all models show an overall increasing trend of pmp but of different extent and spatial variation in general approximately 29 to 35 and 20 to 28 increase in pmp is observed in the far future period compared to the recent past under rcp 8 5 and rcp 4 5 scenario respectively also around 70 80 area of india shows this increasing trend across different models this indicates that the increasing trend of pmp throughout india in the past will continue almost at a similar rate in the upcoming future period further analysis indicates that compared to mean amdp the standard deviation of amdp is increasing with a similar or even faster rate over time and eventually resulting in the increase in the estimates of pmp with time apart from this the change in frequency factor its range and corresponding changes in the envelope curve also results in an increase in pmp finally the temporal change of pmp in india must be considered in the planning designing and future risk assessment of any major high risk water resources infrastructure any design based on the stationary estimate of pmp is susceptible to be exposed to higher risk with the passage of time hence the long term decision making strategies should be updated according to the future projected pmp maps the developed pmp maps for entire indian mainland based on this study are available at mendeley data repository url https doi org 10 17632

5569,probable maximum precipitation pmp is considered as an important design criteria and it is expected to change over time owing to the impacts of climate change and intensification of global hydrological cycle thus reconstruction of pmp map and investigation about its temporal change are very essential in the context of climate change this study develops 1 day pmp map of india for five consecutive time periods two in historical i e 1901 70 1971 2010 and three in future i e 2010 39 2040 69 and 2070 2100 to study its temporal change observed gridded daily precipitation data from india meteorological department imd and outputs from three climate models following two representative concentration pathways rcps are used to develop historical and future pmp maps respectively the modified hershfield method is used for estimation of pmp with an updated method for enveloping technique the results show a clear increasing trend in pmp for most part of india specifically 84 area of indian mainland exhibits an increasing trend in pmp with an average of around 35 increase in post 1970 1971 2010 period as compared to pre 1970 1901 1970 period similarly in the far future period 2071 2100 around 70 80 area is showing an increase with an approximate average increase of 20 35 in pmp across different models with respect to recent past 1971 2010 following rcp 8 5 scenario these observations evidently indicate how significantly pmp is increasing due to climate change and it should be considered in the revised planning and design in water resources engineering keywords annual maximum daily precipitation amdp modified hershfield method enveloping technique frequency factor climate change change in pmp 1 introduction intensification of hydrological cycle is one of the major consequences of climate change jacob and hagemann 2007 allen and ingram 2002 such intensification leads to higher intensity and frequency of precipitation events at global and local scale trenberth et al 2003 giorgi et al 2011 increase in extreme precipitation is being reported in many studies allan and soden 2008 utsumi et al 2011 o gorman 2015 madakumbura et al 2019 as a consequence of such intensification probable maximum precipitation pmp which is defined as the greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration that is physically possible over a given size storm area at a particular geographical location at a certain time of year wmo 1986 is expected to increase with time the usefulness of pmp in hydrologic studies and design ranges from estimation of probable maximum flood pmf fernando and wickramasuriya 2011 to the design of major hydraulic structures such as large dams wmo 2009 to the design of high risk energy infrastructures like nuclear power plants prasad et al 2011 the possible change in pmp will have some serious implications on such structures due to their very long life span 100 500 years and may alter the risk and reliability associated with such structures designed against a stationary estimate of pmp kunkel et al 2013 milly et al 2008 hence the study on temporal change of pmp is of utmost importance in the context of climate change which is the focus of this study possible impact of climate change on the pmp has been reported in the literature at different parts of the world for instance kunkel et al 2013 showed that the pmp is likely to increase in future as indicated by simulation results of various global circulation models gcms due to substantial increase in average and maximum atmospheric moisture content analysing the downscaled climatic projections produced by the canadian regional climate model crcm beauchamp et al 2013 and rouhani and leconte 2016 indicated a tendency of increasing pmp estimates over different watersheds in quebec rastogi et al 2017 projected a significant increase in pmp estimates in later part of 21st century over the alabama coosa tallapoosa act river basin in the south eastern united states using a physics based numerical weather simulation model stratz and hossain 2014 studied on nonstationary pmp recalculations at three large dam sites in the united states and reported a substantial increase in currently accepted pmp values under future climate changes chen et al 2017 also reported an increase in pmp in the pacific northwest pnw region in the usa by about 50 30 around 2099 relative to the 2016 level under the worst climate scenario rcp8 5 likewise many studies have investigated the impact of climate change on pmp and reported a general increasing trend in future around different parts of the world rousseau et al 2014 afrooz et al 2015 klein et al 2016 lee et al 2016 ramak et al 2017 thuy et al 2019 however none of these studies investigated the effect of shift in global climatic regime in 1970s wang et al 2001 zhou et al 2009 sabeerali et al 2012 chen et al 2007 dai et al 2018 dash and maity 2019 on pmp this shift in climatic regime caused by anthropogenic global warming and different other external forcings is found to have significant impacts on several important hydroclimatic variables such as temperature air pressure wind field and rainfall pattern wang 2001 meehl et al 2008 jacques coper and garreaud 2015 nevertheless its effect on precipitation extremes especially on pmp is yet to be explored which motivates the present study to investigate the impact of shift in global climatic regime in 1970s on the spatio temporal variation of pmp considering the entire indian mainland as the study area secondly though there have been several works conducted at different regions basins in india to estimate pmp by different methods mazumder and rangarajan 1966 sharma et al 1975 dhar et al 1981 rakhecha et al 1992 kulkarni 2000 chavan and srinivas 2017 no significant work on future changes in pmp is available currently india has 5264 completed large dams and 437 large dams are under construction available on http www indiaenvironmentportal org in files file nrld 202018 pdf accessed in june 2019 these dams will experience future changes in climate owing to their long life spans these two factors build the motivations of this study i e to investigate the impact of climate change on the spatio temporal variation of pmp in the past to study the impact of global climate regime shift in 1970s and in the future which can be useful for future risk assessment of existing hydrologic structures in india among many methods available in literature e g wiesner 1970 hansen et al 1977 schreiner and riedel 1978 hart 1981 collier and hardaker 1996 hershfield method hershfield 1961 1965 is considered as a convenient and efficient tool for the estimation of pmp particularly for those locations where sufficiently long precipitation records are available but other meteorological data e g dew point temperature wind speed relative and humidity are lacking these meteorological data are essential for other physical methods such as moisture maximization and storm transposition technique wmo 2009 singh et al 2018 with the availability of sufficiently long record of precipitation the pmp estimates by hershfield method are closely comparable to those by other approaches at different parts of the world e g bruce and clark 1966 for canada myers 1967 for the usa eliasson 1997 for iceland and wiesner 1970 for australia the world meteorological organisation wmo has also recommended the hershfield method as one of the methods to estimate pmp in their various manuals and technical publications wmo 2009 considering its benefits the hershfield 1965 method is used for estimating pmp in this study however with a modified enveloping technique discussed elaborately later in brief the overall objective of this study is to investigate the possible spatio temporal change in pmp over india under changing climate to capture this change in pmp 1 day pmp maps are developed for the entire indian mainland for five consecutive time periods spanning over 200 years from past to future two historical periods viz pre 1970 1901 1970 and post 1970 1971 2010 and three future time periods viz near future 2011 2040 future 2041 2070 and far future 2071 2100 following two possible climate change scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 these pmp maps especially the recent one post 1970 and its future projections will serve as an important information for the design engineers and hydro meteorologists for revised planning and designing various major water energy infrastructures in the context of climate change the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows details on the observed and future simulated rainfall data are provided in section 2 following this the methodology along with the proposed modification in the standard enveloping technique for estimation of pmp using hershfield method 1965 is explained in section 3 results in terms of pmp maps in the past and future time periods are presented in section 4 along with associated comparative study finally the conclusions of the study are provided in section 5 2 rainfall data used 2 1 historical observed data from imd daily gridded 0 25 latitude 0 25 longitude rainfall data over entire indian mainland is procured from india meteorological department imd the length of the data is 110 years i e from 1901 to 2010 it is split into two parts pre 1970 1901 1970 and post 1970 1971 2010 to capture the effect of the shift in global climate regime in the 1970s as mentioned before though it is not an equal division of the historical data the data lengths are sufficiently long for both pre and post 1970 periods to estimate pmp next 1 day annual maximum rainfall values are extracted and the series of annual maximum daily precipitation amdp values are prepared at each grid point as an initial checking it is noticed that at some grid points in the north east region the recorded rainfall magnitude is zero throughout the year for many consecutive years it may be due to non availability of data in these regions this is particularly true for the pre 1970 period such cases are ignored from the analysis 2 2 future rcm data from cordex coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex portal supported by world climate research programme wcrp provides the simulation outputs of various climate variables during historical and future time periods at a regional scale nikulin et al 2011 in this study daily simulated precipitation values for the future time period 2011 2100 i e 90 years are obtained for three different regional climate models rcms for two emission scenarios designated by representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 from the cordex database the basic information of the data including its driving model source institute data resolution for those three different model combinations named as m1 m2 and m3 henceforth are shown in table 1 similar to historical data the length of future simulated data i e 90 years is also divided into three equal parts of 30 years namely near future 2011 40 future 2041 70 and far future 2071 2100 to study the change in pmp estimates over time however to use any future climate model output bias with respect to observed data is to be corrected for the bias correction historically simulated daily precipitation values for the concerned climate model are required hence along with future data historical data 1961 2005 are also obtained for m1 m2 and m3 3 methodology initially the daily observed rainfall data undergone some preliminary screening including removal of spurious data e g zero rainfall years as discussed in section 2 1 as explained earlier any simulated climate model output here rcm output may possess significant bias with respect to actual observations in spite of some recent developments in the field jang and kavvas 2015 hence the selection of a suitable bias correction method and application of that on the future simulated rainfall data is a mandatory step in the analysis next the homogeneity of both observed and future amdp series at each grid point is checked by the mann kendall test followed by adjustment of mean and standard deviation for the sample size and observed maximum event finally the estimation of pmp as per the modified hershfield method starts with the evaluation of frequency factor and its upper envelope curve finally a comparative study is carried out between developed pmp maps for the future time periods and recent past to capture the temporal change of pmp the entire methodology starting from data collection to final comparative study is summarised in fig 1 in the form of a flowchart major steps involved in the methodology are discussed in the subsequent sections 3 1 bias correction for future simulated precipitation series most of the existing bias correction techniques correct the bias in mean values only not in extreme values however as the present study involves only annual maximum values a bias correction method for extreme values is required also in case of monsoon dominant country like india consideration of zero rainfall days in the calculation plays a key role in bias correction what most of the bias correction methods ignore maity et al 2019 hence a recently developed copula based bias correction technique developed by maity et al 2019 is used this method is proven to correct the bias in both mean and extreme values and suitable for zero inflated daily simulated precipitation series the method uses copula nelsen 2006 maity 2018 to develop the joint distribution between observed and simulated precipitation in the past over a particular time period then the conditional distribution function obtained from the joint distribution is modified as a mixed distribution with a discrete probability mass at zero in order to account for zero values finally using the future simulated precipitation values as input into the modified conditional distribution function future bias corrected values are simulated and used for subsequent steps for pmp estimation 3 2 checking the homogeneity of data series the use of a long series of annual maximum daily rainfall in the estimation of pmp is suitable only if they show no significant increasing or decreasing trends desa and rakhecha 2007 the presence or absence of trends in the annual maximum rainfall series can be investigated using the mann kendall rank statistics test wmo 1966 or swed eisenhart run test wmo 1966 or turning point test kendall and stuart 1976 the mann kendall rank statistics test is used and the test statistic τ is defined as 1 τ 4 n i n n 1 1 where ni is the number of values larger than the ith value in the series subsequent to its position in the series of n values this statistic τ follows a normal distribution with its expected value zero and variance given by eq 2 2 σ τ 2 4 n 10 9 n n 1 so the standardised variate of τ i e the ratio of τ to the σ τ gives an indication of trend in the data for no trend in the data series this value should lie within the limits of 1 96 at the 5 level of significance and within the limits of 2 576 at the 1 level of significance 3 3 adjustment of mean and standard deviation for the maximum event extreme rainfall amounts of rare magnitude e g rainfall with return periods of 500 years or more are generally considered as an outlier in any data series though these outliers are not ignored from the analysis these values may have some substantial effect on the mean and standard deviation of the data series the magnitude of this effect is less for long records of data than for short records hershfield 1961 studied this by using hypothetical series of varying length and developed mean adjustment factor maf1 and standard deviation adjustment factor saf1 for different data lengths the adjustment factors maf1 and saf1 need to be multiplied with the originally calculated mean and standard deviation to obtain their corresponding adjusted values for each grid point it must be noted that this adjustment considers only the effect of the maximum observed event not other anomalous observations wmo 1986 3 4 adjustment of mean and standard deviation for sample size in general the frequency distribution of extreme rainfall is skewed towards right and hence there is always a greater chance of getting a large extreme event than a smaller extreme with the increase in the length of record wmo 2009 as a result of that the mean and standard deviation of the annual maximum series tend to increase with the length of record hence hershfield 1961 proposed another set of adjustment factors for mean maf2 and standard deviation saf2 for different sample sizes in our study we have evaluated the adjusted values of mean and standard deviation after incorporating these both sets of adjustment factors 3 x n x n m a f 1 m a f 2 4 s n s n s a f 1 s a f 2 where x n and s n are the original mean and standard deviation of the annual maximum time series respectively n is the number of years of data x n and s n are the adjusted mean and standard deviation of data series respectively 3 5 basic equations in hershfield method hershfield 1961 proposed the basic equation for estimation of pmp based on the general frequency equation suggested by chow 1951 as follows 5 x pmp x n k s n where x pmp is the pmp estimate for the station x n is the adjusted mean of the annual maximum series of rainfall data for n years at that station s n is the adjusted standard deviation of the annual maximum series of rainfall data at that station k is the frequency factor for estimating pmp at that station which can be determined from the following equation proposed by hershfield 1961 6 k x m x n 1 s n 1 where x m is the maximum value in annual maximum series of rainfall data at the station x n 1 and s n 1 are the mean and standard deviation of the annual maximum series of rainfall data respectively for n 1 years after removing the year with the maximum value 3 6 development of upper envelop curve of frequency factor judicious estimation of frequency factor k plays a key role in proper estimation of pmp a very high value of k will lead to over estimation of pmp and consequently an uneconomical design on the other hand a lower value of k will lead to under estimation of pmp and any structure designed based on that pmp estimate will be exposed to higher risk so the factor k has to be determined appropriately such that the design based on it have a proper balance of economy and allowable risk for this purpose the upper envelope curve of k is used as proposed by hershfield 1965 from the simple scatter plot between k and x n for 2700 stations 90 in the usa across the globe hershfield 1965 found a general negative trend in the plot i e as x n increases k decreases depending on that one exponential function of k is developed for different duration of rainfall as its upper envelope curve as given below 7 k k a e a x n as per the eq 7 the envelope curve starts at some point ka in the k axis for x n 0 and exponentially decreases and becomes asymptotic towards the higher values of x n hershfield 1965 used 20 as the value of ka after analysing data from 2700 different locations as mentioned earlier but this value may vary for different study areas the slope of the exponentially decreasing curve depends on the factor a which is again a function of study area and duration of the rainfall however in this technique it is noticed that unusually high values may be assigned to the points with lower mean due to the steep nature of the exponential curve towards the left end a typical example of scatter plot is shown in fig 2 where some points on the possible upper envelop are selected shown by orange diamond dots and an exponential curve blue dashed line is fitted to those points this blue dashed exponential curve indicates the envelope curve following hershfield 1965 though the maximum value of k say km is 11 5 here the envelope curve meets the k axis around 19 and thus provides excessive weightage more than the maximum value of k in the study area to the points with lower mean amdp magnitude this may not be a realistic reflection of the data points and thus leading to overestimation of pmp in those low precipitation extreme region hence a modified technique of enveloping is introduced in this study ensuring that no grid point gets assigned with k k m within the study area in this modified enveloping technique instead of a single envelope curve as in the existing hershfield method a composite envelope curve is proposed comprising of a straight line parallel to x axis part and an exponentially decay curve same as the blue dashed line thus the revised envelope curve not only encapsulates all the observed frequency factors but also unusually high values are avoided for the low rainfall regions a typical example of such modified envelope curve is shown as the red line in fig 2 from which it can be seen that the straight line portion and the exponential curve intersects at mean amdp x n x n t t refers to transition point and frequency factor k km where x n t denotes the mean amdp at transition point and km is the highest value of k thus the revised curve is defined by eq 8 as follows 8 k k m 0 x n x n t k m e b x n x n t x n x n t in this revised envelope curve also a factor b is there which determines the slope of the exponentially decreasing portion and is a function of the duration of interest and the study area referring to fig 2 the revised envelope curve consists of a straight line k k m 11 5 here for the mean amdp zero to x n t 153 mm here and an exponentially decaying curve for mean amdp higher than 153 mm finally using the new values of frequency factor from the envelope curve pmp at any location can be estimated using eq 5 3 7 determination of change in pmp over time in order to identify the impact of global shift in climate regime in the 1970s on pmp the pmp map for post 1970 is compared with that of pre 1970 in terms of percentage difference likewise to capture the change in future pmp estimates over time pmp maps developed for three future time spans for three models and two scenarios are compared with the recent past i e post 1970 pmp values at each grid point plotting this percentage change in pmp will provide the spatial distribution of this change throughout india however due to mismatch in the data resolution between observed here 0 25 x0 25 and future 0 5 x0 5 or 0 44 x0 44 period observed data is re gridded by inverse distance weightage idw method to match the corresponding future data for calculating the percentage change in pmp in future with respect to recent past iwd method is a widely used interpolation technique in hydro meteorological studies tang et al 1996 xia et al 1999 de silva et al 2007 chen and liu 2012 which determines the value of a variable at a target location through a linear combination of the values at four surrounding grid intersections by assigning weights inversely proportional to the distance from the target location to the grid intersections 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of bias correction before applying any bias correction technique a comparative study has been conducted between the observed and model simulated from m1 m2 and m3 precipitation series over a common historical period 1961 2005 the results reveal the presence of significant bias in the mean and standard deviation of the extreme values i e amdp here of model simulated precipitation series with respect to that of observed the mean values of amdp from observed records and outputs from three different models are shown in first two panels of fig 3 a and b respectively inter model spatial variations are notable and the existence of bias in the model simulated from m1 m2 and m3 precipitation values is shown in panel d of fig 3 it shows that the model m1 possesses a considerable amount of negative bias i e simulated values are higher than observed in mean amdp along the central belt of india whereas the models m2 and m3 have huge positive bias i e observed values are higher than simulated in the western and some parts of north east india apart from mean standard deviation of amdp series are also compared fig 4 similar observations are made from fig 4 as well which illustrates the difference in the standard deviation between observed and simulated amdp series all over india across the models as discussed in section 3 1 a recently developed copula based bias correction technique maity et al 2019 is used to remove this bias present in the extreme values bias corrected results in terms of mean and standard deviation of amdp 1961 2005 are presented in panel c of figs 3 and 4 respectively the plots showing the residual bias are also presented in panel e of figs 3 and 4 the residual bias is approximately near zero throughout the indian mainland comparing the figures in panel e with those in panel d it is noticed that the bias correction method adopted in this study has effectively debiased the model simulated precipitation in terms of both mean and standard deviation of the amdp series using the same bias correction technique future simulated daily precipitation series are also bias corrected 4 2 mann kendall rank statistic test for detection of trend tables 2a and 2b show the results of the mann kendall test for observed and future simulated amdp series respectively at two levels of significance i e 5 and 1 these results depict that most part of india is not showing any significant trend in amdp series and hence this time series can safely be considered as homogeneous for entire india in subsequent calculations 4 3 determination of frequency factor and its envelope curve using eq 6 frequency factor k is determined for each grid point throughout india for different time spans and models scatter plot of k against mean annual maximum daily rainfall x n for two parts of observed data is shown in fig 5a and the same is shown for three parts of future data for m2 following rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 in fig 5b for brevity results for m1 and m3 are not shown by figure from these scatter plots a general trend of decreasing k with increasing x n is observed moreover it is noticed that the k values are highly skewed towards its lower side in other words the k value falls within a small range of 2 10 for most of the grid points these observations match with the findings of other investigators desa and rakhecha 2007 rakhecha et al 1992 kim and lee 2016 hershfield 1965 for each scatter plot the upper envelope curve for k is developed by applying our proposed technique and eq 8 as discussed in section 3 6 shown by red line in figs 5a and 5b the envelope curves clearly have two different parts as discussed earlier one straight line parallel to x axis with the maximum value of k km and one exponentially decaying curve in order to get the exponential curve some top points from the scatter plot were selected and have been marked by orange diamond markers in the scatter plots however in some cases very few grid points exist with unusually high values of k as compared to the other points in the study area for example in case of post 1970 period few grid points 4 or 5 out of 4951 exist in west central part of india that have very high k values in range of 21 24 whereas k values mostly lie below 16 for other grid points fig 5a now developing the envelope curve considering those unusually high values of k will definitely lead to over estimation of pmp for remaining and most part of india hence those few points are excluded while developing the upper envelope curve however while estimating pmp for those points we have used their actual k values not the one obtained from the envelope curve keeping this in mind the envelope curves for different future time spans across three different models are also prepared the equation of the exponential portion of the envelope curve is shown in the inset of these figures figs 5a and 5b using these envelope curves eq 8 frequency factor at each grid point is re estimated depending on the mean annual maximum daily rainfall x n at that grid point 4 4 development of pmp map using historical data using the adjusted mean and standard deviation of amdp series and the re estimated frequency factor in eq 5 pmp is determined for each grid point in india the spatial distribution of mean and standard deviation of amdp frequency factor and estimated pmp are shown in fig 6 for two parts of observed data viz pre 1970 and post 1970 from the maps of mean and standard deviation in general higher values are observed along the western ghats some parts of north east and east central india comparatively lower values of mean and standard deviation are observed in the rajasthan region peninsular india and kashmir portion these basic observations match with the regular spatial variation of indian rainfall finally the estimated pmp maps for both pre 1970 and post 1970 are provided in the last column in fig 6 it is observed that the pmp is varying from a minimum value of 179 mm to the highest value of 1088 mm for the pre 1970 period whereas for the post 1970 period estimated values of pmp is ranging between 363 mm and 1826 mm iitm 1989 published a pmp atlas for india containing generalized charts of pmp estimates ranging from 300 mm to 1100 mm which is comparable with the pre 1970 period in the present study rakhecha and clark 1999 also developed one pmp map for india based on maximisation and transposition of storm using previous 100 years data with respect to the year of analysis which shows a pmp range of 600 mm to 1700 mm so the pmp estimates obtained in this study are mostly comparable with those results at least in terms of range which validates the applicability of hershfield method and our proposed enveloping technique however the post 1970 pmp estimates are substantially higher compared to the pre 1970 estimates as a possible consequence of climate change and global climatic shift in the 1970s to further investigate the extent of increase and its possible cause the percentage difference of mean and standard deviation of amdp series and the estimated pmp values in post 1970 is calculated with respect to pre 1970 at each grid point and shown in fig 7 a 7b and 7c respectively some basic observations from this fig 7 are given in quantitative terms in tables 3a and 3b from fig 7 and table 3 it is noticed that almost 84 area cyan to purple portion in fig 7c in india shows an increasing trend in pmp the range of change in pmp varies from 47 38 to 318 11 however averaged over entire india the percentage increase in pmp is 35 40 some parts of gujarat rajasthan and meghalaya are also showing significant amount of increase in pmp interestingly extreme north east portion of india in and around arunachal pradesh shows maximum amount of reduction in pmp 47 apart from that portion a few other locations around 16 across the country exhibit a decreasing trend in pmp brown to yellow patches in fig 7c the reason behind the overall increase in pmp is the general trend of increase in the mean and standard deviation of amdp throughout india which is also visually evident from fig 6 moreover compared to mean the standard deviation is showing a higher range in percentage increase as shown in table 3a on average the increase in standard deviation is about 25 whereas the average increase in mean is only about 9 also more grid points 67 59 are showing an increase in standard deviation as compared to mean 61 85 evident from fig 7a and 7b this indicates that not only the average amdp is increasing but also its variability standard deviation is increasing at a higher rate as a consequence there is a change in frequency factor which is visually evident from fig 5a which shows how considerably the scatter points k vs x n have changed during post 1970 with respect to the same during pre 1970 the range of k has increased the scatter plot has become more skewed resulting in a steeper envelope curve for k during post 1970 therefore an overall increase in pmp is noticed which can be considered as a significant impact of global climatic shift in the 1970s and hence of climate change kunkel et al 2013 lee et al 2016 chen et al 2017 rastogi et al 2017 pmp is observed to increase approximately by 35 in past few decades post 1970 as compared to pre 1970 such a level of increase can be highly detrimental for the structures designed against a stationary estimate of pmp 4 5 pmp map using future data and comparison with recent past the pmp maps for entire india is developed using three future projected rcm m1 m2 and m3 data following two scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 and for three future time periods viz near future 2011 2040 future 2041 2070 and far future 2071 2100 figs 8a and 8b show the future pmp maps developed in this study following rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively unlike the previous case of observed data the spatial distribution of mean and standard deviation of amdp series for future periods are not shown here for brevity from these figures gradual increase in pmp magnitude with the passage of time for all three models is clearly visible moreover the pmp estimates are higher in the rcp 8 5 scenario as compared to the rcp 4 5 case being the worst climatic projection such observations under rcp 8 5 are quite reasonable however in order to visually compare these future pmp maps with recent past the pmp map for post 1970 is reproduced in fig 9 in the same colour scale as of these future maps comparing these maps from the future periods with that of the recent past an overall increase in pmp estimates is clearly noticed throughout the country though the spatial distribution of future pmp varies between models a substantial increase of pmp in west central india and parts of north west india is common similarly reduction in pmp estimates in the eastern and southern parts of india is also a common observation across m2 and m3 the m1 model also shows some decreasing trend of pmp in the central portion of india though the reducing trend gradually vanishes towards the end of this century in general the change in pmp is captured by all three models in the future all over india keeping few observations of decreasing trend aside on overall increase in pmp in most parts of india across the models is the key observation from these two figures i e figs 8a and 8b similar to observed data in order to investigate further some quantitative study on percentage difference in mean standard deviation and pmp between different future time periods and post 1970 period is performed in order to do so the pmp map developed for the post 1970 period with resolution 0 25 x 0 25 is transformed to a lower resolution of 0 5 0 5 for m1 and 0 44 0 44 for m2 and m3 by idw method as discussed in section 3 7 the results of the comparative study for pmp are shown in figs 10a and 10b percentage difference in mean and standard deviation are not shown as figure for brevity in the form of spatial distribution throughout india on the other hand table 4 shows quantitative output of this analysis i e average percentage increase of pmp and percentage of grid points showing this increment in india different models show different levels of increase in pmp magnitude towards the end of this century in near future period this overall percentage of increase in pmp varies approximately between 7 and 16 and in future period it ranges between 12 and 24 across different models and scenarios towards the end of this century i e in far future period the increment in pmp varies approximately between 20 and 28 and 29 35 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenario respectively across three models additionally under both scenarios around 70 80 area of india shows this increasing trend across different models in far future period overall a continuous increase in pmp with time is evident from the table 4 for each model all these observations clearly indicate towards a continuous temporal change of pmp throughout india for the rest of the present century reasonably similar extent of increase in pmp was also reported by rastogi et al 2017 where they observed around 20 increase in pmp in the 2021 2050 time period and 44 in the 2071 2100 time periods with respect to 1981 2010 baseline values in the south eastern united states likewise for pacific northwest pnw region in the usa chen et al 2017 observed an increase in pmp by about 50 30 around 2099 relative to the 2016 level following rcp 8 5 in different other parts of the world also similar extent of increase in pmp have been reported in many studies e g lee et al 2016 projected around 30 increase under rcp 8 5 scenario in south korea afrooz et al 2015 estimated pmp to increase up to 18 2 and 27 3 in southern iran across different gcms toward the end of the century w r t 1971 2000 base period hence though unavailability of study on future changes in pmp in india limits us to compare our results to that reasonably similar results from different other portions of the world support us to infer that similar to different parts of the world pmp is also expected to increase in future at a significant rate in india table 4 also shows the average percentage increase and percentage of area showing that increase for mean and standard deviation along with pmp observing the numbers reported there the gradual increase in mean and standard deviation with time can be identified also their spatial extent of increase increases with time in general we observe around 15 to 33 increase in mean in far future period under the rcp 4 5 scenario across the models whereas the same for standard deviation is around 20 to 37 specifically we observe higher extent of increase in standard deviation in most of the cases as compared to mean so similar to the observed data set it can also be inferred here that not only the mean amdp but their variability is also increasing sometimes even in a faster rate which is eventually causing a substantial increase in pmp throughout india in future in a nutshell comparative study between different pmp maps developed from future simulated and observed precipitation we can summarise that pmp estimates throughout india are showing substantial change with time pmp was increasing in the last century and it will continue to increase over the future period too with almost similar rate though the projection of spatial variation and extent is different all the models considered in this study depicts similar results this can be considered as a possible consequence of changing climate which is intensifying the global hydrological cycle and altering the regular spatio temporal variation of precipitation all over india krishnamurthy et al 2009 mishra and liu 2014 loo et al 2015 as a result of that extreme rainfalls of high intensity are expected to occur in most parts of the country causing an overall increase in mean and std dev in amdp series ali and mishra 2017 mukherjee et al 2018 which in turn is resulting in such an extent of increase in pmp 5 conclusions in this study the likely spatio temporal change mostly increase in pmp under changing climate is established across indian mainland using observed records and model simulated precipitation values 1 day pmp maps for two different time periods from the past and three time periods from the future period are developed and compared future simulated precipitation values are the simulations outputs from three different gcm rcm combinations to construct the future pmp maps under two rcp scenarios these maps especially the maps based on recent observations and future data are expected to be highly informative for the hydrologists and policy makers following specific conclusions are drawn from the study by comparing two pmp maps for historical periods an increasing trend of pmp with an average increase of around 35 in magnitude is noticed during the post 1970 period as compared to the pre 1970 period it is true for the most part of india 84 of the total area this indicates a serious and significant impact of shift in global climate regime in the 1970s on pmp in india similar to the historical period the increasing trends persist in the future also all three models considered in this study show an agreement on this observation all models show an overall increasing trend of pmp but of different extent and spatial variation in general approximately 29 to 35 and 20 to 28 increase in pmp is observed in the far future period compared to the recent past under rcp 8 5 and rcp 4 5 scenario respectively also around 70 80 area of india shows this increasing trend across different models this indicates that the increasing trend of pmp throughout india in the past will continue almost at a similar rate in the upcoming future period further analysis indicates that compared to mean amdp the standard deviation of amdp is increasing with a similar or even faster rate over time and eventually resulting in the increase in the estimates of pmp with time apart from this the change in frequency factor its range and corresponding changes in the envelope curve also results in an increase in pmp finally the temporal change of pmp in india must be considered in the planning designing and future risk assessment of any major high risk water resources infrastructure any design based on the stationary estimate of pmp is susceptible to be exposed to higher risk with the passage of time hence the long term decision making strategies should be updated according to the future projected pmp maps the developed pmp maps for entire indian mainland based on this study are available at mendeley data repository url https doi org 10 17632
