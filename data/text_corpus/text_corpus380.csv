1900,a multisite method of fragments based rainfall temporal daily to hourly disaggregation procedure conditioned on circulation pattern cp classification is developed and applied to the german part of the rhine river basin the performance of the cp based disaggregation in representing key rainfall characteristics is evaluated and the influence of different number of cp classes is investigated compared with the standard monthly based method of fragments disaggregation the cp based procedure including a seasonal stratification improves the disaggregation quality in hourly rainfall extremes although it shows no improvement in reproducing standard rainfall statistics such as mean and standard deviation cp classifications with more classes tend to perform better in representing hourly rainfall statistics in the rhine basin the developed procedure opens up the possibility to consider dynamic changes in the atmosphere such as changes in the frequency persistence and seasonality of circulation patterns that may be associated with climate change keywords rainfall temporal disaggregation multisite model method of fragments circulation pattern classification rainfall extremes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a wide range of applications involving planning design and management of water resources systems at small spatial scales relies on rainfall data with high temporal for instance hourly resolution breinl and di baldassarre 2019 pui et al 2012 however high resolution rainfall measurements are generally scarce gutierrez magness and mccuen 2004 especially for rural and remote regions the precipitation gauging network operated by the german weather service dwd for example includes roughly 5 700 stations with daily rainfall observation history spanning back more than 100 years compared to this only about 1 200 stations record rainfall at subdaily resolution and an even smaller number has publicly available data covering more than 30 years lisniak et al 2013 one way to overcome this shortcoming is to derive fine resolution data from the widely available coarser resolution e g daily data through data transformation procedures generally referred to as rainfall disaggregation gutierrez magness and mccuen 2004 koutsoyiannis and onof 2001 sharma and srikanthan 2006 temporal disaggregation is often used for scenario based hydrological simulations when combined with regional weather generators mezghani and hingray 2009 winter et al 2019 for instance winter et al 2019 estimated 100 year design floods in 16 catchments in vorarlberg austria with a continuous hydrologic modelling approach with hourly resolution driven by a multi site weather generator providing daily precipitation and air temperature in combination with a temporal disaggregation procedure numerous disaggregation models have been proposed in the literature based on diverse concepts these include 1 bartlett lewis neyman scott rectangular pulse models based on point process theory khaliq and cunnane 1996 lu and qin 2014 pui et al 2012 2 random cascade models based on scale invariance theory anis and rode 2015 müller and haberlandt 2018 and 3 the nonparametric method of fragments mof inspired from analog principle carreau et al 2019 li et al 2018 lu et al 2015 sharma and srikanthan 2006 westra et al 2012 pui et al 2012 compared these temporal rainfall disaggregation models at single sites and found that the nonparametric mof outperformed the point process based and cascade models in matching the observed hourly intensity frequency relationship in particular for extreme rainfall characteristics mof achieves temporal disaggregation by employing the subdaily distribution of analog days also known as fragments to distribute daily precipitation totals into subdaily intervals in the daily to hourly disaggregation procedure the fragments are the rainfall amounts or fractions of the daily rainfall amount of the 24 h of one day sharma and srikanthan 2006 analog days are defined as days that are similar in terms of a number of features carreau et al 2019 often the only feature used to determine analog days is the daily rainfall total at a given location sharma and srikanthan 2006 westra et al 2012 recently modifications were introduced to mof to improve the model s ability in reproducing the hourly rainfall these modifications include the consideration of the wet dry state of the days preceding and following the target day breinl and di baldassarre 2019 westra et al 2012 other climate variables like temperature relative humidity and air pressure rafatnejad et al 2021 spatial information such as inter site correlation or neighboring information carreau et al 2019 müller and haberlandt 2018 and the category of daily rainfall amount classified in 5 mm bins li et al 2018 the features introduced in these modifications to better filter the analog days are generally daily variables hence it is implicitly assumed that these daily features allow to condition the precipitation distribution on the subdaily scale carreau et al 2019 the basic assumption of the mof rainfall temporal disaggregation is stationarity i e that the daily subdaily rainfall relationship from the analog period remains unchanged in the period for which the disaggregation is performed this assumption is particularly questionable when the disaggregation is performed for future climate change projections in order to account for dynamic changes in the atmosphere circulation patterns cps can be used to condition the selection of analog days for mof cps describe the atmospheric circulation at any given moment in time and cp classifications are applied to simplify the physical reality by identifying a small number of representative patterns to which the instantaneous patterns are assigned huth et al 2008 one of the goals of cp classification is to improve the description of effects the atmospheric circulation has on surface climate like precipitation formation huth et al 2016 conditioning the rainfall temporal disaggregation on cps allows to consider climate change effects related to changes in frequency persistence and seasonality of these weather patterns on the link between daily and hourly rainfall distributions however possible within type changes in particular due to increasing temperature and super clausius clapeyron scaling may strongly determine the link between daily and hourly rainfall distributions lenderink et al 2017 if such changes occur they will not be represented by a cp based disaggregation besides the capability to consider climatic changes at least to some extent a cp based disaggregation may also be preferable as different cps may be associated with different precipitation types e g large scale long lasting events vs small scale short duration events which may have different subdaily distributions kronenberg et al 2012 lisniak et al 2013 hence we hypothesize that mof conditioned on cps can better represent the rainfall generation mechanisms and provides a more robust link between daily and subdaily rainfall in the context of climate change than a standard mof procedure in this study we develop a rainfall temporal daily to hourly disaggregation procedure by conditioning the method of fragments on circulation patterns for multisite applications the performance of this cp based disaggregation procedure is evaluated against the standard mof procedure in the rhine river basin the sensitivity of the mof to the number of cps and seasonal stratification is further analyzed and discussed 2 research area and data 2 1 research area the rhine river basin with a drainage area of about 185 000 km2 is situated in northwestern europe covering 9 countries fig 1 with a length of about 1 320 km it flows from the swiss alps through middle mountain ranges and lowlands and drains into the north sea in the netherlands see ullrich et al 2021 for a detailed description the rhine river and its tributaries are often affected by flooding caused by persistent precipitation heavy rainfall or snowmelt in july 2021 a record breaking flood hit west germany belgium luxembourg and the netherlands and in particular the left side rhine tributaries ahr erft and ruhr causing more than 200 fatalities and tremendous socio economic impacts mohr et al 2022 hydrological analysis of such floods in small scale catchments require hourly precipitation time series which are rarely available long term precipitation series are often available at daily time scale and need to be disaggregated we select the rainfall gauges located in the german part of the rhine basin to develop the rainfall disaggregation model and to compare it to existing methods given the availability and accessibility of hourly rainfall data in this region 2 2 hourly precipitation observations the hourly rainfall observations are collected from the climate data center of the german weather service dwd https www dwd de last access 26th of february 2022 these observations are quality controlled measurements from dwd stations and legally and qualitatively equivalent partner stations there are in total 1 038 stations across germany most of which provide hourly rainfall observations since 2000 134 rainfall stations located in the german part of the rhine basin are selected with at least 15 years 2006 2020 of hourly rainfall records and with no more than 2 missing data in each year fig 1 2 3 circulation patterns we classify circulation patterns using daily values of the mean sea level pressure field of the era5 data set for the period from january 1979 to july 2021 era5 is the fifth generation ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate hersbach et al 2020 we smoothed the original era5 data by interpolating it to a regular 1 x 1 grid the classification is conducted using the objective classification algorithm sandra simulated annealing and diversified randomization philipp et al 2007 it is based on k means and minimizes the within cluster variance of the euclidian distance between the cluster elements and the cluster centroid the problem of a conventional k means approach is that it often converges to a local optimum sandra avoids this problem and searches for the global optimum by introducing random reassignments of cluster elements the number of classes in cp classification affects its ability to stratify the surface climate variable of interest huth et al 2016 vallorani et al 2018 therefore 5 different numbers of cp classes 4 5 6 7 and 8 are generated and the sensitivity of the disaggregation performance to the number of classes is examined 3 methods 3 1 multisite rainfall disaggregation with method of fragments the method of fragments mof is a non parametric disaggregation technique the idea is to resample a vector of fragments that represents the relative distribution of subdaily to daily rainfall pui et al 2012 the number of fragments corresponds to the subdaily temporal resolution used i e if the disaggregation is conducted from daily to hourly resolution the relative distribution of subdaily values consists of 24 relative weights that sum up to 1 in the simulation variability is introduced by a k nearest neighbor algorithm the proposed non parametric multisite mof model works as follows i obtain the daily rainfall vector r t 1 r t 2 r t n to be disaggregated where t represents the date of the day and n denotes the number of rainfall sites in the observation network r t s s indicates individual rainfall site with the value ranging from 1 to n can be obtained from the observed daily rainfall or from other sources such as daily weather generators nguyen et al 2021 winter et al 2019 and general circulation models gcms rafatnejad et al 2021 ii use the observational hourly records r i m s to build daily time vectors r i s where i denotes the day m is the hourly time step and s is a site of the rainfall observation network 1 r i s m 1 24 r i m s form a time series of vectors with hourly to daily ratios which are so called fragments 2 f i m s r i m s r i s iii to consider the seasonal variability the standard mof based disaggregation procedure builds a window with l days around the target day t from which to sample the fragments vectors westra et al 2012 pui et al 2012 for example if t represents the 15th of april and l 14 all days between the first 1st and last 29th day of april from all available years are considered for disaggregation this standard disaggregation procedure usually with a time window width l 14 is further called monthly based disaggregation procedure in this study the mof conditioned on circulation patterns is proposed and termed cp based disaggregation procedure to this end the days with the same cp class as the target day t are selected into the candidate pool for fragments sampling instead of imposing a monthly window additionally circulation patterns and candidate days are stratified into winter november 1st april 30th and summer may 1st october 30th seasons iv filter the candidate pool obtained in step iii based on the wet rainy dry non rainy status of the target day only days with the same wet dry status as the target day t will be selected to obtain possible nearest neighbors here n denotes the number of possible neighbors v before calculating the distance between target day and candidate day the daily rainfall amounts are standardized which is a preferable operation for positively skewed random variables such as rainfall breinl and di baldassarre 2019 in this study the manhattan distance the sum of absolute differences is used as a measure to quantify the similarity of multisite daily rainfall vectors between target day t and candidate day i the manhattan distance has been shown to work well with nearest neighbor algorithms for rainfall disaggregation breinl and di baldassarre 2019 breinl et al 2017 the distance d r t r i is calculated as 3 d r t r i s 1 n r t s r i s vi identify the k nearest neighbors with k n the distances are sorted for all j 1 2 k and the highest probability is assigned to the neighbor with the smallest distance to the target day the probability p j is computed as 4 p j 1 j p t p t j 1 k 1 j vii sample a candidate day by applying the inverse cumulative distribution function of eq 4 and using random numbers between 0 and 1 sampled from a uniform distribution the date of the sampled day is used and the corresponding hourly fragments f i m s are applied at each site in the disaggregation the hourly time series r i m s of the target day t are then derived using daily rainfall series r t s as 5 r t m s r t s f i m s viii repeat step i to step vii for each day t until the entire daily records are disaggregated 3 2 experimental setup to evaluate the cp based disaggregation procedure developed in this study and to investigate its sensitivity towards the number of cp classes and towards the consideration of seasonality three disaggregation experiments are performed table 1 to make full use of the limited hourly observations we perform a leave one out cross validation each single year of the hourly observations is selected and aggregated to the daily scale to be subsequently disaggregated using the remaining 14 years the original hourly data for each year is then used to test the performance of the disaggregation procedure in the different experiments a total of 30 monte carlo mc runs given the computational constraint with the same length 15 years as the observed precipitation records are generated to explore the sampling variability of the nearest neighbor candidate date 3 3 performance evaluation the performance evaluation of the different rainfall disaggregation experiments employs the following indicators as suggested by previous studies breinl and di baldassarre 2019 li et al 2018 pui et al 2012 the performance in reconstructing standard rainfall statistics includes mean value standard deviation fraction of wet rainy hours and lag 1 autocorrelation the mean wet dry spell length is selected to reflect the model performance in simulating the wet and dry features in the rainfall temporal disaggregation the skill in maintaining the spatial correlation structure is indicated by inter site pearson correlation coefficients finally the performance of the disaggregation procedures to meet the extreme percentiles 95th 97th 99th and 99 5th of hourly rainfall is evaluated the metrics for disaggregated precipitation relate to the median of the 30 mc runs and are compared against the indicators of the original records 4 results 4 1 standard metrics according to the different experiments table 1 the simulated hourly rainfall series at the 134 rainfall stations in the german part of rhine river basin are compared with the observed counterparts and the statistical metrics reflecting the disaggregation performance in reproducing key hourly rainfall characteristics are calculated fig 2 summarizes the model performance with regard to mean value standard deviation std lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient lag1auto and fraction of wet hours all disaggregation models tend to underestimate the mean hourly rainfall values which results from the overestimation of the number of wet hours in disaggregation procedures as the same daily precipitation totals are distributed to more wet shares the monthly based mof shows a slightly better performance in reproducing the mean value than the cp based procedures but the difference in mean value between monthly based and cp based approaches with seasonal stratification and high number of classes like sw cla8 is not large all model variants perform well with respect to standard deviation lag 1 autocorrelation is underestimated by the monthly based mof and overestimated by the cp based mof whereas the seasonally stratified cp based procedure performs best generally the seasonally stratified cp based procedure outperforms the one without stratification for all four indicators with increasing number of cp classes the performance improves all disaggregation procedures consistently underestimate the dry spell duration compared to observations fig 2 the mean length of the simulated dry spells is approximately 20 h compared to the observed 23 h such underestimation is also demonstrated in fig 3 b and d and the difference among different disaggregation experiments is nearly indistinguishable in terms of mean length of wet spells the cp based models perform better than monthly based procedure especially for longer wet spells see fig 3a and c which is largely underestimated by the monthly based disaggregation procedure we suggest that cp based disaggregation pools days with long and short duration wet spells which may correspond to frontal and convective rainfall respectively in a better way than monthly based disaggregation the discontinuity of rainfall events between days could play a role as well as the disaggregation procedure does not consider the wet dry status in the preceding and following days of the target day 4 2 spatial correlation the pair wise inter site pearson correlation coefficients of hourly rainfall series are given in fig 4 to assess the spatial connections of precipitation across station locations the deviations between simulated and observed correlation coefficients versus inter site distance are given in fig 5 all disaggregation procedures reproduce the spatial correlation well with most absolute deviations between simulated and observed coefficients lower than 0 1 the monthly based mof performs best in terms of spatial correlation the cp based disaggregation procedure without seasonal stratification tends to slightly overestimate the inter site correlations whereas considering the seasonality fig 5 clearly reduces the bias the number of cps does not affect the performance for this characteristic 4 3 precipitation extremes to examine the disaggregation performance in reproducing the hourly rainfall extremes several high percentiles are calculated and compared with observations fig 6 in addition the cumulative distribution functions for the example station nürburg barweiler are given in fig 7 for less extreme precipitation 95th percentile the monthly based mof outperforms the cp based disaggregation for more extreme precipitation 97th 99th 99 5th percentiles however the monthly based procedure overestimates the cp based without seasonal stratification underestimates and the cp based with seasonal stratification largely matches the observed percentiles this is also demonstrated in fig 7 for the example rainfall station that the probability curves from 30 runs of sw cla8 disaggregation can better envelope the observation one black dashed line the number of cp classes does not play a strong role though the classification with four classes performs worst 5 discussion in this study we demonstrate that the temporal rainfall disaggregation based on mof is improved in reproducing hourly rainfall extremes when conditioned on circulation patterns along with seasonal winter summer stratification we assume that the additional information injected by cps and seasonality better describes precipitation formation mechanisms and hence the link between daily sums and hourly precipitation distributions additionally the number of cp classes also plays a role models with more cp classes and seasonality considered perform better in rainfall temporal disaggregation and the sw cla8 disaggregation procedure shows the best performance in extreme hourly rainfall simulation fig 6 and fig 7 it is expected that increasing the number of classes in cp stratification improves the performance in explaining the rainfall variability as shown in beck and philipp 2010 and huth et al 2008 and further improves the performance of the disaggregation model however increasing the number of cp classes is computationally more demanding and also each class becomes less populated since the length of time series is limited which will inevitably introduce more uncertainty in candidate days sampling another concern is related to the underestimation of hourly rainfall mean values in all disaggregation experiments which results from the overestimation of fraction of wet hours in the fragments sampling procedure although monthly based standard mof shows lower underestimation fig 2 the difference between monthly based model and cp based approach with seasonal stratification and high number of cp classes like sw cla8 is rather small apparently all models underestimate precipitation in the range between 50th and 95th percentiles fig 7 cp based models perform similarly to the monthly based approach however for higher percentiles above 95th the monthly based approach strongly overestimates precipitation compared to the cp based one fig 6 hence the monthly based approach compensates the underestimation for lower percentiles with overestimation for higher percentiles resulting in a better mean we thus consider the cp based approach to be better particularly with regards to disaggregation of extreme precipitation which plays an important role in many practical applications in water management such as flood design estimation and risk analysis the major limitation of the cp based disaggregation is the stationarity assumption of the link between daily sums and subdaily distributions in each cp class this assumption is challenged by the thermodynamic changes in the atmosphere in particular increasing water vapor with increasing air temperature lenderink et al 2017 the cps in this study are classified by using only daily mean sea level pressure and seasonality summer winter which does not account for this thermodynamic effect westra et al 2013 examined the daily to subdaily disaggregation performance of mof conditioned on a range of atmospheric covariates such as air temperature and relative humidity where the atmospheric covariates with the greatest influence on the sub daily rainfall temporal pattern were identified by fitting a generalized additive model gam they found that the temporal distribution of subdaily rainfall is sensitive to changes in atmospheric temperature the maximum intensity of short duration rainfall increased by 4 1 13 4 per degree change in air temperature for the maximum 6 min burst and by 3 1 6 8 for the maximum 1 h burst rafatnejad et al 2021 evaluated climate change impacts on extreme subdaily rainfall amounts by using mof with inclusion of air temperature and other weather variables as influential factors where the distances between target and candidate days were weighted by the correlation coefficients between conditional variables and rainfall series their results indicated an increase in the extremes for instance in the mean and standard deviation of the 95th percentile therefore one approach to further improve the cp based rainfall temporal disaggregation model in reproducing subdaily rainfall extremes is to include additional conditional variables in particular air temperature into the cp classification which is expected to represent the thermodynamic effect of climate warming on the link between daily rainfall totals and subdaily distributions on the contrary breinl and di baldassarre 2019 used both precipitation and air temperature in a single matrix to compute the distances between the target day and candidate days and this approach delivered poorer performance with regards to subdaily rainfall extremes and inter site correlation so the question remains how to optimally incorporate additional weather variables to circulation patterns into the mof disaggregation procedure and can be addressed in future research 6 conclusions in this research a multisite method of fragments based rainfall temporal disaggregation model conditioned on circulation pattern cp classification is developed and applied for the german part of the rhine river basin its performance in simulating standard rainfall statistics spatial correlation wet and dry spells features and extremes is examined and compared with the standard disaggregation procedure monthly based the cp based disaggregation shows good performance in representing standard rainfall statistics including standard deviation lag 1 autocorrelation and fraction of wet hours although the monthly based method of fragments disaggregation performs slightly better with regard to mean both disaggregation procedures underestimate the mean duration of dry spells while the cp based models outperform monthly based one in wet spell length estimation the spatial correlation structure in terms of the inter site correlation coefficients is well maintained by both procedures the cp based rainfall disaggregation procedure significantly improves the simulation of rainfall extremes especially for high percentiles the performance gain may be explained by the improvement of cp classification in stratifying extreme rainfall features it could be shown that model performance increases with the number of cp classes this comes however at the costs of higher computational demands and higher uncertainty the superior performance for rainfall extremes is a valuable improvement for many practical applications in water management such as flood design estimation and risk analysis in addition the cp based approach opens up the possibility of including climate change effects in generating subdaily rainfall series credit authorship contribution statement xiaoxiang guan conceptualization methodology data curation software

disaggregation procedure usually with a time window width l 14 is further called monthly based disaggregation procedure in this study the mof conditioned on circulation patterns is proposed and termed cp based disaggregation procedure to this end the days with the same cp class as the target day t are selected into the candidate pool for fragments sampling instead of imposing a monthly window additionally circulation patterns and candidate days are stratified into winter november 1st april 30th and summer may 1st october 30th seasons iv filter the candidate pool obtained in step iii based on the wet rainy dry non rainy status of the target day only days with the same wet dry status as the target day t will be selected to obtain possible nearest neighbors here n denotes the number of possible neighbors v before calculating the distance between target day and candidate day the daily rainfall amounts are standardized which is a preferable operation for positively skewed random variables such as rainfall breinl and di baldassarre 2019 in this study the manhattan distance the sum of absolute differences is used as a measure to quantify the similarity of multisite daily rainfall vectors between target day t and candidate day i the manhattan distance has been shown to work well with nearest neighbor algorithms for rainfall disaggregation breinl and di baldassarre 2019 breinl et al 2017 the distance d r t r i is calculated as 3 d r t r i s 1 n r t s r i s vi identify the k nearest neighbors with k n the distances are sorted for all j 1 2 k and the highest probability is assigned to the neighbor with the smallest distance to the target day the probability p j is computed as 4 p j 1 j p t p t j 1 k 1 j vii sample a candidate day by applying the inverse cumulative distribution function of eq 4 and using random numbers between 0 and 1 sampled from a uniform distribution the date of the sampled day is used and the corresponding hourly fragments f i m s are applied at each site in the disaggregation the hourly time series r i m s of the target day t are then derived using daily rainfall series r t s as 5 r t m s r t s f i m s viii repeat step i to step vii for each day t until the entire daily records are disaggregated 3 2 experimental setup to evaluate the cp based disaggregation procedure developed in this study and to investigate its sensitivity towards the number of cp classes and towards the consideration of seasonality three disaggregation experiments are performed table 1 to make full use of the limited hourly observations we perform a leave one out cross validation each single year of the hourly observations is selected and aggregated to the daily scale to be subsequently disaggregated using the remaining 14 years the original hourly data for each year is then used to test the performance of the disaggregation procedure in the different experiments a total of 30 monte carlo mc runs given the computational constraint with the same length 15 years as the observed precipitation records are generated to explore the sampling variability of the nearest neighbor candidate date 3 3 performance evaluation the performance evaluation of the different rainfall disaggregation experiments employs the following indicators as suggested by previous studies breinl and di baldassarre 2019 li et al 2018 pui et al 2012 the performance in reconstructing standard rainfall statistics includes mean value standard deviation fraction of wet rainy hours and lag 1 autocorrelation the mean wet dry spell length is selected to reflect the model performance in simulating the wet and dry features in the rainfall temporal disaggregation the skill in maintaining the spatial correlation structure is indicated by inter site pearson correlation coefficients finally the performance of the disaggregation procedures to meet the extreme percentiles 95th 97th 99th and 99 5th of hourly rainfall is evaluated the metrics for disaggregated precipitation relate to the median of the 30 mc runs and are compared against the indicators of the original records 4 results 4 1 standard metrics according to the different experiments table 1 the simulated hourly rainfall series at the 134 rainfall stations in the german part of rhine river basin are compared with the observed counterparts and the statistical metrics reflecting the disaggregation performance in reproducing key hourly rainfall characteristics are calculated fig 2 summarizes the model performance with regard to mean value standard deviation std lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient lag1auto and fraction of wet hours all disaggregation models tend to underestimate the mean hourly rainfall values which results from the overestimation of the number of wet hours in disaggregation procedures as the same daily precipitation totals are distributed to more wet shares the monthly based mof shows a slightly better performance in reproducing the mean value than the cp based procedures but the difference in mean value between monthly based and cp based approaches with seasonal stratification and high number of classes like sw cla8 is not large all model variants perform well with respect to standard deviation lag 1 autocorrelation is underestimated by the monthly based mof and overestimated by the cp based mof whereas the seasonally stratified cp based procedure performs best generally the seasonally stratified cp based procedure outperforms the one without stratification for all four indicators with increasing number of cp classes the performance improves all disaggregation procedures consistently underestimate the dry spell duration compared to observations fig 2 the mean length of the simulated dry spells is approximately 20 h compared to the observed 23 h such underestimation is also demonstrated in fig 3 b and d and the difference among different disaggregation experiments is nearly indistinguishable in terms of mean length of wet spells the cp based models perform better than monthly based procedure especially for longer wet spells see fig 3a and c which is largely underestimated by the monthly based disaggregation procedure we suggest that cp based disaggregation pools days with long and short duration wet spells which may correspond to frontal and convective rainfall respectively in a better way than monthly based disaggregation the discontinuity of rainfall events between days could play a role as well as the disaggregation procedure does not consider the wet dry status in the preceding and following days of the target day 4 2 spatial correlation the pair wise inter site pearson correlation coefficients of hourly rainfall series are given in fig 4 to assess the spatial connections of precipitation across station locations the deviations between simulated and observed correlation coefficients versus inter site distance are given in fig 5 all disaggregation procedures reproduce the spatial correlation well with most absolute deviations between simulated and observed coefficients lower than 0 1 the monthly based mof performs best in terms of spatial correlation the cp based disaggregation procedure without seasonal stratification tends to slightly overestimate the inter site correlations whereas considering the seasonality fig 5 clearly reduces the bias the number of cps does not affect the performance for this characteristic 4 3 precipitation extremes to examine the disaggregation performance in reproducing the hourly rainfall extremes several high percentiles are calculated and compared with observations fig 6 in addition the cumulative distribution functions for the example station nürburg barweiler are given in fig 7 for less extreme precipitation 95th percentile the monthly based mof outperforms the cp based disaggregation for more extreme precipitation 97th 99th 99 5th percentiles however the monthly based procedure overestimates the cp based without seasonal stratification underestimates and the cp based with seasonal stratification largely matches the observed percentiles this is also demonstrated in fig 7 for the example rainfall station that the probability curves from 30 runs of sw cla8 disaggregation can better envelope the observation one black dashed line the number of cp classes does not play a strong role though the classification with four classes performs worst 5 discussion in this study we demonstrate that the temporal rainfall disaggregation based on mof is improved in reproducing hourly rainfall extremes when conditioned on circulation patterns along with seasonal winter summer stratification we assume that the additional information injected by cps and seasonality better describes precipitation formation mechanisms and hence the link between daily sums and hourly precipitation distributions additionally the number of cp classes also plays a role models with more cp classes and seasonality considered perform better in rainfall temporal disaggregation and the sw cla8 disaggregation procedure shows the best performance in extreme hourly rainfall simulation fig 6 and fig 7 it is expected that increasing the number of classes in cp stratification improves the performance in explaining the rainfall variability as shown in beck and philipp 2010 and huth et al 2008 and further improves the performance of the disaggregation model however increasing the number of cp classes is computationally more demanding and also each class becomes less populated since the length of time series is limited which will inevitably introduce more uncertainty in candidate days sampling another concern is related to the underestimation of hourly rainfall mean values in all disaggregation experiments which results from the overestimation of fraction of wet hours in the fragments sampling procedure although monthly based standard mof shows lower underestimation fig 2 the difference between monthly based model and cp based approach with seasonal stratification and high number of cp classes like sw cla8 is rather small apparently all models underestimate precipitation in the range between 50th and 95th percentiles fig 7 cp based models perform similarly to the monthly based approach however for higher percentiles above 95th the monthly based approach strongly overestimates precipitation compared to the cp based one fig 6 hence the monthly based approach compensates the underestimation for lower percentiles with overestimation for higher percentiles resulting in a better mean we thus consider the cp based approach to be better particularly with regards to disaggregation of extreme precipitation which plays an important role in many practical applications in water management such as flood design estimation and risk analysis the major limitation of the cp based disaggregation is the stationarity assumption of the link between daily sums and subdaily distributions in each cp class this assumption is challenged by the thermodynamic changes in the atmosphere in particular increasing water vapor with increasing air temperature lenderink et al 2017 the cps in this study are classified by using only daily mean sea level pressure and seasonality summer winter which does not account for this thermodynamic effect westra et al 2013 examined the daily to subdaily disaggregation performance of mof conditioned on a range of atmospheric covariates such as air temperature and relative humidity where the atmospheric covariates with the greatest influence on the sub daily rainfall temporal pattern were identified by fitting a generalized additive model gam they found that the temporal distribution of subdaily rainfall is sensitive to changes in atmospheric temperature the maximum intensity of short duration rainfall increased by 4 1 13 4 per degree change in air temperature for the maximum 6 min burst and by 3 1 6 8 for the maximum 1 h burst rafatnejad et al 2021 evaluated climate change impacts on extreme subdaily rainfall amounts by using mof with inclusion of air temperature and other weather variables as influential factors where the distances between target and candidate days were weighted by the correlation coefficients between conditional variables and rainfall series their results indicated an increase in the extremes for instance in the mean and standard deviation of the 95th percentile therefore one approach to further improve the cp based rainfall temporal disaggregation model in reproducing subdaily rainfall extremes is to include additional conditional variables in particular air temperature into the cp classification which is expected to represent the thermodynamic effect of climate warming on the link between daily rainfall totals and subdaily distributions on the contrary breinl and di baldassarre 2019 used both precipitation and air temperature in a single matrix to compute the distances between the target day and candidate days and this approach delivered poorer performance with regards to subdaily rainfall extremes and inter site correlation so the question remains how to optimally incorporate additional weather variables to circulation patterns into the mof disaggregation procedure and can be addressed in future research 6 conclusions in this research a multisite method of fragments based rainfall temporal disaggregation model conditioned on circulation pattern cp classification is developed and applied for the german part of the rhine river basin its performance in simulating standard rainfall statistics spatial correlation wet and dry spells features and extremes is examined and compared with the standard disaggregation procedure monthly based the cp based disaggregation shows good performance in representing standard rainfall statistics including standard deviation lag 1 autocorrelation and fraction of wet hours although the monthly based method of fragments disaggregation performs slightly better with regard to mean both disaggregation procedures underestimate the mean duration of dry spells while the cp based models outperform monthly based one in wet spell length estimation the spatial correlation structure in terms of the inter site correlation coefficients is well maintained by both procedures the cp based rainfall disaggregation procedure significantly improves the simulation of rainfall extremes especially for high percentiles the performance gain may be explained by the improvement of cp classification in stratifying extreme rainfall features it could be shown that model performance increases with the number of cp classes this comes however at the costs of higher computational demands and higher uncertainty the superior performance for rainfall extremes is a valuable improvement for many practical applications in water management such as flood design estimation and risk analysis in addition the cp based approach opens up the possibility of including climate change effects in generating subdaily rainfall series credit authorship contribution statement xiaoxiang guan conceptualization methodology data curation software

1901,wildfire has been shown to increase decrease or have no detectable effect on actual evapotranspiration eta fluxes in the western united states where disturbance induced shifts are significant source water hydrology may be impacted as eta constitutes the largest outgoing water flux in much of the arid west we conducted pixel scale analysis of 30 m eta data and various meteorologic and landscape variables at 13 burn scars to understand how wildfire disturbance impacted hillslope to burn scar scale hydrology and vegetation conversion significant fire induced eta reductions between approximately 15 to 50 were detected at nine burn scars through the tenth post fire year while eta recovery rate varied substantially by ecoregion and pre fire vegetation type along elevation gradients both climate and land disturbance influenced the location of runoff recharge generation zones and more net water was generated from a snow dominated burn scar in dry post fire years than in wet pre fire years however especially in arid locations where eta is water limited compensatory eta pathways may be more likely to dampen fire effects on total basin water yield where intact vegetation is located between the disturbance footprint and the basin outlet relationships between post fire eta shifts and early successional vegetation conversion were also tracked the majority of burn scars with significant fire induced eta reductions experienced conversion patterns typical of the western united states following stand replacing disturbance with forests converting to shrub scrub and or grassland herbaceous cover through at least the end of the study period eight to 15 years depending on date of the fire event this could have important implications for high elevation snow dominated watersheds some of the most critical source water areas as previous research indicates that wildfire activity is moving upslope and into vegetation communities that have not evolved to withstand fire finally we show that much of the colorado river basin s high yield source water areas are vulnerable to the fire induced eta reductions and vegetation conversion observed herein as such water managers in the colorado river basin can anticipate changes in burn scar hydrology and snowpack mechanics following fire disturbance keywords vegetation succession disturbance hydrology et wildfire data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction it is reasonable to assume that where landscape disturbance modifies evapotranspiration eta downgradient streamflow will be subsequently altered as eta constitutes the largest outgoing water flux in much of the arid western united states healy et al 2007 reitz et al 2017 sanford selnick 2013 eta is also the most sensitive terrestrial hydrologic flux to vegetation disturbance debano et al 1998 this assumption is being made in reverse order when eta disruption is the assumed primary driver of streamflow modification goeking tarboton 2020 tague et al 2019 that is frequently observed in post fire settings beyene et al 2021 hallema et al 2018 kinoshita hogue 2015 saxe et al 2018 m l wine cadol 2016 yet both eta and streamflow response to partial or complete stand replacing disturbance are highly variable over space and time collar et al 2021 2022 goeking tarboton 2020 häusler et al 2018 this makes predicting the effect of wildfire on water availability difficult further in addition to eta fire disturbance can alter numerous other physical landscape processes influential to hydraulic connectivity along hillslopes such as precipitation throughfall infiltration and snowmelt mechanics hallema et al 2017 vegetation disturbance can reduce total net eta when transpiration suppression is large enough to overcome any surface energy balance modifications that increase evaporation biederman et al 2014 tague et al 2019 a net reduction in eta can enhance runoff generation by changing hydrologic states that are the initial conditions for rainfall runoff response such as by elevating subsurface soil and rock moisture levels to boost lateral shallow subsurface interflow and dry season baseflows atchley et al 2018 bart tague 2017 ebel 2013 goeking tarboton 2020 perry jones 2017 but explicitly linking eta to streamflow modification can be difficult if compensation pathways develop that dampen the effect of an eta reduction on total catchment water yield for example when intact riparian vegetation exists between the burn scar and the basin outlet a fraction of the excess water generated by the upgradient eta reduction may be consumed compensatory evaporation and or transpiration may be particularly prevalent in mediterranean and semi arid climates where eta tends to be water versus energy limited collar et al 2022 tague et al 2019 given eta s variable response to landscape disturbance observation of how one location responds hydrologically to disturbance may have limited transferability elsewhere yet most post fire eta studies are conducted at the sub basin to watershed scale ma et al 2020 nolan et al 2015 poon kinoshita 2018 the regional post fire hydrology studies that do exist focus primarily on the streamflow signal beyene et al 2021 hallema et al 2018 saxe et al 2018 for now the role of eta disruption in hillslope water balance and hydrologic connectivity must be generally inferred from prior studies that focus on disturbance induced vegetation dynamics for example post fire vegetation conversion has been shown to change the location and extent of runoff generation zones within a catchment rodman et al 2020 as have climate shifts that expand the activity density or coverage of cold limited vegetation in mountainous terrain via upslope vegetation migration goulden bales 2014 and highlighting the overarching role of climate in a catchment s runoff response mechanisms that modulate runoff generation have been shown to differ in wet versus dry years bales et al 2018 during dry periods in the sierra nevada california evaporative processes have been shown to have first access to local precipitation inputs this reduced the volume of water available to partition into recharge and or runoff in addition eta losses were shown to increase during dry periods because warmer air temperatures increased vapor pressure deficits warmer air temperatures have higher saturation vapor pressures this amplified the atmospheric demand for water vapor and boosted the latent heat flux conversely some mechanisms alleviated the impact of drought on water yield basins with more heterogeneous land cover and continuous inputs of runoff from higher elevation areas tended to generate higher total yields drought conditions can also increase total water yield by suppressing transpiration losses directly e g contributing to vegetation dieback or indirectly e g promoting fire related vegetation disturbance by increasing fuel flammability bales et al 2018 the effects of forest disturbance on basin hydrology may be particularly pronounced in the western united states where snowpack produces between 53 and 90 of average annual runoff barnett et al 2005 doesken judson 1996 d li et al 2017 and wildfire activity is becoming increasingly erratic and severe parks abatzoglou 2020 the latter is causing fire activity to occur at higher altitudes than it did historically coop et al 2020 higuera et al 2021 kemp et al 2019 schwartz et al 2015 stevens rumann et al 2016 creating more overlap between snow accumulation and fire prone zones kampf et al 2022 niemann giovando 2021 the availability of remotely sensed data and reanalysis products has substantially improved the scientific community s ability to conduct large scale hydrologic evaluations gorelick et al 2017 lettenmaier et al 2015 eta was once known as the most challenging moisture flux to estimate or measure directly lettenmaier famiglietti 2006 and is now modeled by a variety of operational products and publicly available algorithms gorelick et al 2017 miralles et al 2016 widespread availability provides opportunity for cross estimate comparison gridded data products also remove the need to compute eta as the lumped residual between precipitation and streamflow at basin outlets enabling insight into eta s spatial distribution throughout a catchment this may be particularly important for basins where groundwater contributions to streamflow vary interannually for the current study fine resolution landsat based 30 meter m eta estimates were generated with the simplified surface energy balance ssebop model senay 2018 senay et al 2013 we use this opportunity to compare the 30 m data with the united states geological service s usgs 1 km operational ssebop product the 1 km ssebop product senay et al 2013 has been shown to agree well with eddy covariance ec tower eta measurements mod16a2 and water balance data chen et al 2016 savoca et al 2013 senay et al 2013 velpuri et al 2013 and is included in the suite of eta estimates available on the openet project https openetdata org the finer resolution of the 30 m product is attractive for sub basin scale assessment where the heterogeneity of landscape features is of interest this work serves as a continuation of previous research that linked fire induced eta shifts to streamflow magnitude and timing collar et al 2022 using observations from the same basins plus three additional the current study evaluates how fire affects vegetation water usage and runoff generation within burn scars where precipitation partitioning is first occurring our primary research questions include a how do fire and climate interact to modulate runoff generation mechanisms and groundwater recharge in mountainous terrain and b how do fire induced eta modifications relate to post fire vegetation recovery implications of research findings for larger scale water availability concerns in the semi arid to arid southwestern united states are also discussed 2 methods 2 1 study areas in a prior study that links fire induced eta shifts to the downstream streamflow signal collar et al 2022 ten basins were selected from the western united states based on the availability of continuous daily stream gage data and the percentage of total burned contributing drainage area 5 in the water year of

enable insight into the potential effects of fire on water availability in the colorado river basin specifically fig 1 table 1 no upper colorado river basins were included in collar et al 2022 as none of the upper colorado s gaged watersheds met the selection criteria that 5 of the drainage area was burned in a single water year this constraining selection criteria could be ignored in the current study because stream gage data were not analyzed supplementary material the authors acknowledge that the relatively small number of burn scars included in the current study limits the reach and applicability of our results however the broad geographic spread of the 13 burn scars allows a range of environmental conditions to be sampled including seven different epa level iii ecoregions 2 2

response recovery and vegetation conversion post fire eta response and recovery metrics were calculated at each burned pixel following methods described in collar et al 2021 ten year pre fire mean annual eta depths and evaporation ratios eta precipitation et p were calculated and the percent and magnitude change of eta and et p for each post fire year post fire year one through ten relative to the pre fire mean was determined non parametric wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to determine where post fire eta was significantly different from the pre fire period at each burn scar before analysis the monthly datasets were log transformed and made seasonally stationary such that for a 12 month seasonal cycle the average value of each month was calculated from all data in the series and then subtracted to render the monthly anomaly seasonal first difference then deseasoned data from two post fire periods post fire years one through five post fire years six through ten were compared

procedures and statistical tests were applied to the prism precipitation data and 30 m eta data from unburned areas adjacent to each burn scar over the same periods post fire years one through five and six through ten to evaluate the rate of post fire et p recovery at each burn scar three recovery metrics were calculated including the 1 relative recovery indicator rri equation 1 the ratio of the

type 2 4 pixel scale annual water balances to assess the effects of fire and climate on hillslope and basin hydrology pixel scale annual water balances were constructed at two burn scars with significant fire induced eta reductions chippy mill northern rockies and santiago southern california save for eastern most flank of santiago both burn scars extended to the highest elevations in the drainages fig 2 this effectively removed the possibility of unaccounted run on or interflow from upgradient areas to contribute to basin water budgets santiago and chippy mill also represented a wide range of hydrologic conditions 43 of annual precipitation falls as snow at chippy mill 0 falls as snow at santiago fig 1 table 1 for continuity water balances were also constructed for one burn scar from every other epa level iii ecoregion except the southwestern tablelands where there was no detectable effect of fire on eta at the unnamed fire eta shift results discussed in section 3 2 annual pixel scale eta and precipitation data were binned by elevation to determine which elevation zones were generating recharge runoff water and which were consuming it the elevation binning construct was selected because prior work has shown that precipitation and eta patterns create elevation zones that are disproportionately important for runoff generation due to elevational dependent vegetation distribution patterns bales et al 2018 goulden bales 2014 asynchronous snowmelt behavior bewley et al 2010 or other location specific factors data were broken out by pre and post fire period then by their mean annual spi score keyantash 2018 such that pre fire wet years could be compared to post fire wet years and pre fire dry years could be compared to post fire dry years normal years excluded from analysis water years above and below the 95 confidence interval of the spi s 21 year mean were considered wet and dry respectively for each group of pixels dry pre fire dry post fire wet pre fire wet post fire in each elevation bin the mean depth of excess water generated recharge runoff was calculated as the difference between annual precipitation and eta from all pixels with annual precipitation depths that exceeded annual eta depths in the same water year the mean depth of water consumed as a result of regolith eta bales et al 2018 was calculated as the difference between annual eta and precipitation from pixels with annual eta depths that exceeded annual precipitation depths in the same water year the net water generated or consumed by the area within the burn scar was calculated as the difference between the total depth of water generated or consumed by each elevation bin normalized as mm pixel year 3 results and discussion 3 1 agreement of 30 m ssebop eta estimates with 1 km ssebop operational product agreement between the basin averaged 30 m and 1 km monthly eta datasets ranged from 0 29 r2 cannon to 0 92 r2 boulder fig 3 si figure a nse ranged from 0 09 cannon to 0 84 boulder rmse from 29 7 mm month boulder 18 5 mm month chippy mill and percent bias from 35 cannon to 1 jungle scatter and ba plots show that although the summary statistics listed above varied substantially by epa level iii ecoregion differences between the eta estimates followed a common trend across ecoregions the 30 m eta estimate was consistently greater than the 1 km eta estimate at lower eta magnitudes and smaller at higher eta magnitudes fig 3 si figure a this suggests that agreement between measurement methods is seasonably variable with the 30 m eta method overpredicting in the cooler months and underpredicting in hotter months relative to the 1 km eta product one might expect the opposite to occur if the patterns were driven by statistics alone i e the 1 km eta estimates would be less extreme than the 30 m estimates if underlying heterogeneity were being averaged out in the coarser 1 km product thirty and 100 m landsat based ssebop eta estimates

generally shown good agreement r2 from 0 74 to 0 95 and nse from 0 66 to 0 91 senay et al 2016 3 2 post fire eta shifts and recovery over time spatial post fire eta patterns generally agreed with the prior observation that burn scar aggregated eta is typically reduced following wildfires in the arid western united states collar et al 2021 ma et al 2020 according to wilcoxon rank sum tests deseasoned monthly eta was significantly reduced p less than 0 05 in both the first five and second five post fire years relative to pre fire monthly eta at nine of the 13 burn scars fig 4 provides data for the three upper colorado river basin burn scars the same data for the original ten burn scars are provided in collar et al 2022 and herein as si figure b southern california s santiago burn scar was the only study area to experience significant reductions in the first five years only median percent reductions ranged from approximately 20 coal seam waterfall to approximately 30 cannon there was no detectable difference between pre and post fire eta at oregon s boulder fires or colorado s spring creek and unnamed burn scars at eight of the nine burn scars with significant post fire eta reductions pettitt s tests identified significant shifts in the central tendencies of the stationary eta time series p less than 0 05 within two months of fire origin dates in contrast a significant shift in deseasoned monthly precipitation was only detected at one burn scar during the first five post fire years nevada s waterfall fire and that shift did not coincide chronologically with the burn event si figure b fig 4a these results support our hypothesis that most post fire eta reductions were caused by fire versus post fire weather conditions results from analysis of the unburned pixels si figure b fig 4b and eta residuals si figure b fig 4c provide additional supporting evidence post fire eta in unburned pixels was only significantly different from pre fire eta at chippy thomas and boulder where it shifted in the opposite direction increased from the eta of burned pixels decreased and at porcupine ranch and coal seam post fire eta reduced in both burned and unburned pixels however none of the significant shifts in unburned pixel eta occurred within two months of fire events the increase in unburned pixel eta at chippy thomas was likely driven by the above average rainfall experienced in the post fire period si figure b fig 4a at the boulder fires post fire rainfall was similar to pre fire but air temperatures may have increased and driven higher evaporative demand the position of burn scars within the greater boulder watershed may have also contributed to increased eta flux in unburned pixels substantial unburned drainage area was positioned between burn scars and the basin outlet some of the excess water generated from the eta reductions in the burn scar may have boosted transpiration by intact vegetation in those unburned areas collar et al 2022 tague et al 2019 conversely eta residuals at every burn scar were significantly reduced within two months of fire events except at unnamed where post fire eta increased unnamed was the only burn scar dominated by herbaceous vegetation versus forest or shrub scrub before fire table 1 in both rangeland and forested areas and across burn severities various herbaceous species have been shown to increase in density and abundance following disturbance that reduces resource competition unlocks nutrients increases light levels and or removes surface litter layers elliott et al 2011 ruthven synatzske 2002 some post disturbance herbaceous colonizers such as fireweed erechtites hieracifolia are only found in burned areas elliott et al 2011 it follows that increased nutrient availability may have elevated herbaceous productivity and thus water usage at unnamed following the fire when post fire eta shifts and recovery metrics were averaged for all pixels in each epa level iii ecoregion and broken out by pre fire vegetation type both percent and magnitude et p and eta reductions were greatest in mediterranean california followed by the northern rockies and the central basin and range columns change et p yr 1 mag change et p yr 1 and mag change eta yr 1 where mean reductions in et p ranged from approximately 30 to 55 in the first post fire year table 2 the grassy unnamed burn scar the only study area included in the southwestern tablelands ecoregion experienced a 16 increase in mean post fire et p in the first post fire water year equivalent to 178 mm year increase in eta see the same columns in table 2 all shaded blue to denote increased post fire et p and eta in terms of recovery the rri recovery metric varied substantially by pre fire vegetation type and ecoregion this comports with the prior finding that natural rates of post fire forest regeneration vary substantially over space and time which has been attributed to differences in pre fire vegetation condition topography slope aspect elevation and post fire temperature and moisture conditions collar et al 2021 vanderhoof et al 2021 regeneration rates of different conifer species can vary by an order of magnitude as an example vanderhoof et al 2021 unfortunately the nlcd rasters used to inform pre and post fire vegetation type in the current study only differentiate between broad high level classes evergreen deciduous mixed conifer this means we could not detect the role of species composition differences in variable inter region recovery rates among the same nlcd land cover classes if any differences in local scale biotic interactions may have also contributed our results show that deciduous forest et p in the wasatch and uinta mountain s jungle fire was lower a decade after fire than it was the first post fire year rri decreased by 0 27 conversely in the southern rockies deciduous forest recovered faster than any other vegetation type r 5 41 we note that immediately after fire the dominant vegetation type had converted from evergreen forest to grassland herbaceous at jungle and most of the southern rockies burn scars conversions provided in table 1 by about post fire year ten grassland herbaceous was either still the dominant cover type at most pixels in the southern rockies ecoregion number of pixels inferred from burn scar area table 1 or shrub scrub had only recently taken over in contrast shrub scrub became the dominant cover type at jungle multiple timesteps before the tenth post fire year and thus being more mature perhaps posed greater resource competition to remaining deciduous species than the early successional grasses did in the rockies and thereby reducing primary productivity and transpiration losses hansen et al 2016 mack et al 2021 the regional difference in deciduous recovery rate could also partially be explained by burn severity patterns at the southern rocky and jungle burn scars the average percentage of moderate and high burn severity area was higher in the southern rockies burn scars mean percent of moderate and high burn severity area in the burn scars with significant fire induced eta shifts was 51 compared with the jungle fire s 31 table 1 shifts in vegetation composition towards deciduous species such as oak and aspen have been observed more frequently following higher severity disturbance johnstone kasischke 2005 this has been attributed to higher fire intensities burning deeper into the soil organic layer exposing suitable seedbeds for deciduous tree seedling establishment frazier et al 2018 johnstone et al 2010 mack et al 2021 other patterns remained consistent across ecoregions evergreen forest recovered faster than mixed forest and shrub scrub cover in the central basin and range mediterranean california and the wasatch and uinta mountains 3 3 effects of fire and climate on pixel and burn scar scale water balance pixel scale water balances fig 5 support prior findings that both local climate and landscape disturbance are capable of influencing runoff generation and subsurface storage bales et al 2018 goulden bales 2014 tague et al 2019 hillslope and burn scar scale hydrology was markedly different at the chippy mill montana and santiago southern california burn scars visual inspection of pixel scale water balances indicates that annual precipitation totals generally increased with elevation at chippy mill table 1 fig 5 water balances for four additional burn scars provided in si figure c logically precipitation magnitudes were higher in wet years and lower in dry years but were not noticeably different in pre versus post fire periods at santiago annual precipitation was less stratified by elevation but magnitude differences between wet and dry years were more pronounced than at chippy mill the latter finding agrees with prior research that interannual precipitation variability is relatively higher in the coastal western united states particularly southern california due to higher exposure to mesoscale climate features e g landfalling atmospheric rivers and anomalies e g el niño southern oscillation deng 2009 dettinger et al 2011 neiman et al 2008 oakley et al 2018 in contrast eta magnitudes were similar across elevation bins during the pre fire period perhaps because pre fire vegetation type was fairly homogeneous throughout each burn scar fig 5 eta variation is likely higher in areas with elevation dependent heterogeneous land cover such as where catchments straddle tree line a condition not well represented in the current study eta decreased universally after fire disturbance fig 5c and e chippy mill had elevation bins that received more annual precipitation than they lost via eta p eta termed recharge runoff generation zones in fig 5 in all four scenarios dry pre fire dry post fire wet pre fire wet post fire those recharge runoff zones were upgradient of consumption zones p eta in all four scenarios at chippy mill and the majority of other study areas evaluated si figure c this implies two things first water generated upslope likely routes downslope to facilitate riparian transpiration regolith eta where eta would otherwise be water limited bales et al 2018 observed similar vegetation water use patterns in the sierra nevada s kings river basin which has steep elevation and climate gradients second where undisturbed drainage area is situated between the burn scar and basin outlet some of the excess water generated by the eta reduction in the burn scar will likely be consumed by downslope riparian vegetation or infiltrated where hydrophobic soil lenses are not present much like the disconnected impervious area concept in urban stormwater engineering roy shuster 2009 development of compensatory pathways has been shown to dampen the effects of disturbance on water yield particularly in arid environments where eta is water versus energy limited tague et al 2019 in wet years recharge runoff zones extended grew downslope while consumption zones receded shrank upslope at chippy mill fig 5d and e wildfire caused recharge runoff zones to extend downslope in both dry and wet years fig 5c and e the eventual burn scar only experienced net water consumption at the burn scar scale during dry pre fire years indicated by the thick pink bar which shows that the burn scar consumed more water via eta than it received at precipitation when integrated across all pixels in the burn scar and the largest export occurred in wet post fire years approximately 400 mm pixel year whether that excess water became overland flow or entered the soil depended on the infiltration capacity of the soil adams et al 2012 notably the chippy mill burn scar generated more net excess water recharge runoff in dry post fire years than during wet pre fire years previous work suggests that some post disturbance landscapes experience net reductions in water yield during dry years such as when annual precipitation is less than 500 mm and when the impacted catchment does not accumulate substantial annual snowpack adams et al 2012 this did in fact occur at a handful of our study basins including santiago fig 5c and d boulder cannon and jungle si figure c however snowmelt likely contributes a substantial fraction of runoff at chippy mill 43 of its average annual precipitation falls as snow table 1 and even during dry years average annual precipitation exceeded 500 mm at chippy mill both before and after the wildfire event 519 mm pre fire and 588 mm post fire according to 4 km prism data runoff mechanisms differed at santiago where recharge runoff was only ever generated in wet post fire years and only from the lower elevation regions of the basin because santiago s recharge runoff generation zone was downslope of its consumption zone in the wet post fire period chances for compensatory uptake of that excess water were reduced relative to chippy mill most burn scars mimicked the spatial pattern observed at chippy mill consumption occurred downgradient of runoff generation zones si figure c 3 4 relationships between early succession vegetation conversion and hillslope hydrology forested landscapes in north america are commonly shaped by fire disturbances x li et al 2018 early successional vegetation conversion forest to grass to shrub was documented at most burn scars in the current study table 1 and generally co occurred with significant reductions in eta flux fig 4 si figure b when post fire eta shifts were separated by vegetation type and plotted by aspect fig 6 it becomes evident that aspect controls where certain vegetation types grow in some undisturbed settings for example grass herb only grew on south facing aspects at cannon before the 2002 fire because the canopy foliage that shades out herbaceous vegetation was removed disturbance seemingly removed that aspect driven control such that grass herb became the dominant vegetation type at all aspects through at least the 12th post fire year at cannon and elsewhere fig 6 it is well known that herbaceous recruitment often follows stand replacing disturbance including the establishment of competitive highly flammable invasive annual grasses such conversion can pose temporary or longer term pressures on the disturbed ecosystem when the invading species alters the way a system responds to disturbance for example post fire encroachment of cheatgrass bromus tectorum in north america is a widespread issue as its high flammability can intensify fire behavior shorten fire recurrence intervals disrupt natural succession and reduce overall biodiversity balch et al 2013 pellant 1989 post fire succession can also have a negative fire vegetation feedback cycle where flammability increases with stand age tiribelli et al 2018 the authors acknowledge that full forest succession typically requires more than ten years to complete following stand replacing disturbance halpern 1988 kemp et al 2019 swanson et al 2011 however our rose plots do provide insight into interactions between pre fire vegetation regimes and early post fire succession patterns we also show that even early vegetation succession patterns comply with what is often observed in north america following partial or complete stand replacing disturbance annual and perennial herbs followed by shrubs often replace forested ecosystems for some period of time halpern 1988 swanson et al 2011 at oregon s buckeye burn scar initial post fire et p reduced among north facing evergreen forest but increased among south facing shrub scrub and evergreen forest fig 7 at the porcupine ranch fire initial post fire et p reduced in southwest facing deciduous forest but increased in north facing deciduous forest fig 8 by the third post fire year et p was reduced relative to pre fire et p in all vegetation types and grass became the dominant cover type by the eighth post fire year shrub scrub cover replaced much of the grass and was present at every aspect bin including in the northeast facing pixels where shrub scrub was not present before disturbance these insights become relevant to hillslope and burn scar scale hydrology because water balances show that wildfire can change both the net volume of water exported within an elevation zone and the lateral extent of recharge runoff generation zones we show that both eta and early succession vegetation shifts were widespread following fire disturbance from there it is logical to infer that the contraction and expansion of water generation and expansion zones were at least partially driven by the vegetation recruitment and migration patterns we can apply this forward to anticipate meaningful shifts in runoff and subsurface storage as climate change and other pressures push some species out and others in along elevation gradients goulden bales 2014 shifts may be most prevalent in snow dominated and cold limited catchments where the effects of a warming climate are being realized most acutely central tibetan administration in exile india environment development desk 2009 ugarelli et al 2011 chippy mill represents a watershed vulnerable to future shifts in recharge runoff mechanics because it accumulates a substantial seasonal snowpack column annual precip that falls as snow in table 1 and generates the majority of recharge runoff at its highest elevations fig 5a through f similar to what our results show occurs in dry pre and post fire years fig 5 the size of water generation zones may decrease as air surface temperature increases allow temperature limited vegetation to migrate upslope breshears et al 2008 davis 1989 goulden bales 2014 concurrently as climate change causes wildfire to occur at higher elevations than it did historically higuera et al 2021 schwartz et al 2015 stevens rumann et al 2016 fire s overlap with snow accumulation zones will likely expand this could effectively decrease the volume of water stored in the high altitude water generation zone if snow sublimation and or ablation rates accelerate fire induced forest conversion could also increase where high elevation forest types that are not adapted to withstand fire become exposed to more frequent or severe wildfire disturbance chambers et al 2016 coop et al 2020 higuera et al 2021 kampf et al 2022 kemp et al 2019 this may have been the case at chippy mill where the dominant cover type converted from evergreen forest to shrub scrub through at least the ninth post fire year fig 9 3 5 potential implications for water availability in the colorado river basin mtbs mapped 2 176 unique fire events in the colorado river basin since 1984 comprising approximately 58 100 km2 of total area si figure e si figure f when that burned area is separated into köppen geiger climate classes we show that the amount of area burned in the bsk arid steppe cold csb temperate dry summer warm summer and dsb cold dry summer warm summer climate classes is increasing significantly over time trendlines in si figure ec si figure f two of these three climate classes also have highest percentages of burned area in the colorado river basin csb at 62 burned dsb at 55 burned legend in si figure f these findings support the scientific community s general consensus that more area is burning often at higher severity not studied herein in the american west parks abatzoglou 2020 westerling 2016 in addition the most common fire ignition month in the colorado river basin was june followed by may and october si figure eb this could implicate water availability in the warmer summer months when irrigation demands peak in the basin xu et al 2016 when we marry these data summaries with results from the current study and collar et al 2022 we show that fire induced eta modification and vegetation conversion are likely to occur in the colorado river basin our five colorado river basin burn scars coal seam jungle mcgruder spring creek porcupine ranch sampled the köppen geiger climate classes with the most burn drainage area bsk at approximately 27 600 burned km2 and dsb at approximately 8 900 burned km2 table 1 si figure ea and steepest trends in total area burned over time bsk dsb and csb si figure ec four of those five burn scars experienced significant post fire eta reductions through the tenth post fire year fig 4 si figure b at coal seam deciduous forest converted to grassland and then shrub scrub and evergreen forest converted to grassland and then shrub scrub at jungle and porcupine ranch table 1 fig 8 these observations align with rodman et al 2020 s findings and others regarding vegetation conversion after stand replacing disturbance important future work might also determine how fire induced eta reductions affect the relative humidity and behavior of fuel during reburn events until streamflow can be estimated from remotely sensed data with sufficient confidence and higher spatial resolution than what is currently available e g nasa s surface water and ocean topography swot mission https swot jpl nasa gov the dearth of stream gaging stations in the west limit our ability to evaluate effects of landscape disturbance on yield and runoff patterns this is particularly so in relatively small but high yield headwater catchments of the upper colorado river basin where not a single gagesii basin met our reasonable basin selection criteria e g unmanaged 5 burned contributing drainage area as described in collar et al 2022 the lack of monitoring and inability to link burn scar observations to streamflow is problematic because of the disproportionate importance of these source water areas for water supply a statistical conundrum is also created when streamflow is only monitored in large basins the smaller the ratio of disturbed to total contributing drainage area the more difficult it becomes to separate the effects of disturbance from the overarching climate signal in the streamflow record beyene et al 2021 hallema et al 2018 saxe et al 2018 michael l wine et al 2018 one possible solution would be to use temporary pressure transducers to monitor ungaged source water catchments for example see lundquist et al 2005 s nested monitoring approach in the tuolumne river basin more observational discharge data will improve quantitative forecasts and reduce uncertainty but for now it is already apparent that elevated post fire runoff eta induced or otherwise and sediment transport capacities pose supply and quality challenges to western water managers higher reservoir sedimentation rates flashier hydrology reduced snowpack storage raw water treatment challenges on both the front taste odor solids and back ends disinfection byproducts among others are becoming increasingly common pressures for our aging water collection storage transfer and treatment systems to absorb for example colorado water provider denver water spent 26 million to restore water collection storage and treatment functions following large fires in 1996 and 2002 gartner et al 2017 martin 2016 that the southwest is currently gripped in an extreme megadrought williams et al 2022 which both causes and contributes additional compounding pressure to the aforementioned water availability issues does not help in 2021 for the first time since the compact was initiated in 1922 water use restrictions were triggered in upper basin states following the first ever water shortage declaration on the colorado river compact water education colorado 2021 perhaps the most reliable defense to our climate change related water woes is the resiliency of our forested areas to disturbance mechanisms bladon et al 2014 martin 2016 stevens rumann et al 2018 a healthy forest can better withstand disturbances like wildfire and insect infestation and is a more predictable and higher yielding source of fresh drinking water on the other hand when vegetation structure and fuel moisture levels combine to support high severity fire in vegetation communities that are not adapted to withstand severe fire disturbance conversion of forests to shrub scrub or grassland can be widespread and potentially permanent coop et al 2020 rodman et al 2020 rother veblen 2016 stevens rumann et al 2018 4 conclusions the current study was conducted to better understand how wildfire impacts burn scar hydrology along elevation gradients in the western united states at 13 burn scars in seven different epa level iii ecoregions we generated 30 m gridded monthly eta estimates with the usgs s ssebop model and demonstrate that wildfire significantly reduced eta at the majority 69 of study areas through the tenth post fire year fig 4 si figure b then at each burn scar we binned pixels by elevation to evaluate annual water balances in wet and dry years during pre and post fire periods because eta losses were suppressed inside the burn perimeter wildfire caused recharge runoff generation zones to expand usually downslope and total net annual water yield to increase relative to pre fire periods fig 5 si figure c even during low precipitation years more net excess water was generated from the burn scar than what was produced in wet pre fire years meaning more water was available to partition into groundwater recharge and or runoff however especially in arid locations where eta is water limited compensatory eta pathways may be more likely to dampen downstream water yield increases where consumption regolith eta zones are located downgradient of recharge runoff generation zones or where undisturbed vegetation is located between the burn scar and the basin outlet results from this work would be well accompanied by studies that link observations of burn scar eta down to the basin outlet see for example collar et al 2022 and field scale studies of the physical mechanics behind fire induced eta reductions eta recovery and post fire vegetation succession patterns were also examined eta recovery varied substantially by ecoregion with the fastest recovery occurring in deciduous forest in the upper colorado river basin table 2 the slowest occurred in mixed and deciduous forest in the wasatch and uinta mountain range followed by all vegetation types in the northern rocky mountains forests experienced early successional conversion to herbaceous and then shrub scrub cover through the tenth post fire year at most burn scars fig 6 through fig 9 as structure and function vary substantially between forest shrub scrub and herbaceous vegetation e g grass roots may not have access to the deep water reserves that mature tree stands do we infer that the observed post fire eta reductions were partially driven by the structural and functional changes associated with vegetation conversion where warming air surface temperatures drive wildfire activity farther uphill into fire unadapted vegetation communities and catchments that accumulate persistent snowpack fire induced hydromodification should be anticipated downstream because snow accumulation and ablation mechanics are closely linked to vegetation structure agreement between our calculated 30 m eta estimates and the operational 1 km ssebop product was also quantified to provide another comparison dataset for the scientific community fig 3 relative to the operational 1 km ssebop eta product our calculated 30 m estimates underpredicted eta in cooler months and overpredicted it in warmer months variability was high between epa level iii ecoregions with agreement ranging from 0 29 to 0 92 r2 nse from 0 09 to 0 84 rmse from 18 5 to 29 7 mm month and percent bias from 1 to 35 numerous prior publications provided herein can be visited for comparisons and validation of 1 km and 30 m ssebop eta estimates with other remotely sensed products flux tower observations and other hydrometeorological datasets potential implications of our findings for water availability in the colorado river basin were also explored fire activity in the colorado river basin is increasing including in many of the upper colorado river basin s high yield headwater catchments which are relatively small but provide a disproportionately large percentage of the colorado river s flow fig 1 si figure f our study confirms that fire induced eta reductions occur in these areas as a result water managers in the basin can anticipate changes in burn scar hydrology e g timing and volume of runoff soil moisture conditions and snowpack mechanics e g shifts in the timing and location of snowpack accumulation and ablation following fire disturbance for example in snow dominated basins total annual water yield may increase where fire disturbance expands recharge runoff generation zones by suppressing transpiration losses but snowmelt driven runoff timing may occur earlier in the year when irrigation demands are relatively low to fulfill peak irrigation demand later in the growing season more high elevation storage may be required to capture that runoff further as forest conversion rates increase in subalpine and montane watersheds land managers will be forced to grapple with the direct and indirect consequences of those conversions on watershed structure and hydrologic function a more extensive stream gage network could advance monitoring of the effects of fire driven eta reductions on water supply in the arid southwest declaration of competing

1901,wildfire has been shown to increase decrease or have no detectable effect on actual evapotranspiration eta fluxes in the western united states where disturbance induced shifts are significant source water hydrology may be impacted as eta constitutes the largest outgoing water flux in much of the arid west we conducted pixel scale analysis of 30 m eta data and various meteorologic and landscape variables at 13 burn scars to understand how wildfire disturbance impacted hillslope to burn scar scale hydrology and vegetation conversion significant fire induced eta reductions between approximately 15 to 50 were detected at nine burn scars through the tenth post fire year while eta recovery rate varied substantially by ecoregion and pre fire vegetation type along elevation gradients both climate and land disturbance influenced the location of runoff recharge generation zones and more net water was generated from a snow dominated burn scar in dry post fire years than in wet pre fire years however especially in arid locations where eta is water limited compensatory eta pathways may be more likely to dampen fire effects on total basin water yield where intact vegetation is located between the disturbance footprint and the basin outlet relationships between post fire eta shifts and early successional vegetation conversion were also tracked the majority of burn scars with significant fire induced eta reductions experienced conversion patterns typical of the western united states following stand replacing disturbance with forests converting to shrub scrub and or grassland herbaceous cover through at least the end of the study period eight to 15 years depending on date of the fire event this could have important implications for high elevation snow dominated watersheds some of the most critical source water areas as previous research indicates that wildfire activity is moving upslope and into vegetation communities that have not evolved to withstand fire finally we show that much of the colorado river basin s high yield source water areas are vulnerable to the fire induced eta reductions and vegetation conversion observed herein as such water managers in the colorado river basin can anticipate changes in burn scar hydrology and snowpack mechanics following fire disturbance keywords vegetation succession disturbance hydrology et wildfire data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction it is reasonable to assume that where landscape disturbance modifies evapotranspiration eta downgradient streamflow will be subsequently altered as eta constitutes the largest outgoing water flux in much of the arid western united states healy et al 2007 reitz et al 2017 sanford selnick 2013 eta is also the most sensitive terrestrial hydrologic flux to vegetation disturbance debano et al 1998 this assumption is being made in reverse order when eta disruption is the assumed primary driver of streamflow modification goeking tarboton 2020 tague et al 2019 that is frequently observed in post fire settings beyene et al 2021 hallema et al 2018 kinoshita hogue 2015 saxe et al 2018 m l wine cadol 2016 yet both eta and streamflow response to partial or complete stand replacing disturbance are highly variable over space and time collar et al 2021 2022 goeking tarboton 2020 häusler et al 2018 this makes predicting the effect of wildfire on water availability difficult further in addition to eta fire disturbance can alter numerous other physical landscape processes influential to hydraulic connectivity along hillslopes such as precipitation throughfall infiltration and snowmelt mechanics hallema et al 2017 vegetation disturbance can reduce total net eta when transpiration suppression is large enough to overcome any surface energy balance modifications that increase evaporation biederman et al 2014 tague et al 2019 a net reduction in eta can enhance runoff generation by changing hydrologic states that are the initial conditions for rainfall runoff response such as by elevating subsurface soil and rock moisture levels to boost lateral shallow subsurface interflow and dry season baseflows atchley et al 2018 bart tague 2017 ebel 2013 goeking tarboton 2020 perry jones 2017 but explicitly linking eta to streamflow modification can be difficult if compensation pathways develop that dampen the effect of an eta reduction on total catchment water yield for example when intact riparian vegetation exists between the burn scar and the basin outlet a fraction of the excess water generated by the upgradient eta reduction may be consumed compensatory evaporation and or transpiration may be particularly prevalent in mediterranean and semi arid climates where eta tends to be water versus energy limited collar et al 2022 tague et al 2019 given eta s variable response to landscape disturbance observation of how one location responds hydrologically to disturbance may have limited transferability elsewhere yet most post fire eta studies are conducted at the sub basin to watershed scale ma et al 2020 nolan et al 2015 poon kinoshita 2018 the regional post fire hydrology studies that do exist focus primarily on the streamflow signal beyene et al 2021 hallema et al 2018 saxe et al 2018 for now the role of eta disruption in hillslope water balance and hydrologic connectivity must be generally inferred from prior studies that focus on disturbance induced vegetation dynamics for example post fire vegetation conversion has been shown to change the location and extent of runoff generation zones within a catchment rodman et al 2020 as have climate shifts that expand the activity density or coverage of cold limited vegetation in mountainous terrain via upslope vegetation migration goulden bales 2014 and highlighting the overarching role of climate in a catchment s runoff response mechanisms that modulate runoff generation have been shown to differ in wet versus dry years bales et al 2018 during dry periods in the sierra nevada california evaporative processes have been shown to have first access to local precipitation inputs this reduced the volume of water available to partition into recharge and or runoff in addition eta losses were shown to increase during dry periods because warmer air temperatures increased vapor pressure deficits warmer air temperatures have higher saturation vapor pressures this amplified the atmospheric demand for water vapor and boosted the latent heat flux conversely some mechanisms alleviated the impact of drought on water yield basins with more heterogeneous land cover and continuous inputs of runoff from higher elevation areas tended to generate higher total yields drought conditions can also increase total water yield by suppressing transpiration losses directly e g contributing to vegetation dieback or indirectly e g promoting fire related vegetation disturbance by increasing fuel flammability bales et al 2018 the effects of forest disturbance on basin hydrology may be particularly pronounced in the western united states where snowpack produces between 53 and 90 of average annual runoff barnett et al 2005 doesken judson 1996 d li et al 2017 and wildfire activity is becoming increasingly erratic and severe parks abatzoglou 2020 the latter is causing fire activity to occur at higher altitudes than it did historically coop et al 2020 higuera et al 2021 kemp et al 2019 schwartz et al 2015 stevens rumann et al 2016 creating more overlap between snow accumulation and fire prone zones kampf et al 2022 niemann giovando 2021 the availability of remotely sensed data and reanalysis products has substantially improved the scientific community s ability to conduct large scale hydrologic evaluations gorelick et al 2017 lettenmaier et al 2015 eta was once known as the most challenging moisture flux to estimate or measure directly lettenmaier famiglietti 2006 and is now modeled by a variety of operational products and publicly available algorithms gorelick et al 2017 miralles et al 2016 widespread availability provides opportunity for cross estimate comparison gridded data products also remove the need to compute eta as the lumped residual between precipitation and streamflow at basin outlets enabling insight into eta s spatial distribution throughout a catchment this may be particularly important for basins where groundwater contributions to streamflow vary interannually for the current study fine resolution landsat based 30 meter m eta estimates were generated with the simplified surface energy balance ssebop model senay 2018 senay et al 2013 we use this opportunity to compare the 30 m data with the united states geological service s usgs 1 km operational ssebop product the 1 km ssebop product senay et al 2013 has been shown to agree well with eddy covariance ec tower eta measurements mod16a2 and water balance data chen et al 2016 savoca et al 2013 senay et al 2013 velpuri et al 2013 and is included in the suite of eta estimates available on the openet project https openetdata org the finer resolution of the 30 m product is attractive for sub basin scale assessment where the heterogeneity of landscape features is of interest this work serves as a continuation of previous research that linked fire induced eta shifts to streamflow magnitude and timing collar et al 2022 using observations from the same basins plus three additional the current study evaluates how fire affects vegetation water usage and runoff generation within burn scars where precipitation partitioning is first occurring our primary research questions include a how do fire and climate interact to modulate runoff generation mechanisms and groundwater recharge in mountainous terrain and b how do fire induced eta modifications relate to post fire vegetation recovery implications of research findings for larger scale water availability concerns in the semi arid to arid southwestern united states are also discussed 2 methods 2 1 study areas in a prior study that links fire induced eta shifts to the downstream streamflow signal collar et al 2022 ten basins were selected from the western united states based on the availability of continuous daily stream gage data and the percentage of total burned contributing drainage area 5 in the water year of interest among other criteria here we conduct detailed pixel scale evaluation of the burned areas within those basins to understand the effects of fire induced eta shifts on basin hydrology upgradient of the gage at each burn scar pyrologic data were obtained from the monitoring trends in burn severity mtbs database eidenshink et al 2007 united states environmental protection agency epa level iii

enable insight into the potential effects of fire on water availability in the colorado river basin specifically fig 1 table 1 no upper colorado river basins were included in collar et al 2022 as none of the upper colorado s gaged watersheds met the selection criteria that 5 of the drainage area was burned in a single water year this constraining selection criteria could be ignored in the current study because stream gage data were not analyzed supplementary material the authors acknowledge that the relatively small number of burn scars included in the current study limits the reach and applicability of our results however the broad geographic spread of the 13 burn scars allows a range of environmental conditions to be sampled including seven different epa level iii ecoregions 2 2

extraction and aggregation procedures are provided in si appendix a 2 3 statistical analysis 2 3 1 comparison of monthly 30 m eta data with operational 1 km ssebop product monthly 30 m eta estimates were compared to the operational 1 km ssebop eta product senay et al 2007 2013 at one randomly selected burn scar from each of the six epa level iii ecoregions included in the study to do so monthly 1 km eta data were extracted at the six burn scars for the period the 1 km data were available for at the time of data download january 2001 through september 2018 then the average monthly eta depth for each estimate 30 m and 1 km was calculated for the entire burn scar biases across measurement magnitudes were inspected with scatter plots bland altman scatter plots ba plots altman bland 1983 are also provided in the supplementary materials ba plots are frequently used in clinical settings to understand differences between measurement methods specifically ba plots are graphical representations of the magnitude difference between the paired measurements against the mean of the paired measurements for every month in the analysis period giavarina 2015 agreement between the measurements was also quantified with common summary statistics including root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse spearman s correlation r2 and percent bias additional validation of the calculated 30 m eta data was not conducted in the current study because the 30 m data were rigorously compared with additional hydroclimatic data in collar et al 2022 2 3 2 burn scar and basin scale eta and et p response recovery and vegetation conversion post fire eta response and recovery metrics were calculated at each burned pixel following methods described in collar et al 2021 ten year pre fire mean annual eta depths and evaporation ratios eta precipitation et p were calculated and the percent and magnitude change of eta and et p for each post fire year post fire year one through ten relative to the pre fire mean was determined non parametric wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to determine where post fire eta was significantly different from the pre fire period at each burn scar before analysis the monthly datasets were log transformed and made seasonally stationary such that for a 12 month seasonal cycle the average value of each month was calculated from all data in the series and then subtracted to render the monthly anomaly seasonal first difference then deseasoned data from two post fire periods post fire years one through five post fire years six through ten were compared to the ten years of pre fire data with wilcoxon rank sum tests α 0 05 non parametric pettitt s change point detection tests were also applied to each time series with the trend r package pohlert 2020 to independently check the timing of major behavioral shifts dates of significant shifts α 0 05 were compared to fire event dates table 1 to evaluate the influence of climate on the eta data the same procedures and statistical tests were applied to the prism precipitation data and 30 m eta data from unburned areas adjacent to each burn scar over the same periods post fire years one through five and six through ten to evaluate the rate of post fire et p recovery at each burn scar three recovery metrics were calculated including the 1 relative recovery indicator rri equation 1 the ratio of the maximum et p value from post fire year nine or ten whichever was highest to the pre fire average et p both normalized to the initial post fire year one et p value 2 the ratio of 80 pre disturbance r80p equation 2 the ratio of the maximum et p value from post fire year eight nine or ten whichever was highest to 80 of the mean pre fire et p and 3 the year on year average yryr equation 3 post fire

of fire induced eta shifts and et p recovery rates to pre fire vegetation type pixels were grouped by epa level iii ecoregion and statistical summaries of eta shifts and et p recovery metrics were calculated by pre fire nlcd vegetation type to determine which burn scars experienced fire induced vegetation conversion the mode of nlcd land cover class for all pixels in a burn scar was calculated if the mode changed between pre and post fire nlcd rasters available for years 2001 2004 2006 2008 2011 2013 and 2016 the burn scar was classified as experiencing a conversion in dominant vegetation type 2 4 pixel scale annual water balances to assess the effects of fire and climate on hillslope and basin hydrology pixel scale annual water balances were constructed at two burn scars with significant fire induced eta reductions chippy mill northern rockies and santiago southern california save for eastern most flank of santiago both burn scars extended to the highest elevations in the drainages fig 2 this effectively removed the possibility of unaccounted run on or interflow from upgradient areas to contribute to basin water budgets santiago and chippy mill also represented a wide range of hydrologic conditions 43 of annual precipitation falls as snow at chippy mill 0 falls as snow at santiago fig 1 table 1 for continuity water balances were also constructed for one burn scar from every other epa level iii ecoregion except the southwestern tablelands where there was no detectable effect of fire on eta at the unnamed fire eta shift results discussed in section 3 2 annual pixel scale eta and precipitation data were binned by elevation to determine which elevation zones were generating recharge runoff water and which were consuming it the elevation binning construct was selected because prior work has shown that precipitation and eta patterns create elevation zones that are disproportionately important for runoff generation due to elevational dependent vegetation distribution patterns bales et al 2018 goulden bales 2014 asynchronous snowmelt behavior bewley et al 2010 or other location specific factors data were broken out by pre and post fire period then by their mean annual spi score keyantash 2018 such that pre fire wet years could be compared to post fire wet years and pre fire dry years could be compared to post fire dry years normal years excluded from analysis water years above and below the 95 confidence interval of the spi s 21 year mean were considered wet and dry respectively for each group of pixels dry pre fire dry post fire wet pre fire wet post fire in each elevation bin the mean depth of excess water generated recharge runoff was calculated as the difference between annual precipitation and eta from all pixels with annual precipitation depths that exceeded annual eta depths in the same water year the mean depth of water consumed as a result of regolith eta bales et al 2018 was calculated as the difference between annual eta and precipitation from pixels with annual eta depths that exceeded annual precipitation depths in the same water year the net water generated or consumed by the area within the burn scar was calculated as the difference between the total depth of water generated or consumed by each elevation bin normalized as mm pixel year 3 results and discussion 3 1 agreement of 30 m ssebop eta estimates with 1 km ssebop operational product agreement between the basin averaged 30 m and 1 km monthly eta datasets ranged from 0 29 r2 cannon to 0 92 r2 boulder fig 3 si figure a nse ranged from 0 09 cannon to 0 84 boulder rmse from 29 7 mm month boulder 18 5 mm month chippy mill and percent bias from 35 cannon to 1 jungle scatter and ba plots show that although the summary statistics listed above varied substantially by epa level iii ecoregion differences between the eta estimates followed a common trend across ecoregions the 30 m eta estimate was consistently greater than the 1 km eta estimate at lower eta magnitudes and smaller at higher eta magnitudes fig 3 si figure a this suggests that agreement between measurement methods is seasonably variable with the 30 m eta method overpredicting in the cooler months and underpredicting in hotter months relative to the 1 km eta product one might expect the opposite to occur if the patterns were driven by statistics alone i e the 1 km eta estimates would be less extreme than the 30 m estimates if underlying heterogeneity were being averaged out in the coarser 1 km product thirty and 100 m landsat based ssebop eta estimates have been generated for multiple studies dias lopes et al 2019 senay et al 2016 sharma tare 2018 singh senay 2015 comparisons of landsat based eta estimates with ec towers and water balance data have generally shown good agreement r2 from 0 74 to 0 95 and nse from 0 66 to 0 91 senay et al 2016 3 2 post fire eta shifts and recovery over time spatial post fire eta patterns generally agreed with the prior observation that burn scar aggregated eta is typically reduced following wildfires in the arid western united states collar et al 2021 ma et al 2020 according to wilcoxon rank sum tests deseasoned monthly eta was significantly reduced p less than 0 05 in both the first five and second five post fire years relative to pre fire monthly eta at nine of the 13 burn scars fig 4 provides data for the three upper colorado river basin burn scars the same data for the original ten burn scars are provided in collar et al 2022 and herein as si figure b southern california s santiago burn scar was the only study area to experience significant reductions in the first five years only median percent reductions ranged from approximately 20 coal seam waterfall to approximately 30 cannon there was no detectable difference between pre and post fire eta at oregon s boulder fires or colorado s spring creek and unnamed burn scars at eight of the nine burn scars with significant post fire eta reductions pettitt s tests identified significant shifts in the central tendencies of the stationary eta time series p less than 0 05 within two months of fire origin dates in contrast a significant shift in deseasoned monthly precipitation was only detected at one burn scar during the first five post fire years nevada s waterfall fire and that shift did not coincide chronologically with the burn event si figure b fig 4a these results support our hypothesis that most post fire eta reductions were caused by fire versus post fire weather conditions results from analysis of the unburned pixels si figure b fig 4b and eta residuals si figure b fig 4c provide additional supporting evidence post fire eta in unburned pixels was only significantly different from pre fire eta at chippy thomas and boulder where it shifted in the opposite direction increased from the eta of burned pixels decreased and at porcupine ranch and coal seam post fire eta reduced in both burned and unburned pixels however none of the significant shifts in unburned pixel eta occurred within two months of fire events the increase in unburned pixel eta at chippy thomas was likely driven by the above average rainfall experienced in the post fire period si figure b fig 4a at the boulder fires post fire rainfall was similar to pre fire but air temperatures may have increased and driven higher evaporative demand the position of burn scars within the greater boulder watershed may have also contributed to increased eta flux in unburned pixels substantial unburned drainage area was positioned between burn scars and the basin outlet some of the excess water generated from the eta reductions in the burn scar may have boosted transpiration by intact vegetation in those unburned areas collar et al 2022 tague et al 2019 conversely eta residuals at every burn scar were significantly reduced within two months of fire events except at unnamed where post fire eta increased unnamed was the only burn scar dominated by herbaceous vegetation versus forest or shrub scrub before fire table 1 in both rangeland and forested areas and across burn severities various herbaceous species have been shown to increase in density and abundance following disturbance that reduces resource competition unlocks nutrients increases light levels and or removes surface litter layers elliott et al 2011 ruthven synatzske 2002 some post disturbance herbaceous colonizers such as fireweed erechtites hieracifolia are only found in burned areas elliott et al 2011 it follows that increased nutrient availability may have elevated herbaceous productivity and thus water usage at unnamed following the fire when post fire eta shifts and recovery metrics were averaged for all pixels in each epa level iii ecoregion and broken out by pre fire vegetation type both percent and magnitude et p and eta reductions were greatest in mediterranean california followed by the northern rockies and the central basin and range columns change et p yr 1 mag change et p yr 1 and mag change eta yr 1 where mean reductions in et p ranged from approximately 30 to 55 in the first post fire year table 2 the grassy unnamed burn scar the only study area included in the southwestern tablelands ecoregion experienced a 16 increase in mean post fire et p in the first post fire water year equivalent to 178 mm year increase in eta see the same columns in table 2 all shaded blue to denote increased post fire et p and eta in terms of recovery the rri recovery metric varied substantially by pre fire vegetation type and ecoregion this comports with the prior finding that natural rates of post fire forest regeneration vary substantially over space and time which has been attributed to differences in pre fire vegetation condition topography slope aspect elevation and post fire temperature and moisture conditions collar et al 2021 vanderhoof et al 2021 regeneration rates of different conifer species can vary by an order of magnitude as an example vanderhoof et al 2021 unfortunately the nlcd rasters used to inform pre and post fire vegetation type in the current study only differentiate between broad high level classes evergreen deciduous mixed conifer this means we could not detect the role of species composition differences in variable inter region recovery rates among the same nlcd land cover classes if any differences in local scale biotic interactions may have also contributed our results show that deciduous forest et p in the wasatch and uinta mountain s jungle fire was lower a decade after fire than it was the first post fire year rri decreased by 0 27 conversely in the southern rockies deciduous forest recovered faster than any other vegetation type r 5 41 we note that immediately after fire the dominant vegetation type had converted from evergreen forest to grassland herbaceous at jungle and most of the southern rockies burn scars conversions provided in table 1 by about post fire year ten grassland herbaceous was either still the dominant cover type at most pixels in the southern rockies ecoregion number of pixels inferred from burn scar area table 1 or shrub scrub had only recently taken over in contrast shrub scrub became the dominant cover type at jungle multiple timesteps before the tenth post fire year and thus being more mature perhaps posed greater resource competition to remaining deciduous species than the early successional grasses did in the rockies and thereby reducing primary productivity and transpiration losses hansen et al 2016 mack et al 2021 the regional difference in deciduous recovery rate could also partially be explained by burn severity patterns at the southern rocky and jungle burn scars the average percentage of moderate and high burn severity area was higher in the southern rockies burn scars mean percent of moderate and high burn severity area in the burn scars with significant fire induced eta shifts was 51 compared with the jungle fire s 31 table 1 shifts in vegetation composition towards deciduous species such as oak and aspen have been observed more frequently following higher severity disturbance johnstone kasischke 2005 this has been attributed to higher fire intensities burning deeper into the soil organic layer exposing suitable seedbeds for deciduous tree seedling establishment frazier et al 2018 johnstone et al 2010 mack et al 2021 other patterns remained consistent across ecoregions evergreen forest recovered faster than mixed forest and shrub scrub cover in the central basin and range mediterranean california and the wasatch and uinta mountains 3 3 effects of fire and climate on pixel and burn scar scale water balance pixel scale water balances fig 5 support prior findings that both local climate and landscape disturbance are capable of influencing runoff generation and subsurface storage bales et al 2018 goulden bales 2014 tague et al 2019 hillslope and burn scar scale hydrology was markedly different at the chippy mill montana and santiago southern california burn scars visual inspection of pixel scale water balances indicates that annual precipitation totals generally increased with elevation at chippy mill table 1 fig 5 water balances for four additional burn scars provided in si figure c logically precipitation magnitudes were higher in wet years and lower in dry years but were not noticeably different in pre versus post fire periods at santiago annual precipitation was less stratified by elevation but magnitude differences between wet and dry years were more pronounced than at chippy mill the latter finding agrees with prior research that interannual precipitation variability is relatively higher in the coastal western united states particularly southern california due to higher exposure to mesoscale climate features e g landfalling atmospheric rivers and anomalies e g el niño southern oscillation deng 2009 dettinger et al 2011 neiman et al 2008 oakley et al 2018 in contrast eta magnitudes were similar across elevation bins during the pre fire period perhaps because pre fire vegetation type was fairly homogeneous throughout each burn scar fig 5 eta variation is likely higher in areas with elevation dependent heterogeneous land cover such as where catchments straddle tree line a condition not well represented in the current study eta decreased universally after fire disturbance fig 5c and e chippy mill had elevation bins that received more annual precipitation than they lost via eta p eta termed recharge runoff generation zones in fig 5 in all four scenarios dry pre fire dry post fire wet pre fire wet post fire those recharge runoff zones were upgradient of consumption zones p eta in all four scenarios at chippy mill and the majority of other study areas evaluated si figure c this implies two things first water generated upslope likely routes downslope to facilitate riparian transpiration regolith eta where eta would otherwise be water limited bales et al 2018 observed similar vegetation water use patterns in the sierra nevada s kings river basin which has steep elevation and climate gradients second where undisturbed drainage area is situated between the burn scar and basin outlet some of the excess water generated by the eta reduction in the burn scar will likely be consumed by downslope riparian vegetation or infiltrated where hydrophobic soil lenses are not present much like the disconnected impervious area concept in urban stormwater engineering roy shuster 2009 development of compensatory pathways has been shown to dampen the effects of disturbance on water yield particularly in arid environments where eta is water versus energy limited tague et al 2019 in wet years recharge runoff zones extended grew downslope while consumption zones receded shrank upslope at chippy mill fig 5d and e wildfire caused recharge runoff zones to extend downslope in both dry and wet years fig 5c and e the eventual burn scar only experienced net water consumption at the burn scar scale during dry pre fire years indicated by the thick pink bar which shows that the burn scar consumed more water via eta than it received at precipitation when integrated across all pixels in the burn scar and the largest export occurred in wet post fire years approximately 400 mm pixel year whether that excess water became overland flow or entered the soil depended on the infiltration capacity of the soil adams et al 2012 notably the chippy mill burn scar generated more net excess water recharge runoff in dry post fire years than during wet pre fire years previous work suggests that some post disturbance landscapes experience net reductions in water yield during dry years such as when annual precipitation is less than 500 mm and when the impacted catchment does not accumulate substantial annual snowpack adams et al 2012 this did in fact occur at a handful of our study basins including santiago fig 5c and d boulder cannon and jungle si figure c however snowmelt likely contributes a substantial fraction of runoff at chippy mill 43 of its average annual precipitation falls as snow table 1 and even during dry years average annual precipitation exceeded 500 mm at chippy mill both before and after the wildfire event 519 mm pre fire and 588 mm post fire according to 4 km prism data runoff mechanisms differed at santiago where recharge runoff was only ever generated in wet post fire years and only from the lower elevation regions of the basin because santiago s recharge runoff generation zone was downslope of its consumption zone in the wet post fire period chances for compensatory uptake of that excess water were reduced relative to chippy mill most burn scars mimicked the spatial pattern observed at chippy mill consumption occurred downgradient of runoff generation zones si figure c 3 4 relationships between early succession vegetation conversion and hillslope hydrology forested landscapes in north america are commonly shaped by fire disturbances x li et al 2018 early successional vegetation conversion forest to grass to shrub was documented at most burn scars in the current study table 1 and generally co occurred with significant reductions in eta flux fig 4 si figure b when post fire eta shifts were separated by vegetation type and plotted by aspect fig 6 it becomes evident that aspect controls where certain vegetation types grow in some undisturbed settings for example grass herb only grew on south facing aspects at cannon before the 2002 fire because the canopy foliage that shades out herbaceous vegetation was removed disturbance seemingly removed that aspect driven control such that grass herb became the dominant vegetation type at all aspects through at least the 12th post fire year at cannon and elsewhere fig 6 it is well known that herbaceous recruitment often follows stand replacing disturbance including the establishment of competitive highly flammable invasive annual grasses such conversion can pose temporary or longer term pressures on the disturbed ecosystem when the invading species alters the way a system responds to disturbance for example post fire encroachment of cheatgrass bromus tectorum in north america is a widespread issue as its high flammability can intensify fire behavior shorten fire recurrence intervals disrupt natural succession and reduce overall biodiversity balch et al 2013 pellant 1989 post fire succession can also have a negative fire vegetation feedback cycle where flammability increases with stand age tiribelli et al 2018 the authors acknowledge that full forest succession typically requires more than ten years to complete following stand replacing disturbance halpern 1988 kemp et al 2019 swanson et al 2011 however our rose plots do provide insight into interactions between pre fire vegetation regimes and early post fire succession patterns we also show that even early vegetation succession patterns comply with what is often observed in north america following partial or complete stand replacing disturbance annual and perennial herbs followed by shrubs often replace forested ecosystems for some period of time halpern 1988 swanson et al 2011 at oregon s buckeye burn scar initial post fire et p reduced among north facing evergreen forest but increased among south facing shrub scrub and evergreen forest fig 7 at the porcupine ranch fire initial post fire et p reduced in southwest facing deciduous forest but increased in north facing deciduous forest fig 8 by the third post fire year et p was reduced relative to pre fire et p in all vegetation types and grass became the dominant cover type by the eighth post fire year shrub scrub cover replaced much of the grass and was present at every aspect bin including in the northeast facing pixels where shrub scrub was not present before disturbance these insights become relevant to hillslope and burn scar scale hydrology because water balances show that wildfire can change both the net volume of water exported within an elevation zone and the lateral extent of recharge runoff generation zones we show that both eta and early succession vegetation shifts were widespread following fire disturbance from there it is logical to infer that the contraction and expansion of water generation and expansion zones were at least partially driven by the vegetation recruitment and migration patterns we can apply this forward to anticipate meaningful shifts in runoff and subsurface storage as climate change and other pressures push some species out and others in along elevation gradients goulden bales 2014 shifts may be most prevalent in snow dominated and cold limited catchments where the effects of a warming climate are being realized most acutely central tibetan administration in exile india environment development desk 2009 ugarelli et al 2011 chippy mill represents a watershed vulnerable to future shifts in recharge runoff mechanics because it accumulates a substantial seasonal snowpack column annual precip that falls as snow in table 1 and generates the majority of recharge runoff at its highest elevations fig 5a through f similar to what our results show occurs in dry pre and post fire years fig 5 the size of water generation zones may decrease as air surface temperature increases allow temperature limited vegetation to migrate upslope breshears et al 2008 davis 1989 goulden bales 2014 concurrently as climate change causes wildfire to occur at higher elevations than it did historically higuera et al 2021 schwartz et al 2015 stevens rumann et al 2016 fire s overlap with snow accumulation zones will likely expand this could effectively decrease the volume of water stored in the high altitude water generation zone if snow sublimation and or ablation rates accelerate fire induced forest conversion could also increase where high elevation forest types that are not adapted to withstand fire become exposed to more frequent or severe wildfire disturbance chambers et al 2016 coop et al 2020 higuera et al 2021 kampf et al 2022 kemp et al 2019 this may have been the case at chippy mill where the dominant cover type converted from evergreen forest to shrub scrub through at least the ninth post fire year fig 9 3 5 potential implications for water availability in the colorado river basin mtbs mapped 2 176 unique fire events in the colorado river basin since 1984 comprising approximately 58 100 km2 of total area si figure e si figure f when that burned area is separated into köppen geiger climate classes we show that the amount of area burned in the bsk arid steppe cold csb temperate dry summer warm summer and dsb cold dry summer warm summer climate classes is increasing significantly over time trendlines in si figure ec si figure f two of these three climate classes also have highest percentages of burned area in the colorado river basin csb at 62 burned dsb at 55 burned legend in si figure f these findings support the scientific community s general consensus that more area is burning often at higher severity not studied herein in the american west parks abatzoglou 2020 westerling 2016 in addition the most common fire ignition month in the colorado river basin was june followed by may and october si figure eb this could implicate water availability in the warmer summer months when irrigation demands peak in the basin xu et al 2016 when we marry these data summaries with results from the current study and collar et al 2022 we show that fire induced eta modification and vegetation conversion are likely to occur in the colorado river basin our five colorado river basin burn scars coal seam jungle mcgruder spring creek porcupine ranch sampled the köppen geiger climate classes with the most burn drainage area bsk at approximately 27 600 burned km2 and dsb at approximately 8 900 burned km2 table 1 si figure ea and steepest trends in total area burned over time bsk dsb and csb si figure ec four of those five burn scars experienced significant post fire eta reductions through the tenth post fire year fig 4 si figure b at coal seam deciduous forest converted to grassland and then shrub scrub and evergreen forest converted to grassland and then shrub scrub at jungle and porcupine ranch table 1 fig 8 these observations align with rodman et al 2020 s findings and others regarding vegetation conversion after stand replacing disturbance important future work might also determine how fire induced eta reductions affect the relative humidity and behavior of fuel during reburn events until streamflow can be estimated from remotely sensed data with sufficient confidence and higher spatial resolution than what is currently available e g nasa s surface water and ocean topography swot mission https swot jpl nasa gov the dearth of stream gaging stations in the west limit our ability to evaluate effects of landscape disturbance on yield and runoff patterns this is particularly so in relatively small but high yield headwater catchments of the upper colorado river basin where not a single gagesii basin met our reasonable basin selection criteria e g unmanaged 5 burned contributing drainage area as described in collar et al 2022 the lack of monitoring and inability to link burn scar observations to streamflow is problematic because of the disproportionate importance of these source water areas for water supply a statistical conundrum is also created when streamflow is only monitored in large basins the smaller the ratio of disturbed to total contributing drainage area the more difficult it becomes to separate the effects of disturbance from the overarching climate signal in the streamflow record beyene et al 2021 hallema et al 2018 saxe et al 2018 michael l wine et al 2018 one possible solution would be to use temporary pressure transducers to monitor ungaged source water catchments for example see lundquist et al 2005 s nested monitoring approach in the tuolumne river basin more observational discharge data will improve quantitative forecasts and reduce uncertainty but for now it is already apparent that elevated post fire runoff eta induced or otherwise and sediment transport capacities pose supply and quality challenges to western water managers higher reservoir sedimentation rates flashier hydrology reduced snowpack storage raw water treatment challenges on both the front taste odor solids and back ends disinfection byproducts among others are becoming increasingly common pressures for our aging water collection storage transfer and treatment systems to absorb for example colorado water provider denver water spent 26 million to restore water collection storage and treatment functions following large fires in 1996 and 2002 gartner et al 2017 martin 2016 that the southwest is currently gripped in an extreme megadrought williams et al 2022 which both causes and contributes additional compounding pressure to the aforementioned water availability issues does not help in 2021 for the first time since the compact was initiated in 1922 water use restrictions were triggered in upper basin states following the first ever water shortage declaration on the colorado river compact water education colorado 2021 perhaps the most reliable defense to our climate change related water woes is the resiliency of our forested areas to disturbance mechanisms bladon et al 2014 martin 2016 stevens rumann et al 2018 a healthy forest can better withstand disturbances like wildfire and insect infestation and is a more predictable and higher yielding source of fresh drinking water on the other hand when vegetation structure and fuel moisture levels combine to support high severity fire in vegetation communities that are not adapted to withstand severe fire disturbance conversion of forests to shrub scrub or grassland can be widespread and potentially permanent coop et al 2020 rodman et al 2020 rother veblen 2016 stevens rumann et al 2018 4 conclusions the current study was conducted to better understand how wildfire impacts burn scar hydrology along elevation gradients in the western united states at 13 burn scars in seven different epa level iii ecoregions we generated 30 m gridded monthly eta estimates with the usgs s ssebop model and demonstrate that wildfire significantly reduced eta at the majority 69 of study areas through the tenth post fire year fig 4 si figure b then at each burn scar we binned pixels by elevation to evaluate annual water balances in wet and dry years during pre and post fire periods because eta losses were suppressed inside the burn perimeter wildfire caused recharge runoff generation zones to expand usually downslope and total net annual water yield to increase relative to pre fire periods fig 5 si figure c even during low precipitation years more net excess water was generated from the burn scar than what was produced in wet pre fire years meaning more water was available to partition into groundwater recharge and or runoff however especially in arid locations where eta is water limited compensatory eta pathways may be more likely to dampen downstream water yield increases where consumption regolith eta zones are located downgradient of recharge runoff generation zones or where undisturbed vegetation is located between the burn scar and the basin outlet results from this work would be well accompanied by studies that link observations of burn scar eta down to the basin outlet see for example collar et al 2022 and field scale studies of the physical mechanics behind fire induced eta reductions eta recovery and post fire vegetation succession patterns were also examined eta recovery varied substantially by ecoregion with the fastest recovery occurring in deciduous forest in the upper colorado river basin table 2 the slowest occurred in mixed and deciduous forest in the wasatch and uinta mountain range followed by all vegetation types in the northern rocky mountains forests experienced early successional conversion to herbaceous and then shrub scrub cover through the tenth post fire year at most burn scars fig 6 through fig 9 as structure and function vary substantially between forest shrub scrub and herbaceous vegetation e g grass roots may not have access to the deep water reserves that mature tree stands do we infer that the observed post fire eta reductions were partially driven by the structural and functional changes associated with vegetation conversion where warming air surface temperatures drive wildfire activity farther uphill into fire unadapted vegetation communities and catchments that accumulate persistent snowpack fire induced hydromodification should be anticipated downstream because snow accumulation and ablation mechanics are closely linked to vegetation structure agreement between our calculated 30 m eta estimates and the operational 1 km ssebop product was also quantified to provide another comparison dataset for the scientific community fig 3 relative to the operational 1 km ssebop eta product our calculated 30 m estimates underpredicted eta in cooler months and overpredicted it in warmer months variability was high between epa level iii ecoregions with agreement ranging from 0 29 to 0 92 r2 nse from 0 09 to 0 84 rmse from 18 5 to 29 7 mm month and percent bias from 1 to 35 numerous prior publications provided herein can be visited for comparisons and validation of 1 km and 30 m ssebop eta estimates with other remotely sensed products flux tower observations and other hydrometeorological datasets potential implications of our findings for water availability in the colorado river basin were also explored fire activity in the colorado river basin is increasing including in many of the upper colorado river basin s high yield headwater catchments which are relatively small but provide a disproportionately large percentage of the colorado river s flow fig 1 si figure f our study confirms that fire induced eta reductions occur in these areas as a result water managers in the basin can anticipate changes in burn scar hydrology e g timing and volume of runoff soil moisture conditions and snowpack mechanics e g shifts in the timing and location of snowpack accumulation and ablation following fire disturbance for example in snow dominated basins total annual water yield may increase where fire disturbance expands recharge runoff generation zones by suppressing transpiration losses but snowmelt driven runoff timing may occur earlier in the year when irrigation demands are relatively low to fulfill peak irrigation demand later in the growing season more high elevation storage may be required to capture that runoff further as forest conversion rates increase in subalpine and montane watersheds land managers will be forced to grapple with the direct and indirect consequences of those conversions on watershed structure and hydrologic function a more extensive stream gage network could advance monitoring of the effects of fire driven eta reductions on water supply in the arid southwest declaration of competing

1902,iron redox is often coupled with the degradation and conversion of co existing organic pollutants however their co transport behavior in hyporheic zone is not clear in this study the characteristics and mechanism of reactive co transport of fe2 and antibiotics during groundwater discharge were revealed by quartz sand column simulation it was found that fe2 inhibited the transport of three antibiotics sulfamethoxazole smx ofloxacin ofl and oxytetracycline otc in the quartz column and the average inhibitory intensity was otc 80 ofl 20 smx 2 meanwhile the content of dissolved oxygen in the column decreased from more than 7 mg l to 3 mg l fe2 transport in the column was promoted with the increase of otc and ofl concentrations 2 50 mg l as fe2 otc and fe2 ofl complexes inhibited the formation of lepidocrocite and induced fe2 fe3 cycling during co transport of fe2 and otc in contrast the interaction between smx and fe2 was not obvious due to the electrostatic repulsion due to the prevalence of fe2 and antibiotics in groundwater system especially with high antibiotic contamination this study provides a new perspective on the potential environmental impacts of fe and pollutants co transport during groundwater discharge keywords iron redox antibiotics complexation degradation lepidocrocite data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the global consumption of antibiotics has increased dramatically due to the population growth and the high incidence of infectious diseases klein et al 2018 commonly used antibiotics such as oxytetracycline ofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole are widely present in the environment due to their strong broad spectrum antibacterial activity huang et al 2018 wang et al 2017b and high utilization rate rodriguez escales et al 2016 however long term residues of antibiotics in the environment can induce the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistant genes klein et al 2018 sarmah et al 2006 threatening the safety of surface and groundwater quality pullagurala et al 2018 in contrast to the surface environment the transport and conversion of antibiotics in groundwater systems have not received sufficient attention as a transition zone connecting surface water and groundwater the hyporheic zone hz is an active biogeochemical region with redox fluctuations jung et al 2015 which is also considered as natural filters for pollutants and nutrients zhao et al 2021 many organic micropollutants such as antibiotics have been detected in hz li et al 2022 and their concentrations decreased with the increase of aquifer depth indicating that the porous aquifer serves as an important place for antibiotics adsorption and biodegradation peralta maraver et al 2018 it is well known that the dissolved oxygen do is a key environmental variable that drives a series of redox processes in hz kaufman et al 2017 previous studies have reported that the maximum concentration of do in surface water is usually near saturation 7 9 11 3 mg l while that in pore water is very limited 1 1 4 3 mg l naranjo et al 2015 in hz rivers carry do into groundwater promoting redox reactions in the riverbed and groundwater also brings reducing substances while recharging surface water this process can lead to changes in the redox state of susceptible components such as fe mn dong et al 2020 which may play an important role in pollutants removal fe is one of the most important active components in hz and the concentration of fe2 is usually between 0 5 and 5 mg l in groundwater of han river basin lu et al 2022 due to the frequent fluctuation of oxygen content in hz fe is prone to redox changes under chemical and microbial interactions during groundwater discharge fe2 is easily oxidized to fe iii minerals by oxygen lu et al 2022 ratie et al 2019 and hydroxyl radicals oh will be generated in the rapid oxidation process to degrade pollutants tong et al 2016 xie et al 2020 in addition aqueous fe2 can affect the conversion of co existing organic compounds in the environment through complexation fe iii minerals also often act as mobile carriers to promote the transport of organic matter carstens et al 2018 and play an important role in contaminants cycling in the subsurface environments hassellov von der kammer 2008 li et al 2019 current studies mainly focus on the effects of fe conversion on pollutants under static conditions pimentel et al 2021 rodriguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 zheng et al 2017 e g complexation of fe2 fe3 and tetracycline antibiotics tcs wang et al 2016 as well as electrostatic adsorption of tc on fe iii mineral surfaces wu et al 2019 however the transport of fe2 in hz and its effect on the fate of antibiotics under dynamic oxygen changes have not been studied therefore we investigated the reactive co transport of fe2 and antibiotics in the process of groundwater discharge by one dimensional simulated column experiment with quartz sand as saturated porous medium the aim of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the co transport behavior of fe2 and antibiotics in hz not only to investigate the effect of fe2 on the fate of antibiotics but also to reveal the effects of different antibiotics on fe2 transport and iron species transformation by comparing the breakthrough curves btcs obtained from fe2 and antibiotics co transport experiments we found that fe2 has a great effect on antibiotics transport in porous media while different types of antibiotics have different mechanisms on iron conversion furthermore the mechanisms affecting the co transport behavior of fe2 and antibiotics was revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals quartz sand sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china with a size range of 0 25 0 42 mm 40 60 mesh was used as the porous media antibiotics including smx sulfamethoxazole 98 and ofl ofloxacin 98 were obtained from anpu experimental technology co ltd and otc oxytetracycline hydrochloride was purchased from aladdin biochem technology ferrous chloride fecl2 4h2o 99 was purchased from sinopharm

hplc grade were purchased from sigma aldrich trading co ltd tron chloride hexahydrate 99 was obtained from aladdin biochemical technology piperazine n n bis ethanesulfonic acid pipes was obtained from sigma aldrich trading co ltd other chemicals were of analytical purity or above section s1 experimental solutions were prepared with 18 2 mω cm di water 2 2 column experiments an organic glass column with 15 cm length and 2 cm inner diameter was used for the experiment the columns were gradually wet packed with clean sand in an increment of 2 cm layers the porosity of the sand column was 0 4 detailed sand cleaning procedure and column packing are provided in section s2 and section s3 before column experiment the background solution 0 01 mol l nacl was injected from the bottom of the column using a peristaltic pump at a pore velocity of 4 ml min for more than 12 h to saturate the column and establish steady state saturated flow condition kbr or mixed solutions of different concentration ratios of fe2 and anaerobic antibiotic were injected into the column and then the anaerobic background solution 0 01 mol l nacl was passed into the column for elution since fe2 would reduce the ph value of the solution a certain proportion of pipes was used to maintain the ph at 6 8 chen et al 2018 in addition the aqueous mixed solutions of iron and antibiotic into the column were kept anaerobic in the dark and was well connected to the column apparatus throughout the experiment a semi automatic collector with centrifuge tubes was used to collect the effluent every 4 min the centrifuge tube was pre filled with 20 µl of 6 mol l hcl to prevent fe2 oxidation and separate antibiotics from iron complexes the specific experimental setup and summary of column experimental conditions are shown in figure s1 and table s1 the c c0 mentioned in the text refers to the ratio of the concentration of the target substance before and after transport from the column br concentration was measured with bromine electrode oxygen sensor spots reeder et al 2018 oxygen sensitive spot presens precision sensing gmbh regensburg germany were attached to the inner wall of the organic glass column at a height of 2 5 7 5 and 12 5 cm from the bottom respectively during column experiments do changes were monitored in real time using noninvasive optode technique fibox 4 presens gmbh regensburg germany 2 3 determination of antibiotics the concentration of antibiotic was determined by hplc lc 20at shimadzu japan with a c18 reverse phase column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 µm before detection water samples were filtered through a 0 22 µm polyethersulfone pes membrane to separate suspended particles specific testing methods for antibiotics are provided in section s4 2 4 analyses of iron concentrations the concentration of fe2 in column effluent was determined by the 1 10 phenanthroline method tamura et al 1974 using an enzyme labeled instrument infinite 200 pro nano quant tecan germany to obtain the content of fe ii and fe iii species in the experimental column the reacted quartz sand column was divided into three layers in the anaerobic chamber and then different forms of iron were extracted by chemical classification chen et al 2022b claff et al 2010 scouller et al 2006 yuan et al 2018 specific extraction steps are provided in section s5 2 5 characterization of quartz sand after the column experiment the reacted quartz sand column was divided into three layers according to the height in an anaerobic chamber and lyophilized under anaerobic conditions the lyophilized quartz particles were determined by raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy sem in addition lyophilized samples are ground in an anaerobic chamber and passed through a 200 mesh sieve for x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps detection xps spectra were obtained on a vg multilab 2000 x ray electron energy spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa raman spectroscopy of the reacted quartz sand was measured by alpha 300 r raman sem eds particlescout witec germany to obtain the morphology and structure of fe2 oxidation products the samples were scanned by sem eds su8010 hitachi japan the zeta potential of crushed quartz sand was determined with zeta plus potential analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk at room temperature 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 column transport characteristics of br and fe2 a conservative br breakthrough curve btc was used to describe the water flow behavior in a quartz sand column fig 1 a the btc of br had good symmetry with no trailing indicating that the column was filled uniformly without cracks and preferential flow btc of fe2 fig 1b reached a peak rapidly in 0 4 pore volume pv and then began to decrease between 4 and 29 pv until the anaerobic background solution was injected 29 35 pv compared with br the btc peak value of fe2 was significantly lower and the symmetry was poor indicating that fe2 was non equilibrium adsorption and unstable during column transport when fe2 transports in the sand column we found that the bottom of the column turned yellow fig s2a indicating that fe2 may be oxidized to form fe iii minerals and adsorbed on quartz sand it has been reported that fe2 is difficult to be adsorbed by quartz sand but it is easy to be oxidized to form fe iii minerals under aerobic conditions klüpfel et al 2014 in general fe2 forms lepidocrocite in the early oxidation stage and then transformed from weak crystalline minerals such as lepidocrocite to high crystalline minerals vogelsang et al 2016 moreover the differences of oxygen and fe2 content will lead to different iron minerals chen and thompson 2018 therefore the mineral composition of column sand was characterized by raman spectroscopy according to the results the raman spectra of fe2 oxidation products matched the characteristic peak of lepidocrocite 249 cm 1 das and hendry 2011 indicating that fe2 was oxidized to form lepidocrocite figure s3 in addition the sem images of the reacted column sand fig 1d showed that the sheet like lepidocrocite was significantly different from the smooth surface of clean quartz sand fig 1c since oxygen is an important factor affecting fe2 conversion park and dempsey 2005 do changes in the column were monitored in real time figure s4 it was found that the oxygen value of the top middle and low parts of the column decreased rapidly 0 10 pv at first and then slowly 10 29 pv due to the consumption by fe2 oxidation and finally stabilized at 3 mg l fig 1e notably oxygen consumption hindered further oxidation of fe2 chen and thompson 2018a but the transport volume of fe2 continued to decrease when do stopped declining we speculated that this may be due to the non equilibrium adsorption of fe2 by oxidation generated lepidocrocite therefore adsorption capacity of reacted quartz sand to iron was verified and found that iron oxide coated sand has strong adsorption capacity for fe2 under anaerobic and aerobic conditions fig s5a d the concentration of fe2 in the solution decreased with the increase of iron oxide coated sand content furthermore a higher amount of iron oxide coated sand results in a higher value of the δ adsorption quantity of fe2 fig s5b e the strong adsorption of fe2 exhibited by iron oxide coated sand is probably ascribed to the quick electron transfer between fe ii sorbed and fe iii lattice and induced formation of high crystalline fe ii phases that hindered fe2 oxidation chen et al 2022a it can be concluded from the btc results of fe2 that the oxidation process plays a dominant role in 0 10 pv while the combined effect of fe2 oxidation and adsorption of iron oxide coated sand is the main factor in 10 29 pv non equilibrium oxidation of fe2 during transport may be due to the catalytic effect and adsorption of fe iii formed by the oxidation of fe2 electron transfer and complexation hanna et al 2013 williams and scherer 2004 which eventually leads to lower breakthrough concentrations of fe2 3 2 transport of antibiotics in the absence presence of fe2 as can be seen from the transport of different concentrations of antibiotics in the sand column fig 2 a d g the btcs of antibiotics lagged behind that of br at all concentrations indicating a non equilibrium and hysteresis transport process park and huwe 2016 compared to otc and ofl the btcs of single smx existed better stability with higher c c0 plateaus of 100 100 and 99 at 2 10 and 50 mg l respectively while lower c c0 plateaus were observed in single otc 89 94 and 98 and ofl 95 99 and 99 transporting at relative concentrations in general antibiotic transport in the column is mainly affected by adsorption and the different physicochemical properties of antibiotics should be considered e g molecular size number and type of functional groups surface charge etc rodriguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 under neutral conditions the net surface charge of quartz sand is negative and most of the negative sites come from broken edges of silicon oxides sio zhang et al 2021 at this point more than 90 of smx exists in the form of smx and a small amount of smx exists as smx0 table s2 as mentioned above the high mobility of smx is due to its low adsorption equilibrium constant k f on quartz sand dong et al 2021 and may also attribute to the electrostatic repulsion between smx and negatively charged sand under the study conditions considering that the mobility of otc and ofl without fe2 in the column is lower than that of smx we speculated that they were more likely to be adsorbed or degraded in the presence of ofl exists in the form of ofl the electrostatic attraction between ofl and negatively charged sand contributed to the higher adsorption of ofl wang et al 2017a tetracycline has a relatively short environmental half life is unstable and prone to spontaneous hydrolysis meanwhile the silica surface of sand has nanoscale roughness and chemical heterogeneity yang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 which is conducive to the adsorption and catalytic acceleration of otc hydrolysis kang et al 2012 overall the electrostatic repulsion between smx and negatively charged sand as well as the stability of smx led to a good transport performance of smx for otc and ofl the less residue in the column may be due to self hydrolysis and sand adsorption during the co transport with fe2 lower c c0 plateaus of btcs were observed in otc and ofl compared with that of single antibiotics transport fig 2 the c c0 of otc and ofl at 2 10 and 50 mg l was approximately 0 17 and 38 and 78 85 and 95 respectively it can be inferred that the co existence of fe2 inhibited the transport of both otc and ofl and the inhibitory effect on otc was much stronger than ofl however the co existence of fe2 had little effect on smx transport and the btc with different concentrations of smx still has a high plateau in the 96 98 range 3 3 effects of different antibiotics on fe2 transport the effect of different concentrations of antibiotics on fe2 transport varied greatly low concentration of smx 2 mg l inhibited the transport of fe2 but the inhibitory effect was weakened with the increase of smx concentration fig 2c notably low concentration of smx 2 mg l reduced the peak value of btc to 56 while 10 mg l and 50 mg l of smx increased it to 83 and 88 respectively in contrast the presence of otc and ofl both promoted the transport of fe2 in quartz sand and the effect was more pronounced with the increase of antibiotic concentration fig 2f i at concentration of 50 mg l ofl was more effective on iron transport than otc with the btc peak of 95 and 79 respectively differently the btc shape of fe2 remained unchanged in the presence of ofl while the btcs of fe2 in the presence of otc showed good symmetry and no tailing indicating the reaction equilibrium of fe2 overall fe2 inhibited the transport of three antibiotics in sand column and the inhibition intensity was otc ofl smx on the contrary both otc and ofl can promote fe2 transport in the column and the promoting effect enhanced monotonically with the increase of antibiotic concentration in addition the shape of the btc of fe2 changed and had good symmetry in the presence of otc 3 4 effect mechanisms of fe2 on antibiotics transport compared to the transport of a single antibiotic the mechanism of antibiotics transport in the co existence of fe2 was more complex such as degradation by oh generated by fe2 oxidation iron and antibiotics complexation encapsulation and adsorption of iron oxidized minerals during the co transport of smx and fe2 a small amount of smx residue in the column was attributed to the electrostatic adsorption caused by the positive charge on the surface of quartz sand after fe2 was oxidized to fe iii mineral previous studies have suggested that there are more functional groups such as hydroxyl groups and reactive high gibbs free energy on the iron oxide coated sand surfaces than that on clean sand which provides more adsorption sites for antibiotics haham et al 2012 wu et al 2016 xing et al 2020 and promotes the surface complexation chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 conversely the btc values of otc and ofl were greatly reduced in the presence of fe2 suggesting that otc and ofl transport may be inhibited by adsorption encapsulation or degradation in the column we measured the residues of different forms of antibiotic in the post reaction column figure s6 and section s6 the extraction results showed that only a small amount of otc less than 4 00 and ofl 24 00 were detected the weak adsorption and chemisorption of otc and ofl accounted for 1 00 2 19 and 2 77 21 02 respectively due to the small proportion of adsorbed and wrapped antibiotics in the extract it was speculated that the otc and ofl losses in co transport system were mainly due to the degradation to verify the degradation of antibiotics in co transport system we measured the content of oh produced in the column tong et al 2022 sodium benzoate was used to capture oh and the results showed that the production of oh increased with the increase of fe2 content and the maximum accumulated concentration was 1 41 µm fig 1f indicating that fe2 could be oxidized to produce oh in the aerobic column furthermore 0 5 mol l isopropanol quencher was added to the co transport experiment to verify the contribution of oh on antibiotic degradation fig 3 a and fig 3b showed that the contribution of oh to the degradation of otc at different concentrations ranged from 91 75 to 52 72 while that of ofl was about 70 section s7 from the results oh plays a leading role in otc degradation while a limited role in ofl degradation for ofl the degradation pathway of ofl is that oh groups attacks the ring of ofl molecule to produce hydroxylated products and these intermediate degradation products are further oxidized by oh through continuous ring cleavage reaction weng et al 2020 however the contribution of oh to the degradation of otc and ofl 78 78 and 63 16 was lower than that inferred by chemical extraction 96 81 and 76 21 10 mg l in column system figure s6 and section s7 we speculated that this difference may be caused by the complexation of fe2 with tcs and fqs which can promote the degradation sagdinc et al 2004 wang et al 2016 therefore the complexation of otc ofl with fe2 and fe3 was further investigated by uv absorption spectroscopy as can be seen from the results figures s7 s8 the maximum absorption peaks of otc and ofl were 361 nm and 288 nm respectively under aerobic or anaerobic conditions fe2 fe3 solutions did not exhibit noticeable absorbance with the addition of fe2 or fe3 the absorption peak of otc red shifted from 354 nm to 361 nm or 366 nm figure s7a d while that of ofl red shifted from 288 nm to 289 nm or 291 nm respectively figure s8a d thus the maximum absorption peaks of fe2 otc and fe2 ofl complexes were 361 and 289 nm while those of fe3 otc and fe3 ofl complexes were 366 and 291 nm respectively by comparing with the control group antibiotic only we found that the addition of fe2 or fe3 promoted the reduction of otc figure s7f and ofl figure s8f under aerobic and anaerobic conditions however fe2 has a stronger removal effect on otc than on ofl which may be attributed to the special cyclic redox process of iron ions in the coexistence system of fe2 and otc otc is complexed with fe2 under anoxic conditions at the beginning of the experiment when entering the aerobic quartz sand column fe2 and fe2 otc complexes are easily oxidized to fe3 and fe3 otc complex and oh will accelerate the removal of otc meanwhile the otc molecule in the fe3 otc complex acts as the electron donor of fe3 and generates new fe2 wang et al 2015 which oxidized to fe3 and forms a fe2 fe3 cycle in the column this is the speculation for the dynamic equilibrium of the btc of fe2 in otc fe2 co transport system for ofl iron ions can chelate to the ofl in the complexes through ring carbonyl and one of the carboxylic oxygen atoms thus affecting the stability of ofl sagdinc and bayari 2004 therefore fe2 can effectively remove otc ofl through complexation and conversion and the cyclic redox process of fe2 and otc promotes the stronger removal of fe2 on otc in conclusion the co existence of fe2 does not affect the transport of smx due to the electrostatic repulsion and negligible adsorption of quartz sand in contrast the removal of otc and ofl by fe2 is mainly through complexation conversion and fe2 oxidation process in addition the wrapping effect of iron oxidation mineralization process and the surface adsorption after iron oxidation mineralization also contribute to the removal of otc and ofl 3 5 effect mechanism of co existing antibiotics on fe2 transport and fe morphology transformation in quartz sand 3 5 1 effect of smx on fe2 transport since iron morphology is prone to transformation we explored the form and content of fe in the reacted sand of different co transport column the chemical extraction of fe ii fe iii morphology was performed from quartz sand fig 4 and the proportion of fe iii and fe ii under different column conditions was analyzed by xps spectroscopy table 1 and figure s9 in the absence of antibiotics the iron content at the bottom of the column was higher than that in other parts and it mainly existed in the form of amorphous fe iii with the highest proportion of 95 61 followed by amorphous fe ii crystalline fe iii and adsorbed fe ii photo of the reacted column also showed that the yellow color of the sand was darker at the bottom of the column than other parts fig s2a with the continuous input of fe2 a little amount of amorphous fe iii gradually converted to crystalline fe iii it was found that the effect of smx on fe2 was significantly different from that of otc and ofl in co transport system photos of the columns showed a darker yellow color at the bottom as the concentration of smx decreased fig s2b c d similarly sem results showed a significant increase in the amount of lepidocrocite on sand surface at low concentrations of smx 2 mg l while it decreased with the increase of smx concentration 50 mg l fig 5 a b compared with the single fe2 transport system 0 01 the proportion crystalline fe iii increased in co transport column from 1 to 4 13 and 16 at the bottom of the column respectively although the proportion of amorphous fe iii remained dominant 83 73 and 70 at the bottom of the column respectively the residual amount of fe in the column of low concentration co transport system 2 mg l was significantly higher than that in single fe2 transport system but it gradually decreased as the smx concentration increased from 2 to 50 mg l fig 4 and table 1 therefore as the concentration of smx increases the proportion of crystalline fe iii increases gradually although the content of residual fe in the column decreases suggesting that smx promotes the conversion of amorphous fe iii to crystalline fe iii as well as more lepidocrocite were observed since the column transport of smx is almost unaffected by fe2 we speculate that it may be controlled by electrostatic action on the sand surface it was found that the zeta potential fig 5 c and table s3 of sand increased from 23 6 1 3 mv to 21 9 1 4 mv in the presence of 11 2 mg l fe2 when the low concentration 2 mg l of smx co transport with fe2 the zeta potential of sand decreased from 23 6 1 3 mv to 26 2 1 5 mv while it recovered to 25 4 1 7 mv when the concentration of smx increased to 50 mg l it can be inferred that the addition of smx increases the negative charge of quartz sand and enhances the electrostatic attraction between the quartz sand and fe2 moreover it increases the adsorption sites of fe2 by forming sand iron smx bridges on the sand surface shao et al 2020 which promotes the oxidation of fe2 however the negative charge on the sand surface did not increase with the increase of smx concentration and the do consumption decreased accordingly fig s4a therefore we presume that high concentration of smx will compete with iron for adsorption sites on the sand thus reducing the contact probability between fe2 and oxygen on the sand surface and inhibiting the oxidation of fe2 therefore low concentrations of smx enhance the electrostatic attraction between quartz sand and fe2 and ultimately promotes the formation of lepidocrocite however increasing the concentration of smx no longer increases the charge of the sand instead smx competes with fe2 for adsorption sites on the sand thus weakening this promotion effect 3 5 2 effects of otc and ofl on fe2 transport unlike smx different concentrations of otc and ofl promote the iron transport in quartz column fig 2f i in the ofl and fe2 co transport system the content of residual fe in the column was significantly lower than that in the single fe2 transport system and decreased with the increase of ofl concentration and the amorphous fe iii was always dominant 87 76 and 47 at the bottom of the column respectively fig 4 additionally the proportion of fe iii at the bottom of sand column decreased from 95 61 to 70 59 and 64 10 with the addition of 2 and 50 mg l ofl to fe2 transport system respectively table 1 it was concluded that with the increase of ofl concentration the inhibition effect on the formation of lepidocrocite was further enhanced in otc and fe2 co transport system fe content in sand column also decreased gradually with the increase of antibiotic concentration but mainly in amorphous fe ii 47 69 and 72 at the bottom of the column respectively fig 4 in addition compared to the single fe2 transport system fe ii increased gradually in the whole sand column and was nearly equal to fe iii with the increase of otc concentration table 1 in addition the concentration of fe2 remained in equilibrium in otc and fe2 co transport system when oxygen content tended to be fixed fig s4b it is speculated that there is newly generated fe2 in the column resulting from the redox process of fe3 otc complex wang et al 2015 to demonstrate this we conducted the co transport column experiments of otc and fe3 and detected the presence of fe2 by acid extraction from the reacted sand figure s10 overall both otc and ofl can reduced the total iron retention in the column and inhibit the formation of lepidocrocite through complexation the difference is that the presence of otc tends to equalize the amount of fe ii and fe iii in the column which is due to the redox cycle between fe3 and fe2 4 conclusion this is the first study to investigate the reactive co transport of fe2 and antibiotics in quartz sand columns during simulated groundwater discharge to surface water the results showed that fe2 inhibited the transport of otc and ofl while had little effect on that of smx in sand column at the same time fe2 was oxidized on the porous media to form weak crystallinity lepidocrocite during simulated groundwater discharge different types and concentrations of antibiotics had different effects on the transport and morphological transformation of fe2 fig 6 the co transport mechanisms of antibiotics with fe2 were as follows i smx facilitates the conversion of fe2 to lepidocrocite by altering the zeta potential of porous media ii fe2 fe3 has a strong tendency of complexing with otc and ofl that inhibit the conversion of fe2 into lepidocrocite iii fe3 can oxidize otc and reduce itself to fe2 thus facilitating the transport of more dissolved fe2 into solute our study indicates that antibiotics will affect the biogeochemical cycle of fe2 in the hyporheic zone and thus lead to changes in their own environmental fate due to the detection limit the co transport process of antibiotics and fe2 was not discussed at ng level in this study to better understand the co transport behavior of antibiotics and fe2 in hz it is necessary to study the effect of increasing oxygen in porous media during the discharge of river water to groundwater meanwhile the coupling effect of other

1902,iron redox is often coupled with the degradation and conversion of co existing organic pollutants however their co transport behavior in hyporheic zone is not clear in this study the characteristics and mechanism of reactive co transport of fe2 and antibiotics during groundwater discharge were revealed by quartz sand column simulation it was found that fe2 inhibited the transport of three antibiotics sulfamethoxazole smx ofloxacin ofl and oxytetracycline otc in the quartz column and the average inhibitory intensity was otc 80 ofl 20 smx 2 meanwhile the content of dissolved oxygen in the column decreased from more than 7 mg l to 3 mg l fe2 transport in the column was promoted with the increase of otc and ofl concentrations 2 50 mg l as fe2 otc and fe2 ofl complexes inhibited the formation of lepidocrocite and induced fe2 fe3 cycling during co transport of fe2 and otc in contrast the interaction between smx and fe2 was not obvious due to the electrostatic repulsion due to the prevalence of fe2 and antibiotics in groundwater system especially with high antibiotic contamination this study provides a new perspective on the potential environmental impacts of fe and pollutants co transport during groundwater discharge keywords iron redox antibiotics complexation degradation lepidocrocite data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the global consumption of antibiotics has increased dramatically due to the population growth and the high incidence of infectious diseases klein et al 2018 commonly used antibiotics such as oxytetracycline ofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole are widely present in the environment due to their strong broad spectrum antibacterial activity huang et al 2018 wang et al 2017b and high utilization rate rodriguez escales et al 2016 however long term residues of antibiotics in the environment can induce the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistant genes klein et al 2018 sarmah et al 2006 threatening the safety of surface and groundwater quality pullagurala et al 2018 in contrast to the surface environment the transport and conversion of antibiotics in groundwater systems have not received sufficient attention as a transition zone connecting surface water and groundwater the hyporheic zone hz is an active biogeochemical region with redox fluctuations jung et al 2015 which is also considered as natural filters for pollutants and nutrients zhao et al 2021 many organic micropollutants such as antibiotics have been detected in hz li et al 2022 and their concentrations decreased with the increase of aquifer depth indicating that the porous aquifer serves as an important place for antibiotics adsorption and biodegradation peralta maraver et al 2018 it is well known that the dissolved oxygen do is a key environmental variable that drives a series of redox processes in hz kaufman et al 2017 previous studies have reported that the maximum concentration of do in surface water is usually near saturation 7 9 11 3 mg l while that in pore water is very limited 1 1 4 3 mg l naranjo et al 2015 in hz rivers carry do into groundwater promoting redox reactions in the riverbed and groundwater also brings reducing substances while recharging surface water this process can lead to changes in the redox state of susceptible components such as fe mn dong et al 2020 which may play an important role in pollutants removal fe is one of the most important active components in hz and the concentration of fe2 is usually between 0 5 and 5 mg l in groundwater of han river basin lu et al 2022 due to the frequent fluctuation of oxygen content in hz fe is prone to redox changes under chemical and microbial interactions during groundwater discharge fe2 is easily oxidized to fe iii minerals by oxygen lu et al 2022 ratie et al 2019 and hydroxyl radicals oh will be generated in the rapid oxidation process to degrade pollutants tong et al 2016 xie et al 2020 in addition aqueous fe2 can affect the conversion of co existing organic compounds in the environment through complexation fe iii minerals also often act as mobile carriers to promote the transport of organic matter carstens et al 2018 and play an important role in contaminants cycling in the subsurface environments hassellov von der kammer 2008 li et al 2019 current studies mainly focus on the effects of fe conversion on pollutants under static conditions pimentel et al 2021 rodriguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 zheng et al 2017 e g complexation of fe2 fe3 and tetracycline antibiotics tcs wang et al 2016 as well as electrostatic adsorption of tc on fe iii mineral surfaces wu et al 2019 however the transport of fe2 in hz and its effect on the fate of antibiotics under dynamic oxygen changes have not been studied therefore we investigated the reactive co transport of fe2 and antibiotics in the process of groundwater discharge by one dimensional simulated column experiment with quartz sand as saturated porous medium the aim of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the co transport behavior of fe2 and antibiotics in hz not only to investigate the effect of fe2 on the fate of antibiotics but also to reveal the effects of different antibiotics on fe2 transport and iron species transformation by comparing the breakthrough curves btcs obtained from fe2 and antibiotics co transport experiments we found that fe2 has a great effect on antibiotics transport in porous media while different types of antibiotics have different mechanisms on iron conversion furthermore the mechanisms affecting the co transport behavior of fe2 and antibiotics was revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals quartz sand sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china with a size range of 0 25 0 42 mm 40 60 mesh was used as the porous media antibiotics including smx sulfamethoxazole 98 and ofl ofloxacin 98 were

sigma aldrich trading co ltd other chemicals were of analytical purity or above section s1 experimental solutions were prepared with 18 2 mω cm di water 2 2 column experiments an organic glass column with 15 cm length and 2 cm inner diameter was used for the experiment the columns were gradually wet packed with clean sand in an increment of 2 cm layers the porosity of the sand column was 0 4 detailed sand cleaning procedure and column packing are provided in section s2 and section s3 before column experiment the background solution 0 01 mol l nacl was injected from the bottom of the column using a peristaltic pump at a pore velocity of 4 ml min for more than 12 h to saturate the column and establish steady state saturated flow condition kbr or mixed solutions of different concentration ratios of fe2 and anaerobic antibiotic were injected into the column and then the anaerobic background solution 0 01 mol l nacl was passed into the column for elution since fe2 would reduce the ph value of the solution a certain proportion of pipes was used to maintain the ph at 6 8 chen et al 2018 in addition the aqueous mixed solutions of iron and antibiotic into the column were kept anaerobic in the dark and was well connected to the column apparatus throughout the experiment a semi automatic collector with centrifuge tubes was used to collect the effluent every 4 min the centrifuge tube was pre filled with 20 µl of 6 mol l hcl to prevent fe2 oxidation and separate antibiotics from iron complexes the specific experimental setup and summary of column experimental conditions are shown in figure s1 and table s1 the c c0 mentioned in the text refers to the ratio of the concentration of the target substance before and after transport from the column br concentration was measured with bromine electrode oxygen sensor spots reeder et al 2018 oxygen sensitive spot presens precision sensing gmbh regensburg germany were attached to the inner wall of the organic glass column at a height of 2 5 7 5 and 12 5 cm from the bottom respectively during column experiments do changes were monitored in real time using noninvasive optode technique fibox 4 presens gmbh regensburg germany 2 3 determination of antibiotics the concentration of antibiotic was determined by hplc lc 20at shimadzu japan with a c18 reverse phase column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 µm before detection water samples were filtered through a 0 22 µm polyethersulfone pes membrane to separate suspended particles specific testing methods for antibiotics are provided in section s4 2 4 analyses of iron concentrations the concentration of fe2 in column effluent was determined by the 1 10 phenanthroline method tamura et al 1974 using an enzyme labeled instrument infinite 200 pro nano quant tecan germany to obtain the content of fe ii and fe iii species in the experimental column the reacted quartz sand column was divided into three layers in the anaerobic chamber and then different forms of iron were extracted by chemical classification chen et al 2022b claff et al 2010 scouller et al 2006 yuan et al 2018 specific extraction steps are provided in section s5 2 5 characterization of quartz sand after the column experiment the reacted quartz sand column was divided into three layers according to the height in an anaerobic chamber and lyophilized under anaerobic conditions the lyophilized quartz particles were determined by raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy sem in addition lyophilized samples are ground in an anaerobic chamber and passed through a 200 mesh sieve for x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps detection xps spectra were obtained on a vg multilab 2000 x ray electron energy spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa raman spectroscopy of the reacted quartz sand was measured by alpha 300 r raman sem eds particlescout witec germany to obtain the morphology and structure of fe2 oxidation products the samples were scanned by sem eds su8010 hitachi japan the zeta potential of crushed quartz sand was determined with zeta plus potential analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk at room temperature 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 column transport characteristics of br and fe2 a conservative br breakthrough curve btc was used to describe the water flow behavior in a quartz sand column fig 1 a the btc of br had good symmetry with no trailing indicating that the column was filled uniformly without cracks and preferential flow btc of fe2 fig 1b reached a peak rapidly in 0 4 pore volume pv and then began to decrease between 4 and 29 pv until the anaerobic background solution was injected 29 35 pv compared with br the btc peak value of fe2 was significantly lower and the symmetry was poor indicating that fe2 was non equilibrium adsorption and unstable during column transport when fe2 transports in the sand column we found that the bottom of the column turned yellow fig s2a indicating that fe2 may be oxidized to form fe iii minerals and adsorbed on quartz sand it has been reported that fe2 is difficult to be adsorbed by quartz sand but it is easy to be oxidized to form fe iii minerals under aerobic conditions klüpfel et al 2014 in general fe2 forms lepidocrocite in the early oxidation stage and then transformed from weak crystalline minerals such as lepidocrocite to high crystalline minerals vogelsang et al 2016 moreover the differences of oxygen and fe2 content will lead to different iron minerals chen and thompson 2018 therefore the mineral composition of column sand was characterized by raman spectroscopy according to the results the raman spectra of fe2 oxidation products matched the characteristic peak of lepidocrocite 249 cm 1 das and hendry 2011 indicating that fe2 was oxidized to form lepidocrocite figure s3 in addition the sem images of the reacted column sand fig 1d showed that the sheet like lepidocrocite was significantly different from the smooth surface of clean quartz sand fig 1c since oxygen is an important factor affecting fe2 conversion park and dempsey 2005 do changes in the column were monitored in real time figure s4 it was found that the oxygen value of the top middle and low parts of the column decreased rapidly 0 10 pv at first and then slowly 10 29 pv due to the consumption by fe2 oxidation and finally stabilized at 3 mg l fig 1e notably oxygen consumption hindered further oxidation of fe2 chen and thompson 2018a but the transport volume of fe2 continued to decrease when do stopped declining we speculated that this may be due to the non equilibrium adsorption of fe2 by oxidation generated lepidocrocite therefore adsorption capacity of reacted quartz sand to iron was verified and found that iron oxide coated sand has strong adsorption capacity for fe2 under anaerobic and aerobic conditions fig s5a d the concentration of fe2 in the solution decreased with the increase of iron oxide coated sand content furthermore a higher amount of iron oxide coated sand results in a higher value of the δ adsorption quantity of fe2 fig s5b e the strong adsorption of fe2 exhibited by iron oxide coated sand is probably ascribed to the quick electron transfer between fe ii sorbed and fe iii lattice and induced formation of high crystalline fe ii phases that hindered fe2 oxidation chen et al 2022a it can be concluded from the btc results of fe2 that the oxidation process plays a dominant role in 0 10 pv while the combined effect of fe2 oxidation and adsorption of iron oxide coated sand is the main factor in 10 29 pv non equilibrium oxidation of fe2 during transport may be due to the catalytic effect and adsorption of fe iii formed by the oxidation of fe2 electron transfer and complexation hanna et al 2013 williams and scherer 2004 which eventually leads to lower breakthrough concentrations of fe2 3 2 transport of antibiotics in the absence presence of fe2 as can be seen from the transport of different concentrations of antibiotics in the sand column fig 2 a d g the btcs of antibiotics lagged behind that of br at all concentrations indicating a non equilibrium and hysteresis transport process park and huwe 2016 compared to otc and ofl the btcs of single smx existed better stability with higher c c0 plateaus of 100 100 and 99 at 2 10 and 50 mg l respectively while lower c c0 plateaus were observed in single otc 89 94 and 98 and ofl 95 99 and 99 transporting at relative concentrations in general antibiotic transport in the column is mainly affected by adsorption and the different physicochemical properties of antibiotics should be considered e g molecular size number and type of functional groups surface charge etc rodriguez escales and sanchez vila 2016 under neutral conditions the net surface charge of quartz sand is negative and most of the negative sites come from broken edges of silicon oxides sio zhang et al 2021 at this point more than 90 of smx exists in the form of smx and a small amount of smx exists as smx0 table s2 as mentioned above the high mobility of smx is due to its low adsorption equilibrium constant k f on quartz sand dong et al 2021 and may also attribute to the electrostatic repulsion between smx and negatively charged sand under the study conditions considering that the mobility of otc and ofl without fe2 in the column is lower than that of smx we speculated that they were more likely to be adsorbed or degraded in the presence of ofl exists in the form of ofl the electrostatic attraction between ofl and negatively charged sand contributed to the higher adsorption of ofl wang et al 2017a tetracycline has a relatively short environmental half life is unstable and prone to spontaneous hydrolysis meanwhile the silica surface of sand has nanoscale roughness and chemical heterogeneity yang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 which is conducive to the adsorption and catalytic acceleration of otc hydrolysis kang et al 2012 overall the electrostatic repulsion between smx and negatively charged sand as well as the stability of smx led to a good transport performance of smx for otc and ofl the less residue in the column may be due to self hydrolysis and sand adsorption during the co transport with fe2 lower c c0 plateaus of btcs were observed in otc and ofl compared with that of single antibiotics transport fig 2 the c c0 of otc and ofl at 2 10 and 50 mg l was approximately 0 17 and 38 and 78 85 and 95 respectively it can be inferred that the co existence of fe2 inhibited the transport of both otc and ofl and the inhibitory effect on otc was much stronger than ofl however the co existence of fe2 had little effect on smx transport and the btc with different concentrations of smx still has a high plateau in the 96 98 range 3 3 effects of different antibiotics on fe2 transport the effect of different concentrations of antibiotics on fe2 transport varied greatly low concentration of smx 2 mg l inhibited the transport of fe2 but the inhibitory effect was weakened with the increase of smx concentration fig 2c notably low concentration of smx 2 mg l reduced the peak value of btc to 56 while 10 mg l and 50 mg l of smx increased it to 83 and 88 respectively in contrast the presence of otc and ofl both promoted the transport of fe2 in quartz sand and the effect was more pronounced with the increase of antibiotic concentration fig 2f i at concentration of 50 mg l ofl was more effective on iron transport than otc with the btc peak of 95 and 79 respectively differently the btc shape of fe2 remained unchanged in the presence of ofl while the btcs of fe2 in the presence of otc showed good symmetry and no tailing indicating the reaction equilibrium of fe2 overall fe2 inhibited the transport of three antibiotics in sand column and the inhibition intensity was otc ofl smx on the contrary both otc and ofl can promote fe2 transport in the column and the promoting effect enhanced monotonically with the increase of antibiotic concentration in addition the shape of the btc of fe2 changed and had good symmetry in the presence of otc 3 4 effect mechanisms of fe2 on antibiotics transport compared to the transport of a single antibiotic the mechanism of antibiotics transport in the co existence of fe2 was more complex such as degradation by oh generated by fe2 oxidation iron and antibiotics complexation encapsulation and adsorption of iron oxidized minerals during the co transport of smx and fe2 a small amount of smx residue in the column was attributed to the electrostatic adsorption caused by the positive charge on the surface of quartz sand after fe2 was oxidized to fe iii mineral previous studies have suggested that there are more functional groups such as hydroxyl groups and reactive high gibbs free energy on the iron oxide coated sand surfaces than that on clean sand which provides more adsorption sites for antibiotics haham et al 2012 wu et al 2016 xing et al 2020 and promotes the surface complexation chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 conversely the btc values of otc and ofl were greatly reduced in the presence of fe2 suggesting that otc and ofl transport may be inhibited by adsorption encapsulation or degradation in the column we measured the residues of different forms of antibiotic in the post reaction column figure s6 and section s6 the extraction results showed that only a small amount of otc less than 4 00 and ofl 24 00 were detected the weak adsorption and chemisorption of otc and ofl accounted for 1 00 2 19 and 2 77 21 02 respectively due to the small proportion of adsorbed and wrapped antibiotics in the extract it was speculated that the otc and ofl losses in co transport system were mainly due to the degradation to verify the degradation of antibiotics in co transport system we measured the content of oh produced in the column tong et al 2022 sodium benzoate was used to capture oh and the results showed that the production of oh increased with the increase of fe2 content and the maximum accumulated concentration was 1 41 µm fig 1f indicating that fe2 could be oxidized to produce oh in the aerobic column furthermore 0 5 mol l isopropanol quencher was added to the co transport experiment to verify the contribution of oh on antibiotic degradation fig 3 a and fig 3b showed that the contribution of oh to the degradation of otc at different concentrations ranged from 91 75 to 52 72 while that of ofl was about 70 section s7 from the results oh plays a leading role in otc degradation while a limited role in ofl degradation for ofl the degradation pathway of ofl is that oh groups attacks the ring of ofl molecule to produce hydroxylated products and these intermediate degradation products are further oxidized by oh through continuous ring cleavage reaction weng et al 2020 however the contribution of oh to the degradation of otc and ofl 78 78 and 63 16 was lower than that inferred by chemical extraction 96 81 and 76 21 10 mg l in column system figure s6 and section s7 we speculated that this difference may be caused by the complexation of fe2 with tcs and fqs which can promote the degradation sagdinc et al 2004 wang et al 2016 therefore the complexation of otc ofl with fe2 and fe3 was further investigated by uv absorption spectroscopy as can be seen from the results figures s7 s8 the maximum absorption peaks of otc and ofl were 361 nm and 288 nm respectively under aerobic or anaerobic conditions fe2 fe3 solutions did not exhibit noticeable absorbance with the addition of fe2 or fe3 the absorption peak of otc red shifted from 354 nm to 361 nm or 366 nm figure s7a d while that of ofl red shifted from 288 nm to 289 nm or 291 nm respectively figure s8a d thus the maximum absorption peaks of fe2 otc and fe2 ofl complexes were 361 and 289 nm while those of fe3 otc and fe3 ofl complexes were 366 and 291 nm respectively by comparing with the control group antibiotic only we found that the addition of fe2 or fe3 promoted the reduction of otc figure s7f and ofl figure s8f under aerobic and anaerobic conditions however fe2 has a stronger removal effect on otc than on ofl which may be attributed to the special cyclic redox process of iron ions in the coexistence system of fe2 and otc otc is complexed with fe2 under anoxic conditions at the beginning of the experiment when entering the aerobic quartz sand column fe2 and fe2 otc complexes are easily oxidized to fe3 and fe3 otc complex and oh will accelerate the removal of otc meanwhile the otc molecule in the fe3 otc complex acts as the electron donor of fe3 and generates new fe2 wang et al 2015 which oxidized to fe3 and forms a fe2 fe3 cycle in the column this is the speculation for the dynamic equilibrium of the btc of fe2 in otc fe2 co transport system for ofl iron ions can chelate to the ofl in the complexes through ring carbonyl and one of the carboxylic oxygen atoms thus affecting the stability of ofl sagdinc and bayari 2004 therefore fe2 can effectively remove otc ofl through complexation and conversion and the cyclic redox process of fe2 and otc promotes the stronger removal of fe2 on otc in conclusion the co existence of fe2 does not affect the transport of smx due to the electrostatic repulsion and negligible adsorption of quartz sand in contrast the removal of otc and ofl by fe2 is mainly through complexation conversion and fe2 oxidation process in addition the wrapping effect of iron oxidation mineralization process and the surface adsorption after iron oxidation mineralization also contribute to the removal of otc and ofl 3 5 effect mechanism of co existing antibiotics on fe2 transport and fe morphology transformation in quartz sand 3 5 1 effect of smx on fe2 transport since iron morphology is prone to transformation we explored the form and content of fe in the reacted sand of different co transport column the chemical extraction of fe ii fe iii morphology was performed from quartz sand fig 4 and the proportion of fe iii and fe ii under different column conditions was analyzed by xps spectroscopy table 1 and figure s9 in the absence of antibiotics the iron content at the bottom of the column was higher than that in other parts and it mainly existed in the form of amorphous fe iii with the highest proportion of 95 61 followed by amorphous fe ii crystalline fe iii and adsorbed fe ii photo of the reacted column also showed that the yellow color of the sand was darker at the bottom of the column than other parts fig s2a with the continuous input of fe2 a little amount of amorphous fe iii gradually converted to crystalline fe iii it was found that the effect of smx on fe2 was significantly different from that of otc and ofl in co transport system photos of the columns showed a darker yellow color at the bottom as the concentration of smx decreased fig s2b c d similarly sem results showed a significant increase in the amount of lepidocrocite on sand surface at low concentrations of smx 2 mg l while it decreased with the increase of smx concentration 50 mg l fig 5 a b compared with the single fe2 transport system 0 01 the proportion crystalline fe iii increased in co transport column from 1 to 4 13 and 16 at the bottom of the column respectively although the proportion of amorphous fe iii remained dominant 83 73 and 70 at the bottom of the column respectively the residual amount of fe in the column of low concentration co transport system 2 mg l was significantly higher than that in single fe2 transport system but it gradually decreased as the smx concentration increased from 2 to 50 mg l fig 4 and table 1 therefore as the concentration of smx increases the proportion of crystalline fe iii increases gradually although the content of residual fe in the column decreases suggesting that smx promotes the conversion of amorphous fe iii to crystalline fe iii as well as more lepidocrocite were observed since the column transport of smx is almost unaffected by fe2 we speculate that it may be controlled by electrostatic action on the sand surface it was found that the zeta potential fig 5 c and table s3 of sand increased from 23 6 1 3 mv to 21 9 1 4 mv in the presence of 11 2 mg l fe2 when the low concentration 2 mg l of smx co transport with fe2 the zeta potential of sand decreased from 23 6 1 3 mv to 26 2 1 5 mv while it recovered to 25 4 1 7 mv when the concentration of smx increased to 50 mg l it can be inferred that the addition of smx increases the negative charge of quartz sand and enhances the electrostatic attraction between the quartz sand and fe2 moreover it increases the adsorption sites of fe2 by forming sand iron smx bridges on the sand surface shao et al 2020 which promotes the oxidation of fe2 however the negative charge on the sand surface did not increase with the increase of smx concentration and the do consumption decreased accordingly fig s4a therefore we presume that high concentration of smx will compete with iron for adsorption sites on the sand thus reducing the contact probability between fe2 and oxygen on the sand surface and inhibiting the oxidation of fe2 therefore low concentrations of smx enhance the electrostatic attraction between quartz sand and fe2 and ultimately promotes the formation of lepidocrocite however increasing the concentration of smx no longer increases the charge of the sand instead smx competes with fe2 for adsorption sites on the sand thus weakening this promotion effect 3 5 2 effects of otc and ofl on fe2 transport unlike smx different concentrations of otc and ofl promote the iron transport in quartz column fig 2f i in the ofl and fe2 co transport system the content of residual fe in the column was significantly lower than that in the single fe2 transport system and decreased with the increase of ofl concentration and the amorphous fe iii was always dominant 87 76 and 47 at the bottom of the column respectively fig 4 additionally the proportion of fe iii at the bottom of sand column decreased from 95 61 to 70 59 and 64 10 with the addition of 2 and 50 mg l ofl to fe2 transport system respectively table 1 it was concluded that with the increase of ofl concentration the inhibition effect on the formation of lepidocrocite was further enhanced in otc and fe2 co transport system fe content in sand column also decreased gradually with the increase of antibiotic concentration but mainly in amorphous fe ii 47 69 and 72 at the bottom of the column respectively fig 4 in addition compared to the single fe2 transport system fe ii increased gradually in the whole sand column and was nearly equal to fe iii with the increase of otc concentration table 1 in addition the concentration of fe2 remained in equilibrium in otc and fe2 co transport system when oxygen content tended to be fixed fig s4b it is speculated that there is newly generated fe2 in the column resulting from the redox process of fe3 otc complex wang et al 2015 to demonstrate this we conducted the co transport column experiments of otc and fe3 and detected the presence of fe2 by acid extraction from the reacted sand figure s10 overall both otc and ofl can reduced the total iron retention in the column and inhibit the formation of lepidocrocite through complexation the difference is that the presence of otc tends to equalize the amount of fe ii and fe iii in the column which is due to the redox cycle between fe3 and fe2 4 conclusion this is the first study to investigate the reactive co transport of fe2 and antibiotics in quartz sand columns during simulated groundwater discharge to surface water the results showed that fe2 inhibited the transport of otc and ofl while had little effect on that of smx in sand column at the same time fe2 was oxidized on the porous media to form weak crystallinity lepidocrocite during simulated groundwater discharge different types and concentrations of antibiotics had different effects on the transport and morphological transformation of fe2 fig 6 the co transport mechanisms of antibiotics with fe2 were as follows i smx facilitates the conversion of fe2 to lepidocrocite by altering the zeta potential of porous media ii fe2 fe3 has a strong tendency of complexing with otc and ofl that inhibit the conversion of fe2 into lepidocrocite iii fe3 can oxidize otc and reduce itself to fe2 thus facilitating the transport of more dissolved fe2 into solute our study indicates that antibiotics will affect the biogeochemical cycle of fe2 in the hyporheic zone and thus lead to changes in their own environmental fate due to the detection limit the co transport process of antibiotics and fe2 was not discussed at ng level in this study to better understand the co transport behavior of antibiotics and fe2 in hz it is necessary to study the effect of increasing oxygen in porous media during the discharge of river water to groundwater meanwhile the coupling effect of other environmental factors on the transformation of iron form is also worth studying funding this work was supported by the key project grant no 41830862 general project grant no 42277068 and 41772364 of

1903,the assessment of the response time of a karst aquifer is an important step towards the development of conceptual models from which tools for water resources planning and management could be applied the aim of this work is to evaluate the applicability of the joint use of statistical time lag evaluation and dye tracer tests techniques with a double objective 1 the development of conceptual models on the hydrogeological functioning that include the duality in the aquifer recharge processes as well as the particularities of the preferential drainage flowpaths respect to the global response of the aquifers 2 to establish a reference frame to foresee with enough time in anticipation the potential affections derived from the concentrated recharge to the springs required in the creation of water quality monitoring networks and early warning systems to water pollution in the ubrique karst aquifer southern spain the empirical relationships between the intensity i of rainfall events recharge and the time lag t observed in the springs that draining the aquifer have been quantified the establishment of the curve i t constitutes a reliable tool for the prediction of potential affections to the springs intended for urban supply derived from recharge events on the other hand the comparison of the values drawn in the i t curve characteristic of each spring with those derived from three tracer tests has allowed further advances in the understanding of the aquifer functioning and the influence of concentrated recharge on the global system behavior to be achieved keywords carbonate karst aquifer time lag recharge dye tracer test cross correlation function southern spain data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction carbonate massifs are particularly susceptible to fracturing and karstification phenomena forming complex aquifer systems in which the infiltration of water occurs through stratification surfaces discontinuities and or fissures enlarged by dissolution and within the rock matrix this set of elements generally constitutes a hierarchical drainage network capable of rapidly transmitting large volumes of water from infiltration zones recharge areas to natural drainage points generally springs there are several factors that control recharge in these systems climatic conditions lithology and degree of karstification topographic position soil surface components vegetation texture porosity fractures etc slope and soil moisture andreo et al 2008 fu et al 2015 galibert 2016 in addition tectonics is a factor that increases the complexity of aquifer systems often being a critical element affecting hydrogeological behaviour particularly in mountainous regions goldscheider 2005 perrin and luetscher 2008 sanz de galdeano et al 2019 de la torre et al 2020 due to these factors karst aquifers present a high degree of heterogeneity spatial anisotropy in their hydrogeological properties bakalowicz 2005 ford and williams 2007 worthington and ford 2009 being also much more vulnerable to contamination than other systems doerfliger and zwahlen 1998 marín and andreo 2015 marín et al 2021 hartmann et al 2021 it is essential therefore to highlight the strategic dimension of carbonate aquifers and to manage the foreseeable water scarcity crisis induced by global climate change konapala et al 2020 since around 25 of the world s population supplies its demands with water from this type of aquifers eu 1995 ford and williams 2007 stevanović 2018 the implementation and contrast of several research methodologies provide a consistent framework to improve knowledge about karst aquifer functioning including aspects related to recharge mechanisms trček 2007 charlier et al 2012 surface water groundwater relationship bailly comte et al 2009 transport dynamics towards preferential drainage routes schuler et al 2020 groundwater flow and storage at different aquifer components perrin et al 2003 or internal aquifer geometry bodin et al 2022 among others hydrological methods water balance hydrodynamic analyses etc deserve special attention since they have demonstrated applicability to elucidate conceptual schemes of functioning in geologically complex contexts padilla and pulido bosch 1995 groves et al 2007 el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 de la torre et al 2020 in this sense some authors jiang et al 2008 galibert 2016 discussed the close relationship between the precipitation intensity considering effective rainfall as the primary factor controlling the aquifer recharge and the time lag until input detection at shallow subsurface observation points based on mangin s correlation analysis 1981 delbart et al 2014 extend this relationship by studying the temporal variability of water transfer through the infiltration zone of karst aquifers using the sliding window cross correlation function swccf to estimate the time lag between rainfall and the piezometric level time series in wells and boreholes as indicators of the recharge effects it should be noted that the hydrodynamic conditions of the aquifer prior to a recharge event can modify the responses hydrochemical and hydrodynamic that are recorded at the discharge points perrin et al 2003 bicalho et al 2012 fu et al 2015 the application of delbart et al 2014 approach to the entire aquifer considering natural discharge points springs as the reference of the hydrodynamic response has the advantage of achieving a global assessment of the aquifer functioning moreover the use of precipitation the driving cause of the system response as a temporal reference for evaluating the impacts of quick recharge events on springs shows relevant benefits since rainfall records are usually real time available and provide a wider temporal range than indicators based on intrinsic water parameters whose detection is an immediate indication of water pollution hence it is expected that the empirical relationship between the input signal and its hydraulic effects in the outlets rainfall intensity i versus response lag time t i t curve in this document provide a quantitative predictive tool for assessing the impact of recharge processes on discharge points especially valuable when these are intended for human supply the joint use of the i t curves characteristic of the global system response with results derived from dye tracer tests whose usefulness in karst hydrogeology is well known benischke et al 2007 goldscheider et al 2008 adds the perspective of the time lags along defined drainage flow paths commonly between concentrated infiltration points and springs consequently the combination of both methods under the same approach would open new insights for inferring the presence and influence of geometric constraints that may exert a noteworthy incidence on the velocity of input signal transmission into the aquifer the main aim of this work is therefore to advance on the understanding of the factors that drive the hydrodynamic time lag in binary karst aquifers under different hydrometeorological conditions affecting recharge volume in addition we try to explore the potential of the joint application of hydrological analysis tools and dye tracer tests to gain a deeper insight on the mechanisms that modulate the response of these aquifers to recharge processes with an integral view both temporal and spatial the approach presented here could help in management strategies with special relevance to those oriented to protect the water supply sources in karst aquifers in fact the test site where our approach is applied sierra de ubrique s spain acts as pilot area for the development of early warning systems ews to avoid the water pollution during flooding events marín et al 2021 martín rodríguez et al 2022 the establishment of the lag time of the point draining the system and used as sources of urban water supply may constitute the necessary conceptual framework for the implementation of control algorithms and to enhance their predictability when faced with increasingly changing and extreme hydroclimatic scenarios richts and vrba 2017 1 1 site settings the ubrique aquifer is a binary karst system located at ne area of the cádiz province southern spain fig 1 with a total surface effective recharge area of 26 06 km2 the karst system is formed by two mountainous massifs caíllo and ubrique sierras with a ragged orography from 317 to 1395 m a s l dominated by outcrops of carbonate rocks jurassic dolostones and limestones the prevailing climate in the area is humid mediterranean with a noteworthy seasonal pattern in the annual distribution of precipitation and air temperature rainfall mainly occurs from autumn to springtime related to wet winds coming from the atlantic ocean the mean annual precipitation and air temperature values recorded in this area from 1984 85 to 2017 18 were respectively 1305 mm and 14 8 c spatial distributions of both precipitation and temperature values are mostly conditioned by the altitude and the orientation of major hillsides the accumulated rainfall amount for each hydrological year comprising the study period considered in this work from october 2013 to september 2018 was respectively 1 348 mm 2013 2014 1 071 mm 2014 2015 1 208 mm 2015 2016 807 mm 2016 2017 and 1 710 mm 2017 2018 table 1 the annual rainfall values were obtained through the spatial distribution of the isohyets lines for each hydrological year despite of rainfall amounts several townships in the region dependent of groundwater resources for water supply are affected by seasonal restrictions geologically the pilot site and surrounding areas are located within the westernmost sector of the betic cordillera specifically within the so called penibetic domain of the external zone martín algarra 1987 the stratigraphic series of this domain consists of around 500 m thick jurassic dolostones and limestones which present late triassic clays dolomitic beds sandstones and evaporite rocks mainly gypsum at the bottom and early cretaceous tertiary marly limestones and marls at the top surrounding and overlaying all these rocks tertiary flysch type clays and sandstones outcrops figs 1 and 2 the geological structure is characterized by ne sw pluri kilometer size open anticline folds and narrow synclines affected by reverse faults from which overthrusts were developed with vergence towards n nw tectonic gave rise to a series of imbricate thrusts with the triassic rocks overthrusting cretaceous marls under jurassic carbonate formations cross section 1 1 in fig 2 apart from these shortening features the entire structure has been affected by normal faults in a mainly nne ssw direction and oblique strike slip fractures caused by extensional accommodation of prior structures jiménez bonilla et al 2017 the sw border of the sierra de ubrique has been also affected by a more recent set of normal faults related to gravitational collapses which configure the orography in that sector cross section 2 2 the large outcrops of jurassic limestones densely fractured jointly with bedding planes and the prevailing climate conditions have favored a noteworthy development of exokarst landforms delannoy 1987 1999 karrenfields dolines sinkholes and shafts besides the presence of low permeability outcrops marls and clays related to synclinal folds and faults have contributed to the development of endorheic drainage areas which caused the quick infiltration of runoff water generated during rainfall events through several swallow holes hydrologically connected with shafts and other endokarst features in general a patchy soil cover up to 10 20 cm thick can be found especially where the slope is low overall vegetation is typically mediterranean with shrub growth forest and pasture except for the highest areas where there is neither soil development nor vegetation in these areas large karrenfields exist over bare carbonate rocks in hydrogeological terms the ubrique karst system is formed by fractured and karstified jurassic carbonate rocks limited by low permeability materials cretaceous tertiary marls triassic clays and flysch clays in almost all their borders figs 1 and 2 the geometry of the aquifer is particularly determined by the flat hinge anticline structure and occasionally by low permeability materials imbricates below the thrust surfaces andreo et al 2014 recharge takes place by two mechanisms binary karst system by direct infiltration of rainwater over the bare carbonate outcrops autogenic component 24 03 km2 and by concentrated infiltration of runoff water coming from small neighbor catchments formed by low permeability materials allogenic component 2 03 km2 the hydrogeological connection of three of the swallow holes sh 1 sh 2 and sh 3 in fig 1 with some of the springs was proved using dye tracers hydrogeochemical tools applied to this site also revealed the existence of an incipient degree of contamination affecting the system as a whole marín et al 2021 whose origin would be associated with the infiltration of surface runoff water through the villaluenga del rosario shaft sh 1 in fig 1 this point receives the poorly treated wastewater from 500 inhabitants urban area of villaluenga del rosario as well as the remains of the livestock activity over an endorheic area of 2 03 km2 fig 1 groundwater discharge occurs along the w border of the carbonate outcrops through two perennial springs sited at the ubrique urban area cornicabra and algarrobal springs located at 349 and 317 m a s l respectively plus two overflow springs one located north of ubrique town alto ofs 521 m a s l and other one sited at the sw border of the sierra de ubrique garciago 422 m a s l general background information about the hydrogeological settings of the pilot site can be found in previous works sánchez et al 2016 sánchez et al 2018 marín et al 2021 martín rodríguez et al 2022 2 material and methods 2 1 data availability and hydrodynamic analyses continuous discharge data from cornicabra and algarrobal permanent outlets and also from garciago overflow spring was hourly recorded during five hydrological years by using odysseytm capacitance water level loggers properly gauged with its corresponding rating curve obtained through direct flow determinations by means otttm c2 and etrelectm salinomadd flowmeters temperature and electrical conductivity ec of groundwater drained by the springs were also hourly monitored using different types of proves onsettm hobo u24 001 datalogger installed at algarrobal spring and wtwtm cond 3310 at cornicabra outlet precipitation data were hourly obtained from a rain gauge station located near grazalema town red triangle in fig 1 during the monitoring period 2013 14 2017 18 the time lag between the occurrence of rainfall events triggering the aquifer recharge and its manifestation in discharge rate risings of the springs has been measured single time lag determinations std the time lag between the mass center of a single rainfall event point when the 50 of the total precipitation is amounted and the maximum flow rate value of the spring has been considered as the system response time to a specific recharge event fig 3 b several descriptors concerning to the precipitation events as mean and maximum intensity total rainfall amount and duration event have been estimated in order to establish relationships among rainfall typology and springs time lags on the other hand cross correlation analysis ccf has been performed for individual hydrological year using rainfall data series as input hourly records recorded at grazalema meteorological station see location in fig 1 and hourly data of discharge from each spring as output the k values that shows the mean time lag between the impulse and the observed response in ccf analysis obtained have been considered an annual mean time lag hours for the hydrodynamic response of the system to precipitation events table 1 commonly higher values of time lag are related to poorly developed karst drainage network and larger capacity to modulate the recharge impulse instead short time lags illustrate a high capability of the karst system to transfer infiltration water from recharge areas to the outflow points mangin 1984 padilla and pulido bosch 1995 fiorillo and doglioni 2010 lorette et al 2018 the sliding window cross correlation function analysis swccf consists of sectioning the precipitation and spring discharge time series into short and partially overlapping time periods fig 3a for each of these periods observation windows the cross correlation function is calculated and the value of k is determined thus obtaining a time lag temporal distribution this methodology allows to obtain the temporal evolution of the time lag among the input signal precipitation data and its response at the discharge points spring discharge a time length of the observation window of 60 days with a 50 overlap 30 days has been here used fig 3a in order to reach the optimal resolution during the wet periods commonly between autumn winter and spring seasons this methodology allows the evaluation of response times for specific periods leading to the detection of seasonal patterns or highlighting differences between successive recharge episodes delbart et al 2014 2 2 dye tracer tests two dye tracer experiments were performed in the framework of this research using twice fluorescent substances table 1 fig 2 pyranine pyr solvent green 7 cas 6358 69 6 and amidorhodamine g amg acid red 50 cas 5873 16 5 the first experiment was performed by injection of 3 kg of amg into the villaluenga del rosario swallowhole sh 1 on 07 march 2018 coinciding with a rainfall event of 157 mm of total amount and a mean intensity rainfall value of 5 1 mm h 1 in response to this test dye was detected in the three springs related to the drainage of the ubrique aquifer cornicabra algarrobal and garciago the second test consisted of the near simultaneous injection of two tracers amg 3 kg and pyr 2 kg on april 12th 2018 in two karst swallowholes sh 2 and sh 3 respectively placed in the sierra del caillo fig 1 and coinciding with a rainfall event of 53 mm in this case both tracers were detected in cornicabra and alto ofs springs groundwater sampling was performed manually directly at the karst springs with a sampling frequency between 1 and 5 h or automatically using a ggun fl30 portable fluorometer fig 3c whose reading frequency was 15 min a perkin elmer ls55 spectrofluorometer was used for the detection and quantitative determination in the laboratory of the center of hydrogeology of the university of málaga of dye tracer concentration in spring water 3 results 3 1 time lag evaluation from hydrodynamic analysis tools ccf swccf and single determinations the parameters concerning the main springs discharge regime are summarized in table 1 in general terms the three control points show a marked variability in their discharge flow rates with minimum values not higher than 35 l s 1 at the end of the hydrological year which contrasts with the maximum values reached 2623 2694 and 10093 l s 1 for cornicabra algarrobal and garciago respectively cornicabra spring shows the highest average flow rate 324 l s 1 in contrast to the mean value recorded in algarrobal and garciago springs 125 and 147 l s 1 respectively fig 4 shows the hydrodynamic responses of the three main springs draining the pilot site jointly with the hourly records of rainfall occurred during the study period in contrast to the cornicabra spring in which each significant rainfall event induces a response the hydrograph analysis of algarrobal and garciago reveals that not all rainfall impulses provoke an increase in discharge rates this phenomena has been observed several times along the study period and it would be related to the previous hydrological conditions and the extent of drought periods such as the first flooding events of the hydrological years 2015 16 and 2017 18 although in some cases it occurred in winter or spring time as the year 2013 14 fig 4 the k values obtained both for each spring and for each hydrological year have been considered the mean annual response time or time lag hours according to the results of the ccf response times table 1 and fig 5 the aquifer sector drained by cornicabra algarrobal and garciago springs show rapid responses to rainfall events 58 to 81 h these values have markedly ranged from a minimum of 49 h obtained for the hydrological years 2017 18 cornicabra and 2014 15 garciago to 132 h for a maximum value calculated in algarrobal spring during the year 2013 14 the sliding window cross correlation swccf method between precipitation and the available discharge data series 5 years has been applied table 1 and fig 4 77 correlograms were obtained with a confidence value of 95 whose correlation coefficient r x y is higher than the standard error mangin 1981 delbart et al 2014 likewise 83 flooding events were identified from which the time lag respect to recharge input could be quantified table 1 to perform calculations for rainfall related parameters mean intensity duration total amount etc the precipitation event that causes the recharge impulse was previously delimited in dry seasons usually from may to october the absence of rainfall and the weak variation in the discharge rate of the springs means that the results of the swccf analysis are not representative no considered in this work as it is shown in fig 4 and table 1 the response time estimated by swccf analysis and single determinations in each of the springs is far from being uniform throughout the year as may be inferred from the ccf analysis suggest a noteworthy variability in the response time values can be observed during the wet periods for example the annual mean response times in cornicabra spring ranged between a maximum value of 83 h result obtained during the year 2014 15 using the swccf analysis and a minimum value of 43 h measured in the recharge events of 2017 18 single events time lag determinations in general terms algarrobal spring showed the greatest mean annual time lag value with a minimum of 41 h single events time lag determined for the flooding events of 2016 17 and a maximum of 132 h during the year 2013 14 ccf analysis the mean value of the spring time lag during the study period ranged between 56 h single events determinations and 81 ccf results garciago overflow spring shows the shortest response times with an annual minimum value of 26 h during the year 2017 18 swccf analysis tool the maximum value was determined by ccf analysis during the year 2013 14 109 h 3 2 dye tracer tests during the first tracer test performed in the framework of this research march 2018 the first detection time tfd of the dye was verified in cornicabra spring 31 h after infection fig 6 followed by garciago 45 h and finally algarrobal 47 h after injection the time lags for the maximum tracer concentration followed a similar pattern to that defined by the first detection times 39 h in cornicabra maximum concentration of 0 20 μg l 55 h in garciago 1 46 μg l and 64 h in algarrobal 0 89 μg l table 2 a temporal coincidence of the maximum tracer concentration and the relative minimum values of ec and t fig 6 were detected in cornicabra and algarrobal springs the breakthrough curves i e btćs obtained at algarrobal and garciago springs show also a secondary peak of dye concentration between 46 and 55 h after maximum concentration fig 6 the recovery rate values at the end of the first experiment were 68 4 garciago 21 9 algarrobal and 2 03 cornicabra with a total mass recovered during this experiment of 92 3 in the subsequent tracer test april 2018 the injected dyes in sh 2 and sh 3 see location in fig 1 were only detected in the water drained by cornicabra spring and in its related set of overflow springs fig 1 although samples were only systematically collected in alto ofs fig 7 due to better accessibility conditions despite the reduced time interval between the injections of both dyes and the similar distance from the sh 2 and sh 3 injection points to the springs table 2 the detection of amg was substantially faster than pyr both for the first detection and for the maximum concentration values fig 7 and table 2 tmc and tfd for amg were respectively 34 and 44 h in cornicabra spring and 37 and 42 h for alto ofs table 2 the highest concentration reached was quite comparable in both springs 12 95 and 10 62 μg l 1 in the case of pyr the first detection and maximum concentration times were higher than obtained for amg with 46 and 57 h in cornicabra spring and 48 and 56 h in alto ofs reaching peak concentrations 3 20 and 3 68 ug l 1 respectively in this test the dye tracer recovery rate could only be quantified from cornicabra btćs yielding 38 9 for amg and 11 2 for pyr table 2 these values which are low compared to the previous test were probably motivated by the impossibility of determining the quantitative recovery in overflow springs that showed the presence of both tracers as in the alto ofs due to the absence of discharge records 4 discussion the joint analysis of the results derived from the hydrological series processing global system response and those from dye tracer tests preferential flowpaths has provided deeper insights into the flow dynamics within a karst system with confirmed duality in recharge mechanisms autogenic and allogenic and also under variable hydrometeorological conditions additionally the combination of techniques used in this work has a great potential for assessing from an integrated point of view different aspects on the system response to rainfall intensity as well as for increasing our understanding on the internal geometry of karst aquifers in general quick rises in flow rates after recharge events and shapes of btc curves reveal the existence of a highly developed karst network in the pilot site which permits fast flows and short transit times of groundwater within the system towards the springs both from the soil and epikarst diffuse recharge and from specific points on the surface where concentrated infiltration occurs e g swallow holes however a detailed review of the results obtained in the framework of this study allows distinguishing differences in the response times of the springs to recharge both for the global response and from specific points which can be attributed to spatial variations in the development of the karst drainage network 4 1 role of rainfall intensity in response lag times of karst aquifers although the ccf analysis provides general information on the mean response time of aquifers to the input signal padilla et al 1995 panagopoulos and lambrakis 2006 its application loses reliability to identify changes in response times as a consequence of differences in the hydrodynamic conditions during recharge periods this restriction has prompted the implementation of further statistical approaches such as partial correlation of time series jukić et al 2011 sliding window cross correlation function swccf delbart et al 2014 or higher order partial correlation function jukić et al 2015 which bring additional information about the system response to recharge impulses in karst media in this work the correspondence of the time lag data provided by the swccf analysis with the single determinations of time lag sdt for each flooding event supports the representativeness of this approximation as a descriptor of the specific response time interval for each karst spring all applied analyses are referred to the fastest flow circulation of groundwater in natural regime lower correlation peaks or and long term response associated with slower drainage mechanisms fracture and fissure flow mechanisms domain is beyond the scope of this study previous studies have highlighted the existence of seasonal patterns in the response time distribution with the lowest time lag coinciding with wet periods due to a faster transference of input signal through a transmissive network of conduits and fissures when hydraulic head increases larocque et al 1998 lee et al 2006 mudarra et al 2014 other authors delbart et al 2014 sánchez et al 2016 concluded that the variability in the intensity of rainfall events primarily contributes to the faster transmission of the input signal in karst systems in our work a minimum value around 20 h from the mass center of precipitations for the response time has been detected following the obtained i t curves fig 8 delbart et al 2014 regarded this limit as the maximum transfer velocity within the aquifer due to the saturation of the upper sector of the drainage network unsaturated zone in addition to the intrinsic system heterogeneity or karst anisotropy however the nature of the observation points in the aforementioned research boreholes and wells restricted the representativeness of their results to a limited segment of the drainage network in contrast to delbart et al 2014 our study is exemplified in a mountainous karst aquifer characterized by a well defined recharge area a clear duality in recharge modalities and a dataset coming from the main springs fig 1 the most significant advantage of considering the hydrodynamic regime of the springs as a reference for response is to obtain a global view of the aquifer behavior not restricted to a specific sector or subsystem within it in all the analyzed springs the lower asymptotic segment of the i t curve fig 8 represents the maximum flow transmission velocity under intense rainfall conditions which in turn is indicative of the existence of a well hierarchized karst network with high capacity to evacuate rapidly recent infiltrated water fig 9 nevertheless while algarrobal and garciago springs shows a stabilization of the response time around 20 h fig 8b and c the minimum value reaches in cornicabra outlet was around 30 h fig 8a at these conditions when the first tracer test was carried out karst conduits and enlarged fractures that feed algarrobal and garciago outlets would have a higher groundwater flow transmission capacity compared to the sector drained by cornicabra spring this would be in agreement with the mean discharge rates shown by the two first outlets table 1 and also since both springs gathered the most of the injected dye mass in sh 1 68 41 and 21 94 respectively table 2 however since the tmc values calculated in algarrobal and garciago springs were significantly higher than expected according to their experimental i t curves fig 8b and c some type of geometric features capable to delay the arrival to the springs of the allogenic recharge from sh 1 must be invoked fig 9 the structure of the drainage network in several levels where karstification is differentially developed could lead to the existence of thresholds that require a certain rise in the hydraulic load to activate groundwater drainage this scenario illustrated on the left side of fig 9 implies an increase in the tortuosity of a specific drainage route showing this higher transit time respect to the global time lag of the system consequently this functional scheme is consistent with the hydrodynamic regime of the graciago and algarrobal springs while the first outlet is only activated after the most intense recharge events the second one is limited to show notable increases in discharge flow in response to the most significant recharge events although it drains a very low permanent flow 30 50 l s 1 by contrast cornicabra spring displayed a limited connection with sh 1 tracer recovery 2 being a marginal drainage pathway under the same hydrometeorological conditions fig 9 however the satisfactory fit of the dye tmc values on the i t curve fig 8a suggests that the concentrated recharge is incorporated into a well hierarchised drainage network in which water from both rapid infiltration through swallowholes and diffuse infiltration flows to the discharge points cornicabra and ofs in addition the maximum concentration of tracer occurred coinciding upon a relative minimum of ec and water temperature values in this outlet fig 6 all this implies that the impact of the concentrated recharge mechanisms on the spring water is simultaneously manifested with the global response in the discharge peaks at any case a total recovery rate around 90 of the initially injected mass suggests no significant loss of dye through unmonitored drainage points adsorption phenomena or long term storage käss 1998 on the other hand global time lag values higher than 40 50 h upper asymptotic section of the i t curve fig 8 are related to recharge events induced by rainfall of moderate small intensities fig 9 right side under these conditions concentrated recharge may be marginal respect to diffuse recharge because the required conditions for the runoff generation over the catchment basins linked to karst swallow holes not occur thus rainwater diffusely infiltrated on permeable outcrops plays a predominant role in the global system response the interaction with soil epikarst and the unsaturated zone of the aquifer buffers the transmission rate of the input signal through the critical zone of the aquifer and may even act as a significant storage element in karst systems perrin et al 2003 therefore the magnitude of the recharge episodes could be not enough to provoke a significant rise in the hydraulic gradient and consequently groundwater flows occur predominantly through fractures fissures however a part of recent infiltrated water could be transferred through a network of transmissive karst conduits according to the general morphology of the spring hydrographs and also to the acceptable fitting of the tmc values in the i c curve achieved in cornicabra outlet during the second tracer test fig 8a although dyes were injected almost simultaneously table 2 at the same altitude gradient and at a similar distance to the spring the tmc value related to the pyr injected in sh 3 showed a better fit to the i t curve this fact could be due to a more efficient capacity of groundwater transference between sh 2 and the discharge points which would be linked to preferential flows in the ne sw direction according to the main fold axis and fractures network of the pilot site fig 1 this would be in agreement with the maximum concentration values of btcs and also with the recovery rate of the injected mass of each dye 38 9 for amg and 11 2 for pyr fig 7 therefore in contrast to the previous information deduced for garciago and algarrobal the jointly analysis of dye tracer test results and the global hydrodynamic response of the cornicabra spring allows to deduce the existence of internal geometries favoring a more efficient flow transfer mechanisms finally in the three i t curves examined fig 8 a lower limit of mean rainfall intensity approximately 1 mm h 1 is established below which there is no noticeable hydrodynamic responses in the springs consequently small rainfall intensities do not have enough potential to saturate the water storage capacity of the soil epikarst so these rainfall events do not provoke significant risings in the flow rate of the discharge points in binary karst systems such as it has been exemplified in this work the contribution of diffuse and concentrated recharge largely governs the aquifer behavior however the input output time lag is far from being a feature driven entirely by the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer or recharge modalities although the development of the karst drainage network largely determines the velocity and capacity of water migration within the aquifer several factors inherent to precipitation characteristics intensity rainfall amount etc and to recharge mechanisms saturation state in soil and epikarst surface runoff diffuse vs concentrated recharge etc may operate as relevant modulators of response times moreover the aquifer response to a single recharge event may be locally conditioned by other factors related to the remarkable anisotropy of karst media such as the impact of hydrogeological barriers interference among several preferential flow paths or siphonage phenomena in all these cases the cross checking and application of statistical approaches with results derived from hydrochemistry and environmental isotopes trček 2007 houillion et al 2016 gil márquez et al 2019 dye tracer test benischke et al 2007 goldshaider et al 2008 mudarra et al 2014 or hydrochemical modelling etc maloszewski et al 1992 barberá et al 2018 mudarra et al 2019 help to quantify the complex recharge behavior of karst aquifers in current research dye tracer tests permit to characterize several characteristics of groundwater flows regarding the preferential infiltration modality which prevailing during the more intense recharge events the global response time determined in the monitored springs fig 8 is the sum of the diffuse and the concentrated recharge modalities in this sense plotting of time lag data versus precipitation intensity i t curve has the potential to provide specific quantitative information on the impact of recharge modalities in flow dynamics of the aquifer as a whole likewise the projection of the time lag times tmc corresponding to the tracer tests on the i t curve allows inferring the existence of hydraulic constraints that operate on the preferential flow paths defined by these tracer tests following all these insights the establishment of the empirical relationship between the recharge impulses and their effects in the springs hydrodynamic constitutes a useful tool to predict potential affections to groundwater with practicality implications in water resources management fig 10 this is particularly relevant at the test site when the rapid arrival of pollutants from livestock or anthropogenic pollution over recharge zones impacts on discharge points marín et al 2021 hartmann et al 2021 nevertheless additional information derived from subsequent dye tracer tests would be required to contrast results and make it possible to expand the set of connections between the preferential infiltration points and the outlets and thus characterize the specific response times conditioned in turn by the water transmission capacity of the karst network for the different drainage routes the mapping of preferential drainage routes may contribute to characterize the functioning of the aquifer in terms of response times a critical issue for resource management and risk mitigation in terms of human supply fig 10 moreover the representativeness of the i t curves is strongly conditioned by the reference meteorological station s location the expansion of observatories network used to characterize the input signal can provide a more accurate information both temporally and spatially related to recharge events likewise monitoring of concentrated inflows generated in the small catchment basins that inlet into the aquifer thought swallow holes can provide quantitative information about the magnitude of concentrated recharge and its role in the global aquifer response 5 conclusions detailed analysis of the response time to rainfall of several discharge points springs in a karst aquifer has revealed rainfall intensity as the major driver of the input signal transmission velocity the combination of statistical approaches ccf and swccf analysis supported by direct measurements single events determinations of time lag has allowed characterizing a specific function i t curve explaining the global response of each of the aquifer sectors in which a binary karst aquifer is segmented the analysis can provide information on the expected response time of the springs to a rainfall event of a specific intensity as well as drawing conclusions regarding the development and sectorial differences in the karst drainage network on the other hand the differences observed among the response times obtained by means of dye tracer tests and the i t curve can provide conclusive evidences regarding the presence of geometrical factors aquifer structure drainage network anisotropy that may distort the global response of the system in the preferential drainage pathways this research shows how the joint use of statistical analysis and experimental determinations in terms of response time can provide conclusive insights into the functioning and spatial distribution of the drainage network under different hydroclimatic conditions which reduces uncertainties derived from the use of each technique separately the establishment of the springs global response time and the specific time lag between concentrated recharge processes and their impact on the discharge regime constitutes a useful and reliable tool for resource management and the planning and mitigation of risks generated by quick pollution events related to concentrated recharge mechanisms these considerations may be relevant for the implementation of early warning systems ews in those points destined for human supply which requires a solid conceptual framework that provides the predictability of risk events whose effectiveness is dependent on the

1903,the assessment of the response time of a karst aquifer is an important step towards the development of conceptual models from which tools for water resources planning and management could be applied the aim of this work is to evaluate the applicability of the joint use of statistical time lag evaluation and dye tracer tests techniques with a double objective 1 the development of conceptual models on the hydrogeological functioning that include the duality in the aquifer recharge processes as well as the particularities of the preferential drainage flowpaths respect to the global response of the aquifers 2 to establish a reference frame to foresee with enough time in anticipation the potential affections derived from the concentrated recharge to the springs required in the creation of water quality monitoring networks and early warning systems to water pollution in the ubrique karst aquifer southern spain the empirical relationships between the intensity i of rainfall events recharge and the time lag t observed in the springs that draining the aquifer have been quantified the establishment of the curve i t constitutes a reliable tool for the prediction of potential affections to the springs intended for urban supply derived from recharge events on the other hand the comparison of the values drawn in the i t curve characteristic of each spring with those derived from three tracer tests has allowed further advances in the understanding of the aquifer functioning and the influence of concentrated recharge on the global system behavior to be achieved keywords carbonate karst aquifer time lag recharge dye tracer test cross correlation function southern spain data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction carbonate massifs are particularly susceptible to fracturing and karstification phenomena forming complex aquifer systems in which the infiltration of water occurs through stratification surfaces discontinuities and or fissures enlarged by dissolution and within the rock matrix this set of elements generally constitutes a hierarchical drainage network capable of rapidly transmitting large volumes of water from infiltration zones recharge areas to natural drainage points generally springs there are several factors that control recharge in these systems climatic conditions lithology and degree of karstification topographic position soil surface components vegetation texture porosity fractures etc slope and soil moisture andreo et al 2008 fu et al 2015 galibert 2016 in addition tectonics is a factor that increases the complexity of aquifer systems often being a critical element affecting hydrogeological behaviour particularly in mountainous regions goldscheider 2005 perrin and luetscher 2008 sanz de galdeano et al 2019 de la torre et al 2020 due to these factors karst aquifers present a high degree of heterogeneity spatial anisotropy in their hydrogeological properties bakalowicz 2005 ford and williams 2007 worthington and ford 2009 being also much more vulnerable to contamination than other systems doerfliger and zwahlen 1998 marín and andreo 2015 marín et al 2021 hartmann et al 2021 it is essential therefore to highlight the strategic dimension of carbonate aquifers and to manage the foreseeable water scarcity crisis induced by global climate change konapala et al 2020 since around 25 of the world s population supplies its demands with water from this type of aquifers eu 1995 ford and williams 2007 stevanović 2018 the implementation and contrast of several research methodologies provide a consistent framework to improve knowledge about karst aquifer functioning including aspects related to recharge mechanisms trček 2007 charlier et al 2012 surface water groundwater relationship bailly comte et al 2009 transport dynamics towards preferential drainage routes schuler et al 2020 groundwater flow and storage at different aquifer components perrin et al 2003 or internal aquifer geometry bodin et al 2022 among others hydrological methods water balance hydrodynamic analyses etc deserve special attention since they have demonstrated applicability to elucidate conceptual schemes of functioning in geologically complex contexts padilla and pulido bosch 1995 groves et al 2007 el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 de la torre et al 2020 in this sense some authors jiang et al 2008 galibert 2016 discussed the close relationship between the precipitation intensity considering effective rainfall as the primary factor controlling the aquifer recharge and the time lag until input detection at shallow subsurface observation points based on mangin s correlation analysis 1981 delbart et al 2014 extend this relationship by studying the temporal variability of water transfer through the infiltration zone of karst aquifers using the sliding window cross correlation function swccf to estimate the time lag between rainfall and the piezometric level time series in wells and boreholes as indicators of the recharge effects it should be noted that the hydrodynamic conditions of the aquifer prior to a recharge event can modify the responses hydrochemical and hydrodynamic that are recorded at the discharge points perrin et al 2003 bicalho et al 2012 fu et al 2015 the application of delbart et al 2014 approach to the entire aquifer considering natural discharge points springs as the reference of the hydrodynamic response has the advantage of achieving a global assessment of the aquifer functioning moreover the use of precipitation the driving cause of the system response as a temporal reference for evaluating the impacts of quick recharge events on springs shows relevant benefits since rainfall records are usually real time available and provide a wider temporal range than indicators based on intrinsic water parameters whose detection is an immediate indication of water pollution hence it is expected that the empirical relationship between the input signal and its hydraulic effects in the outlets rainfall intensity i versus response lag time t i t curve in this document provide a quantitative predictive tool for assessing the impact of recharge processes on discharge points especially valuable when these are intended for human supply the joint use of the i t curves characteristic of the global system response with results derived from dye tracer tests whose usefulness in karst hydrogeology is well known benischke et al 2007 goldscheider et al 2008 adds the perspective of the time lags along defined drainage flow paths commonly between concentrated infiltration points and springs consequently the combination of both methods under the same approach would open new insights for inferring the presence and influence of geometric constraints that may exert a noteworthy incidence on the velocity of input signal transmission into the aquifer the main aim of this work is therefore to advance on the understanding of the factors that drive the hydrodynamic time lag in binary karst aquifers under different hydrometeorological conditions affecting recharge volume in addition we try to explore the potential of the joint application of hydrological analysis tools and dye tracer tests to gain a deeper insight on the mechanisms that modulate the response of these aquifers to recharge processes with an integral view both temporal and spatial the approach presented here could help in management strategies with special relevance to those oriented to protect the water supply sources in karst aquifers in fact the test site where our approach is applied sierra de ubrique s spain acts as pilot area for the development of early warning systems ews to avoid the water pollution during flooding events marín et al 2021 martín rodríguez et al 2022 the establishment of the lag time of the point draining the system and used as sources of urban water supply may constitute the necessary conceptual framework for the implementation of control algorithms and to enhance their predictability when faced with increasingly changing and extreme hydroclimatic scenarios richts and vrba 2017 1 1 site settings the ubrique aquifer is a binary karst system located at ne area of the cádiz province southern spain fig 1 with a total surface effective recharge area of 26 06 km2 the karst system is formed by two mountainous massifs caíllo and ubrique sierras with a ragged orography from 317 to 1395 m a s l dominated by outcrops of carbonate rocks jurassic dolostones and limestones the prevailing climate in the area is humid mediterranean with a noteworthy seasonal pattern in the annual distribution of precipitation and air temperature rainfall mainly occurs from autumn to springtime related to wet winds coming from the atlantic ocean the mean annual precipitation and air temperature values recorded in this area from 1984 85 to 2017 18 were respectively 1305 mm and 14 8 c spatial distributions of both precipitation and temperature values are mostly conditioned by the altitude and the orientation of major hillsides the accumulated rainfall amount for each hydrological year comprising the study period considered in this work from october 2013 to september 2018 was respectively 1 348 mm 2013 2014 1 071 mm 2014 2015 1 208 mm 2015 2016 807 mm 2016 2017 and 1 710 mm 2017 2018 table 1 the annual rainfall values were obtained through the spatial distribution of the isohyets lines for each hydrological year despite of rainfall amounts several townships in the region dependent of groundwater resources for water supply are affected by seasonal restrictions geologically the pilot site and surrounding areas are located within the westernmost sector of the betic cordillera specifically within the so called penibetic domain of the external zone martín algarra 1987 the stratigraphic series of this domain consists of around 500 m thick jurassic dolostones and limestones which present late triassic clays dolomitic beds sandstones and evaporite rocks mainly gypsum at the bottom and early cretaceous tertiary marly limestones and marls at the top surrounding and overlaying all these rocks tertiary flysch type clays and sandstones outcrops figs 1 and 2 the geological structure is characterized by ne sw pluri kilometer size open anticline folds and narrow synclines affected by reverse faults from which overthrusts were developed with vergence towards n nw tectonic gave rise to a series of imbricate thrusts with the triassic rocks overthrusting cretaceous marls under jurassic carbonate formations cross section 1 1 in fig 2 apart from these shortening features the entire structure has been affected by normal faults in a mainly nne ssw direction and oblique strike slip fractures caused by extensional accommodation of prior structures jiménez bonilla et al 2017 the sw border of the sierra de ubrique has been also affected by a more recent set of normal faults related to gravitational collapses which configure the orography in that sector cross section 2 2 the large outcrops of jurassic limestones densely fractured jointly with bedding planes and the prevailing climate conditions have favored a noteworthy development of exokarst landforms delannoy 1987 1999 karrenfields dolines sinkholes and shafts besides the presence of low permeability outcrops marls and clays related to synclinal folds and faults have contributed to the development of endorheic drainage areas which caused the quick infiltration of runoff water generated during rainfall events through several swallow holes hydrologically connected with shafts and other endokarst features in general a patchy soil cover up to 10 20 cm thick can be found especially where the slope is low overall vegetation is typically mediterranean with shrub growth forest and pasture except for the highest areas where there is neither soil development nor vegetation in these areas large karrenfields exist over bare carbonate rocks in hydrogeological terms the ubrique karst system is formed by fractured and karstified jurassic carbonate rocks limited by low permeability materials cretaceous tertiary marls triassic clays and flysch clays in almost all their borders figs 1 and 2 the geometry of the aquifer is particularly determined by the flat hinge anticline structure and occasionally by low permeability materials imbricates below the thrust surfaces andreo et al 2014 recharge takes place by two mechanisms binary karst system by direct infiltration of rainwater over the bare carbonate outcrops autogenic component 24 03 km2 and by concentrated infiltration of runoff water coming from small neighbor catchments formed by low permeability materials allogenic component 2 03 km2 the hydrogeological connection of three of the swallow holes sh 1 sh 2 and sh 3 in fig 1 with some of the springs was proved using dye tracers hydrogeochemical tools applied to this site also revealed the existence of an incipient degree of contamination affecting the system as a whole marín et al 2021 whose origin would be associated with the infiltration of surface runoff water through the villaluenga del rosario shaft sh 1 in fig 1 this point receives the poorly treated wastewater from 500 inhabitants urban area of villaluenga del rosario as well as the remains of the livestock activity over an endorheic area of 2 03 km2 fig 1 groundwater discharge occurs along the w border of the carbonate outcrops through two perennial springs sited at the ubrique urban area cornicabra and algarrobal springs located at 349 and 317 m a s l respectively plus two overflow springs one located north of ubrique town alto ofs 521 m a s l and other one sited at the sw border of the sierra de ubrique garciago 422 m a s l general background information about the hydrogeological settings of the pilot site can be found in previous works sánchez et al 2016 sánchez et al 2018 marín et al 2021 martín rodríguez et al 2022 2 material and methods 2 1 data availability and hydrodynamic analyses continuous discharge data from cornicabra and algarrobal permanent outlets and also from garciago overflow spring was hourly recorded during five hydrological years by using odysseytm capacitance water level loggers properly gauged with its corresponding rating curve obtained through direct flow determinations by means otttm c2 and etrelectm salinomadd flowmeters temperature and electrical conductivity ec of groundwater drained by the springs were also hourly monitored using different types of proves onsettm hobo u24 001 datalogger installed at algarrobal spring and wtwtm cond 3310 at cornicabra outlet precipitation data were hourly obtained from a rain gauge station located near grazalema town red triangle in fig 1 during the monitoring period 2013 14 2017 18 the time lag between the occurrence of rainfall events triggering the aquifer recharge and its manifestation in discharge rate risings of the springs has been measured single time lag determinations std the time lag between the mass center of a single rainfall event point when the 50 of the total precipitation is amounted and the maximum flow rate value of the spring has been considered as the system response time to a specific recharge event fig 3 b several descriptors concerning to the precipitation events as mean and maximum intensity total rainfall amount and duration event have been estimated in order to establish relationships among rainfall typology and springs time lags on the other hand cross correlation analysis ccf has been performed for individual hydrological year using rainfall data series as input hourly records recorded at grazalema meteorological station see location in fig 1 and hourly data of discharge from each spring as output the k values that shows the mean time lag between the impulse and the observed response in ccf analysis obtained have been considered an annual mean time lag hours for the hydrodynamic response of the system to precipitation events table 1 commonly higher values of time lag are related to poorly developed karst drainage network and larger capacity to modulate the recharge impulse instead short time lags illustrate a high capability of the karst system to transfer infiltration water from recharge areas to the outflow points mangin 1984 padilla and pulido bosch 1995 fiorillo and doglioni 2010 lorette et al 2018 the sliding window cross correlation function analysis swccf consists of sectioning the precipitation and spring discharge time series into short and partially overlapping time periods fig 3a for each of these periods observation windows the cross correlation function is calculated and the value of k is determined thus obtaining a time lag temporal distribution this methodology allows to obtain the temporal evolution of the time lag among the input signal precipitation data and its response at the discharge points spring discharge a time length of the observation window of 60 days with a 50 overlap 30 days has been here used fig 3a in order to reach the optimal resolution during the wet periods commonly between autumn winter and spring seasons this methodology allows the evaluation of response times for specific periods leading to the detection of seasonal patterns or highlighting differences between successive recharge episodes delbart et al 2014 2 2 dye tracer tests two dye tracer experiments were performed in the framework of this research using twice fluorescent substances table 1 fig 2 pyranine pyr solvent green 7 cas 6358 69 6 and amidorhodamine g amg acid red 50 cas 5873 16 5 the first experiment was performed by injection of 3 kg of amg into the villaluenga del rosario swallowhole sh 1 on 07 march 2018 coinciding with a rainfall event of 157 mm of total amount and a mean intensity rainfall value of 5 1 mm h 1 in response to this test dye was detected in the three springs related to the drainage of the ubrique aquifer cornicabra algarrobal and garciago the second test consisted of the near simultaneous injection of two tracers amg 3 kg and pyr 2 kg on april 12th 2018 in two karst swallowholes sh 2 and sh 3 respectively placed in the sierra del caillo fig 1 and coinciding with a rainfall event of 53 mm in this case both tracers were detected in cornicabra and alto ofs springs groundwater sampling was performed manually directly at the karst springs with a sampling frequency between 1 and 5 h or automatically using a ggun fl30 portable fluorometer fig 3c whose reading frequency was 15 min a perkin elmer ls55 spectrofluorometer was used for the detection and quantitative determination in the laboratory of the center of hydrogeology of the university of málaga of dye tracer concentration in spring water 3 results 3 1 time lag evaluation from hydrodynamic analysis tools ccf swccf and single determinations the parameters concerning the main springs discharge regime are summarized in table 1 in general terms the three control points show a marked variability in their discharge flow rates with minimum values not higher than 35 l s 1 at the end of the hydrological year which contrasts with the maximum values reached 2623 2694 and 10093 l s 1 for cornicabra algarrobal and garciago respectively cornicabra spring shows the highest average flow rate 324 l s 1 in contrast to the mean value recorded in algarrobal and garciago springs 125 and 147 l s 1 respectively fig 4 shows the hydrodynamic responses of the three main springs draining the pilot site jointly with the hourly records of rainfall occurred during the study period in contrast to the cornicabra spring in which each significant rainfall event induces a response the hydrograph analysis of algarrobal and garciago reveals that not all rainfall impulses provoke an increase in discharge rates this phenomena has been observed several times along the study period and it would be related to the previous hydrological conditions and the extent of drought periods such as the first flooding events of the hydrological years 2015 16 and 2017 18 although in some cases it occurred in winter or spring time as the year 2013 14 fig 4 the k values obtained both for each spring and for each hydrological year have been considered the mean annual response time or time lag hours according to the results of the ccf response times table 1 and fig 5 the aquifer sector drained by cornicabra algarrobal and garciago springs show rapid responses to rainfall events 58 to 81 h these values have markedly ranged from a minimum of 49 h obtained for the hydrological years 2017 18 cornicabra and 2014 15 garciago to 132 h for a maximum value calculated in algarrobal spring during the year 2013 14 the sliding window cross correlation swccf method between precipitation and the available discharge data series 5 years has been applied table 1 and fig 4 77 correlograms were obtained with a confidence value of 95 whose correlation coefficient r x y is higher than the standard error mangin 1981 delbart et al 2014 likewise 83 flooding events were identified from which the time lag respect to recharge input could be quantified table 1 to perform calculations for rainfall related parameters mean intensity duration total amount etc the precipitation event that causes the recharge impulse was previously delimited in dry seasons usually from may to october the absence of rainfall and the weak variation in the discharge rate of the springs means that the results of the swccf analysis are not representative no considered in this work as it is shown in fig 4 and table 1 the response time estimated by swccf analysis and single determinations in each of the springs is far from being uniform throughout the year as may be inferred from the ccf analysis suggest a noteworthy variability in the response time values can be observed during the wet periods for example the annual mean response times in cornicabra spring ranged between a maximum value of 83 h result obtained during the year 2014 15 using the swccf analysis and a minimum value of 43 h measured in the recharge events of 2017 18 single events time lag determinations in general terms algarrobal spring showed the greatest mean annual time lag value with a minimum of 41 h single events time lag determined for the flooding events of 2016 17 and a maximum of 132 h during the year 2013 14 ccf analysis the mean value of the spring time lag during the study period ranged between 56 h single events determinations and 81 ccf results garciago overflow spring shows the shortest response times with an annual minimum value of 26 h during the year 2017 18 swccf analysis tool the maximum value was determined by ccf analysis during the year 2013 14 109 h 3 2 dye tracer tests during the first tracer test performed in the framework of this research march 2018 the first detection time tfd of the dye was verified in cornicabra spring 31 h after infection fig 6 followed by garciago 45 h and finally algarrobal 47 h after injection the time lags for the maximum tracer concentration followed a similar pattern to that defined by the first detection times 39 h in cornicabra maximum concentration of 0 20 μg l 55 h in garciago 1 46 μg l and 64 h in algarrobal 0 89 μg l table 2 a temporal coincidence of the maximum tracer concentration and the relative minimum values of ec and t fig 6 were detected in cornicabra and algarrobal springs the breakthrough curves i e btćs obtained at algarrobal and garciago springs show also a secondary peak of dye concentration between 46 and 55 h after maximum concentration fig 6 the recovery rate values at the end of the first experiment were 68 4 garciago 21 9 algarrobal and 2 03 cornicabra with a total mass recovered during this experiment of 92 3 in the subsequent tracer test april 2018 the injected dyes in sh 2 and sh 3 see location in fig 1 were only detected in the water drained by cornicabra spring and in its related set of overflow springs fig 1 although samples were only systematically collected in alto ofs fig 7 due to better accessibility conditions despite the reduced time interval between the injections of both dyes and the similar distance from the sh 2 and sh 3 injection points to the springs table 2 the detection of amg was substantially faster than pyr both for the first detection and for the maximum concentration values fig 7 and table 2 tmc and tfd for amg were respectively 34 and 44 h in cornicabra spring and 37 and 42 h for alto ofs table 2 the highest concentration reached was quite comparable in both springs 12 95 and 10 62 μg l 1 in the case of pyr the first detection and maximum concentration times were higher than obtained for amg with 46 and 57 h in cornicabra spring and 48 and 56 h in alto ofs reaching peak concentrations 3 20 and 3 68 ug l 1 respectively in this test the dye tracer recovery rate could only be quantified from cornicabra btćs yielding 38 9 for amg and 11 2 for pyr table 2 these values which are low compared to the previous test were probably motivated by the impossibility of determining the quantitative recovery in overflow springs that showed the presence of both tracers as in the alto ofs due to the absence of discharge records 4 discussion the joint analysis of the results derived from the hydrological series processing global system response and those from dye tracer tests preferential flowpaths has provided deeper insights into the flow dynamics within a karst system with confirmed duality in recharge mechanisms autogenic and allogenic and also under variable hydrometeorological conditions additionally the combination of techniques used in this work has a great potential for assessing from an integrated point of view different aspects on the system response to rainfall intensity as well as for increasing our understanding on the internal geometry of karst aquifers in general quick rises in flow rates after recharge events and shapes of btc curves reveal the existence of a highly developed karst network in the pilot site which permits fast flows and short transit times of groundwater within the system towards the springs both from the soil and epikarst diffuse recharge and from specific points on the surface where concentrated infiltration occurs e g swallow holes however a detailed review of the results obtained in the framework of this study allows distinguishing differences in the response times of the springs to recharge both for the global response and from specific points which can be attributed to spatial variations in the development of the karst drainage network 4 1 role of rainfall intensity in response lag times of karst aquifers although the ccf analysis provides general information on the mean response time of aquifers to the input signal padilla et al 1995 panagopoulos and lambrakis 2006 its application loses reliability to identify changes in response times as a consequence of differences in the hydrodynamic conditions during recharge periods this restriction has prompted the implementation of further statistical approaches such as partial correlation of time series jukić et al 2011 sliding window cross correlation function swccf delbart et al 2014 or higher order partial correlation function jukić et al 2015 which bring additional information about the system response to recharge impulses in karst media in this work the correspondence of the time lag data provided by the swccf analysis with the single determinations of time lag sdt for each flooding event supports the representativeness of this approximation as a descriptor of the specific response time interval for each karst spring all applied analyses are referred to the fastest flow circulation of groundwater in natural regime lower correlation peaks or and long term response associated with slower drainage mechanisms fracture and fissure flow mechanisms domain is beyond the scope of this study previous studies have highlighted the existence of seasonal patterns in the response time distribution with the lowest time lag coinciding with wet periods due to a faster transference of input signal through a transmissive network of conduits and fissures when hydraulic head increases larocque et al 1998 lee et al 2006 mudarra et al 2014 other authors delbart et al 2014 sánchez et al 2016 concluded that the variability in the intensity of rainfall events primarily contributes to the faster transmission of the input signal in karst systems in our work a minimum value around 20 h from the mass center of precipitations for the response time has been detected following the obtained i t curves fig 8 delbart et al 2014 regarded this limit as the maximum transfer velocity within the aquifer due to the saturation of the upper sector of the drainage network unsaturated zone in addition to the intrinsic system heterogeneity or karst anisotropy however the nature of the observation points in the aforementioned research boreholes and wells restricted the representativeness of their results to a limited segment of the drainage network in contrast to delbart et al 2014 our study is exemplified in a mountainous karst aquifer characterized by a well defined recharge area a clear duality in recharge modalities and a dataset coming from the main springs fig 1 the most significant advantage of considering the hydrodynamic regime of the springs as a reference for response is to obtain a global view of the aquifer behavior not restricted to a specific sector or subsystem within it in all the analyzed springs the lower asymptotic segment of the i t curve fig 8 represents the maximum flow transmission velocity under intense rainfall conditions which in turn is indicative of the existence of a well hierarchized karst network with high capacity to evacuate rapidly recent infiltrated water fig 9 nevertheless while algarrobal and garciago springs shows a stabilization of the response time around 20 h fig 8b and c the minimum value reaches in cornicabra outlet was around 30 h fig 8a at these conditions when the first tracer test was carried out karst conduits and enlarged fractures that feed algarrobal and garciago outlets would have a higher groundwater flow transmission capacity compared to the sector drained by cornicabra spring this would be in agreement with the mean discharge rates shown by the two first outlets table 1 and also since both springs gathered the most of the injected dye mass in sh 1 68 41 and 21 94 respectively table 2 however since the tmc values calculated in algarrobal and garciago springs were significantly higher than expected according to their experimental i t curves fig 8b and c some type of geometric features capable to delay the arrival to the springs of the allogenic recharge from sh 1 must be invoked fig 9 the structure of the drainage network in several levels where karstification is differentially developed could lead to the existence of thresholds that require a certain rise in the hydraulic load to activate groundwater drainage this scenario illustrated on the left side of fig 9 implies an increase in the tortuosity of a specific drainage route showing this higher transit time respect to the global time lag of the system consequently this functional scheme is consistent with the hydrodynamic regime of the graciago and algarrobal springs while the first outlet is only activated after the most intense recharge events the second one is limited to show notable increases in discharge flow in response to the most significant recharge events although it drains a very low permanent flow 30 50 l s 1 by contrast cornicabra spring displayed a limited connection with sh 1 tracer recovery 2 being a marginal drainage pathway under the same hydrometeorological conditions fig 9 however the satisfactory fit of the dye tmc values on the i t curve fig 8a suggests that the concentrated recharge is incorporated into a well hierarchised drainage network in which water from both rapid infiltration through swallowholes and diffuse infiltration flows to the discharge points cornicabra and ofs in addition the maximum concentration of tracer occurred coinciding upon a relative minimum of ec and water temperature values in this outlet fig 6 all this implies that the impact of the concentrated recharge mechanisms on the spring water is simultaneously manifested with the global response in the discharge peaks at any case a total recovery rate around 90 of the initially injected mass suggests no significant loss of dye through unmonitored drainage points adsorption phenomena or long term storage käss 1998 on the other hand global time lag values higher than 40 50 h upper asymptotic section of the i t curve fig 8 are related to recharge events induced by rainfall of moderate small intensities fig 9 right side under these conditions concentrated recharge may be marginal respect to diffuse recharge because the required conditions for the runoff generation over the catchment basins linked to karst swallow holes not occur thus rainwater diffusely infiltrated on permeable outcrops plays a predominant role in the global system response the interaction with soil epikarst and the unsaturated zone of the aquifer buffers the transmission rate of the input signal through the critical zone of the aquifer and may even act as a significant storage element in karst systems perrin et al 2003 therefore the magnitude of the recharge episodes could be not enough to provoke a significant rise in the hydraulic gradient and consequently groundwater flows occur predominantly through fractures fissures however a part of recent infiltrated water could be transferred through a network of transmissive karst conduits according to the general morphology of the spring hydrographs and also to the acceptable fitting of the tmc values in the i c curve achieved in cornicabra outlet during the second tracer test fig 8a although dyes were injected almost simultaneously table 2 at the same altitude gradient and at a similar distance to the spring the tmc value related to the pyr injected in sh 3 showed a better fit to the i t curve this fact could be due to a more efficient capacity of groundwater transference between sh 2 and the discharge points which would be linked to preferential flows in the ne sw direction according to the main fold axis and fractures network of the pilot site fig 1 this would be in agreement with the maximum concentration values of btcs and also with the recovery rate of the injected mass of each dye 38 9 for amg and 11 2 for pyr fig 7 therefore in contrast to the previous information deduced for garciago and algarrobal the jointly analysis of dye tracer test results and the global hydrodynamic response of the cornicabra spring allows to deduce the existence of internal geometries favoring a more efficient flow transfer mechanisms finally in the three i t curves examined fig 8 a lower limit of mean rainfall intensity approximately 1 mm h 1 is established below which there is no noticeable hydrodynamic responses in the springs consequently small rainfall intensities do not have enough potential to saturate the water storage capacity of the soil epikarst so these rainfall events do not provoke significant risings in the flow rate of the discharge points in binary karst systems such as it has been exemplified in this work the contribution of diffuse and concentrated recharge largely governs the aquifer behavior however the input output time lag is far from being a feature driven entirely by the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer or recharge modalities although the development of the karst drainage network largely determines the velocity and capacity of water migration within the aquifer several factors inherent to precipitation characteristics intensity rainfall amount etc and to recharge mechanisms saturation state in soil and epikarst surface runoff diffuse vs concentrated recharge etc may operate as relevant modulators of response times moreover the aquifer response to a single recharge event may be locally conditioned by other factors related to the remarkable anisotropy of karst media such as the impact of hydrogeological barriers interference among several preferential flow paths or siphonage phenomena in all these cases the cross checking and application of statistical approaches with results derived from hydrochemistry and environmental isotopes trček 2007 houillion et al 2016 gil márquez et al 2019 dye tracer test benischke et al 2007 goldshaider et al 2008 mudarra et al 2014 or hydrochemical modelling etc maloszewski et al 1992 barberá et al 2018 mudarra et al 2019 help to quantify the complex recharge behavior of karst aquifers in current research dye tracer tests permit to characterize several characteristics of groundwater flows regarding the preferential infiltration modality which prevailing during the more intense recharge events the global response time determined in the monitored springs fig 8 is the sum of the diffuse and the concentrated recharge modalities in this sense plotting of time lag data versus precipitation intensity i t curve has the potential to provide specific quantitative information on the impact of recharge modalities in flow dynamics of the aquifer as a whole likewise the projection of the time lag times tmc corresponding to the tracer tests on the i t curve allows inferring the existence of hydraulic constraints that operate on the preferential flow paths defined by these tracer tests following all these insights the establishment of the empirical relationship between the recharge impulses and their effects in the springs hydrodynamic constitutes a useful tool to predict potential affections to groundwater with practicality implications in water resources management fig 10 this is particularly relevant at the test site when the rapid arrival of pollutants from livestock or anthropogenic pollution over recharge zones impacts on discharge points marín et al 2021 hartmann et al 2021 nevertheless additional information derived from subsequent dye tracer tests would be required to contrast results and make it possible to expand the set of connections between the preferential infiltration points and the outlets and thus characterize the specific response times conditioned in turn by the water transmission capacity of the karst network for the different drainage routes the mapping of preferential drainage routes may contribute to characterize the functioning of the aquifer in terms of response times a critical issue for resource management and risk mitigation in terms of human supply fig 10 moreover the representativeness of the i t curves is strongly conditioned by the reference meteorological station s location the expansion of observatories network used to characterize the input signal can provide a more accurate information both temporally and spatially related to recharge events likewise monitoring of concentrated inflows generated in the small catchment basins that inlet into the aquifer thought swallow holes can provide quantitative information about the magnitude of concentrated recharge and its role in the global aquifer response 5 conclusions detailed analysis of the response time to rainfall of several discharge points springs in a karst aquifer has revealed rainfall intensity as the major driver of the input signal transmission velocity the combination of statistical approaches ccf and swccf analysis supported by direct measurements single events determinations of time lag has allowed characterizing a specific function i t curve explaining the global response of each of the aquifer sectors in which a binary karst aquifer is segmented the analysis can provide information on the expected response time of the springs to a rainfall event of a specific intensity as well as drawing conclusions regarding the development and sectorial differences in the karst drainage network on the other hand the differences observed among the response times obtained by means of dye tracer tests and the i t curve can provide conclusive evidences regarding the presence of geometrical factors aquifer structure drainage network anisotropy that may distort the global response of the system in the preferential drainage pathways this research shows how the joint use of statistical analysis and experimental determinations in terms of response time can provide conclusive insights into the functioning and spatial distribution of the drainage network under different hydroclimatic conditions which reduces uncertainties derived from the use of each technique separately the establishment of the springs global response time and the specific time lag between concentrated recharge processes and their impact on the discharge regime constitutes a useful and reliable tool for resource management and the planning and mitigation of risks generated by quick pollution events related to concentrated recharge mechanisms these considerations may be relevant for the implementation of early warning systems ews in those points destined for human supply which requires a solid conceptual framework that provides the predictability of risk events whose effectiveness is dependent on the anticipation with which the ews can operate fundings this research was supported by the european project karst aquifer resources availability and quality in the mediterranean area karma prima anr 18

1904,balancing clean water and economic growth remains challenge to achieve the sustainable development goals sdgs issued by the united nations in this study the water quality impacts and cost effectiveness analysis of catchment actions were integrated by a new proposed watershed management framework wam sdgs the source appointment and control practices were incorporated based on physical based model and heuristic algorithm the tradeoffs between different targets were balanced using multiple attribute decision making madm and pareto score approaches the method was tested in two paired catchments including typical urban and agricultural catchments in china the results indicated that 1 the cost effectiveness and reliability of catchment action was improved by 4 and 3 3 compare to traditional methods 2 the restriction of urban pollution is mainly attributable to strong spatial heterogeneity while that of agricultural pollution control is attributed to lack of investment 3 for water quality improvement sources and sinks of pollutants are quantified and used as priority areas for catchment action due to high pollution intensity and control reliability urban catchments should be given priority and agricultural catchments are more cost effectiveness when fund is no longer a limiting factor the economic based and water quality based protection strategies are suggested for urban and agricultural catchment respectively this new framework could be extended to other catchments for global sustainable development keywords watershed management pareto score nonpoint source pollution water quality protection data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the united nations un has introduced 17 sustainable development goals sdgs to achieve a sustainable future however meeting these goals has become a worldwide challenge modibbo et al 2021 pradhan et al 2017 sarvajayakesavalu 2015 due to complex interactions and the tradeoffs between different goals hegarty et al 2021 li et al 2021 wang et al 2022 for example the achievement of clean water sdg 6 might impact on economic growth sdg 8 which lead to the imbalance of sustainable development cai et al 2021 coscieme et al 2021 nundy et al 2021 water quality deterioration has been ranked as one of the top 10 global issues for centuries almost 90 of the global catchments have been experiencing the deterioration of water quality due to anthropogenic activities since the early 21st century chung et al 2021 chaudhari et al 2022 while nutrient enrichment of rivers and lakes commonly termed eutrophication is the most far reaching issue zhang et al 2021a makubura et al 2022 that globally costs billions of dollars annually mcdowell et al 2020 to support watershed management the total maximum daily load tmdl mandated by the clean water act and other programs were established arteaga et al 2020 borsuk et al 2002 however water quality deterioration has not been eliminated in facing human development and population growth hansen et al 2018 zhu and eslamian 2020 the first obstacle to achieve clean water is to evaluate and quantify the goals of watershed action the core is the maximum benefit from using the smallest land the evaluation of water quality goal at the catchment scale generally focuses on the identification of critical sources or priority management areas pmas shrestha et al 2021 which are defined as relatively small portions of a catchment that export the majority of pollutants to nearby water bodies for identifying vulnerable areas chen et al 2014 watershed models index analysis and optimization methods have been used to explore pmas of pollutants at the watershed scale rong et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 zou et al 2020 for example somaye et al 2019 lim and lee 2017 proposed pma identification based on nutrient loads by the soil and water assessment tool swat and the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf model respectively twombly et al 2021 proposed the vermont phosphorus p index which considers topographic controls on transport to identify vulnerable areas with high intensity of p risk there are many methods and evaluation indicators for watershed management but a comprehensive evaluating method is lacking the cost efficient control focuses on water quality improvement through control practices on a small scale at present point source ps pollution has been significantly reduced through the implementation of high quality engineering measures and nonpoint source nps pollution has gradually been controlled by the introduction of best management practices bmps babaei et al 2019 liu et al 2019b martinho 2019 wei and bailey 2021 in recent years optimization algorithms have been introduced that can synthesize multiple objectives and produce nondominated solutions for cost effectiveness kaufman et al 2021 geng and sharpley 2019 combined the swat model and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii for agricultural nps pollution control at spatial multi scales liu et al 2020 coupled a multi objective shuffled frog leaping algorithm mosfla for optimizing bmps considering long term efficiency however there is a lack of method to combine these sdgs and comprehensively analyze the feasibility of overall sustainable goals furthermore the multiple attribute decision making madm method was introduced for watershed management chung et al 2011 steiguer et al 2003 used madm to construct integrated watershed management in chesapeake bay by considering water quality timber harvest riparian areas and cost this was an breakthrough attempt however control cost and other development goals have disrupted its reliability ahmadi et al 2013 g wang et al 2016 for decoupling the complex interaction between sdgs economic growth have been identified by many researchers as the major obstacle to achieving sustainable water quality goals in actual watershed management haas et al 2017 li et al 2021 yang et al 2021 zhou and gao 2011 zou et al 2020 in other words there should be a trade off between sdg 6 and sdg 8 it is not difficult to understand that the development of various industries will inevitably lead to an increase in pollutant emissions and effective practices to control pollutant will certainly lead to an increase in cost however quantitative methods to balance different sdgs for water quality control remains an urgent issue in sustainable water quality management the aims of this paper are to 1 establish a quantifiable watershed management wam sdgs method for sdgs achievement 2 balance water quality impacts and cost effectiveness control for watershed management and 3 explore the differences in managing different types of catchments in this framework the environmental impact of water quality target was identified though two indicators in terms of load contribution and load intensity using physical based model the cost effectiveness and reliability of each action was evaluated and optimized using intelligent algorithm then the water quality impact management cost and actual reliability were integrated using the madm two paired catchments i e the nanfei catchment and the hangbu catchment were selected as urban and agricultural catchments cases which face severe p pollution in the chaohu lake basin one of china s five largest freshwater lakes therefore total phosphorus tp is selected as the water quality index due to its environmental impact in this area 2 methods and materials 2 1 general framework of the wam sdgs framework in this study the wam sdgs framework was developed to quantify and balance clean water and economic growth goals in watershed management the flowchart of framework is shown in fig 1 first four selected attributes environmental impact fair effectiveness cost efficiency and economic feasibility were calculated by the corresponding method or tool for obtaining four indicators among them environmental impact and fair effectiveness are the main evaluation attributes of water quality target while cost efficiency and economic feasibility are the attributes of economic growth goal second four indicators the total load contribution intensity of pollutant optimal load reduction and reliability of control were integrated by the mamd method and decision maker preferences 2 2 detailed steps description 2 2 1 matriculated physical based model for source apportionment the swat was used as the watershed model to simulate hydrology nutrient production and transport during the baseline period arcswat 2012 software was used in this study and the calibration of the swat model was executed by swat cup 2019 software to facilitate the calculation and coupling with an optimization algorithm the watershed model was matriculated by the markov chain method 2 2 1 1 delineating upstream downstream relationship based on geographic theory a catchment can be divided into a distinct stream network and a corresponding number of subcatchments by the hydrology module of the arcgis toolbox integrated in arcswat zhang et al 2021b the original markov flow navigation based on the upstream downstream relationship was simplified as an n n matrix h in which h i j is set as 1 if sub catchment j represents the nearest spatial unit downstream from sub catchment i otherwise h i j is set as 0 2 the left is the relationship of the upstream downstream relationship and it can easily transform into an h matrix 2 2 1 2 qualifying pollutant loads released to the river network the curve number cn and the modified universal soil loss equation musle were used to estimate the water balance and nutrient simulation weather data daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature solar radiation and wind speed were obtained from local state weather stations located within the watershed pasture management information such as the timing of manure and fertilizer application and the grazing intensity and dates was collected from detailed interviews with local farmers industrial domestic and agricultural pollutants were added as point source ps layers to swat within this step a subcatchment is further broken down into a number of smaller hydrologic response units hrus that consist of homogeneous land use soil and slope the pollutant yields are then quantified for each hru the total load released from a subcatchment is the sum of the releases from all the hrus 2 l i j 1 n a hru i j c hru i j l ps where l i is the total quantity of the pollutant released from subcatchment i and a hru i j and c hru i j are the area and load intensity of hru j in subcatchment i respectively an n 1 pollutant load matrix l l1 li ln can be developed where n is the number of spatial units and li represents the pollutant emissions from spatial unit i l ps represents the total load of ps pollutant in the corresponding area 2 2 1 3 quantifying retention rates of each reach the retention simulation of a river network to a specific river assessment point using the qual2e model was conducted the retention coefficient was calculated as an index of transport efficiency which can be expressed as follows 3 r load in load out load out where the ith input of the pollutant load is load i in sub i load i 1 out the ith input of the load is equal to the sum of the upstream load and the nps load generated from the current subcatchment then the retention matrix r is expressed as follows 4 r r 1 0 0 0 r 2 0 0 0 r n 2 2 1 4 calculating the contribution of each area considering the retention in the river network we define the transfer matrix of nps pollutants as h h i r the assessment point was set as n 1 matrix k k 1 k 2 k n t the corresponding h k and v k can be calculated as 5 h k i j h k i j i f i k 1 i f i j k 0 i f i k a n d j k 6 v k i 1 i f i k 0 o t h e r w i s e h v h k n v k indicates a kth step of the n step markov transition matrix finally the total load contribution indicator lc of pollution at each subcatchment to the assessment point is quantified as 7 l c h v l where l is an n 1 matrix which represents the quantity of the pollutant released from each subcatchment and hv indicates the markov transition matrix meanwhile the intensity of pollutant indicator ip of the subcatchment was calculated as follows 8 i p l c a r where ar represents the corresponding area of pollution discharge 2 2 1 5 simulating the effectiveness of various practices practices can be divided into structural and nonstructural practices liu et al 2017 liu guo et al 2019 the performance of nonstructural practices is difficult to determine compared with structural practices influenced by relative policy therefore the simulation method of nonstructural practices is not the focus of this study liu et al 2019 the performance of structural practices can be described based on experts knowledge including source control interception and river practices interception and river practices are simulated in the swat model by parameter adjustments after the practice configuration the detailed simulation process of practices in swat is shown in table s1 the swat model lacks a module to simulate the reduction process of ps pollution by source control practices for simulating source control practices a logarithmic model is applied to assess the cost efficiency of various practices in different areas 9 p ia α ia ln cost ia β ia where i represents the ith subcatchment and a represents the ath practice α and β are coefficients calibrated by the second national survey of pollution source data finally the reduced amount of ps pollutant is added as p dat files in swat 2 2 1 6 counting the cost of practices the lifetime costs were counted from preconstruction costs pc construction costs cc right of way costs rw annual maintenance and replacement costs mr nobles et al 2017 these data come from local housing bureaus and environmental protection bureaus the optimization method proposed by our previous study was used for practical long term efficiency liu et al 2020 10 fund p c c c r w y 1 y mr y where mr y represents the mr of yth year and y means the total number of years for practice maintenance and replacement the reliability of control in actual implementation could be quantified as follows 11 rc m 1 m fund m where fund mn represents the fund amount of the mth type of practice 2 2 2 the description of iha optimization algorithm 2 2 2 1 steps of the iha algorithm the practice potential cost efficiency is calculated using the optimal solution of the integrated heuristic algorithm iha method evolving sufficient generations the iha method is a novel multiobjective optimization algorithm inspired by the no free lunch theorem any two optimization algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems wolpert and macready 1997 that is an optimization algorithm cannot solve all problems and the performance of different problems is always good and bad the main steps of iha in one loop is fig s1 step i all scenarios are stratified according to the dominated relation by fast nondominated sorting and crowding distances were calculated for each front as 12 p i distance k 1 r p i 1 f k p i 1 f k where p i distance indicates the crowding distance of the ith nondominant solution and p i 1 f k and p i 1 f k indicate the kth objective function values of two adjacent solutions then the population was sorted and divided into several subpopulations step ii defining different evolutionary strategies for subpopulations to improve the applicability of the method to various problems the evolutionary strategies include the multiobjective shuffled frog leaping algorithm mosfla nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii multiple objective particle swarm optimization mopso and a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition moea d step iii by shuffling all subpopulations and selecting the optimal solution to enter the next generation loop the solving performance of different heuristic algorithm modules can be effectively utilized for a nondominated population 2 2 2 2 mathematical expression of the optimal load reduction problem for optimum efficiency the optimal objectives were set as the minimum pollutant load in a watershed and the corresponding cost of practices of integrated watershed management liu et al 2020 which could be expressed as follows 13 minimizel f x y a p m i n i m i z e c g x y a where l and c represent the pollutant load and the cost of the practices respectively f and g represent the watershed model and economic model respectively used to calculate the pollutant load and cost x denotes the configuration of each practice and y a and p represent the type location and performance of each practice respectively a solution in the evolutionary process is often called a chromosome chen et al 2015 and genes are the mapping value of different types and locations of practices existing in one chromosome in this study the value range of genes was set from 0 to 1 which correspond to installing no practices and installing all available practices respectively the il is the sum of the load reduction of all implemented practices after optimization the optimal load reduction of each area could be quantified as follows 14 il il ps il nps where il ps represents the optimal load reduction by ps control practices and il nps represents the optimal load reduction by nps control practices the effect is simulated by swat and the markov chain method after practice configuration 2 2 3 the description of madm method the madm method is used to synthesize four different dimensions and two methods are provided below considering the weights of multiple dimension or not 2 2 3 1 madm based on pareto score and standardization nondominated sorting is a common method to define the pareto optimal solution of madm and the core process is to determine the nondominant relationship between solutions deb et al 2002 if solution a is better than solution b in every dimension the relationship is a dominant b a b accordingly rank a rank b conversely b dominates a if solution a is not better than solution b in each dimension there is a dominant relationship between a and b the highest rank is defined from 0 many solutions exist in the solution set m the pareto score of solution i is defined as follows 15 paretoscore i max r a n k rank i i i m where max r a n k represents the maximum rank in set m rank i represents the rank of solution i that is between two solutions with differing nondomination ranks and scores we prefer the solution with the higher score and the lower better rank max min standardization is a common approach to rescale features with a distribution value between 0 and 1 for every feature the minimum value of that feature is transformed into 0 and the maximum value is transformed into 1 standardization can help maximize compatibility and interoperability and facilitate the normalization of former processes xie et al 2016 in this study four dimensional arrays were standardized into the 0 1 range the dominant score was accumulated by the standardized values in the same feature 16 dominantscore x x min x max x min where x represents the element in an array and x max and x min represent the maximum and minimum values of this array respectively meanwhile the subsequent analysis after dimensionality reduction was based on a standardized method ranging from 1 to 1 as shown below 17 x 2 x x min x max x min 1 based on the above method the solution space can be divided into four areas by positive and negative coordinates if there are no preferences 2 2 3 2 madm based on weights of multiple dimension weight and preference have two roles in watershed management on the one hand it could be used to define the weight of sources and practices on the other hand it is used to define the priority of each area which largely depends on the preference of the decision makers the weight matrix w w s w p of sources w s and practices w p are defined based on the preferences of decision makers if the attribute is considered important the weight is set far less than 0 the binary array of the ith subcatchment after the pareto score and standardization is defined as x i y i and the location is shown as 18 x i y i l o c a t e s i n areai i f x i w s a n d y i w p a r e a i i i f x i w s a n d y i w p a r e a i i i i f x i w s a n d y i w p a r e a i v i f x i w s a n d y i w p in terms of water quality impacts and cost effectivenessness regions with high pollution and more fund are ranked first for water quality improvement for other regions if decision makers are willing to treat highly polluted areas regardless of the cost they will give higher weight to the water quality impacts dimension in contrast cost effectiveness would be given a higher weight if watershed management is not the main target areas are considered to be of higher priority if the existing planning of practice configurations can effectively address different types of pollution sources correspondingly the method provides adjustment suggestions if the poor matching between water quality and economics 2 3 iha algorithm for cost efficiency optimization the practice potential cost efficiency is calculated using the optimal solution of the iha method evolving sufficient generations the iha method is a novel multi objective optimization algorithm inspired by the no free lunch theorem any two optimization algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems wolpert and macready 1997 that is an optimization algorithm cannot solve all problems and the performance of different problems is always good and bad the main steps of iha in one loop is step i all scenarios are stratified according to the dominated relation by fast nondominated sorting and crowding distances were calculated for each front as 19 p i distance k 1 r p i 1 f k p i 1 f k where p i distance indicates the crowding distance of the ith nondominant solution and p i 1 f k and p i 1 f k indicate the kth objective function values of two adjacent solutions then the population was sorted and divided into several subpopulations step ii defining different evolutionary strategies for subpopulations to improve the applicability of the method to various problems the evolutionary strategies include the multi objective shuffled frog leaping algorithm mosfla nondominated sorting

and selecting the optimal solution to enter the next generation loop the solving performance of different heuristic algorithm modules can be effectively utilized for a nondominated population for optimum efficiency the optimal objectives were set as the minimum pollutant load in a catchment and the corresponding cost of practices of integrated watershed management g liu et al 2020 which could be expressed as follows 20 minimizel f x y a p m i n i m i z e c g x y a where l and c represent the pollutant load and the cost of the practices respectively f and g represent the watershed model and economic model respectively used to calculate the pollutant load and cost x denotes the configuration of each practice and y a and p represent the type location and performance of each practice respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 the water quality impacts and investments of each catchment the nanfei catchment was selected as the first typical case for indicators quantification the results of four indicators of each sub catchment are shown in fig 2 a the annual total load contribution to the chaohu lake and intensity of pollutant indicators were used to identify the main pollutant load and intensity areas for priority management the total load contributions of each sub catchment ranged from 0 67 102 to 0 30 105 kg and the total contribution was 1 48 105 kg the area with the highest total load contribution was 444 78 times that of the area with the lowest one reflecting the great spatial difference in source distribution in the urban catchment similarly the intensity of pollutant load ranged from 5 09 10 2 to 1 80 102 kg ha and the average intensity was 0 40 102 kg ha the fluctuation of the intensity of pollutant value over 3 000 times indicated the significance of the spatial heterogeneity of tp intensity the optimal load reduction and reliability of control indicators were used to quantify the cost effectiveness and feasibility of local water quality improvement the integrated heuristic algorithm iha was selected as the optimization engine for cost efficient analysis and it has been computed for 50 generations to obtain the pareto front fig s1 a shows the distribution of the optimal solution set after the loop an optimization strategy that meets local water quality standards tp less than 0 2 mg l was selected as the baseline for the following calculations and the cost of selected strategy was about 6 15 108 dollars based on selected strategies of the catchments the potential cost effectiveness values were computed in the urban catchment the reliable investments ranged from 0 to 7 22 109 dollars with most of the fund concentrate in the southwest part of the catchment which is the location of main city the total cost of the whole nanfei catchment was approximately 3 34 109 dollars and most of the practices were urban sewage treatment construction such as the expansion of sewage treatment plants rainwater and sewage diversion projects and sewage network construction the hangbu catchment was selected as the agricultural case for goals quantification compared to the urban catchment to show the difference between agricultural and urban catchments in different indicators fig 2 b the total load contributions of each sub catchment ranged from 1 03 102 to 1 76 104 kg and the total contribution to the lake was 1 91 105 kg the intensity ranged from 1 07 to 36 03 kg ha with a mean contribution of 10 30 kg ha the spatial difference of the contribution and intensity of pollutant values were 170 87 and 33 67 times much lower than in urban catchment which indicates the non significant spatial heterogeneity of tp in agricultural the agricultural catchment has a large area and normal contamination conditions and the average intensity of pollutant value of the urban catchment is over twofold that of the agricultural catchment it shows that ps pollution in the urban catchment was more serious and the severity of some sub catchments was much higher than the average level so prevention and control of these regions should be strengthened because the proportion of urban life and industrial pollution is relatively high and does not change with hydrological conditions therefore the load contribution of pollution in the urban catchment does not fluctuate significantly over time considering the potential optimal load reduction sub catchment no 7 is the most efficient for water quality control nos 1 2 9 10 and 24 31 are ineffective because the southwestern part of the agricultural catchment is an undeveloped mountainous area in which construction investment is not recommended compared with the urban catchment the agricultural catchment needs more investments for water quality improvement meanwhile greater potential reduction and larger space existed in this area fig s1 b it takes an ideal investment of 1 54 109 dollars to meet tp water quality standards by optimization however the reliable investment based on local planning is 2 89 107 dollars which can t meet the desired investment condition and much lower than the investment in the urban catchment the investment is concentrated at the outlet of this catchment which is a wetland park due to the characteristics of the catchment the projects mainly focused on the construction of rural sewage treatment facilities and wetland restoration in conclusion the spatial heterogeneity of pollution sources in urban and agricultural catchments lead to the difference of driving factors and urban catchments have received more attention in the current stage on the one hand the spatial difference of pollution sources in urban catchment is larger and the pollution intensity is higher than agricultural catchment which is worthier of pollution control in key polluted areas on the other hand urban catchments are more developed and have more funds for water quality management and the reliable investment could meet the required cost of watershed management however agricultural catchments will need a 50 fold increase in existing investment to meet water quality requirements it is that the most serious flaw of the agricultural catchment is lack of investment this may be the dominant factor in agriculturally underdeveloped catchments for watershed management plaguing the world for many years funds should be invested in more suitable areas in subsequent water quality improvement planning efforts 3 2 priority identification by balancing control cost and feasibility targets based on the quantification of the above four indicators each sub catchment was given different priorities for achieving water quality and economic goals for a priority analysis of different goals the pareto score is calculated according to two goals by the madm method then the standardization is applied to discuss the relationships of water quality impacts and cost effectiveness in each sub catchment and the space is divided into four quadrants area i water quality impacts cost effectiveness red points is a high priority for water quality deterioration control and cost effectiveness these areas are worthy of pollution control because of their higher contribution and adequate budget not affecting economic growth area ii water quality impacts cost effectiveness yellow points has potential for practice configuration and planning but poor implementation and a lack of funding limited water quality improvements area iii water quality impacts cost effectiveness dark blue points is of low impact for the overall water quality target with low pollutant contributions and little investment area iv water quality impacts cost effectiveness green points is characterized by overinvestment or low potential for practices which have invested heavily in environmental protection but are not major contributor to water quality improvement in the urban catchment most sub catchments are concentrated in areas i and iii with eleven in each region areas ii and iv have fewer sub catchments with six and five sub catchments respectively in terms of spatial distribution most of area i is concentrated in the western part and downstream region the western part is the main urban area which has a vibrant urban life and follows urban runoff pollution the local government has made a great investment in this city area such as sewage treatment plant construction rain and sewage diversion projects and low impact development the downstream region is a farmland and wetland area which has also been the focus of environmental ecology and cultural entertainment in recent years the northern part of the catchment contains county towns were identified as area ii although it also has high pollution sources of nutrients it lacks the corresponding investment for the agricultural catchment most of the sub catchments are concentrated in areas i and iii with ten in each region in the right part of fig 2 b areas ii and iv had fewer sub catchments with five and six respectively the results are similar to the urban catchment but are more dispersed in the agricultural catchment highly correlated with the spatial distribution of pollutant intensity in terms of spatial distribution most of area i is concentrated in the northern part and near the agricultural catchment outlet north of the catchment is an agricultural region with a large number of rural lives livestock and poultry and agricultural pollution however the lack of investment leads to some areas being identified as area ii the downstream of the catchment is farmland and wetland area which has been the focus of wetland parks around lake construction the southwest area of the agricultural catchment is natural land with a large part of mountainous areas so it is identified as area iii with low pollution sources and low control practices in general different priority areas could be preliminarily identified that simultaneously benefit both goals most of the areas identified as area i are heavily polluted such as the main city and agricultural region which are sources of nutrients wetlands and other large practices that function as sink are cost effectiveness of pollution control and are recommended as key areas of watershed management it could consider the major sources and sinks of pollutants in a catchment to be cost effectiveness in addition higher local investment would reinforce the priority of these regions 3 3 the tradeoff of influencing factors hinting for urban and agricultural catchments this section discusses the availability of the wam sdgs framework in actual practice and analyses the differences in the managing different types of catchments to test the impacts of decision makers preferences we introduced the weight of preferences matrix and adjusted weights of environmental impact and cost effectiveness based on preferences two different strategies were set as water quality based preference wbp and economic based preference ebp for watershed management the wbp indicates that local governments have sufficient funds to prioritize more highly polluted areas area ii according to the ebp it is necessary to focus more on existing planned practices and high potential practices as there is no immediate target of improving water quality the preference weight matrix is w w s w p where w s 0 and w p 0 when decision makers have no obvious preference it is assumed that the wbp gives more weight to the source regions that is more regions that belong to area i and area iv the ebp gives more weight to the control practices and more sub catchments are identified in area i and area ii to better analyze the relationship between water quality and economics based on different strategies the water quality and economic ratio w e was introduced to evaluate the degree of difference between the two goals it was obtained by dividing the standardized pareto score into two targets to avoid zero in the denominator all pareto scores were counted from one the w e for each sub catchment is labelled in fig 3 after considering preferences the urban catchment and the agricultural catchment have different recognition results than a no preference water quality protection in the urban catchment the w e of area i range from 0 78 to 2 17 indicating that practices within this range can effectively deal with corresponding pollution sources in the case of a no preference water quality protection sub catchments nos 5 and 10 are identified as area i and nos 23 and 27 are identified as area iv by the wbp the w e of no 5 and no 10 are 2 00 and 1 40 respectively both within the range of area i thus it is considered that the wbp is reasonable in the urban catchment nos 4 8 and 29 are identified as area i and nos 10 and 23 are identified as area ii through the ebp the ratios of no 8 and no 29 are both 1 00 which is reasonable however the value of the no 4 sub catchment is 0 67 which is less than the reasonable range of area i therefore we believe that the ebp is not as reasonable as the wbp in the urban catchment in the agricultural catchment the rational w e of area i range from 0 73 to 2 14 no extra sub catchment is identified as area i but nos 9 and 14 are identified as area iv by the wbp by analyzing the ratio of area ii it could be concluded that even the minimum value of 4 67 is far above the reasonable range which means the wbp is irrational in the agricultural catchment nos 12 and 23 are identified as area i and nos 3 11 27 and 31 are identified as area ii through the ebp the w e of no 12 and no 23 are 1 20 and 1 40 respectively both within the range of area i thus it is considered that the ebp is more reasonable than the wbp in the agricultural catchment it is evident that the imbalance between water quality and economics in both study areas leads to the rationality of different actions the differences in wbp and ebp are obvious in the two catchments except for the applicability of the water quality protection mentioned above in urban catchments there is no corresponding investment in these areas which will not lead to improved cost effectiveness and reliability through the wbp however if one million dollars were invested in each identified sub catchment the extra cost effectiveness of the tp contribution reduction would be 5 93 kg million dollars in the ebp the extra cost effectiveness is 5 18 kg million dollars and the reliability improved 11 89 compared to the no preference water quality protection in the agricultural catchment the cost effectiveness and reliability remained stable through the wbp in the ebp the cost effectiveness improved to 26 21 kg million dollars and the reliability drop compared to the no preference water quality protection because one sub catchment had high potential but no investment according to the quantitative results in section 2 1 the spatial heterogeneity of source in urban catchment is higher and the pollution is more concentrated the wbp strategy with full consideration of pollution load and intensity is more suitable for urban catchment agricultural catchments lack significant investment and are more suited to local economy led ebp strategy furthermore strategies that are more applicable to global paired catchment can be concluded for water quality management when local finances are tight investment should be focused on high pollution and high intensity urban areas for more cost effectiveness as the finances improve investment in agricultural areas should be progressively strengthened 3 4 reliability analysis for different strategies three traditional methods were selected for comparison with the wam sdgs approach for rationality of cost effectiveness and reliability in this study traditional methods are based on pollutant exports from each reach or the pollutant yields kg ha of each area ghebremichael et al 2013 shrestha et al 2021 zhou gao 2011 to better describe the main features of the wam sdgs the targeting results of the wam sdgs in a typical year 2017 were compared with those of the traditional targeting methods based on the markov chain method including the load contribution approach lca and load contribution per area approach lcaa the cost effectiveness of the different approaches is determined by evaluating the investment in achieving local water quality objectives for actual control the reliability of practice implementation needs to be further assessed in the management process choi et al 2013 park et al 2015 traditional methods such as practice configurations based on optimization algorithms oa lack consideration of economic feasibility therefore reliability indicator re is defined as the ratio of the number of satisfied investment areas n s to the number of total investment areas n t under certain water quality objectives if the actual investment is not less than the optimized investment the region is considered to be a satisfied investment area to compare traditional and wam sdgs methods percentages are expressed as follows 21 re n s n t 100 the results are shown in table 1 in the urban catchment the total costs of lca and lcaa for reaching the water quality improvement target are 1 05 109 and 9 43 108 dollars respectively the oa method is 8 91 108 dollars because of the introduction of the optimization approach in contrast the cost of wam sdgs is 9 17 108 dollars which is 12 70 and 2 76 less than the costs of lca and lcaa respectively compared with the mean cost of the four methods the wam sdgs method still has a 3 48 increase for the re indicator analysis the re of the lca lcaa and oa methods are 76 92 68 75 and 62 50 respectively the re indicator is 72 73 based on wam sdgs improving 2 50 rather than the average of traditional methods in the agricultural catchment the costs of the lca lcaa and oa approaches are 6 74 107 6 18 107 and 5 29 107 dollars respectively and the wam sdgs is 5 72 107 dollars it is easy to conclude that the cost effectiveness of the wam sdgs approach improve significantly by 15 14 and 7 45 compared to lca and lcaa respectively the same reliability results occur with the agricultural catchment in which the re of the wam sdgs method is 60 00 higher than that of the traditional optimization method 55 91 the new method can improve the reliability of practices by almost 5 compared to traditional optimization methods 4 conclusion in conclusion this study proposed the wam sdgs framework which utilizes source identification and practice optimization approaches to achieve a balance between clean water and economic growth sdgs the results demonstrate that this approach can improve the cost effectiveness and reliability of catchment action by 4 and 3 3 respectively compared to traditional methods the analysis also revealed that the key barriers to pollution control are the spatial heterogeneity in urban areas and the lack of investment in agricultural areas based on our findings we recommend a two pronged approach to managing catchments which involves economic based strategies for urban catchments and water quality based strategies for agricultural catchments by quantifying the sources and sinks of pollutants we can prioritize catchment action in areas that require the most attention overall this framework has the potential to be applied to other catchments for global sustainable development however further research is needed to develop a more systematic method for incorporating decision makers preferences selecting different indicators

1904,balancing clean water and economic growth remains challenge to achieve the sustainable development goals sdgs issued by the united nations in this study the water quality impacts and cost effectiveness analysis of catchment actions were integrated by a new proposed watershed management framework wam sdgs the source appointment and control practices were incorporated based on physical based model and heuristic algorithm the tradeoffs between different targets were balanced using multiple attribute decision making madm and pareto score approaches the method was tested in two paired catchments including typical urban and agricultural catchments in china the results indicated that 1 the cost effectiveness and reliability of catchment action was improved by 4 and 3 3 compare to traditional methods 2 the restriction of urban pollution is mainly attributable to strong spatial heterogeneity while that of agricultural pollution control is attributed to lack of investment 3 for water quality improvement sources and sinks of pollutants are quantified and used as priority areas for catchment action due to high pollution intensity and control reliability urban catchments should be given priority and agricultural catchments are more cost effectiveness when fund is no longer a limiting factor the economic based and water quality based protection strategies are suggested for urban and agricultural catchment respectively this new framework could be extended to other catchments for global sustainable development keywords watershed management pareto score nonpoint source pollution water quality protection data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the united nations un has introduced 17 sustainable development goals sdgs to achieve a sustainable future however meeting these goals has become a worldwide challenge modibbo et al 2021 pradhan et al 2017 sarvajayakesavalu 2015 due to complex interactions and the tradeoffs between different goals hegarty et al 2021 li et al 2021 wang et al 2022 for example the achievement of clean water sdg 6 might impact on economic growth sdg 8 which lead to the imbalance of sustainable development cai et al 2021 coscieme et al 2021 nundy et al 2021 water quality deterioration has been ranked as one of the top 10 global issues for centuries almost 90 of the global catchments have been experiencing the deterioration of water quality due to anthropogenic activities since the early 21st century chung et al 2021 chaudhari et al 2022 while nutrient enrichment of rivers and lakes commonly termed eutrophication is the most far reaching issue zhang et al 2021a makubura et al 2022 that globally costs billions of dollars annually mcdowell et al 2020 to support watershed management the total maximum daily load tmdl mandated by the clean water act and other programs were established arteaga et al 2020 borsuk et al 2002 however water quality deterioration has not been eliminated in facing human development and population growth hansen et al 2018 zhu and eslamian 2020 the first obstacle to achieve clean water is to evaluate and quantify the goals of watershed action the core is the maximum benefit from using the smallest land the evaluation of water quality goal at the catchment scale generally focuses on the identification of critical sources or priority management areas pmas shrestha et al 2021 which are defined as relatively small portions of a catchment that export the majority of pollutants to nearby water bodies for identifying vulnerable areas chen et al 2014 watershed models index analysis and optimization methods have been used to explore pmas of pollutants at the watershed scale rong et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 zou et al 2020 for example somaye et al 2019 lim and lee 2017 proposed pma identification based on nutrient loads by the soil and water assessment tool swat and the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf model respectively twombly et al 2021 proposed the vermont phosphorus p index which considers topographic controls on transport to identify vulnerable areas with high intensity of p risk there are many methods and evaluation indicators for watershed management but a comprehensive evaluating method is lacking the cost efficient control focuses on water quality improvement through control practices on a small scale at present point source ps pollution has been significantly reduced through the implementation of high quality engineering measures and nonpoint source nps pollution has gradually been controlled by the introduction of best management practices bmps babaei et al 2019 liu et al 2019b martinho 2019 wei and bailey 2021 in recent years optimization algorithms have been introduced that can synthesize multiple objectives and produce nondominated solutions for cost effectiveness kaufman et al 2021 geng and sharpley 2019 combined the swat model and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii for agricultural nps pollution control at spatial multi scales liu et al 2020 coupled a multi objective shuffled frog leaping algorithm mosfla for optimizing bmps considering long term efficiency however there is a lack of method to combine these sdgs and comprehensively analyze the feasibility of overall sustainable goals furthermore the multiple attribute decision making madm method was introduced for watershed management chung et al 2011 steiguer et al 2003 used madm to construct integrated watershed management in chesapeake bay by considering water quality timber harvest riparian areas and cost this was an breakthrough attempt however control cost and other development goals have disrupted its reliability ahmadi et al 2013 g wang et al 2016 for decoupling the complex interaction between sdgs economic growth have been identified by many researchers as the major obstacle to achieving sustainable water quality goals in actual watershed management haas et al 2017 li et al 2021 yang et al 2021 zhou and gao 2011 zou et al 2020 in other words there should be a trade off between sdg 6 and sdg 8 it is not difficult to understand that the development of various industries will inevitably lead to an increase in pollutant emissions and effective practices to control pollutant will certainly lead to an increase in cost however quantitative methods to balance different sdgs for water quality control remains an urgent issue in sustainable water quality management the aims of this paper are to 1 establish a quantifiable watershed management wam sdgs method for sdgs achievement 2 balance water quality impacts and cost effectiveness control for watershed management and 3 explore the differences in managing different types of catchments in this framework the environmental impact of water quality target was identified though two indicators in terms of load contribution and load intensity using physical based model the cost effectiveness and reliability of each action was evaluated and optimized using intelligent algorithm then the water quality impact management cost and actual reliability were integrated using the madm two paired catchments i e the nanfei catchment and the hangbu catchment were selected as urban and agricultural catchments cases which face severe p pollution in the chaohu lake basin one of china s five largest freshwater lakes therefore total phosphorus tp is selected as the water quality index due to its environmental impact in this area 2 methods and materials 2 1 general framework of the wam sdgs framework in this study the wam sdgs framework was developed to quantify and balance clean water and economic growth goals in watershed management the flowchart of framework is shown in fig 1 first four selected attributes environmental impact fair effectiveness cost efficiency and economic feasibility were calculated by the corresponding method or tool for obtaining four indicators among them environmental impact and fair effectiveness are the main evaluation attributes of water quality target while cost efficiency and economic feasibility are the attributes of economic growth goal second four indicators the total load contribution intensity of pollutant optimal load reduction and reliability of control were integrated by the mamd method and decision maker preferences 2 2 detailed steps description 2 2 1 matriculated physical based model for source apportionment the swat was used as the watershed model to simulate hydrology nutrient production and transport during the baseline period arcswat 2012 software was used in this study and the calibration of the swat model was executed by swat cup 2019 software to facilitate the calculation and coupling with an optimization algorithm the watershed model was matriculated by the markov chain method 2 2 1 1 delineating upstream downstream relationship based on geographic theory a catchment can be divided into a distinct stream network and a corresponding number of subcatchments by the hydrology module of the arcgis toolbox integrated in arcswat zhang et al 2021b the original markov flow navigation based on the upstream downstream relationship was simplified as an n n matrix h in which h i j is set as 1 if sub catchment j represents the nearest spatial unit downstream from sub catchment i otherwise h i j is set as 0 2 the left is the relationship of the upstream downstream relationship and it can easily transform into an h matrix 2 2 1 2 qualifying pollutant loads released to the river network the curve number cn and the modified universal soil loss equation musle were used to estimate the water balance and nutrient simulation weather data daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature solar radiation and wind speed were obtained from local state weather stations located within the watershed pasture management information such as the timing of manure and fertilizer application and the grazing intensity and dates was collected from detailed interviews with local farmers industrial domestic and agricultural pollutants were added as point source ps layers to swat within this step a subcatchment is further broken down into a number of smaller hydrologic response units hrus that consist of homogeneous land use soil and slope the pollutant yields are then quantified for each hru the total load released from a subcatchment is the sum of the releases from all the hrus 2 l i j 1 n a hru i j c hru i j l ps where l i is the total quantity of the pollutant released from subcatchment i and a hru i j and c hru i j are the area and load intensity of hru j in subcatchment i respectively an n 1 pollutant load matrix l l1 li ln can be developed where n is the number of spatial units and li represents the pollutant emissions from spatial unit i l ps represents the total load of ps pollutant in the corresponding area 2 2 1 3 quantifying retention rates of each reach the retention simulation of a river network to a specific river assessment point using the qual2e model was conducted the retention coefficient was calculated as an index of transport efficiency which can be expressed as follows 3 r load in load out load out where the ith input of the pollutant load is load i in sub i load i 1 out the ith input of the load is equal to the sum of the upstream load and the nps load generated from the current subcatchment then the retention matrix r is expressed as follows 4 r r 1 0 0 0 r 2 0 0 0 r n 2 2 1 4 calculating the contribution of each area considering the retention in the river network we define the transfer matrix of nps pollutants as h h i r the assessment point was set as n 1 matrix k k 1 k 2 k n t the corresponding h k and v k can be calculated as 5 h k i j h k i j i f i k 1 i f i j k 0 i f i k a n d j k 6 v k i 1 i f i k 0 o t h e r w i s e h v h k n v k indicates a kth step of the n step markov transition matrix finally the total load contribution indicator lc of pollution at each subcatchment to the assessment point is quantified as 7 l c h v l where l is an n 1 matrix which represents the quantity of the pollutant released from each subcatchment and hv indicates the markov transition matrix meanwhile the intensity of pollutant indicator ip of the subcatchment was calculated as follows 8 i p l c a r where ar represents the corresponding area of pollution discharge 2 2 1 5 simulating the effectiveness of various practices practices can be divided into structural and nonstructural practices liu et al 2017 liu guo et al 2019 the performance of nonstructural practices is difficult to determine compared with structural practices influenced by relative policy therefore the simulation method of nonstructural practices is not the focus of this study liu et al 2019 the performance of structural practices can be described based on experts knowledge including source control interception and river practices interception and river practices are simulated in the swat model by parameter adjustments after the practice configuration the detailed simulation process of practices in swat is shown in table s1 the swat model lacks a module to simulate the reduction process of ps pollution by source control practices for simulating source control practices a logarithmic model is applied to assess the cost efficiency of various practices in different areas 9 p ia α ia ln cost ia β ia where i represents the ith subcatchment and a represents the ath practice α and β are coefficients calibrated by the second national survey of pollution source data finally the reduced amount of ps pollutant is added as p dat files in swat 2 2 1 6 counting the cost of practices the lifetime costs were counted from preconstruction costs pc construction costs cc right of way costs rw annual maintenance and replacement costs mr nobles et al 2017 these data come from local housing bureaus and environmental protection bureaus the optimization method proposed by our previous study was used for practical long term efficiency liu et al 2020 10 fund p c c c r w y 1 y mr y where mr y represents the mr of yth year and y means the total number of years for practice maintenance and replacement the reliability of control in actual implementation could be quantified as follows 11 rc m 1 m fund m where fund mn represents the fund amount of the mth type of practice 2 2 2 the description of iha optimization algorithm 2 2 2 1 steps of the iha algorithm the practice potential cost efficiency is calculated using the optimal solution of the integrated heuristic algorithm iha method evolving sufficient generations the iha method is a novel multiobjective optimization algorithm inspired by the no free lunch theorem any two optimization algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems wolpert and macready 1997 that is an optimization algorithm cannot solve all problems and the performance of different problems is always good and bad the main steps of iha in one loop is fig s1 step i all scenarios are stratified according to the dominated relation by fast nondominated sorting and crowding distances were calculated for each front as 12 p i distance k 1 r p i 1 f k p i 1 f k where p i distance indicates the crowding distance of the ith nondominant solution and p i 1 f k and p i 1 f k indicate the kth objective function values of two adjacent solutions then the population was sorted and divided into several subpopulations step ii defining different evolutionary strategies for subpopulations to improve the applicability of the method to various problems the evolutionary strategies include the multiobjective shuffled frog leaping algorithm mosfla nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii multiple objective particle swarm optimization mopso and a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition moea d step iii by shuffling all subpopulations and selecting the optimal solution to enter the next generation loop the solving performance of different heuristic algorithm modules can be effectively utilized for a nondominated population 2 2 2 2 mathematical expression of the optimal load reduction problem for optimum efficiency the optimal objectives were set as the minimum pollutant load in a watershed and the corresponding cost of practices of integrated watershed management liu et al 2020 which could be expressed as follows 13 minimizel f x y a p m i n i m i z e c g x y a where l and c represent the pollutant load and the cost of the practices respectively f and g represent the watershed model and economic model respectively used to calculate the pollutant load and cost x denotes the configuration of each practice and y a and p represent the type location and performance of each practice respectively a solution in the evolutionary process is often called a chromosome chen et al 2015 and genes are the mapping value of different types and locations of practices existing in one chromosome in this study the value range of genes was set from 0 to 1 which correspond to installing no practices and installing all available practices respectively the il is the sum of the load reduction of all implemented practices after optimization the optimal load reduction of each area could be quantified as follows 14 il il ps il nps where il ps represents the optimal load reduction by ps control practices and il nps represents the optimal load reduction by nps control practices the effect is simulated by swat and the markov chain method after practice configuration 2 2 3 the description of madm method the madm method is used to synthesize four different dimensions and two methods are provided below considering the weights of multiple dimension or not 2 2 3 1 madm based on pareto score and standardization nondominated sorting is a common method to define the pareto optimal solution of madm and the core process is to determine the nondominant relationship between solutions deb et al 2002 if solution a is better than solution b in every dimension the relationship is a dominant b a b accordingly rank a rank b conversely b dominates a if solution a is not better than solution b in each dimension there is a dominant relationship between a and b the highest rank is defined from 0 many solutions exist in the solution set m the pareto score of solution i is defined as follows 15 paretoscore i max r a n k rank i i i m where max r a n k represents the maximum rank in set m rank i represents the rank of solution i that is between two solutions with differing nondomination ranks and scores we prefer the solution with the higher score and the lower better rank max min standardization is a common approach to rescale features with a distribution value between 0 and 1 for every feature the minimum value of that feature is transformed into 0 and the maximum value is transformed into 1 standardization can help maximize compatibility and interoperability and facilitate the normalization of former processes xie et al 2016 in this study four dimensional arrays were standardized into the 0 1 range the dominant score was accumulated by the standardized values in the same feature 16 dominantscore x x min x max x min where x represents the element in an array and x max and x min represent the maximum and minimum values of this array respectively meanwhile the subsequent analysis after dimensionality reduction was based on a standardized method ranging from 1 to 1 as shown below 17 x 2 x x min x max x min 1 based on the above method the solution space can be divided into four areas by positive and negative coordinates if there are no preferences 2 2 3 2 madm based on weights of multiple dimension weight and preference have two roles in watershed management on the one hand it could be used to define the weight of sources and practices on the other hand it is used to define the priority of each area which largely depends on the preference of the decision makers the weight matrix w w s w p of sources w s and practices w p are defined based on the preferences of decision makers if the attribute is considered important the weight is set far less than 0 the binary array of the ith subcatchment after the pareto score and standardization is defined as x i y i and the location is shown as 18 x i y i l o c a t e s i n areai i f x i w s a n d y i w p a r e a i i i f x i w s a n d y i w p a r e a i i i i f x i w s a n d y i w p a r e a i v i f x i w s a n d y i w p in terms of water quality impacts and cost effectivenessness regions with high pollution and more fund are ranked first for water quality improvement for other regions if decision makers are willing to treat highly polluted areas regardless of the cost they will give higher weight to the water quality impacts dimension in contrast cost effectiveness would be given a higher weight if watershed management is not the main target areas are considered to be of higher priority if the existing planning of practice configurations can effectively address different types of pollution sources correspondingly the method provides adjustment suggestions if the poor matching between water quality and economics 2 3 iha algorithm for cost efficiency optimization the practice potential cost efficiency is calculated using the optimal solution of the iha method evolving sufficient generations the iha method is a novel multi objective optimization algorithm inspired by the no free lunch theorem any two optimization algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems wolpert and macready 1997 that is an optimization algorithm cannot solve all problems and the performance of different problems is always good and bad the main steps of iha in one loop is step i all scenarios are stratified according to the dominated relation by fast nondominated sorting and crowding distances were calculated for each front as 19 p i distance k 1 r p i 1 f k p i 1 f k where p i distance indicates the crowding distance of the ith nondominant solution and p i 1 f k and p i 1 f k indicate the kth objective function values of two adjacent solutions then the population was sorted and divided into several subpopulations step ii defining different evolutionary strategies for

and selecting the optimal solution to enter the next generation loop the solving performance of different heuristic algorithm modules can be effectively utilized for a nondominated population for optimum efficiency the optimal objectives were set as the minimum pollutant load in a catchment and the corresponding cost of practices of integrated watershed management g liu et al 2020 which could be expressed as follows 20 minimizel f x y a p m i n i m i z e c g x y a where l and c represent the pollutant load and the cost of the practices respectively f and g represent the watershed model and economic model respectively used to calculate the pollutant load and cost x denotes the configuration of each practice and y a and p represent the type location and performance of each practice respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 the water quality impacts and investments of each catchment the nanfei catchment was selected as the first typical case for indicators quantification the results of four indicators of each sub catchment are shown in fig 2 a the annual total load contribution to the chaohu lake and intensity of pollutant indicators were used to identify the main pollutant load and intensity areas for priority management the total load contributions of each sub catchment ranged from 0 67 102 to 0 30 105 kg and the total contribution was 1 48 105 kg the area with the highest total load contribution was 444 78 times that of the area with the lowest one reflecting the great spatial difference in source distribution in the urban catchment similarly the intensity of pollutant load ranged from 5 09 10 2 to 1 80 102 kg ha and the average intensity was 0 40 102 kg ha the fluctuation of the intensity of pollutant value over 3 000 times indicated the significance of the spatial heterogeneity of tp intensity the optimal load reduction and reliability of control indicators were used to quantify the cost effectiveness and feasibility of local water quality improvement the integrated heuristic algorithm iha was selected as the optimization engine for cost efficient analysis and it has been computed for 50 generations to obtain the pareto front fig s1 a shows the distribution of the optimal solution set after the loop an optimization strategy that meets local water quality standards tp less than 0 2 mg l was selected as the baseline for the following calculations and the cost of selected strategy was about 6 15 108 dollars based on selected strategies of the catchments the potential cost effectiveness values were computed in the urban catchment the reliable investments ranged from 0 to 7 22 109 dollars with most of the fund concentrate in the southwest part of the catchment which is the location of main city the total cost of the whole nanfei catchment was approximately 3 34 109 dollars and most of the practices were urban sewage treatment construction such as the expansion of sewage treatment plants rainwater and sewage diversion projects and sewage network construction the hangbu catchment was selected as the agricultural case for goals quantification compared to the urban catchment to show the difference between agricultural and urban catchments in different indicators fig 2 b the total load contributions of each sub catchment ranged from 1 03 102 to 1 76 104 kg and the total contribution to the lake was 1 91 105 kg the intensity ranged from 1 07 to 36 03 kg ha with a mean contribution of 10 30 kg ha the spatial difference of the contribution and intensity of pollutant values were 170 87 and 33 67 times much lower than in urban catchment which indicates the non significant spatial heterogeneity of tp in agricultural the agricultural catchment has a large area and normal contamination conditions and the average intensity of pollutant value of the urban catchment is over twofold that of the agricultural catchment it shows that ps pollution in the urban catchment was more serious and the severity of some sub catchments was much higher than the average level so prevention and control of these regions should be strengthened because the proportion of urban life and industrial pollution is relatively high and does not change with hydrological conditions therefore the load contribution of pollution in the urban catchment does not fluctuate significantly over time considering the potential optimal load reduction sub catchment no 7 is the most efficient for water quality control nos 1 2 9 10 and 24 31 are ineffective because the southwestern part of the agricultural catchment is an undeveloped mountainous area in which construction investment is not recommended compared with the urban catchment the agricultural catchment needs more investments for water quality improvement meanwhile greater potential reduction and larger space existed in this area fig s1 b it takes an ideal investment of 1 54 109 dollars to meet tp water quality standards by optimization however the reliable investment based on local planning is 2 89 107 dollars which can t meet the desired investment condition and much lower than the investment in the urban catchment the investment is concentrated at the outlet of this catchment which is a wetland park due to the characteristics of the catchment the projects mainly focused on the construction of rural sewage treatment facilities and wetland restoration in conclusion the spatial heterogeneity of pollution sources in urban and agricultural catchments lead to the difference of driving factors and urban catchments have received more attention in the current stage on the one hand the spatial difference of pollution sources in urban catchment is larger and the pollution intensity is higher than agricultural catchment which is worthier of pollution control in key polluted areas on the other hand urban catchments are more developed and have more funds for water quality management and the reliable investment could meet the required cost of watershed management however agricultural catchments will need a 50 fold increase in existing investment to meet water quality requirements it is that the most serious flaw of the agricultural catchment is lack of investment this may be the dominant factor in agriculturally underdeveloped catchments for watershed management plaguing the world for many years funds should be invested in more suitable areas in subsequent water quality improvement planning efforts 3 2 priority identification by balancing control cost and feasibility targets based on the quantification of the above four indicators each sub catchment was given different priorities for achieving water quality and economic goals for a priority analysis of different goals the pareto score is calculated according to two goals by the madm method then the standardization is applied to discuss the relationships of water quality impacts and cost effectiveness in each sub catchment and the space is divided into four quadrants area i water quality impacts cost effectiveness red points is a high priority for water quality deterioration control and cost effectiveness these areas are worthy of pollution control because of their higher contribution and adequate budget not affecting economic growth area ii water quality impacts cost effectiveness yellow points has potential for practice configuration and planning but poor implementation and a lack of funding limited water quality improvements area iii water quality impacts cost effectiveness dark blue points is of low impact for the overall water quality target with low pollutant contributions and little investment area iv water quality impacts cost effectiveness green points is characterized by overinvestment or low potential for practices which have invested heavily in environmental protection but are not major contributor to water quality improvement in the urban catchment most sub catchments are concentrated in areas i and iii with eleven in each region areas ii and iv have fewer sub catchments with six and five sub catchments respectively in terms of spatial distribution most of area i is concentrated in the western part and downstream region the western part is the main urban area which has a vibrant urban life and follows urban runoff pollution the local government has made a great investment in this city area such as sewage treatment plant construction rain and sewage diversion projects and low impact development the downstream region is a farmland and wetland area which has also been the focus of environmental ecology and cultural entertainment in recent years the northern part of the catchment contains county towns were identified as area ii although it also has high pollution sources of nutrients it lacks the corresponding investment for the agricultural catchment most of the sub catchments are concentrated in areas i and iii with ten in each region in the right part of fig 2 b areas ii and iv had fewer sub catchments with five and six respectively the results are similar to the urban catchment but are more dispersed in the agricultural catchment highly correlated with the spatial distribution of pollutant intensity in terms of spatial distribution most of area i is concentrated in the northern part and near the agricultural catchment outlet north of the catchment is an agricultural region with a large number of rural lives livestock and poultry and agricultural pollution however the lack of investment leads to some areas being identified as area ii the downstream of the catchment is farmland and wetland area which has been the focus of wetland parks around lake construction the southwest area of the agricultural catchment is natural land with a large part of mountainous areas so it is identified as area iii with low pollution sources and low control practices in general different priority areas could be preliminarily identified that simultaneously benefit both goals most of the areas identified as area i are heavily polluted such as the main city and agricultural region which are sources of nutrients wetlands and other large practices that function as sink are cost effectiveness of pollution control and are recommended as key areas of watershed management it could consider the major sources and sinks of pollutants in a catchment to be cost effectiveness in addition higher local investment would reinforce the priority of these regions 3 3 the tradeoff of influencing factors hinting for urban and agricultural catchments this section discusses the availability of the wam sdgs framework in actual practice and analyses the differences in the managing different types of catchments to test the impacts of decision makers preferences we introduced the weight of preferences matrix and adjusted weights of environmental impact and cost effectiveness based on preferences two different strategies were set as water quality based preference wbp and economic based preference ebp for watershed management the wbp indicates that local governments have sufficient funds to prioritize more highly polluted areas area ii according to the ebp it is necessary to focus more on existing planned practices and high potential practices as there is no immediate target of improving water quality the preference weight matrix is w w s w p where w s 0 and w p 0 when decision makers have no obvious preference it is assumed that the wbp gives more weight to the source regions that is more regions that belong to area i and area iv the ebp gives more weight to the control practices and more sub catchments are identified in area i and area ii to better analyze the relationship between water quality and economics based on different strategies the water quality and economic ratio w e was introduced to evaluate the degree of difference between the two goals it was obtained by dividing the standardized pareto score into two targets to avoid zero in the denominator all pareto scores were counted from one the w e for each sub catchment is labelled in fig 3 after considering preferences the urban catchment and the agricultural catchment have different recognition results than a no preference water quality protection in the urban catchment the w e of area i range from 0 78 to 2 17 indicating that practices within this range can effectively deal with corresponding pollution sources in the case of a no preference water quality protection sub catchments nos 5 and 10 are identified as area i and nos 23 and 27 are identified as area iv by the wbp the w e of no 5 and no 10 are 2 00 and 1 40 respectively both within the range of area i thus it is considered that the wbp is reasonable in the urban catchment nos 4 8 and 29 are identified as area i and nos 10 and 23 are identified as area ii through the ebp the ratios of no 8 and no 29 are both 1 00 which is reasonable however the value of the no 4 sub catchment is 0 67 which is less than the reasonable range of area i therefore we believe that the ebp is not as reasonable as the wbp in the urban catchment in the agricultural catchment the rational w e of area i range from 0 73 to 2 14 no extra sub catchment is identified as area i but nos 9 and 14 are identified as area iv by the wbp by analyzing the ratio of area ii it could be concluded that even the minimum value of 4 67 is far above the reasonable range which means the wbp is irrational in the agricultural catchment nos 12 and 23 are identified as area i and nos 3 11 27 and 31 are identified as area ii through the ebp the w e of no 12 and no 23 are 1 20 and 1 40 respectively both within the range of area i thus it is considered that the ebp is more reasonable than the wbp in the agricultural catchment it is evident that the imbalance between water quality and economics in both study areas leads to the rationality of different actions the differences in wbp and ebp are obvious in the two catchments except for the applicability of the water quality protection mentioned above in urban catchments there is no corresponding investment in these areas which will not lead to improved cost effectiveness and reliability through the wbp however if one million dollars were invested in each identified sub catchment the extra cost effectiveness of the tp contribution reduction would be 5 93 kg million dollars in the ebp the extra cost effectiveness is 5 18 kg million dollars and the reliability improved 11 89 compared to the no preference water quality protection in the agricultural catchment the cost effectiveness and reliability remained stable through the wbp in the ebp the cost effectiveness improved to 26 21 kg million dollars and the reliability drop compared to the no preference water quality protection because one sub catchment had high potential but no investment according to the quantitative results in section 2 1 the spatial heterogeneity of source in urban catchment is higher and the pollution is more concentrated the wbp strategy with full consideration of pollution load and intensity is more suitable for urban catchment agricultural catchments lack significant investment and are more suited to local economy led ebp strategy furthermore strategies that are more applicable to global paired catchment can be concluded for water quality management when local finances are tight investment should be focused on high pollution and high intensity urban areas for more cost effectiveness as the finances improve investment in agricultural areas should be progressively strengthened 3 4 reliability analysis for different strategies three traditional methods were selected for comparison with the wam sdgs approach for rationality of cost effectiveness and reliability in this study traditional methods are based on pollutant exports from each reach or the pollutant yields kg ha of each area ghebremichael et al 2013 shrestha et al 2021 zhou gao 2011 to better describe the main features of the wam sdgs the targeting results of the wam sdgs in a typical year 2017 were compared with those of the traditional targeting methods based on the markov chain method including the load contribution approach lca and load contribution per area approach lcaa the cost effectiveness of the different approaches is determined by evaluating the investment in achieving local water quality objectives for actual control the reliability of practice implementation needs to be further assessed in the management process choi et al 2013 park et al 2015 traditional methods such as practice configurations based on optimization algorithms oa lack consideration of economic feasibility therefore reliability indicator re is defined as the ratio of the number of satisfied investment areas n s to the number of total investment areas n t under certain water quality objectives if the actual investment is not less than the optimized investment the region is considered to be a satisfied investment area to compare traditional and wam sdgs methods percentages are expressed as follows 21 re n s n t 100 the results are shown in table 1 in the urban catchment the total costs of lca and lcaa for reaching the water quality improvement target are 1 05 109 and 9 43 108 dollars respectively the oa method is 8 91 108 dollars because of the introduction of the optimization approach in contrast the cost of wam sdgs is 9 17 108 dollars which is 12 70 and 2 76 less than the costs of lca and lcaa respectively compared with the mean cost of the four methods the wam sdgs method still has a 3 48 increase for the re indicator analysis the re of the lca lcaa and oa methods are 76 92 68 75 and 62 50 respectively the re indicator is 72 73 based on wam sdgs improving 2 50 rather than the average of traditional methods in the agricultural catchment the costs of the lca lcaa and oa approaches are 6 74 107 6 18 107 and 5 29 107 dollars respectively and the wam sdgs is 5 72 107 dollars it is easy to conclude that the cost effectiveness of the wam sdgs approach improve significantly by 15 14 and 7 45 compared to lca and lcaa respectively the same reliability results occur with the agricultural catchment in which the re of the wam sdgs method is 60 00 higher than that of the traditional optimization method 55 91 the new method can improve the reliability of practices by almost 5 compared to traditional optimization methods 4 conclusion in conclusion this study proposed the wam sdgs framework which utilizes source identification and practice optimization approaches to achieve a balance between clean water and economic growth sdgs the results demonstrate that this approach can improve the cost effectiveness and reliability of catchment action by 4 and 3 3 respectively compared to traditional methods the analysis also revealed that the key barriers to pollution control are the spatial heterogeneity in urban areas and the lack of investment in agricultural areas based on our findings we recommend a two pronged approach to managing catchments which involves economic based strategies for urban catchments and water quality based strategies for agricultural catchments by quantifying the sources and sinks of pollutants we can prioritize catchment action in areas that require the most attention overall this framework has the potential to be applied to other catchments for global sustainable development however further research is needed to develop a more systematic method for incorporating decision makers preferences selecting different indicators
