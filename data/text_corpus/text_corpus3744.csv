18720,improving biodegradation of pharmaceuticals during wastewater treatment is critical to control the release of emerging micropollutants to natural waters in this study biodegradation of six model pharmaceuticals was investigated at different initial concentrations in two discrete activated sludge systems and moreover the correlation was explored between the biodegradation rate and key molecular properties of the contaminants first the biodegradation rates of the pharmaceuticals were measured fitting a pseudo first order kinetic model to the experimental kinetic data the degradation rate constants k bio were found to negatively correlate to the initial concentration of the chemicals indicating an inhibitory effect on the microorganisms by the pharmaceuticals further examinations of the rate data against the key molecular properties of the pharmaceuticals revealed for the first time that the electrophilicity index ω a measure of electrophilic power served as a better indicator of the biodegradability and predictive parameter for the k bio than the conventional log k ow a measure of hydrophobicity in the two discrete aerobic activated sludge systems however the correlation strength goodness of fit between ω and k bio deteriorated when the reactor turned from aerobic to anoxic and anaerobic conditions suggesting that electron transfer from pharmaceutical molecules to enzymes was inhibited when dissolved oxygen was deficit or absent our results show that ω can potentially serve as a straightforward and robust indicator for predicting the biodegradability of pharmaceutical in conventional activated sludge processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceutical biodegradation activated sludge emerging micropollutants hydrophobicity electrophilicity index 1 introduction the potential adverse effects of pharmaceuticals released from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been a major concern to human health and the environment sanderson et al 2004 verlicchi et al 2012 although advanced water treatment technologies e g oxidation and membrane separation following the secondary treatments may reduce the levels of pharmaceuticals in the effluents gao et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 2019 it is highly desired that the chemicals are removed or degraded within the wastewater treatment plants for both economic and practical considerations in conventional activated sludge processes pharmaceuticals can be removed through a number of physical chemical and biological processes including volatilization sorption oxidation and biodegradation li and zhang 2010 luo et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 among which biodegradation is considered the dominant attenuation process ericson 2010 kim et al 2005 typically the pseudo first order kinetic model is used to interpret the biodegradation rate data and the reaction rate constant k bio is used to assess the biodegradability of pharmaceuticals in wwtps for example joss et al 2006 studied the removal of 35 pharmaceuticals personal care products and hormones in an activated sludge system and found that the k bio values may serve as an indicator for overall removal rates namely up to 20 removal for chemicals with low k bio values 0 1 l g 1 d 1 20 90 removal with moderate k bio values 0 1 10 l g 1 d 1 and more than 90 removal with high k bio values 10 l g 1 d 1 moreover k bio values also provide an insightful guide to design and optimize operational conditions for the removal of exogenous macro and micro pollutants andreozzi et al 2006 plósz et al 2010 suarez et al 2010 many factors can affect the biodegradation rates in activated sludge processes including microbial cultures e g sludge type and biomass concentration properties of the exogenous pollutants e g concentration molecular properties and toxicity and environmental conditions e g temperature ph dissolved oxygen do hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt aubenneau et al 2010 lawrence et al 2005 pagga 1997 underwood et al 2011 particularly the molecular properties of the target chemicals e g hydrophobicity and electron donor acceptor can often govern bioavailability of the chemicals and their interactions with microorganisms boopathy 2000 tang et al 2005 liu et al 2011 investigated biodegradation of three benzotriazoles and found that the k bio values were strongly influenced by electron acceptors present wammer and peters 2005 examined the role of molecular structures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and observed a quantitative structure activity relationship they found that the presence of a 5 carbon ring or an alkyl substitute in an α position altered k bio to a great extent andreozzi et al 2006 evaluated effects of functional groups e g oh ch3 cl and no2 on the k bio values of aromatic compounds and their results showed that the k bio values decreased with an increasing number of nitro groups no2 or chlorine atoms cl apparently the presence of the substitute functional groups has altered the electron distribution on the molecules resulting in different reactivities with microbial cells however a general correlation remains lacking between k bio and molecular structural properties particularly for a wide variety of emerging micropollutants including pharmaceuticals such correlation equations would be of great practical value to evaluate and possibly predict the fate of pollutants in both engineered and natural systems many fundamental questions are yet to be answered for assessing biodegradation kinetics based on the physio chemical properties of a chemical including 1 is pollutant diffusion or enzymatic reactivity the rate limiting step for the biodegradation process 2 what is the role of electron transfer in the process and 3 is there a robust indicator that can describe or predict the k bio values in activated sludge systems to address these critical issues this present study aimed to develop a viable indicator that can predict the biodegradation rates of pharmaceuticals based on fundamental physico chemical parameters of a chemical i e hydrophobicity log k ow and electrophilicity index ω in typical activated sludge processes specifically six pharmaceuticals covering a wide range of structures and biodegradability were selected as target compounds namely metronidazole mtz bezafibrate bzf ibuprofen ibp sulfamethoxazole smx carbamazepine cbz and ciprofloxacin cip the k bio values were determined at initial concentrations from 50 to 500 μg l 1 and in aerobic activated sludge systems and for comparison under anoxic and anaerobic conditions for the first time we analyzed the relationship between k bio and ω or log k ow using both experimental and computational approaches and tested it as a viable indicator to predict the biodegradability of pharmaceuticals in wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the selected pharmaceuticals were purchased from sigma aldrich u s with purities higher than 99 8 table s1 in the supplementary material lists their relevant physicochemical properties acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from merck germany sodium azide nan3 99 5 which was used as a bio growth inhibitor was obtained from dingguo biotechnology beijing china synthetic wastewater and stock solutions were prepared following the methods by min et al 2018 2 2 activated sludge collection fresh activated sludge was collected from the aeration basins of two separate wwtps in changsha china wwtp a and wwtp b wwtp a employs a modified sequencing batch reactor msbr system whereas wwtp b utilizes a modified anaerobic anoxic aerobic a a o system these two wwtps were selected because their treatment technologies represent two different but common activated sludge treatment systems table s2 summaries the wastewater characteristics and operational parameters wwtp a has a treatment capacity of 40 000 m3 d 1 and it features an integrated multi cell process in a single chamber tank with front end anaerobic anoxic aerobic a a o and back end sbr the hrt and srt of the msbr are 15 h and 12 d respectively the mixed liquid suspended sludge mlss is 2 5 g l 1 wwtp b has a treatment capacity of 100 000 m3 d 1 with an a a o process the hrt and srt are 12 h and 9 d respectively the mlss is 3 5 g l 1 sludge samples from the wwtps were collected and transported to the laboratory in coolers 4 c within 5 h then the sludge was pretreated based on methods by min et al 2018 in brief the sludge was aerated for 48 h and then washed three times by ultrapure water to remove any impurities adsorbed by biomass then the sludge was settled and the supernatant was replaced with synthetic wastewater all the experiments were performed within one month 2 3 quality controls all experiments were performed in the absence of light to exclude the possible interference of photolysis in order to determine the hydrolysis and volatilization of the target pharmaceuticals control experiments were carried out in open bioreactors at an initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 for each compound without activated sludge no concentration changes were observed during the course of the experiment table s3 the mean analytical recoveries for the target compounds mtz smx cip cbz bzf and ibp were 100 4 0 8 99 0 1 0 98 3 1 3 97 8 0 8 98 9 0 9 and 101 1 1 respectively indicating that the loss of the pharmaceuticals due to hydrolysis and volatilization was negligible furthermore control tests with inactivated aerobic sludge 2 25 g l 1 were conducted in batch experiments to evaluate removal of each pharmaceutical due to sorption the inactivated sludge was prepared by adding 0 1 w v nan3 to the sludge min et al 2018 yu et al 2011 zhang 2010 concentrations of the pharmaceuticals in the aqueous and solid phases were determined separately at pre determined time intervals i e 0 2 5 12 24 and 48 h at the initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 the average concentrations of mtz smx cip cbz bzf and ibp were measured to be 93 1 1 0 94 5 1 3 8 0 0 2 98 1 1 9 92 0 1 8 84 2 0 3 μg l 1 in the aqueous phase respectively and 1 5 0 2 4 0 0 5 91 2 2 9 0 0 5 2 2 4 12 3 1 6 μg l 1 in the solid phase respectively finally the recoveries of the pharmaceuticals were calculated by combining the measured contents in both phases the average recoveries were 94 9 1 2 98 0 1 8 99 2 2 9 98 1 2 0 97 4 3 6 and 96 7 1 4 for mtz smx cip cbz bzf and ibp respectively indicating excellent mass balance quantitation of the pharmaceuticals in solid and liquid phases followed the procedures described in min et al 2018 specifically for solid phase analysis the sludge solids separated from slurry samples were extracted successively with methanol and acetone 1 1 three times in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature after centrifuging at 5000 rpm all supernatants were collected and combined then the organic solvent was evaporated at 40 c with a gentle nitrogen gas steam until nearly dry the sample was re dissolved again with 500 μl methanol vortex for 1 min and filtrated through 0 22 μm nylon syringe filters for liquid chromatography lc quantification for quantification of aqueous phase pharmaceuticals samples taken at designed time were filtered through 0 22 μm nylon syringe filters prior to lc analysis lc setup and analysis performed in a waters acquity uplc h class coupled with a photo diode array detector pda referred our previous study min et al 2018 2 4 batch sorption biodegradation experiments the batch experiments were conducted simulating sorption biodegradation processes using aerobic sludge from wwtp a and wwtp b as well as anoxic and anaerobic sludge from wwtp a it is assumed that process i is designed for the sorption process only while process ii is designed for both sorption and biodegradation processes thus the biodegradation process was calculated as 1 δc t c t i c t ii 2 r 1 c t c 0 100 where c 0 is the initial concentration of each compound μg l 1 c t is the concentration at time t μg l 1 c t i and c t ii are the concentrations in processes i and ii at time t μg l 1 δc t is the biodegradation amount at time t μg l 1 and r represents removal percentage for each sludge sample both sorption and biodegradation experiments were carried out in 0 5 l reactors for 48 h note that the reactors containing anoxic and anaerobic sludges were sealed since several target compounds exhibited limited biodegradation in order to capture this tiny trend we did not use any sample pretreatment techniques to avoid introducing extra uncertainty and propagation of errors thus we selected the concentration of pharmaceuticals ranging from 50 to 500 μg l 1 the reactors were controlled at 25 c and stirred at 500 rpm by magnetic stirrers the solution ph was controlled at 7 0 0 2 and do at ca 4 mg l 1 0 2 0 5 mg l 1 and 0 1 mg l 1 for the aerobic anoxic and anaerobic reactors respectively the mixed liquor suspended sludge mlss was adjusted to 2 25 0 20 g l 1 in all batch experiments samples of 2 ml slurry were collected at the designated time intervals 0 0 17 0 5 1 2 5 12 24 36 48 h all samples were filtered using 0 22 μm nylon syringe filters and stored at 4 c before chemical analysis it is reported that the first order kinetic model fits the biodegradation process well for micropollutants min et al 2018 urase and kikuta 2005 xue et al 2010 in the pseudo first order biodegradation it is assumed that the mlss concentration is constant during the relatively short term batch experiments thus biodegradation rate constants k bio can be derived based on eq 3 fernandez fontaina et al 2013 inyang et al 2016 joss et al 2006 min et al 2018 3 d c w d t k b i o x m l s s c w where c w is the concentration of the pharmaceuticals in the water phase μg l 1 x mlss is the concentration of suspended sludge g l 1 and k bio is pseudo first order rate constants l g 1 d 1 2 5 molecular descriptor density functional theory dft calculations were performed using gaussian 09 revision c 01 for the molecular structures of the target pharmaceuticals which were obtained via gaussview 5 0 dennington et al 2008 frisch et al 2010 the geometry optimization and vibrational frequencies were calculated at the b3lyp 6 31 g level of theory zhao and truhlar 2008 because the b3lyp functional yielded good performance to cost ratio for organic molecules an et al 2014 yang et al 2016 the frequency analysis of all stationary points of a molecule was conducted to assure that a true minimum on the potential energy surface is obtained i e no imaginary frequencies were present the molecular descriptor of electrophilicity index is defined as 4 ω ζ 2 2η where ζ is the electronegativity and η the hardness defined as 5 ζ ip ea 2 6 η ip ea 2 where ip is the ionization potential and ea is the electron affinity as shown in fig 1 the values of ω for cbz cip smx mtz bzf and ibp were calculated to be 0 393 0 318 0 159 0 238 0 414 and 0 652 ev respectively the homo lumo distribution for each molecule was also given in fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of pharmaceuticals by activated sludges from two different processes sorption and biodegradation of the target pharmaceuticals were evaluated in the batch experiments fig s1 shows the sorption removal of the pharmaceuticals by the aerobic activated sludge from wwtp a in the presence of nan3 0 1 w v at 48 h the average removal efficiencies of mtz smx cip cbz bzf and ibp were 11 5 0 5 12 4 1 2 83 0 2 0 10 2 0 4 12 2 0 7 and 13 5 1 4 respectively among which cip exhibited the highest sorption fig s2 shows that in the presence of both sorption and biodegradation process ii the 48 h removal efficiencies were increased to 61 9 18 4 34 1 10 6 89 5 6 0 11 5 2 0 93 3 7 2 and 100 respectively the elevated removal efficiencies indicate that biodegradation played an important role in the removal especially for mtz smx bzf and ibp in the aerobic activated sludge process the net biodegradation rates of the target compounds were calculated via eq 1 in aerobic activated sludge from wwtp a over a range of initial concentrations 50 500 μg l 1 fig 2 while cip exhibited the highest sorption capacity it displayed rather limited biodegradation up to 9 8 after 48 h the concentration of cbz remained relatively stable regardless of the initial concentration suggesting a strong resistance to the activated sludge process by comparison smx showed moderate biodegradability in the aerobic system with removal efficiencies up to 32 3 in the initial concentration range of 50 500 μg l 1 the removal efficiencies of mtz ranged from 20 1 to 76 8 at 48 h and those of bzf from 68 2 to 100 showing a high biodegradability the highest biodegradability was observed for ibp with the removal efficiencies up to 100 overall the biodegradability of target compounds followed the order of ibp bzf mtz smx cip cbz it should be noted that in fig 2 cip decreased to 94 4 μg l 1 and 472 6 μg l 1 in 0 5 h at the initial concentration of 100 and 500 μg l 1 respectively this decrease cannot be accounted for biodegradation in such a short time therefore it is possible that there are some minor experimental errors between the two experimental set ups in this study the activity of activated sludge was inhibited with the presence of nan3 sorption and biodegradation experiments were conducted following two processes process i was designed for the removal of pharmaceuticals in the batch reactors due to the sorption mechanism for process ii two removal pathways sorption and biodegradation were studied simultaneously thus the biodegradation process can be calculated based on eq 1 the batch experiments were based on two assumptions 1 the sorption capacity of sterilized activated sludge to target pharmaceuticals was the same as that of non sterilized activated sludge 2 intermediate products have a negligible effect on the sorption capacity of sludge to parent compounds however the two assumptions have several arguable concerns yu et al 2011 meaning that some minor experimental errors were unavoidable the decrease of cip occurred in a very short time and was likely due to the difference of the sorption capacity of sterilized and non sterilized activated sludge to cip therefore we conclude that the initial decrease of cip was just due to the adsorption difference and some minor experimental errors between two experimental setups our findings are consistent with previous results for example wick et al 2009 observed that cbz removal was negligible by conventional activated sludge treatment likewise it is reported that sorption rather than biodegradation was the dominant removal pathway for cip in activated sludge progress golet et al 2003 tran et al 2016 the reported removal efficiencies for smx ranged from 20 müller et al 2013 to up to 39 li and zhang 2010 in activated sludge at 48 h previous studies also supported that mtz is moderately biodegradable at intermediate concentrations of 50 5000 μg l 1 alexy et al 2004 ingerslev et al 2001 several studies also reported high removal efficiencies 80 of bzf and ibp in aerobic wastewater treatment plants castiglioni et al 2006 radjenovic et al 2009 suarez et al 2010 overall biodegradation of pharmaceuticals followed the same trend although some individual compounds exhibited somewhat different degradation rates probably due to the different characteristics of activated sludge such as microbial culture mlss hrt srt etc batt et al 2006 tran et al 2009 such compound dependent biodegradation is ascribed to their unique physicochemical properties first some pharmaceuticals such as the antibiotics cbz and cip are likely to be toxic to the cells this is not surprising given that they are both antibiotics due to its relatively high hydrophobicity table s1 cbz molecules can be adsorbed on the hydrophobic floc surfaces cip is zwitterion and is positively charged at treatment ph 6 8 therefore cip can be favorably taken up by negatively charged sludge floc surface through electrostatic interactions tran et al 2016 table s1 also reveals that the removal rates of the biodegradable pharmaceuticals increased with increasing log k ow values indicating that the hydrophobicity of organic molecules played a role in the biodegradation process it was reported that the oxygenase enzyme is hydrophobic ngai and ornston 1988 peterson and graham 1998 therefore more hydrophobic pharmaceutical molecules are expected to interact with the oxygenase enzyme more strongly leading to the higher removal rates except for cbz that is toxic to sludge flocs 3 2 biodegradation kinetics of pharmaceuticals the biodegradation kinetics of the pharmaceuticals were fitted with the first order kinetic model table s4 summarizes the k bio values for both readily biodegradable compounds i e mtz smx bzf and ibp and hardly biodegradable compounds i e cip and cbz apparently the model showed a much better goodness of fit for the more biodegradable pharmaceuticals with higher r 2 values in the aerobic sludge system of wwtp a the k bio values of mtz smx bzf and ibp were 0 16 0 08 0 47 and 3 52 l g 1 d 1 respectively at the initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 the k bio values of the four biodegradable pharmaceuticals decreased with increased initial concentrations from 50 to 500 μg l 1 table s4 suggesting that high initial concentrations pharmaceuticals inhibited activities of microorganisms edwards victor 1970 investigated the effect of inhibitory substrates on microbial kinetics they reported that highly concentrated substrates could alter the chemical potential intermediates cell permeability and enzyme activity structure synthesis resulting in toxic effects to microorganisms to different extents in fact alexy et al 2004 investigated the toxic effect of some antibiotics on biodegradability using closed bottle tests and observed that mtz at 5 95 mg l 1 suppressed biodegradation of acetate collado et al 2013 found that the fraction of actinobacteria chlorobia sphingobacteria and chloroflexi disappeared in the bacterial community exposed to smx at a concentration of 50 μg l 1 moreover dantas et al 2007 observed a significant increase of toxicity in the early stage of bzf exposure suggesting that bzf and its degradation byproducts may be inhibitory to aquatic living organisms pomati et al 2004 found that ibp at a concentration of 1000 μg l 1 inhibited the growth of synechocystis sp by up to 70 these results clearly indicated that these pharmaceuticals at elevated concentrations can pose formidable toxic and or inhibitory effects on aerobic activated sludge in typical sewage water pharmaceuticals are often present at trace levels ranging from ng l 1 to μg l 1 huerta fontela et al 2011 papageorgiou et al 2016 sui et al 2011 therefore pharmaceuticals at environmentally relevant concentrations should not be considered as a source of carbon or energy for microbial metabolic activity as such pharmaceuticals have been envisioned as non growth substrates in the obligatory presence of growth substrates e g glucose and phenol arp et al 2001 unlike common hydrocarbon substrates or nutrients many pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in wastewater are potentially toxic or recalcitrant to microorganisms as indicated by the inhibitory effects at high concentrations in fig 3 thus biodegradation of these micropollutants is often considered a co metabolism process which occurs during the conversion of growth substrates vannelli et al 1990 3 3 correlation analysis with kbio in activated sludge processes biodegradation of substrates involves two critical steps 1 sorption and mass transfer through the cell membranes and 2 binding of the substrates to the initial metabolic enzyme and subsequent biotransformation parsons and govers 1990 wammer and peters 2005 because pharmaceuticals are often present in the trace level the concentration gradient across the cell membrane is supposed to be quite low moreover sorption via hydrophobic electrostatic interactions on the cell membranes can also retard the diffusion process as such the first step may play a governing role in the overall biodegradation process chauhan et al 2008 kallimanis et al 2007 for hydrophobic organic compounds sorption is known to correlate the octanol water partition coefficient k ow where hydrophobic interactions dominate the sorption it should be noted that in addition to sorption to the cell membranes the hydrophobic interactions between organic molecules and metabolic enzymes may also impact the biodegradation process fig 4 shows the correlation between log k bio and apparent log k ow values for four biodegradable pharmaceuticals at various initial concentrations 50 500 μg l 1 non biodegradable cip and cbz are excluded in the correlation analysis however we observed that the goodness of fit decreased r 2 from 0 90 to 0 79 as the initial concentration increased at higher concentration e g 500 μg l 1 the mass transfer process or binding to the enzyme is no longer the rate limiting step and the catalytic conversion of the pharmaceuticals is likely to be controlled by the complexation with the enzyme and enzymatic reaction rates under this circumstance the biodegradability should be governed by the electronic and spatial structures of pharmaceutical molecules inspired by our previous study min et al 2018 we hypothesized that the electrophilicity index ω may serve as a more robust intrinsic indicator of biodegradation rates under various operating conditions e g initial concentration and aerobic or anaerobic conditions table s5 shows the regression analyses between k bio and ω for the four biodegradable pharmaceuticals for the aerobic sludge from msbr of wwtp a the k bio values correlated well with the ω values r 2 0 99 at all initial concentrations and increased as a function of ω from 50 to 500 μg l 1 fig 5 for anoxic and anaerobic activated sludges however the correlation of k bio and ω measured at initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 was not significant figures s3 s5 table s4 this can be attributed to the suppression of oxygenase at low do dissolved oxygen concentrations ong et al 2005 moreover in the anoxic and anaerobic environments the process of transferring electron density of a pharmaceutical molecule is inhibited lahti and oikari 2011 to further confirm the correlation between ω and k bio under aerobic conditions biodegradation rates of selected pharmaceuticals were also tested using the aerobic sludge of wwtp b section s1 and fig s6 again ω correlates well with k bio r2 0 99 for the four pharmaceuticals at initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 fig 5 therefore ω as an electronic parameter appears to be a better indicator or descriptor for predicting the biodegradation rates of pharmaceuticals than the conventional log k ow values this can be attributed to the inherent nature of ω which is a measure of the ability of a molecule to add electron density parr et al 1999 corresponds to the process where the molecule acts as an electrophile although the formal transfer of a single electron is not a requirement as in electron affinity in terms of the mechanism the oxidation of the pharmaceuticals occurs primarily with p450 cytochromes while the active site of many of these enzymes have long been recognized as being hydrophobic denisov et al 2005 leading to a reasonable correlation to the log k ow substrate binding to the enzyme is not the rate controlling step of the reaction the mechanism involves the binding of the substrate with the displacement of a water molecule from the 6th coordination site of the iron atom this step is accompanied by the change from a low spin state s 1 2 which was stabilized by the water molecule to a high spin state s 5 2 although mixed spin states exist i e s 3 2 5 2 where the removal of water is not 100 successful the change in spin state results in a lower reduction potential for the subsequent electron transfer from flavin mononucleotide fmn this is followed by the binding of oxygen to the iron atom and a subsequent second electron transfer reaction leading to the oxidation of the substrate it is the electron transfer reaction that is rate controlling not the substrate binding this process is aided by the change in reduction potential caused by the change in spin state which is caused by the loss of a water molecule from the 6th coordination site of the iron atom denisov et al 2005 the displacement of the water molecule will be more effective if the substrate binds to the water molecule itself clearly removing it from the iron atom allowing for the change in spin state leading to the first electron transfer from fmn substrates with a high ω are strongly electrophilic and will associate with the lone pair electrons from the water molecule even if there is no formal electron transfer better than those with a low ω in the kinetics study we found that those compounds of which the first order kinetic model fit the biodegradation process very well such as mtz smx bzf and ibp with correlation coefficients r 2 0 8 following the concept that uses ω as an indicator for biodegradation as comparison cip and cbz r 2 0 6 did not follow this concept therefore it is suggested to prescreen compounds which are not following the first order kinetic model in the activated sludge system only compounds for which biodegradation process play a major role in activated sludge system and biodegradation process fit the first order kinetic might follow the suggested concept note this is the very first study that proposed to use ω to predict the biodegradation of pharmaceuticals and we sensed this predicting tool needs to be improved in several aspects 1 it did not save the hassle of performing biodegradation experiments using activated sludge since the first order kinetic model was used as the prescreening protocol 2 the variation of compound concentrations were not integrated in the predicting tool which usually varied in wastewater treatment plants and 3 only a limited number of pharmaceuticals were tested in the current study which necessitate a more comprehensive screening of a broader range of compounds to test the robustness of the ω based predicting tool for the biodegradation kinetics 3 4 biodegradation pathways typically the first important pathway for microorganisms to initiate the biotransformation of micropollutants is hydrolysis catalyzed by hydrolases where water acts as a nucleophile meunier et al 2004 next denisov et al 2005 have found that cytochrome p450 a very large and diverse group of enzymes are associated with the metabolism of pharmaceuticals and are involved in many reactions such as hydroxylation epoxidation desulfuration peroxidation deamination sulfoxidation dehalogenation n oxide reduction and n o s dealkylation meunier et al 2004 in particular the primary oxidation route occurs in which the iron iii peroxo porphyrin acts as a nucleophile adding either an epoxide or hydroxyl group to the pharmaceutical molecule guengerich 2001 meunier et al 2004 mtz was reported to undergo oxidation by cytochrome p450 with many oxidized metabolites including l hydroxyethyl 2 carboxy 5 nitroimidazole 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 hydroxymethyl 5 nitroimidazole and 2 methyl 5 nitroimidazole l acetic acid produced lanzky and halting sørensen 1997 similar biological reactions could occur in microorganisms girvan and munro 2016 lewis and wiseman 2005 smx was hydrolyzed first and underwent deamination and desulfurization by cytochrome p450 derivatives meunier et al 2004 some previous studies reported the biodegradation of smx produced a number of metabolites including aniline sulfanilamide 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole 4 aminothiophenol jiang et al 2014 hydroxy n 5 methyl 1 2 oxazol 3 yl benzene 1 sulfonamide and n acetyl smx larcher and yargeau 2012 while cip was mainly eliminated by sorption it also underwent defluorination and hydroxylation oxidative decarboxylation by cytochrome p450 wetzatein et al 1999 cbz was hardly biodegradable suggesting that the enzymes necessary for biodegradation are lacking in microorganisms in the activated sludge keen et al 2012 it is observed that the aromatic compounds were mediated by cytochrome p450 with epoxidation at c10 c11 and hydroxylation of the benzene ring meunier et al 2004 xiong et al 2016 quintana et al 2005 found that bzf undergoes a number of oxidation reactions including hydrolysis decarboxylation and hydroxylation of the alkyl side chain finally ibp was extensively oxidized by cytochrome p450 enzymes resulting in hydroxylation of the aromatic ring and side chains and ultimately causing the loss of the side chains and eventual degradation of the aromatic ring marchlewicz et al 2017a 2017b although previous studies have provided valuable information on the degradation of pharmaceuticals by p450 enzymes there is still limited knowledge of degradation mechanism degradation byproducts metabolic pathways and microbial species on which degradation is dependent indeed the process is complicated due to the presence of co metabolites varied operational conditions such as hrt and srt and the effects of ph and metal ions in the activated sludge process yang et al 2013 further studies are needed to identify the type of microorganisms or characterize the entire microbial community in activated sludge systems it is of great significance to understand the dominant bacteria species and enzymes that degrade micropollutants to effectively improve the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals 4 conclusions this study measured biodegradation rates of six model pharmaceuticals using various activated sludges and under aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions the results showed that the target pharmaceuticals exhibited different biodegradability while cba and cip were hardly biodegradable mtz and smx were moderately biodegradable and bzf and ibp were readily biodegradable their biodegradability followed the order of ibp bzf mtz smx cip cbz based on the reaction rate constants cip and cbz are defined as non biodegradable due to their un reactivities biodegradation of mtz smx bzf and ibp followed the pseudo first order kinetic model well with high r 2 values 0 90 the initial concentrations of the pharmaceuticals had a strong influence on the biodegradation rates and elevated concentrations of the substrates especially the antibiotics inhibited the microbial processes based on correlation analysis with several different activated sludges the electrophilicity index ω was confirmed to be a much robust indicator of biodegradability of the pharmaceuticals at different initial concentrations 50 500 μg l and under aerobic conditions this correlation is very useful especially when the conventional parameter log k ow fails to correlate with the biodegradation rates as is usually the case for the biodegradation of pharmaceuticals this finding warrants further extended investigations with a broader array of pharmaceuticals and may aid to understand the biodegradation mechanisms of pharmaceuticals in the activated sludge processes acknowledgements funding from national natural science foundation of china no 21507167 hunan provincial

18720,improving biodegradation of pharmaceuticals during wastewater treatment is critical to control the release of emerging micropollutants to natural waters in this study biodegradation of six model pharmaceuticals was investigated at different initial concentrations in two discrete activated sludge systems and moreover the correlation was explored between the biodegradation rate and key molecular properties of the contaminants first the biodegradation rates of the pharmaceuticals were measured fitting a pseudo first order kinetic model to the experimental kinetic data the degradation rate constants k bio were found to negatively correlate to the initial concentration of the chemicals indicating an inhibitory effect on the microorganisms by the pharmaceuticals further examinations of the rate data against the key molecular properties of the pharmaceuticals revealed for the first time that the electrophilicity index ω a measure of electrophilic power served as a better indicator of the biodegradability and predictive parameter for the k bio than the conventional log k ow a measure of hydrophobicity in the two discrete aerobic activated sludge systems however the correlation strength goodness of fit between ω and k bio deteriorated when the reactor turned from aerobic to anoxic and anaerobic conditions suggesting that electron transfer from pharmaceutical molecules to enzymes was inhibited when dissolved oxygen was deficit or absent our results show that ω can potentially serve as a straightforward and robust indicator for predicting the biodegradability of pharmaceutical in conventional activated sludge processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceutical biodegradation activated sludge emerging micropollutants hydrophobicity electrophilicity index 1 introduction the potential adverse effects of pharmaceuticals released from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been a major concern to human health and the environment sanderson et al 2004 verlicchi et al 2012 although advanced water treatment technologies e g oxidation and membrane separation following the secondary treatments may reduce the levels of pharmaceuticals in the effluents gao et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 2019 it is highly desired that the chemicals are removed or degraded within the wastewater treatment plants for both economic and practical considerations in conventional activated sludge processes pharmaceuticals can be removed through a number of physical chemical and biological processes including volatilization sorption oxidation and biodegradation li and zhang 2010 luo et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 among which biodegradation is considered the dominant attenuation process ericson 2010 kim et al 2005 typically the pseudo first order kinetic model is used to interpret the biodegradation rate data and the reaction rate constant k bio is used to assess the biodegradability of pharmaceuticals in wwtps for example joss et al 2006 studied the removal of 35 pharmaceuticals personal care products and hormones in an activated sludge system and found that the k bio values may serve as an indicator for overall removal rates namely up to 20 removal for chemicals with low k bio values 0 1 l g 1 d 1 20 90 removal with moderate k bio values 0 1 10 l g 1 d 1 and more than 90 removal with high k bio values 10 l g 1 d 1 moreover k bio values also provide an insightful guide to design and optimize operational conditions for the removal of exogenous macro and micro pollutants andreozzi et al 2006 plósz et al 2010 suarez et al 2010 many factors can affect the biodegradation rates in activated sludge processes including microbial cultures e g sludge type and biomass concentration properties of the exogenous pollutants e g concentration molecular

interactions with microorganisms boopathy 2000 tang et al 2005 liu et al 2011 investigated biodegradation of three benzotriazoles and found that the k bio values were strongly influenced by electron acceptors present wammer and peters 2005 examined the role of molecular structures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and observed a quantitative structure activity relationship they found that the presence of a 5 carbon ring or an alkyl substitute in an α position altered k bio to a great extent andreozzi et al 2006 evaluated effects of functional groups e g oh ch3 cl and no2 on the k bio values of aromatic compounds and their results showed that the k bio values decreased with an increasing number of nitro groups no2 or chlorine atoms cl apparently the presence of the substitute functional groups has altered the electron distribution on the molecules resulting in different reactivities with microbial cells however a general correlation remains lacking between k bio and molecular structural properties particularly for a wide variety of emerging micropollutants including pharmaceuticals such correlation equations would be of great practical value to evaluate and possibly predict the fate of pollutants in both engineered and natural systems many fundamental questions are yet to be answered for assessing biodegradation kinetics based on the physio chemical properties of a chemical including 1 is pollutant diffusion or enzymatic reactivity the rate limiting step for the biodegradation process 2 what is the role of electron transfer in the process and 3 is there a robust indicator that can describe or predict the k bio values in activated sludge systems to address these critical issues this present study aimed to develop a viable indicator that can predict the biodegradation rates of pharmaceuticals based on fundamental physico chemical parameters of a chemical i e hydrophobicity log k ow and electrophilicity index ω in typical activated sludge processes specifically six pharmaceuticals covering a wide range of structures and biodegradability were selected as target compounds namely metronidazole mtz bezafibrate bzf ibuprofen ibp sulfamethoxazole smx carbamazepine cbz and ciprofloxacin cip the k bio values were determined at initial concentrations from 50 to 500 μg l 1 and in aerobic activated sludge systems and for comparison under anoxic and anaerobic conditions for the first time we analyzed the relationship between k bio and ω or log k ow using both experimental and computational approaches and tested it as a viable indicator to predict the biodegradability of pharmaceuticals in wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the selected pharmaceuticals were purchased from sigma aldrich u s with purities higher than 99 8 table s1 in the supplementary material lists their relevant physicochemical properties acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from merck germany sodium azide nan3 99 5 which was used as a bio growth inhibitor was obtained from dingguo biotechnology beijing china synthetic wastewater and stock solutions were prepared following the methods by min et al 2018 2 2 activated sludge collection fresh activated sludge was collected from the aeration basins of two separate wwtps in changsha china wwtp a and wwtp b wwtp a employs a modified sequencing batch reactor msbr system whereas wwtp b utilizes a modified anaerobic anoxic aerobic a a o system these two wwtps were selected because their treatment technologies represent two different but common activated sludge treatment systems table s2 summaries the wastewater characteristics and operational parameters wwtp a has a treatment capacity of 40 000 m3 d 1 and it features an integrated multi cell process in a single chamber tank with front end anaerobic anoxic aerobic a a o and back end sbr the hrt and srt of the msbr are 15 h and 12 d respectively the mixed liquid suspended sludge mlss is 2 5 g l 1 wwtp b has a treatment capacity of 100 000 m3 d 1 with an a a o process the hrt and srt are 12 h and 9 d respectively the mlss is 3 5 g l 1 sludge samples from the wwtps were collected and transported to the laboratory in coolers 4 c within 5 h then the sludge was pretreated based on methods by min et al 2018 in brief the sludge was aerated for 48 h and then washed three times by ultrapure water to remove any impurities adsorbed by biomass then the sludge was settled and the supernatant was replaced with synthetic wastewater all the experiments were performed within one month 2 3 quality controls all experiments were performed in the absence of light to exclude the possible interference of photolysis in order to determine the hydrolysis and volatilization of the target pharmaceuticals control experiments were carried out in open bioreactors at an initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 for each compound without activated sludge no concentration changes were observed during the course of the experiment table s3 the mean analytical recoveries for the target compounds mtz smx cip cbz bzf and ibp were 100 4 0 8 99 0 1 0 98 3 1 3 97 8 0 8 98 9 0 9 and 101 1 1 respectively indicating that the loss of the pharmaceuticals due to hydrolysis and volatilization was negligible furthermore control tests with inactivated aerobic sludge 2 25 g l 1 were conducted in batch experiments to evaluate removal of each pharmaceutical due to sorption the inactivated sludge was prepared by adding 0 1 w v nan3 to the sludge min et al 2018 yu et al 2011 zhang 2010 concentrations of the pharmaceuticals in the aqueous and solid phases were determined separately at pre determined time intervals i e 0 2 5 12 24 and 48 h at the initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 the average concentrations of mtz smx cip cbz bzf and ibp were measured to be 93 1 1 0 94 5 1 3 8 0 0 2 98 1 1 9 92 0 1 8 84 2 0 3 μg l 1 in the aqueous phase respectively and 1 5 0 2 4 0 0 5 91 2 2 9 0 0 5 2 2 4 12 3 1 6 μg l 1 in the solid phase respectively finally the recoveries of the pharmaceuticals were calculated by combining the measured contents in both phases the average recoveries were 94 9 1 2 98 0 1 8 99 2 2 9 98 1 2 0 97 4 3 6 and 96 7 1 4 for mtz smx cip cbz bzf and ibp respectively indicating excellent mass balance quantitation of the pharmaceuticals in solid and liquid phases followed the procedures described in min et al 2018 specifically for solid phase analysis the sludge solids separated from slurry samples were extracted successively with methanol and acetone 1 1 three times in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature after centrifuging at 5000 rpm all supernatants were collected and combined then the organic solvent was evaporated at 40 c with a gentle nitrogen gas steam until nearly dry the sample was re dissolved again with 500 μl methanol vortex for 1 min and filtrated through 0 22 μm nylon syringe filters for liquid chromatography lc quantification for quantification of aqueous phase pharmaceuticals samples taken at designed time were filtered through 0 22 μm nylon syringe filters prior to lc analysis lc setup and analysis performed in a waters acquity uplc h class coupled with a photo diode array detector pda referred our previous study min et al 2018 2 4 batch sorption biodegradation experiments the batch experiments were conducted simulating sorption biodegradation processes using aerobic sludge from wwtp a and wwtp b as well as anoxic and anaerobic sludge from wwtp a it is assumed that process i is designed for the sorption process only while process ii is designed for both sorption and biodegradation processes thus the biodegradation process was calculated as 1 δc t c t i c t ii 2 r 1 c t c 0 100 where c 0 is the initial concentration of each compound μg l 1 c t is the concentration at time t μg l 1 c t i and c t ii are the concentrations in processes i and ii at time t μg l 1 δc t is the biodegradation amount at time t μg l 1 and r represents removal percentage for each sludge sample both sorption and biodegradation experiments were carried out in 0 5 l reactors for 48 h note that the reactors containing anoxic and anaerobic sludges were sealed since several target compounds exhibited limited biodegradation in order to capture this tiny trend we did not use any sample pretreatment techniques to avoid introducing extra uncertainty and propagation of errors thus we selected the concentration of pharmaceuticals ranging from 50 to 500 μg l 1 the reactors were controlled at 25 c and stirred at 500 rpm by magnetic stirrers the solution ph was controlled at 7 0 0 2 and do at ca 4 mg l 1 0 2 0 5 mg l 1 and 0 1 mg l 1 for the aerobic anoxic and anaerobic reactors respectively the mixed liquor suspended sludge mlss was adjusted to 2 25 0 20 g l 1 in all batch experiments samples of 2 ml slurry were collected at the designated time intervals 0 0 17 0 5 1 2 5 12 24 36 48 h all samples were filtered using 0 22 μm nylon syringe filters and stored at 4 c before chemical analysis it is reported that the first order kinetic model fits the biodegradation process well for micropollutants min et al 2018 urase and kikuta 2005 xue et al 2010 in the pseudo first order biodegradation it is assumed that the mlss concentration is constant during the relatively short term batch experiments thus biodegradation rate constants k bio can be derived based on eq 3 fernandez fontaina et al 2013 inyang et al 2016 joss et al 2006 min et al 2018 3 d c w d t k b i o x m l s s c w where c w is the concentration of the pharmaceuticals in the water phase μg l 1 x mlss is the concentration of suspended sludge g l 1 and k bio is pseudo first order rate constants l g 1 d 1 2 5 molecular descriptor density functional theory dft calculations were performed using gaussian 09 revision c 01 for the molecular structures of the target pharmaceuticals which were obtained via gaussview 5 0 dennington et al 2008 frisch et al 2010 the geometry optimization and vibrational frequencies were calculated at the b3lyp 6 31 g level of theory zhao and truhlar 2008 because the b3lyp functional yielded good performance to cost ratio for organic molecules an et al 2014 yang et al 2016 the frequency analysis of all stationary points of a molecule was conducted to assure that a true minimum on the potential energy surface is obtained i e no imaginary frequencies were present the molecular descriptor of electrophilicity index is defined as 4 ω ζ 2 2η where ζ is the electronegativity and η the hardness defined as 5 ζ ip ea 2 6 η ip ea 2 where ip is the ionization potential and ea is the electron affinity as shown in fig 1 the values of ω for cbz cip smx mtz bzf and ibp were calculated to be 0 393 0 318 0 159 0 238 0 414 and 0 652 ev respectively the homo lumo distribution for each molecule was also given in fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of pharmaceuticals by activated sludges from two different processes sorption and biodegradation of the target pharmaceuticals were evaluated in the batch experiments fig s1 shows the sorption removal of the pharmaceuticals by the aerobic activated sludge from wwtp a in the presence of nan3 0 1 w v at 48 h the average removal efficiencies of mtz smx cip cbz bzf and ibp were 11 5 0 5 12 4 1 2 83 0 2 0 10 2 0 4 12 2 0 7 and 13 5 1 4 respectively among which cip exhibited the highest sorption fig s2 shows that in the presence of both sorption and biodegradation process ii the 48 h removal efficiencies were increased to 61 9 18 4 34 1 10 6 89 5 6 0 11 5 2 0 93 3 7 2 and 100 respectively the elevated removal efficiencies indicate that biodegradation played an important role in the removal especially for mtz smx bzf and ibp in the aerobic activated sludge process the net biodegradation rates of the target compounds were calculated via eq 1 in aerobic activated sludge from wwtp a over a range of initial concentrations 50 500 μg l 1 fig 2 while cip exhibited the highest sorption capacity it displayed rather limited biodegradation up to 9 8 after 48 h the concentration of cbz remained relatively stable regardless of the initial concentration suggesting a strong resistance to the activated sludge process by comparison smx showed moderate biodegradability in the aerobic system with removal efficiencies up to 32 3 in the initial concentration range of 50 500 μg l 1 the removal efficiencies of mtz ranged from 20 1 to 76 8 at 48 h and those of bzf from 68 2 to 100 showing a high biodegradability the highest biodegradability was observed for ibp with the removal efficiencies up to 100 overall the biodegradability of target compounds followed the order of ibp bzf mtz smx cip cbz it should be noted that in fig 2 cip decreased to 94 4 μg l 1 and 472 6 μg l 1 in 0 5 h at the initial concentration of 100 and 500 μg l 1 respectively this decrease cannot be accounted for biodegradation in such a short time therefore it is possible that there are some minor experimental errors between the two experimental set ups in this study the activity of activated sludge was inhibited with the presence of nan3 sorption and biodegradation experiments were conducted following two processes process i was designed for the removal of pharmaceuticals in the batch reactors due to the sorption mechanism for process ii two removal pathways sorption and biodegradation were studied simultaneously thus the biodegradation process can be calculated based on eq 1 the batch experiments were based on two assumptions 1 the sorption capacity of sterilized activated sludge to target pharmaceuticals was the same as that of non sterilized activated sludge 2 intermediate products have a negligible effect on the sorption capacity of sludge to parent compounds however the two assumptions have several arguable concerns yu et al 2011 meaning that some minor experimental errors were unavoidable the decrease of cip occurred in a very short time and was likely due to the difference of the sorption capacity of sterilized and non sterilized activated sludge to cip therefore we conclude that the initial decrease of cip was just due to the adsorption difference and some minor experimental errors between two experimental setups our findings are consistent with previous results for example wick et al 2009 observed that cbz removal was negligible by conventional activated sludge treatment likewise it is reported that sorption rather than biodegradation was the dominant removal pathway for cip in activated sludge progress golet et al 2003 tran et al 2016 the reported removal efficiencies for smx ranged from 20 müller et al 2013 to up to 39 li and zhang 2010 in activated sludge at 48 h previous studies also supported that mtz is moderately biodegradable at intermediate concentrations of 50 5000 μg l 1 alexy et al 2004 ingerslev et al 2001 several studies also reported high removal efficiencies 80 of bzf and ibp in aerobic wastewater treatment plants castiglioni et al 2006 radjenovic et al 2009 suarez et al 2010 overall biodegradation of pharmaceuticals followed the same trend although some individual compounds exhibited somewhat different degradation rates probably due to the different characteristics of activated sludge such as microbial culture mlss hrt srt etc batt et al 2006 tran et al 2009 such compound dependent biodegradation is ascribed to their unique physicochemical properties first some pharmaceuticals such as the antibiotics cbz and cip are likely to be toxic to the cells this is not surprising given that they are both antibiotics due to its relatively high hydrophobicity table s1 cbz molecules can be adsorbed on the hydrophobic floc surfaces cip is zwitterion and is positively charged at treatment ph 6 8 therefore cip can be favorably taken up by negatively charged sludge floc surface through electrostatic interactions tran et al 2016 table s1 also reveals that the removal rates of the biodegradable pharmaceuticals increased with increasing log k ow values indicating that the hydrophobicity of organic molecules played a role in the biodegradation process it was reported that the oxygenase enzyme is hydrophobic ngai and ornston 1988 peterson and graham 1998 therefore more hydrophobic pharmaceutical molecules are expected to interact with the oxygenase enzyme more strongly leading to the higher removal rates except for cbz that is toxic to sludge flocs 3 2 biodegradation kinetics of pharmaceuticals the biodegradation kinetics of the pharmaceuticals were fitted with the first order kinetic model table s4 summarizes the k bio values for both readily biodegradable compounds i e mtz smx bzf and ibp and hardly biodegradable compounds i e cip and cbz apparently the model showed a much better goodness of fit for the more biodegradable pharmaceuticals with higher r 2 values in the aerobic sludge system of wwtp a the k bio values of mtz smx bzf and ibp were 0 16 0 08 0 47 and 3 52 l g 1 d 1 respectively at the initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 the k bio values of the four biodegradable pharmaceuticals decreased with increased initial concentrations from 50 to 500 μg l 1 table s4 suggesting that high initial concentrations pharmaceuticals inhibited activities of microorganisms edwards victor 1970 investigated the effect of inhibitory substrates on microbial kinetics they reported that highly concentrated substrates could alter the chemical potential intermediates cell permeability and enzyme activity structure synthesis resulting in toxic effects to microorganisms to different extents in fact alexy et al 2004 investigated the toxic effect of some antibiotics on biodegradability using closed bottle tests and observed that mtz at 5 95 mg l 1 suppressed biodegradation of acetate collado et al 2013 found that the fraction of actinobacteria chlorobia sphingobacteria and chloroflexi disappeared in the bacterial community exposed to smx at a concentration of 50 μg l 1 moreover dantas et al 2007 observed a significant increase of toxicity in the early stage of bzf exposure suggesting that bzf and its degradation byproducts may be inhibitory to aquatic living organisms pomati et al 2004 found that ibp at a concentration of 1000 μg l 1 inhibited the growth of synechocystis sp by up to 70 these results clearly indicated that these pharmaceuticals at elevated concentrations can pose formidable toxic and or inhibitory effects on aerobic activated sludge in typical sewage water pharmaceuticals are often present at trace levels ranging from ng l 1 to μg l 1 huerta fontela et al 2011 papageorgiou et al 2016 sui et al 2011 therefore pharmaceuticals at environmentally relevant concentrations should not be considered as a source of carbon or energy for microbial metabolic activity as such pharmaceuticals have been envisioned as non growth substrates in the obligatory presence of growth substrates e g glucose and phenol arp et al 2001 unlike common hydrocarbon substrates or nutrients many pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in wastewater are potentially toxic or recalcitrant to microorganisms as indicated by the inhibitory effects at high concentrations in fig 3 thus biodegradation of these micropollutants is often considered a co metabolism process which occurs during the conversion of growth substrates vannelli et al 1990 3 3 correlation analysis with kbio in activated sludge processes biodegradation of substrates involves two critical steps 1 sorption and mass transfer through the cell membranes and 2 binding of the substrates to the initial metabolic enzyme and subsequent biotransformation parsons and govers 1990 wammer and peters 2005 because pharmaceuticals are often present in the trace level the concentration gradient across the cell membrane is supposed to be quite low moreover sorption via hydrophobic electrostatic interactions on the cell membranes can also retard the diffusion process as such the first step may play a governing role in the overall biodegradation process chauhan et al 2008 kallimanis et al 2007 for hydrophobic organic compounds sorption is known to correlate the octanol water partition coefficient k ow where hydrophobic interactions dominate the sorption it should be noted that in addition to sorption to the cell membranes the hydrophobic interactions between organic molecules and metabolic enzymes may also impact the biodegradation process fig 4 shows the correlation between log k bio and apparent log k ow values for four biodegradable pharmaceuticals at various initial concentrations 50 500 μg l 1 non biodegradable cip and cbz are excluded in the correlation analysis however we observed that the goodness of fit decreased r 2 from 0 90 to 0 79 as the initial concentration increased at higher concentration e g 500 μg l 1 the mass transfer process or binding to the enzyme is no longer the rate limiting step and the catalytic conversion of the pharmaceuticals is likely to be controlled by the complexation with the enzyme and enzymatic reaction rates under this circumstance the biodegradability should be governed by the electronic and spatial structures of pharmaceutical molecules inspired by our previous study min et al 2018 we hypothesized that the electrophilicity index ω may serve as a more robust intrinsic indicator of biodegradation rates under various operating conditions e g initial concentration and aerobic or anaerobic conditions table s5 shows the regression analyses between k bio and ω for the four biodegradable pharmaceuticals for the aerobic sludge from msbr of wwtp a the k bio values correlated well with the ω values r 2 0 99 at all initial concentrations and increased as a function of ω from 50 to 500 μg l 1 fig 5 for anoxic and anaerobic activated sludges however the correlation of k bio and ω measured at initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 was not significant figures s3 s5 table s4 this can be attributed to the suppression of oxygenase at low do dissolved oxygen concentrations ong et al 2005 moreover in the anoxic and anaerobic environments the process of transferring electron density of a pharmaceutical molecule is inhibited lahti and oikari 2011 to further confirm the correlation between ω and k bio under aerobic conditions biodegradation rates of selected pharmaceuticals were also tested using the aerobic sludge of wwtp b section s1 and fig s6 again ω correlates well with k bio r2 0 99 for the four pharmaceuticals at initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 fig 5 therefore ω as an electronic parameter appears to be a better indicator or descriptor for predicting the biodegradation rates of pharmaceuticals than the conventional log k ow values this can be attributed to the inherent nature of ω which is a measure of the ability of a molecule to add electron density parr et al 1999 corresponds to the process where the molecule acts as an electrophile although the formal transfer of a single electron is not a requirement as in electron affinity in terms of the mechanism the oxidation of the pharmaceuticals occurs primarily with p450 cytochromes while the active site of many of these enzymes have long been recognized as being hydrophobic denisov et al 2005 leading to a reasonable correlation to the log k ow substrate binding to the enzyme is not the rate controlling step of the reaction the mechanism involves the binding of the substrate with the displacement of a water molecule from the 6th coordination site of the iron atom this step is accompanied by the change from a low spin state s 1 2 which was stabilized by the water molecule to a high spin state s 5 2 although mixed spin states exist i e s 3 2 5 2 where the removal of water is not 100 successful the change in spin state results in a lower reduction potential for the subsequent electron transfer from flavin mononucleotide fmn this is followed by the binding of oxygen to the iron atom and a subsequent second electron transfer reaction leading to the oxidation of the substrate it is the electron transfer reaction that is rate controlling not the substrate binding this process is aided by the change in reduction potential caused by the change in spin state which is caused by the loss of a water molecule from the 6th coordination site of the iron atom denisov et al 2005 the displacement of the water molecule will be more effective if the substrate binds to the water molecule itself clearly removing it from the iron atom allowing for the change in spin state leading to the first electron transfer from fmn substrates with a high ω are strongly electrophilic and will associate with the lone pair electrons from the water molecule even if there is no formal electron transfer better than those with a low ω in the kinetics study we found that those compounds of which the first order kinetic model fit the biodegradation process very well such as mtz smx bzf and ibp with correlation coefficients r 2 0 8 following the concept that uses ω as an indicator for biodegradation as comparison cip and cbz r 2 0 6 did not follow this concept therefore it is suggested to prescreen compounds which are not following the first order kinetic model in the activated sludge system only compounds for which biodegradation process play a major role in activated sludge system and biodegradation process fit the first order kinetic might follow the suggested concept note this is the very first study that proposed to use ω to predict the biodegradation of pharmaceuticals and we sensed this predicting tool needs to be improved in several aspects 1 it did not save the hassle of performing biodegradation experiments using activated sludge since the first order kinetic model was used as the prescreening protocol 2 the variation of compound concentrations were not integrated in the predicting tool which usually varied in wastewater treatment plants and 3 only a limited number of pharmaceuticals were tested in the current study which necessitate a more comprehensive screening of a broader range of compounds to test the robustness of the ω based predicting tool for the biodegradation kinetics 3 4 biodegradation pathways typically the first important pathway for microorganisms to initiate the biotransformation of micropollutants is hydrolysis catalyzed by hydrolases where water acts as a nucleophile meunier et al 2004 next denisov et al 2005 have found that cytochrome p450 a very large and diverse group of enzymes are associated with the metabolism of pharmaceuticals and are involved in many reactions such as hydroxylation epoxidation desulfuration peroxidation deamination sulfoxidation dehalogenation n oxide reduction and n o s dealkylation meunier et al 2004 in particular the primary oxidation route occurs in which the iron iii peroxo porphyrin acts as a nucleophile adding either an epoxide or hydroxyl group to the pharmaceutical molecule guengerich 2001 meunier et al 2004 mtz was reported to undergo oxidation by cytochrome p450 with many oxidized metabolites including l hydroxyethyl 2 carboxy 5 nitroimidazole 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 hydroxymethyl 5 nitroimidazole and 2 methyl 5 nitroimidazole l acetic acid produced lanzky and halting sørensen 1997 similar biological reactions could occur in microorganisms girvan and munro 2016 lewis and wiseman 2005 smx was hydrolyzed first and underwent deamination and desulfurization by cytochrome p450 derivatives meunier et al 2004 some previous studies reported the biodegradation of smx produced a number of metabolites including aniline sulfanilamide 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole 4 aminothiophenol jiang et al 2014 hydroxy n 5 methyl 1 2 oxazol 3 yl benzene 1 sulfonamide and n acetyl smx larcher and yargeau 2012 while cip was mainly eliminated by sorption it also underwent defluorination and hydroxylation oxidative decarboxylation by cytochrome p450 wetzatein et al 1999 cbz was hardly biodegradable suggesting that the enzymes necessary for biodegradation are lacking in microorganisms in the activated sludge keen et al 2012 it is observed that the aromatic compounds were mediated by cytochrome p450 with epoxidation at c10 c11 and hydroxylation of the benzene ring meunier et al 2004 xiong et al 2016 quintana et al 2005 found that bzf undergoes a number of oxidation reactions including hydrolysis decarboxylation and hydroxylation of the alkyl side chain finally ibp was extensively oxidized by cytochrome p450 enzymes resulting in hydroxylation of the aromatic ring and side chains and ultimately causing the loss of the side chains and eventual degradation of the aromatic ring marchlewicz et al 2017a 2017b although previous studies have provided valuable information on the degradation of pharmaceuticals by p450 enzymes there is still limited knowledge of degradation mechanism degradation byproducts metabolic pathways and microbial species on which degradation is dependent indeed the process is complicated due to the presence of co metabolites varied operational conditions such as hrt and srt and the effects of ph and metal ions in the activated sludge process yang et al 2013 further studies are needed to identify the type of microorganisms or characterize the entire microbial community in activated sludge systems it is of great significance to understand the dominant bacteria species and enzymes that degrade micropollutants to effectively improve the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals 4 conclusions this study measured biodegradation rates of six model pharmaceuticals using various activated sludges and under aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions the results showed that the target pharmaceuticals exhibited different biodegradability while cba and cip were hardly biodegradable mtz and smx were moderately biodegradable and bzf and ibp were readily biodegradable their biodegradability followed the order of ibp bzf mtz smx cip cbz based on the reaction rate constants cip and cbz are defined as non biodegradable due to their un reactivities biodegradation of mtz smx bzf and ibp followed the pseudo first order kinetic model well with high r 2 values 0 90 the initial concentrations of the pharmaceuticals had a strong influence on the biodegradation rates and elevated concentrations of the substrates especially the antibiotics inhibited the microbial processes based on correlation analysis with several different activated sludges the electrophilicity index ω was confirmed to be a much robust indicator of biodegradability of the pharmaceuticals at different initial concentrations 50 500 μg l and under aerobic conditions this correlation is very useful especially when the conventional parameter log k ow fails to correlate with the biodegradation rates as is usually the case for the biodegradation of pharmaceuticals this finding warrants further extended investigations with a broader array of pharmaceuticals and may aid to understand the biodegradation mechanisms of pharmaceuticals in the activated sludge processes acknowledgements funding from national natural science foundation of china no 21507167 hunan provincial

interacted closely with the compositional variability of dom in the investigated alpine glacial environments by both producing and consuming of dom graphical abstract image 1 keywords tibetan plateau glacier bacterial community chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom network analysis 1 introduction glaciers contain approximately 75 of the freshwater on earth anesio et al 2009 and are highly sensitive to climate change glacial ecosystems are not isolated units but are hydrologically connected with other systems including tundras rivers lakes and coastal environments boetius et al 2015 thus improving our understanding of glacial biogeochemistry is crucial to assess how these environments will respond to climate change singer et al 2012 within glacial ecosystems and the downstream ecosystems receiving glacial input dissolved organic matter dom is of high importance as it represents a major nutrient and carbon source for organismal metabolic activity hood et al 2009 2015 in a number of different environments from freshwaters to marine ecosystems glacial dom has been shown to be a source of biolabile carbon to downstream environments spencer et al 2014a hood et al 2015 within the bulk dom pool chromophoric dom cdom is the colored fraction that intensely absorbs light in the ultraviolet and blue regions of the spectrum and that may exhibit notable changes in quantity and quality during various biogeochemical processes yang et al 2013 hur et al 2014 biological sources and processes have been suggested to be the main producers and mediators of supraglacial dom anesio et al 2009 feng et al 2016 smith et al 2017 in glacial and ice environments cdom appears to come from microbial sources due to the high proportions of protein like substances spencer et al 2014b retelletti brogi et al 2018 which is in contrast to cdom typically found in riverine and coastal ecosystems dominated by allochthonous inputs yang et al 2013 zhou et al 2016 glacial protein like cdom is considered to be highly biolabile hood et al 2009 spencer et al 2014a and can markedly impact the microbial activity and biogeochemical cycling of downstream riverine and lake ecosystems through meltwater export liu et al 2019 through uptake by microorganisms this fraction of the dom pool may eventually be transferred to higher trophic levels in the food web fellman et al 2015 su et al 2018 additionally on glacier surfaces allochthonous inputs of particles and plant materials are cemented together into aggregates by microbial exudates boetius et al 2015 anesio et al 2017 this inorganic and organic debris is solar heated and melts into ice forming cryoconite holes which are hotspots for microbial activity on the surface of glaciers vonnahme et al 2016 therefore biogeochemical processes involving both microbial communities and cdom on the glacier surface alter both the amount and composition of cdom and may ultimately promote solar radiation absorption and glacial melting bagshaw et al 2007 thus understanding the interactions between microorganisms and dom plays a central role in elucidating the cycle of carbon and other elements in glacial environments with respect to glacial ecosystems the tibetan plateau contains the largest area of glaciers outside the polar regions covering a total area of 49 873 km2 yao et al 2010 the glaciers of the tibetan plateau serve as the main source of water to the major rivers and lakes in south and east asia and in the past few decades glacial melting induced by climate change has impacted biogeochemical cycles in these ecosystems yao et al 2010 chen et al 2013 previous studies in the region have concentrated on examination of dom sources spencer et al 2014a feng et al 2016 or on bacterial abundances and communities in tibetan plateau glaciers an et al 2010 nauer et al 2012 however the interaction between dom composition and the microbial community in glacial environments is largely unexplored and is a pressing knowledge gap in this research area cdom absorption and fluorescence measurements are widely used to evaluate the composition of dom fellman et al 2010 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms can provide insights into the composition of dom at the molecular level stubbins et al 2012 spencer et al 2014a in this study we investigated the optical and molecular composition of dom and the bacterial community composition in glacier ice and downstream meltwater collected from two different glaciers on the tibetan plateau we hypothesized that the bacterial community which is strongly involved in biogeochemical processes would be intrinsically linked with the composition of dom in tibetan glacial environments furthermore we conducted dom bio incubation experiments to further unravel the biolability of alpine glacier dom and changes in dom composition concurrent with the microbial processing 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection glacier ice and meltwater samples were collected from two glaciers and downstream linked river systems on the tibetan plateau in september 2017 table s1 fig s1 the two glacier systems were the laohugou glacier lhg at the northern edge of the tibetan plateau and the zhuxi glacier zx at the southern edge of the plateau fig s1 the number of ice samples collected from lhg and zx included 8 sites 3 replicates and 9 sites 3 replicates respectively to cover large glacier fed watersheds the number of meltwater samples collected from the lhg river and the yarlung zangbo river encompassed 16 sites 3 replicates table s1 each ice sample was collected at approximately every 200 m upward of the glacier terminus using a stainless steel scoop and was subsequently kept in acid soaked bottles 2 2 cdom biolability experiments laboratory bio incubations of the ice dom samples were conducted to examine the change in glacial dom optical composition concurrent with microbial processing four ice samples from the lhg glacier were selected for incubation the ice cores were thawed in the dark at 4 c 100 ml meltwater were filtered through pre rinsed 0 22 μm millipore filters 47 mm diameter to remove particulate organic matter and bacteria and amended with 2 ml 2 of the unfiltered meltwater of the corresponding original samples which acted as bacterial inocula to all incubation mixtures a nutrient amendment consisting of 80 μm nh4 and 10 μm po4 3 was added to prevent nutrient limitation and allow for examination of the potential microbial degradation of dom vonk et al 2015 pre combusted 550 c for 6 h and pre rinsed brown incubation glass bottles were loosely capped and shaken daily to ensure adequate oxygen supply to facilitate comparisons with studies in other environments laboratory bio incubations were performed at room temperature 20 2 c for 28 days in the dark hood et al 2009 spencer et al 2014a 2 3 cdom optical measurements and parallel factor analysis parafac detailed information about the absorption and fluorescence measurements calibration and parafac modeling can be found in the supplementary information the absorption coefficient at 254 nm i e a 254 was used as an indicator of cdom abundance zhang et al 2018 we used the ratio of cdom absorption at 250 nm 365 nm i e a 250 a 365 cdom spectral slope s 275 295 and the spectral slope ratio s r s 275 295 s 350 400 as a surrogate for the relative molecular size of dom zhang et al 2018 it has been previously shown that a 250 a 365 s 275 295 and s r all increase with decreasing dom

ratio of the emission intensities at 380 and 430 nm both with excitation at 310 nm high bix values 1 have been suggested to indicate a predominantly biological or microbial origin of dom huguet et al 2009 2 4 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms electrospray ionization coupled with ultra high resolution mass measurements offered by fourier transform ion cyclotron

this method has been successfully utilized to study soil phyllosphere microbiomes and aquatic ecosystems layeghifard et al 2017 coupling otus with environmental factors in networks can helpfully exhibit the linkages between otus and environmental factors thus otus in combination with six cdom fluorescence components were used to construct networks elucidating the correlations between cdom composition and the bacterial community to reduce the complexity of the dataset otus with occurrence in more than 20 of the samples were selected all possible pairwise spearman s rank correlations r between the relative abundance of selected otus and the proportion of each cdom fluorescence component were calculated r 0 4 or r 0 4 and p value 0 05 correlations were incorporated into networks the p values were adjusted with a multiple testing correction using the benjamini hochberg method to reduce the risk of obtaining false positive results benjamini and hochberg 1995 random networks with numbers of nodes and edges identical with the real networks were generated based on the erdös rényi random networks erdős and rényi 2011 network analyses were performed using the igraph vegan and

procedure fig 1 fig s2 we compared the spectral characteristics of the six components in the parafac model to those published in the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 the spectra of c1 had two excitation maxima at 240 and 320 nm with a single emission maximum 412 nm and was categorized as microbial humic like fluorophores potentially biologically produced from terrestrial precursors murphy et al 2011 shutova et al 2014 zhou et al 2018b the component c2 ex em 240 355 476 nm represented terrestrial humic like peak c fluorophores with high molecular weight and aromatic organic compounds stedmon and markager 2005 murphy et al 2011 shutova et al 2014 the components c3 230 275 332 nm c4 230 295 356 nm and c6 300 245 364 nm were categorized as protein like tryptophan like fluorophores associated with amino acids stedmon and markager 2005 murphy et al 2013 shutova et al 2014 c5 230 270 300 nm included tyrosine like peak b fluorophores murphy et al 2011 zhou et al 2018c as both tryptophan and tyrosine are related to amino acids these components c3 c6 can be interpreted more widely as protein like substances dubnick et al 2010 presumably derived from microbial sources both humic like and protein like components have previously been reported in ice and glacial and glacier fed stream environments in the arctic stubbins et al 2012 antarctica smith et al 2018 and alpine regions singer et al 2012 tryptophan like c3 dominated the fluorescence composition representing 45 1 15 7 mean standard deviation of cdom fluorescence in the glacier environment especially in the surface ice samples 58 0 12 1 the four protein like components c3 c6 accounted for 86 0 11 9 of the total six components while the microbial humic like c1 and the terrestrial humic like c2 accounted for 9 3 7 4 and 4 7 4 8 respectively in all the samples fig 2 the predominance of protein like components was consistent with previous studies conducted in ice glacier or glacier fed streams environments stedmon et al 2007 smith et al 2017 retelletti brogi et al 2018 the percentages of microbial humic like c1 c1 and terrestrial humic like c2 c2 were higher in ylzb than in lhg the bix

ultra high resolution ft icr ms analysis of dom samples collected from ice of the zx and lhg glaciers and meltwater of the lhg river exhibited 3334 4694 and 5524 assigned molecular formulae respectively fig 3 table s2 all samples contained high relative proportions of formulae representing nitrogen containing n containing formulae fig 3 high proportions of compounds containing n are congruent with previous studies conducted in other glaciers of the tibetan plateau spencer et al 2014a according to the nominal classification in van krevelen diagrams lipid and protein compounds which are typically associated with microbial activity antony et al 2014 feng et al 2016 accounted in total for 39 4 and 30 8 of the assigned formulae in the ice samples from the zx and lhg glacier and were higher than in the lhg river sample 25 5 in comparison the percentage of lignins and tannins was higher in the lhg river sample 61 0 than in the ice samples 44 7 and 55 6 fig 3 table s2 taking the peak intensity of assigned molecular formulae into account relatively high proportions of lignins and low proportions of lipids and proteins in the lhg river sample were observed table s3 3

combination of richness and evenness simpsoneven and shannoneven evenness did not differ significantly between the ice samples and the meltwater samples t test p 0 1 table s4 for the bacterial community composition all reads were classified into 30 taxonomic groups at phylum level and eight of them average relative abundance 1 at each sampling site accounted for 96 2 of all reads fig 4 proteobacteria 40 1 0 8 were predominant in the glacier bacterial community followed by firmicutes 24 3 1 7 bacteroidetes 23 4 1 6 actinobacteria 2 3 0 2 verrucomicrobia 1 9 0 2 acidobacteria 1 7 0 3 planctomycetes 2 3 0 2 and cyanobacteria chloroplast 0 94 0 14 the observed bacterial community was different from that of arctic antarctic and greenlandic supraglacial habitats suggesting spatial differences of the microbial community in glacial environments hell et al 2013 boetius et al 2015 lutz et al 2017 significantly higher mean relative abundances of bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria chloroplast and a lower mean of actinobacteria were found in the ice samples than in the meltwater samples t test p 0 05 on average bacilli 19 9 7 8 of firmicutes was the most abundant class in all the samples within proteobacteria subdivisions of the classes alpha 14 7 0 8 gamma 11 9 0 4 beta 11 3 0 7 and delta 1 6 0 2 were all abundant other abundant classes average relative abundance 1 were sphingobacteria 10 5 0 9 flavobacteria 8 5 1 0 and cytophagia 3 1 0 4 of bacteroidetes actinobacteria verrucomicrobiae and planctomycetia cyanobacteria were only abundant in the ice samples there were ten genera of proteobacteria among the sixteen most abundant followed by five genera of bacteroidetes and one genus of firmicutes most of these genera showed significant differences between the ice and the meltwater samples including exiguobacterium flavobacterium ferruginibacter polaromonas arenimonas and acinetobacter fig s3 potential functions of the bacteria community determined by faprotax included chemoheterotrophy phototrophy photoheterotrophy fermentation ureolysis aromatic compound degradation methylotrophy methanol oxidation and nitrate reduction which were abundant among all the samples table s5 significantly higher function potentials of chemoheterotrophy ureolysis chitinolysis and chloroplasts were found in the ice than in the meltwater samples whereas significantly higher function potentials of fermentation aromatic compound degradation human pathogens nitrification and denitrification were observed in the meltwater samples than in the ice samples fig s4 in addition 4165 out of 6140 records 67 8 could not be assigned to any group indicating a so far insufficient understanding of glacial environments 3 4 relationship between bacterial taxa and cdom composition in glacial environments the spearman s correlations between the contribution percentages of each fluorescence component and bacterial diversity indices for the ice and meltwater samples fig s5 showed that c1 and c2 were both significantly positively related to bacterial richness and evenness among the protein like components c3 c6 only c5 was significantly negatively related to bacterial diversity mlr model was performed to evaluate the relative importance of bacterial groups for the proportion of each fluorescence component table 1 as for c1 mlr modeling explained 64 2 of the variability and the most significant bacterial taxa included in order of importance verrucomicrobia planctomycetes firmicutes bacteroidetes acidobacteria and proteobacteria mlr modeling accounted for 61 3 of the c2 variability and verrucomicrobia planctomycetes acidobacteria proteobacteria firmicutes and cyanobacteria chloroplast were the most important bacterial taxa for c2 cyanobacteria chloroplast was the only phylum that was conformably negatively related to c1 and c2 relatively lower determinant coefficients were observed in the mlr model for all protein like components than for humic like components table 1 it should be noted that for c4 c5 and c6 the coefficients of each phylum in mlr were all negative furthermore as for the sum of the percentages of all protein like components protein like the mlr model explained 65 of the variability and cyanobacteria chloroplast was the only phylum positively related to protein like with regard to the abundant classes of bacteria bacilli of firmicutes was significantly negatively related to c1 and c3 and positively related to c4 c5 and c6 fig 5 a similar pattern being pronounced also for the abundant genus exiguobacterium of bacilli fig 5 within proteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria were both significantly positively related to c2 and alphaproteobacteria was also significantly positively correlated with c1 and negatively related to protein like whereas betaproteobacteria displayed an opposite correlation being negatively related to c1 and c2 moreover gammaproteobacteria showed a significant and positive correlation with c6 as for bacteroidetes flavobacteria and cytophagia were positively related to c1 and negatively related to protein like similar correlation patterns were pronounced also for the abundant genera flavobacterium and ferruginibacter fig 5 betaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacteria along with sphingobacteria were clustered together furthermore verrucomicrobiae and planctomycetia were significantly positively related to c1 and c2 and negatively related to protein like 3 5 co occurrence networks of different bacterial sub communities in glacial environments co occurrence network was constructed based on spearman s correlations between otus and the six fluorescence components to elucidate the interaction between bacterial sub communities from a new perspective the resulting network was composed of 204 nodes and 2944 edges fig 6 and was characterized by much higher positive than negative correlations the value of modularity the average clustering coefficient and the average path length of the network were higher than in the erdös rényi random network table s6 suggesting that our network had small world properties and modular structure the sphingobacteria and cytophagia genera showed the highest number of connections degree 65 the network was clustered into five modules module ⅰ ⅴ fig 6a accounting for 27 4 25 4 22 5 14 7 and 9 8 of the entire network respectively strong relationships could be observed for each module and different fluorescence types humic like c1 and c2 tryptophan like c3 c4 and c6 and tyrosine like c5 being clustered into different modules tryptophan like components which were included in module ⅰ exhibited strong interactions with bacteroidetes firmicutes and gammaproteobacteria module ⅱ included bacteroidetes betaproteobacteria and actinobacteria and these were associated with tyrosine like c5 alphaproteobacteria verrucomicrobiae together with several members of bacteroidetes and gammaproteobacteria were clustered with microbial and terrestrial humic like components in module ⅲ module ⅳ and ⅴ held a mixture of members with mainly positive correlations 3 6 changes in cdom composition after microbial processing the overall fluorescence signature of dom was weakened after 28 days of microbial processing fig 7 a this observation was also supported by the variations recorded in the fluorescence intensity of each fluorescence component with most components showing major loss fig 7b demonstrating the high biolability of ice dom moreover different fluorescence components displayed distinct variations the fluorescence intensities of tryptophan like c3 and tyrosine like c5 showed the highest decrease in all samples the fluorescence intensity of microbial humic like c1 decreased slightly whereas the terrestrial humic like c2 together with c6 showed a slight increase as to variations in the relative proportions of each fluorescence component overall microbial transformations enhanced the proportions of c1 c2 c3 and c6 and lowered the proportion of c5 fig 7c in addition the biolabile fractions accounted for 41 2 66 7 of the total doc concentrations table s7 decreasing values of a 254 a 250 a 365 s 275 295 and s r after incubation table s7 indicated decreasing cdom amounts and increasing cdom molecular size helms et al 2008 and aromaticity zhou et al 2017a after microbial processing 4 discussion 4 1 the role of microbes in shaping glacier cdom glacial cdom on the tibetan plateau was mainly composed of protein like especially tryptophan like fluorophores which have been linked to microbial processes smith et al 2017 this was supported by much higher proportions of protein like components than humic like components in both ice and meltwater samples and the significant positive correlation discovered between the proportion of protein like components and bix which is indicative of microbial activity and autochthonous sources fig 2 high proportions of lipids and proteins in glacial ice dom were consistent with previous studies on the tibetan plateau feng et al 2016 and indicate proportionally higher microbial activity here than in the meltwater singer et al 2012 the humic like substances in glacial ice may partly be derived from aeolian deposition or allochthonous input of higher plant materials this being supported by the presence of lignins and unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules in the van krevelen diagrams fig 3 molecular signatures of terrestrial derived dom have also been reported for other glaciers or ice sheets stubbins et al 2012 spencer et al 2014a additionally microbial modification of the autochthonous protein like dom may also produce humic like materials on the glacial surfaces and in consequence increase the relative proportion of humic like fluorescence components and lower the proportion of protein like fluorescence components the role of microbes in shaping glacier cdom is evident from our laboratory experiments fig 7 similar transformations have been highlighted in previous incubation experiments on antarctica ice samples smith et al 2017 furthermore the glacial meltwater received inputs of surrounding particles soil and plant materials fellman et al 2010 yielding higher percentages of lignin and tannin molecular formulas fig 3 as well as higher percentages of humic like cdom components fig 1 in the meltwater samples than in the ice samples thus it seems likely that production and degradation of cdom occur simultaneously on the surface of glaciers where both autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria are found fig 4 and bacteria communities lead to chemoheterotrophy photoautotrophy fermentation ureolysis and aromatic compound degradation as determined by faprotax fig s4 table s5 it has been shown that tryptophan like materials can be released as a result of algal activity zhou et al 2018b although occurring in much lower abundances than other phyla the primary production of cyanobacteria chloroplast has been suggested to be higher than total respiration on glacial surfaces anesio et al 2009 2017 indicating accumulation of organic substances over time heterotrophic bacteria decompose freshly released glacial dom and microbially reworked supraglacial dom has proven to increase the number and magnitude of n containing formulae antony et al 2017 explaining the much higher proportions of chon in glacial environments fig 3 than in most other aquatic ecosystems zhou et al 2018c 4 2 strong interactions between bacterial assemblages and cdom composition our study suggests that bacterial assemblages interact strongly with cdom composition in alpine glacier environments this is supported by high biolability of glacial dom fig 7 significant correlations and high determinant coefficients in mlr models between the bacterial community and the fluorescence components fig s5 table 1 the higher biodegradable doc in glacial environments table s7 than in lakes streams and soil leachate søndergaard and worm 2001 fellman et al 2008 likely reflect the higher proportions of proteins and lipids substances in glacial environments i e high h c fig 3 which mainly derive from microbial sources and are widely recognized biolabile fractions of dom feng et al 2016 zhou et al 2018b it should be noted that the rate of microbial degradation of cdom in real glacial environments may be lower than in the incubation experiment because the relatively low temperatures in glacial environments slow down the speed of microbial mineralization kirchman et al 2005 we noted a significant negative relationship between the contribution percentages of protein like components and i c i t fig 2 reflecting a higher cdom humification degree and higher aromaticity contents with decreased proportions of protein like materials this is consistent with increasing cdom molecular size and aromaticity after microbial processing lowering the proportions of protein like materials fig 7 table s7 thus microbial modification from protein like cdom to humic like material may account for the positive relationship between the proportions of humic like components and bacterial α diversity fig s5 relatively weak correlations between each protein like component and the bacterial community fig s5 table 1 may be due to the fact that glacial ice comprises a mixture of autochthonous cdom derived from microbial activity and allochthonous terrestrial substances and a biolabile autochthonous sub fraction of dom rapidly becomes involved in microbial mineralization stedmon et al 2007 that is to say rapid uptake and cycling of protein like dom make it difficult to detect the relationship between protein like components and the bacterial community differences in the relative importance of bacterial groups for each fluorescence component table 1 together with correlations between the contribution percentages of fluorescence components and bacterial relative abundances at class and genus level fig 5 likely reflect distinct preferences for different cdom components by heterotrophic bacteria alphaproteobacteria together with verrucomicrobiae and planctomycetia tends to show a preference for terrestrial humic like substances in aquatic environments rocker et al 2012 blanchet et al 2016 and a similar preference appeared in our study of glacial environments as indicated by the observed significantly positive correlations between microbes and terrestrial humic like components fig 5 the groups betaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacteria along with sphingobacteria were clustered together fig 5 likely due to the capability of decomposing complex carbon sources including both protein like and humic like substances thomas et al 2011 smith et al 2018 the most abundant bacterial class bacilli in alpine glacial ecosystems is different from that in arctic antarctic and greenlandic supraglacial habitats which are dominated by the classes alphaproteobacteria or betaproteobacteria hell et al 2013 boetius et al 2015 anesio et al 2017 lutz et al 2017 this is probably due to local and regional factors such as day length aeolian transport and solar radiation edwards et al 2014 liu et al 2017 particularly the most abundant genus exiguobacterium of bacilli is reported to survive at varying temperature extremes and to tolerate high levels of uv radiation ordoñez et al 2013 singh et al 2013 4 3 components of the cdom pool differentially involved in bacterial metabolism each sub component of the cdom pool differentially participated in bacterial metabolism which was substantiated by our dom bioincubation experiment that demonstrated microbial modification from protein like cdom to humic like material fig 7 and by the network results showing that tryptophan like tyrosine like microbial and terrestrial humic like cdom are clustered into different modules fig 6 although two types of protein like material were divided into two modules the connection between these two was stronger than that with other modules fig 6 module division has proven to be an effective method for detecting specific functions of different groups of nodes newman 2006 bacteroidetes play a vital role in the bacterial metabolism in the glacial environment and contributed the largest proportions of the bacterial community being widely distributed in each module included in bacteroidetes are sphingobacteria and cytophagia which had the highest degree number of connections of co occurrence in the network this is probably associated with their ability to grow attached to algal cells or particles and the fact that they decompose complex carbon sources fernández gómez et al 2013 taking both incubation and network results into account tryptophan like dom is mainly decomposed or generated by some members of bacteroidetes gammaproteobacteria and firmicutes some members of bacteroidetes betaproteobacteria and actinobacteria mainly consume tyrosine like dom in contrast alphaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobiae together with small members of bacteroidetes and gammaproteobacteria mainly degrade or produce humic like dom the latter has been described in previous incubation experiments showing incorporation of autochthonous microbial derived exudates by bacteroidetes and betaproteobacteria while no such incorporation was detected for alphaproteobacteria smith et al 2017 this concordance highlights the value of network analysis in unraveling the metabolic niches of community members in biogeochemical processes glacial dom and microbes can be exported during the melting season and may influence the carbon and other biogeochemical cycling processes of downstream aquatic ecosystems thus it has been reported that the highly biolabile dom from glacial surfaces stimulates downstream heterotrophic activity and microbial reworking of glacial dom also produces photo reactive compounds singer et al 2012 antony et al 2017 such interactions may ultimately contribute to co2 outgassing in the glacier fed downstream aquatic environments singer et al 2012 fasching et al 2014 emphasizing the complex and tight interconnectivity between microorganisms and cdom in glacier ecosystems anesio et al 2009 hell et al 2013 5 conclusions we investigated dom optical and molecular composition and bacterial communities in glaciers and meltwaters in two different glacier ecosystems on the tibetan plateau and carried out incubation experiments on dom biolability to unravel the interactions between cdom and bacteria in glacial environments our results highlighted that the predominant protein like fluorescence is strongly correlated with microbial sources and that protein like and humic like cdom play different roles with respect to bacterial metabolism based on these results and a laboratory incubation experiment we conclude that the bacterial community acts as both producer and decomposer of cdom and thus interacts closely with the composition and variability of dom in alpine glacial environments our results underpin the importance of the interactions between microorganisms and dom in glacial

18721,dissolved organic matter dom from alpine glaciers is highly biolabile and plays a vital role in the biogeochemical cycle of meltwater impacted environments to unravel the composition and interactions of dom with the bacterial community in glacier and glacier meltwater we conducted sampling of two different tibetan plateau glaciers and carried out laboratory bio incubation experiments the field data revealed that four protein like components accounted for 86 0 11 9 of the total variability of all six fluorescence components which suggests a predominantly microbial source of glacial chromophoric dom cdom the ice and meltwater samples displayed major contributions of molecular formulae associated with lipids and proteins i e high h c as revealed by ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry multiple linear regression models revealed that the abundant phyla explain 64 2 61 3 and 65 0 of the variability of microbial and terrestrial humic like and protein like components respectively correlation based network analysis determined the metabolic niches of the bacterial community members associated with different fluorescence types in biogeochemical processes furthermore laboratory dom bio incubation experiments confirmed that sub components of the cdom pool differentially participate in bacterial metabolism we therefore conclude that the bacterial community interacted closely with the compositional variability of dom in the investigated alpine glacial environments by both producing and consuming of dom graphical abstract image 1 keywords tibetan plateau glacier bacterial community chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom network analysis 1 introduction glaciers contain approximately 75 of the freshwater on earth anesio et al 2009 and are highly sensitive to climate change glacial ecosystems are not isolated units but are hydrologically connected with other systems including tundras rivers lakes and coastal environments boetius et al 2015 thus improving our understanding of glacial biogeochemistry is crucial to assess how these environments will respond to climate change singer et al 2012 within glacial ecosystems and the downstream ecosystems receiving glacial input dissolved organic matter dom is of high importance as it represents a major nutrient and carbon source for organismal metabolic activity hood et al 2009 2015 in a number of different environments from freshwaters to marine ecosystems glacial dom has been shown to be a source of biolabile carbon to downstream environments spencer et al 2014a hood et al 2015 within the bulk dom pool chromophoric dom cdom is the colored fraction that intensely absorbs light in the ultraviolet and blue regions of the spectrum and that may exhibit notable changes in quantity and quality during various biogeochemical processes yang et al 2013 hur et al 2014 biological sources and processes have been suggested to be the main producers and mediators of supraglacial dom anesio et al 2009 feng et al 2016 smith et al 2017 in glacial and ice environments cdom appears to come from microbial sources due to the high proportions of protein like substances spencer et al 2014b retelletti brogi et al 2018 which is in contrast to cdom typically found in riverine and coastal ecosystems dominated by allochthonous inputs yang et al 2013 zhou et al 2016 glacial protein like cdom is considered to be highly biolabile hood et al 2009 spencer et al 2014a and can markedly impact the microbial activity and biogeochemical cycling of downstream riverine and lake ecosystems through meltwater export liu et al 2019 through uptake by microorganisms this fraction of the dom pool may eventually be transferred to higher trophic levels in the food web fellman et al 2015 su et al 2018 additionally on glacier surfaces allochthonous inputs of particles and plant materials are cemented together into aggregates by microbial exudates boetius et al 2015 anesio et al 2017 this inorganic and organic debris is solar heated and melts into ice forming cryoconite holes which are hotspots for microbial activity on the surface of glaciers vonnahme et al 2016 therefore biogeochemical processes involving both microbial communities and cdom on the glacier surface alter both the amount and composition of cdom and may ultimately promote solar radiation absorption and glacial melting bagshaw et al 2007 thus understanding the interactions between microorganisms and dom plays a central role in elucidating the cycle of carbon and other elements in glacial environments with respect to glacial ecosystems the tibetan plateau contains the largest area of glaciers outside the polar regions covering a total area of 49 873 km2 yao et al 2010 the glaciers of the tibetan plateau serve as the main source of water to the major rivers and lakes in south and east asia and in the past few decades glacial melting induced by climate change has impacted biogeochemical cycles in these ecosystems yao et al 2010 chen et al 2013 previous studies in the region have concentrated on examination of dom sources spencer et al 2014a feng et al 2016 or on bacterial abundances and communities in tibetan plateau glaciers an et al 2010 nauer et al 2012 however the interaction between dom composition and the microbial community in glacial environments is largely unexplored and is a pressing knowledge gap in this research area cdom absorption and fluorescence measurements are widely used to evaluate the composition of dom fellman et al 2010 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms can provide insights into the composition of dom at the molecular level stubbins et al 2012 spencer et al 2014a in this study we investigated the optical and molecular composition of dom and the bacterial community composition in glacier ice and downstream meltwater collected from two different glaciers on the tibetan plateau we hypothesized that the bacterial community which is strongly involved in biogeochemical processes would be intrinsically linked with the composition of dom in tibetan glacial environments furthermore we conducted dom bio incubation experiments to further unravel the biolability of alpine glacier dom and changes in dom composition concurrent with the microbial processing 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection glacier ice and meltwater samples were collected from two glaciers and downstream linked river systems on the tibetan plateau in september 2017 table s1 fig s1 the two glacier systems were the laohugou glacier lhg at the northern edge of the tibetan plateau and the zhuxi glacier zx at the southern edge of the plateau fig s1 the number of ice samples collected from lhg and zx included 8 sites 3 replicates and 9 sites 3 replicates respectively to cover large glacier fed watersheds the number of meltwater samples collected from the lhg river and the yarlung zangbo river encompassed 16 sites 3 replicates table s1 each ice sample was collected at approximately every 200 m upward of the glacier terminus using a stainless steel scoop and was subsequently kept in acid soaked bottles 2 2 cdom biolability experiments laboratory bio incubations of the ice dom samples were conducted to examine the change in glacial dom optical composition concurrent with microbial processing four ice samples from the lhg glacier were selected for incubation the ice cores were thawed in the dark at 4 c 100 ml meltwater were filtered through pre rinsed 0 22 μm millipore filters 47 mm diameter to remove particulate organic matter and bacteria and amended with 2 ml 2 of the unfiltered meltwater of the corresponding original samples which acted as bacterial inocula to all incubation mixtures a nutrient amendment consisting of 80 μm nh4 and 10 μm po4 3 was added to prevent nutrient limitation and allow for examination of the potential microbial degradation of dom vonk et al 2015 pre combusted 550 c for 6 h and pre rinsed brown incubation glass bottles were loosely capped and shaken daily to ensure adequate oxygen supply to facilitate comparisons with studies in other environments laboratory bio incubations were performed at room temperature 20 2 c for 28 days in the dark hood et al 2009 spencer et al 2014a 2 3 cdom optical measurements and parallel factor analysis parafac detailed information about the absorption and fluorescence measurements calibration and parafac modeling can be found in the supplementary information the absorption coefficient at 254 nm i e a 254 was used as an indicator of cdom abundance zhang et al 2018 we used the ratio of cdom absorption at 250 nm 365 nm i e a 250 a 365 cdom spectral slope s 275 295 and the spectral slope ratio s r s 275 295 s 350 400 as a surrogate for the relative molecular size of dom zhang et al 2018 it has been previously shown that a 250 a 365 s 275 295 and s r all increase with decreasing dom molecular size helms et al 2008 two indices were obtained from the eems 1 the fluorescence peak integration ratio i c i t which is calculated as the ratio of integration of fluorescence peak c ex em

ratio of the emission intensities at 380 and 430 nm both with excitation at 310 nm high bix values 1 have been suggested to indicate a predominantly biological or microbial origin of dom huguet et al 2009 2 4 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms electrospray ionization coupled with ultra high resolution mass measurements offered by fourier transform ion cyclotron

annotation with biogeochemistry processes was performed by the functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax which identifies known taxa by employing marker gene sequencing and then estimates their metabolic phenotype louca et al 2017 2 7 network analyses and statistical analyses correlation based networks explore strong and significant pairwise interactions using a correlation coefficient this method has been successfully utilized to study soil phyllosphere microbiomes and aquatic ecosystems layeghifard et al 2017 coupling otus with environmental factors in networks can helpfully exhibit the linkages between otus and environmental factors thus otus in combination with six cdom fluorescence components were used to construct networks elucidating the correlations between cdom composition and the bacterial community to reduce the complexity of the dataset otus with occurrence in more than 20 of the samples were selected all possible pairwise spearman s rank correlations r between the relative abundance of selected otus and the proportion of each cdom fluorescence component were calculated r 0 4 or r 0 4 and p value 0 05 correlations were incorporated into networks the p values were adjusted with a multiple testing correction using the benjamini hochberg method to reduce the risk of obtaining false positive results benjamini and hochberg 1995 random networks with numbers of nodes and edges identical with the real networks were generated based on the erdös rényi random networks erdős and rényi 2011 network analyses were performed using the igraph vegan and psych packages in r software network visualization and module detection were conducted using the interactive platform gephi webatlas paris france statistical analyses including mean value standard deviation t test spearman correlations and multiple linear regression mlr models were performed using r 3 5 1 most data were plotted with the packages ggplot2 in r v 3 5 1 or base graphics results of t test with p 0 05 were reported as significant 3 results 3 1 cdom characteristics in tibetan glacier environments six components of the parafac model were well validated using the split half procedure fig 1 fig s2 we compared the spectral characteristics of the six components in the parafac model to those published in the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 the spectra of c1 had two excitation maxima at 240 and 320 nm with a single emission maximum 412 nm and was categorized as microbial humic like fluorophores potentially biologically produced from terrestrial precursors murphy et al 2011 shutova et al 2014 zhou et al 2018b the component c2 ex em 240 355 476 nm represented terrestrial humic like peak c fluorophores with high molecular weight and aromatic organic compounds stedmon and markager 2005 murphy et al 2011 shutova et al 2014 the components c3 230 275 332 nm c4 230 295 356 nm and c6 300 245 364 nm were categorized as protein like tryptophan like fluorophores associated with amino acids stedmon and markager 2005 murphy et al 2013 shutova et al 2014 c5 230 270 300 nm included tyrosine like peak b fluorophores murphy et al 2011 zhou et al 2018c as both tryptophan and tyrosine are related to amino acids these components c3 c6 can be interpreted more widely as protein like substances dubnick et al 2010 presumably derived from microbial sources both humic like and protein like components have previously been reported in ice and glacial and glacier fed stream environments in the arctic stubbins et al 2012 antarctica smith et al 2018 and alpine regions singer et al 2012 tryptophan like c3 dominated the fluorescence composition representing 45 1 15 7 mean standard deviation of cdom fluorescence in the glacier environment especially in the surface ice samples 58 0 12 1 the four protein like components c3 c6 accounted for 86 0 11 9 of the total six components while the microbial humic like c1 and the terrestrial humic like c2 accounted for 9 3 7 4 and 4 7 4 8 respectively in all the samples fig 2 the predominance of protein like components was consistent with previous studies conducted in ice glacier or glacier fed streams environments stedmon et al 2007 smith et al 2017 retelletti brogi et al 2018 the percentages of microbial humic like c1 c1 and terrestrial humic like c2 c2 were higher in ylzb than in lhg the bix values of the ice samples 1 20 0 06 and the meltwater samples 1 18 0 14 were both higher than 1 table s2 i c i t was significantly higher in the meltwater samples 1 83 2 32 than in the ice samples 0

ultra high resolution ft icr ms analysis of dom samples collected from ice of the zx and lhg glaciers and meltwater of the lhg river exhibited 3334 4694 and 5524 assigned molecular formulae respectively fig 3 table s2 all samples contained high relative proportions of formulae representing nitrogen containing n containing formulae fig 3 high proportions of compounds containing n are congruent with previous studies conducted in other glaciers of the tibetan plateau spencer et al 2014a according to the nominal classification in van krevelen diagrams lipid and protein compounds which are typically associated with microbial activity antony et al 2014 feng et al 2016 accounted in total for 39 4 and 30 8 of the assigned formulae in the ice samples from the zx and lhg glacier and were higher than in the lhg river sample 25 5 in comparison the percentage of lignins and tannins was higher in the lhg river sample 61 0 than in the ice samples 44 7 and 55 6 fig 3 table s2 taking the peak intensity of assigned molecular formulae into account relatively high proportions of lignins and low proportions of lipids and proteins in the lhg river sample were observed table s3 3

combination of richness and evenness simpsoneven and shannoneven evenness did not differ significantly between the ice samples and the meltwater samples t test p 0 1 table s4 for the bacterial community composition all reads were classified into 30 taxonomic groups at phylum level and eight of them average relative abundance 1 at each sampling site accounted for 96 2 of all reads fig 4 proteobacteria 40 1 0 8 were predominant in the glacier bacterial community followed by firmicutes 24 3 1 7 bacteroidetes 23 4 1 6 actinobacteria 2 3 0 2 verrucomicrobia 1 9 0 2 acidobacteria 1 7 0 3 planctomycetes 2 3 0 2 and cyanobacteria chloroplast 0 94 0 14 the observed bacterial community was different from that of arctic antarctic and greenlandic supraglacial habitats suggesting spatial differences of the microbial community in glacial environments hell et al 2013 boetius et al 2015 lutz et al 2017 significantly higher mean relative abundances of bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria chloroplast and a lower mean of actinobacteria were found in the ice samples than in the meltwater samples t test p 0 05 on average bacilli 19 9 7 8 of firmicutes was the most abundant class in all the samples within proteobacteria subdivisions of the classes alpha 14 7 0 8 gamma 11 9 0 4 beta 11 3 0 7 and delta 1 6 0 2 were all abundant other abundant classes average relative abundance 1 were sphingobacteria 10 5 0 9 flavobacteria 8 5 1 0 and cytophagia 3 1 0 4 of bacteroidetes actinobacteria verrucomicrobiae and planctomycetia cyanobacteria were only abundant in the ice samples there were ten genera of proteobacteria among the sixteen most abundant followed by five genera of bacteroidetes and one genus of firmicutes most of these genera showed significant differences between the ice and the meltwater samples including exiguobacterium flavobacterium ferruginibacter polaromonas arenimonas and acinetobacter fig s3 potential functions of the bacteria community determined by faprotax included chemoheterotrophy phototrophy photoheterotrophy fermentation ureolysis aromatic compound degradation methylotrophy methanol oxidation and nitrate reduction which were abundant among all the samples table s5 significantly higher function potentials of chemoheterotrophy ureolysis chitinolysis and chloroplasts were found in the ice than in the meltwater samples whereas significantly higher function potentials of fermentation aromatic compound degradation human pathogens nitrification and denitrification were observed in the meltwater samples than in the ice samples fig s4 in addition 4165 out of 6140 records 67 8 could not be assigned to any group indicating a so far insufficient understanding of glacial environments 3 4 relationship between bacterial taxa and cdom composition in glacial environments the spearman s correlations between the contribution percentages of each fluorescence component and bacterial diversity indices for the ice and meltwater samples fig s5 showed that c1 and c2 were both significantly positively related to bacterial richness and evenness among the protein like components c3 c6 only c5 was significantly negatively related to bacterial diversity mlr model was performed to evaluate the relative importance of bacterial groups for the proportion of each fluorescence component table 1 as for c1 mlr modeling explained 64 2 of the variability and the most significant bacterial taxa included in order of importance verrucomicrobia planctomycetes firmicutes bacteroidetes acidobacteria and proteobacteria mlr modeling accounted for 61 3 of the c2 variability and verrucomicrobia planctomycetes acidobacteria proteobacteria firmicutes and cyanobacteria chloroplast were the most important bacterial taxa for c2 cyanobacteria chloroplast was the only phylum that was conformably negatively related to c1 and c2 relatively lower determinant coefficients were observed in the mlr model for all protein like components than for humic like components table 1 it should be noted that for c4 c5 and c6 the coefficients of each phylum in mlr were all negative furthermore as for the sum of the percentages of all protein like components protein like the mlr model explained 65 of the variability and cyanobacteria chloroplast was the only phylum positively related to protein like with regard to the abundant classes of bacteria bacilli of firmicutes was significantly negatively related to c1 and c3 and positively related to c4 c5 and c6 fig 5 a similar pattern being pronounced also for the abundant genus exiguobacterium of bacilli fig 5 within proteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria were both significantly positively related to c2 and alphaproteobacteria was also significantly positively correlated with c1 and negatively related to protein like whereas betaproteobacteria displayed an opposite correlation being negatively related to c1 and c2 moreover gammaproteobacteria showed a significant and positive correlation with c6 as for bacteroidetes flavobacteria and cytophagia were positively related to c1 and negatively related to protein like similar correlation patterns were pronounced also for the abundant genera flavobacterium and ferruginibacter fig 5 betaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacteria along with sphingobacteria were clustered together furthermore verrucomicrobiae and planctomycetia were significantly positively related to c1 and c2 and negatively related to protein like 3 5 co occurrence networks of different bacterial sub communities in glacial environments co occurrence network was constructed based on spearman s correlations between otus and the six fluorescence components to elucidate the interaction between bacterial sub communities from a new perspective the resulting network was composed of 204 nodes and 2944 edges fig 6 and was characterized by much higher positive than negative correlations the value of modularity the average clustering coefficient and the average path length of the network were higher than in the erdös rényi random network table s6 suggesting that our network had small world properties and modular structure the sphingobacteria and cytophagia genera showed the highest number of connections degree 65 the network was clustered into five modules module ⅰ ⅴ fig 6a accounting for 27 4 25 4 22 5 14 7 and 9 8 of the entire network respectively strong relationships could be observed for each module and different fluorescence types humic like c1 and c2 tryptophan like c3 c4 and c6 and tyrosine like c5 being clustered into different modules tryptophan like components which were included in module ⅰ exhibited strong interactions with bacteroidetes firmicutes and gammaproteobacteria module ⅱ included bacteroidetes betaproteobacteria and actinobacteria and these were associated with tyrosine like c5 alphaproteobacteria verrucomicrobiae together with several members of bacteroidetes and gammaproteobacteria were clustered with microbial and terrestrial humic like components in module ⅲ module ⅳ and ⅴ held a mixture of members with mainly positive correlations 3 6 changes in cdom composition after microbial processing the overall fluorescence signature of dom was weakened after 28 days of microbial processing fig 7 a this observation was also supported by the variations recorded in the fluorescence intensity of each fluorescence component with most components showing major loss fig 7b demonstrating the high biolability of ice dom moreover different fluorescence components displayed distinct variations the fluorescence intensities of tryptophan like c3 and tyrosine like c5 showed the highest decrease in all samples the fluorescence intensity of microbial humic like c1 decreased slightly whereas the terrestrial humic like c2 together with c6 showed a slight increase as to variations in the relative proportions of each fluorescence component overall microbial transformations enhanced the proportions of c1 c2 c3 and c6 and lowered the proportion of c5 fig 7c in addition the biolabile fractions accounted for 41 2 66 7 of the total doc concentrations table s7 decreasing values of a 254 a 250 a 365 s 275 295 and s r after incubation table s7 indicated decreasing cdom amounts and increasing cdom molecular size helms et al 2008 and aromaticity zhou et al 2017a after microbial processing 4 discussion 4 1 the role of microbes in shaping glacier cdom glacial cdom on the tibetan plateau was mainly composed of protein like especially tryptophan like fluorophores which have been linked to microbial processes smith et al 2017 this was supported by much higher proportions of protein like components than humic like components in both ice and meltwater samples and the significant positive correlation discovered between the proportion of protein like components and bix which is indicative of microbial activity and autochthonous sources fig 2 high proportions of lipids and proteins in glacial ice dom were consistent with previous studies on the tibetan plateau feng et al 2016 and indicate proportionally higher microbial activity here than in the meltwater singer et al 2012 the humic like substances in glacial ice may partly be derived from aeolian deposition or allochthonous input of higher plant materials this being supported by the presence of lignins and unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules in the van krevelen diagrams fig 3 molecular signatures of terrestrial derived dom have also been reported for other glaciers or ice sheets stubbins et al 2012 spencer et al 2014a additionally microbial modification of the autochthonous protein like dom may also produce humic like materials on the glacial surfaces and in consequence increase the relative proportion of humic like fluorescence components and lower the proportion of protein like fluorescence components the role of microbes in shaping glacier cdom is evident from our laboratory experiments fig 7 similar transformations have been highlighted in previous incubation experiments on antarctica ice samples smith et al 2017 furthermore the glacial meltwater received inputs of surrounding particles soil and plant materials fellman et al 2010 yielding higher percentages of lignin and tannin molecular formulas fig 3 as well as higher percentages of humic like cdom components fig 1 in the meltwater samples than in the ice samples thus it seems likely that production and degradation of cdom occur simultaneously on the surface of glaciers where both autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria are found fig 4 and bacteria communities lead to chemoheterotrophy photoautotrophy fermentation ureolysis and aromatic compound degradation as determined by faprotax fig s4 table s5 it has been shown that tryptophan like materials can be released as a result of algal activity zhou et al 2018b although occurring in much lower abundances than other phyla the primary production of cyanobacteria chloroplast has been suggested to be higher than total respiration on glacial surfaces anesio et al 2009 2017 indicating accumulation of organic substances over time heterotrophic bacteria decompose freshly released glacial dom and microbially reworked supraglacial dom has proven to increase the number and magnitude of n containing formulae antony et al 2017 explaining the much higher proportions of chon in glacial environments fig 3 than in most other aquatic ecosystems zhou et al 2018c 4 2 strong interactions between bacterial assemblages and cdom composition our study suggests that bacterial assemblages interact strongly with cdom composition in alpine glacier environments this is supported by high biolability of glacial dom fig 7 significant correlations and high determinant coefficients in mlr models between the bacterial community and the fluorescence components fig s5 table 1 the higher biodegradable doc in glacial environments table s7 than in lakes streams and soil leachate søndergaard and worm 2001 fellman et al 2008 likely reflect the higher proportions of proteins and lipids substances in glacial environments i e high h c fig 3 which mainly derive from microbial sources and are widely recognized biolabile fractions of dom feng et al 2016 zhou et al 2018b it should be noted that the rate of microbial degradation of cdom in real glacial environments may be lower than in the incubation experiment because the relatively low temperatures in glacial environments slow down the speed of microbial mineralization kirchman et al 2005 we noted a significant negative relationship between the contribution percentages of protein like components and i c i t fig 2 reflecting a higher cdom humification degree and higher aromaticity contents with decreased proportions of protein like materials this is consistent with increasing cdom molecular size and aromaticity after microbial processing lowering the proportions of protein like materials fig 7 table s7 thus microbial modification from protein like cdom to humic like material may account for the positive relationship between the proportions of humic like components and bacterial α diversity fig s5 relatively weak correlations between each protein like component and the bacterial community fig s5 table 1 may be due to the fact that glacial ice comprises a mixture of autochthonous cdom derived from microbial activity and allochthonous terrestrial substances and a biolabile autochthonous sub fraction of dom rapidly becomes involved in microbial mineralization stedmon et al 2007 that is to say rapid uptake and cycling of protein like dom make it difficult to detect the relationship between protein like components and the bacterial community differences in the relative importance of bacterial groups for each fluorescence component table 1 together with correlations between the contribution percentages of fluorescence components and bacterial relative abundances at class and genus level fig 5 likely reflect distinct preferences for different cdom components by heterotrophic bacteria alphaproteobacteria together with verrucomicrobiae and planctomycetia tends to show a preference for terrestrial humic like substances in aquatic environments rocker et al 2012 blanchet et al 2016 and a similar preference appeared in our study of glacial environments as indicated by the observed significantly positive correlations between microbes and terrestrial humic like components fig 5 the groups betaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacteria along with sphingobacteria were clustered together fig 5 likely due to the capability of decomposing complex carbon sources including both protein like and humic like substances thomas et al 2011 smith et al 2018 the most abundant bacterial class bacilli in alpine glacial ecosystems is different from that in arctic antarctic and greenlandic supraglacial habitats which are dominated by the classes alphaproteobacteria or betaproteobacteria hell et al 2013 boetius et al 2015 anesio et al 2017 lutz et al 2017 this is probably due to local and regional factors such as day length aeolian transport and solar radiation edwards et al 2014 liu et al 2017 particularly the most abundant genus exiguobacterium of bacilli is reported to survive at varying temperature extremes and to tolerate high levels of uv radiation ordoñez et al 2013 singh et al 2013 4 3 components of the cdom pool differentially involved in bacterial metabolism each sub component of the cdom pool differentially participated in bacterial metabolism which was substantiated by our dom bioincubation experiment that demonstrated microbial modification from protein like cdom to humic like material fig 7 and by the network results showing that tryptophan like tyrosine like microbial and terrestrial humic like cdom are clustered into different modules fig 6 although two types of protein like material were divided into two modules the connection between these two was stronger than that with other modules fig 6 module division has proven to be an effective method for detecting specific functions of different groups of nodes newman 2006 bacteroidetes play a vital role in the bacterial metabolism in the glacial environment and contributed the largest proportions of the bacterial community being widely distributed in each module included in bacteroidetes are sphingobacteria and cytophagia which had the highest degree number of connections of co occurrence in the network this is probably associated with their ability to grow attached to algal cells or particles and the fact that they decompose complex carbon sources fernández gómez et al 2013 taking both incubation and network results into account tryptophan like dom is mainly decomposed or generated by some members of bacteroidetes gammaproteobacteria and firmicutes some members of bacteroidetes betaproteobacteria and actinobacteria mainly consume tyrosine like dom in contrast alphaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobiae together with small members of bacteroidetes and gammaproteobacteria mainly degrade or produce humic like dom the latter has been described in previous incubation experiments showing incorporation of autochthonous microbial derived exudates by bacteroidetes and betaproteobacteria while no such incorporation was detected for alphaproteobacteria smith et al 2017 this concordance highlights the value of network analysis in unraveling the metabolic niches of community members in biogeochemical processes glacial dom and microbes can be exported during the melting season and may influence the carbon and other biogeochemical cycling processes of downstream aquatic ecosystems thus it has been reported that the highly biolabile dom from glacial surfaces stimulates downstream heterotrophic activity and microbial reworking of glacial dom also produces photo reactive compounds singer et al 2012 antony et al 2017 such interactions may ultimately contribute to co2 outgassing in the glacier fed downstream aquatic environments singer et al 2012 fasching et al 2014 emphasizing the complex and tight interconnectivity between microorganisms and cdom in glacier ecosystems anesio et al 2009 hell et al 2013 5 conclusions we investigated dom optical and molecular composition and bacterial communities in glaciers and meltwaters in two different glacier ecosystems on the tibetan plateau and carried out incubation experiments on dom biolability to unravel the interactions between cdom and bacteria in glacial environments our results highlighted that the predominant protein like fluorescence is strongly correlated with microbial sources and that protein like and humic like cdom play different roles with respect to bacterial metabolism based on these results and a laboratory incubation experiment we conclude that the bacterial community acts as both producer and decomposer of cdom and thus interacts closely with the composition and variability of dom in alpine glacial environments our results underpin the importance of the interactions between microorganisms and dom in glacial

18722,the hydrophobic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are apt to adhere tightly to the sediments in aquifer and thus pose great threats to the aquatic environment of groundwater and surface water as well as human health the present study constructed functionalized microbubbles named colloidal ozone aphrons coas by dissolving ozone contained air into the nonionic surfactant tween 20 solution at the pressure of 300 kpa for the in situ remediation of phenanthrene phe contaminated sediments the coa system aimed at improving the phe elimination in terms of i enhancing the migration and transportation ability of the bubble system in the contaminated aquifer matrix ii accurately desorbing the target hydrophobic contaminants from sediments and iii reinforcing the in situ oxidation degradation immediately after or simultaneously when the pahs are desorbed into the aqueous phase experimental results demonstrated that the coas exhibited similar characteristics as the classical colloidal gas aphrons cgas including the high stability half life time 200 s typical morphology and average bubble size 114 162 μm higher air hold up of coas was achieved i e 20 compared with the air microbubbles 1 2 obtained under the same generation conditions although the encapsulated ozone could oxidize the surfactant layers the properties and behaviors of coas were not greatly affected the surfactant multi layers endowed the coas with strong hydrophobic attraction with phe great migration capacity and enlarged oxidation area in the sediment matrix approximately 96 9 of phe was removed from the sediments and 84 9 of the overall phe was oxidized at the high ozone concentration of 0 6 mg l when the initial phe concentration was 240 0 μg kg the coa involved remediation technology provided the insight of combining the processes of washing and oxidizing through adopting the particularly conceived microbubbles the in situ and selective removal of hydrophobic organic contaminants from sediments in aquifer was well achieved in this study graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbubble functionalization colloidal zone aphrons in situ contaminant targeting remediation 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs the by products mainly resulting from petroleum pyrolysis acetylene synthesis from natural gas and refinery operations are well known for their teratogenic carcinogenic and mutagenic nature rodriguez et al 2017 owing to the high hydrophobicity and low solubility the persistent and semi volatile pahs are apt to adhere tightly to the sediments in aquifer which are thus probably the transient storage compartment and secondary pollution source of pahs meng et al 2019 the concentration of pahs in sediments has been reported to be 74 1931 μg kg in summer and 97 3140 μg kg in winter in chinese lakes gong et al 2018 zeng et al 2018 considering the direct threat to the aquatic environment and the current status of pollution pahs are listed as the priority control pollutants by the u s environmental protection agency srogi 2007 it has been widely recognized that the substantial improvement of the groundwater or surface water quality often cannot be achieved without appropriate treatment of the contaminated sediments in aquifer by now the effective and efficient removal of pahs from sediments in aquifer has been among the most urgent issues for the pollution control of the groundwater and surface water systems a significant technology for rapid and effective removal of pahs being adsorbed to sediments is washing with surfactant solution during the process the amphiphilic structure of surfactants exerts the strong capacity of enhancing the solubility of pahs by partitioning the molecules of pahs into the hydrophobic tails of surfactants adrion et al 2016 surfactants are capable of promoting the mass transfer of pahs from the solid into the aqueous phase and meanwhile the interfacial tension between pahs and water is decreased ahn et al 2008 the environmentally friendly surfactants are expected considering their little or no acute toxicity as well as the favorable rates for environmental degradation to innocuous products wen and marshall 2011 ye et al 2017 in most cases the washing residues containing pahs need to be further treated via subsequent degradation processes among which the oxidation methods are attractive for their high efficiency and wide application gitipour et al 2018 as a highly effective oxidant e0 2 07 v ozone degrades pahs in the aqueous phase by breaking them into the more simple and biodegradable form through aromatic ring cleavage and or hydroxylation of the aromatic rings through radical reactions gong and zhao 2017 haapea and tuhkanen 2006 it is well known that ozone application is catalogued as one of the most promising systems for in situ or on site remediation of pollution rivas et al 2009 surfactant enhanced washing coupled with ozone oxidation is gaining a growing attention for the remediation of hydrophobic compound contaminated soils liu 2018a 2018b that sheds light on the application of relevant technologies in the remediation of aquifer pollution in particular those combined technologies overcome the limitations imposed by the low aqueous solubility of pahs which inhibits the rates of dissolution and oxidation nevertheless the difficulties and bottlenecks should be well considered and addressed as well in order to achieve the satisfactory remediation effect of pah contaminated sediments in aquifer i enhancing the migration and transportation ability of surfactant solution for the high leaching efficacy of pahs ii accurately desorbing the target hydrophobic contaminants from sediments and iii reinforcing the in situ oxidation degradation immediately after or simultaneously when the pahs are desorbed into the aqueous phase one promising solution is to employ a functionalized bubble system as surfactant and oxidant carrier for the in situ remediation of pah contaminated sediments the colloidal gas aphrons cgas were then taken into account cgas first proposed by felix sebba 1971 are a special type of microbubbles with a gaseous core and a thin multi layered aqueous surfactant shell molaei and waters 2015 the cga system is of striking and attractive features for the elimination of pollutants from different matrixes including large specific surface area high stability strong ability of migration and transportation controllable interfacial properties and great potential of functionalization zhang and guiraud 2017 zhang et al 2018a 2018b for the hydrophobic pollutants such as pahs the nonionic surfactants could be selected for the cga production which facilitates the adhesion of hydrophobic molecules onto the cga surface moreover cgas can also be harnessed to deliver oxygen to a target site for successfully reinforcing the aerobic degradation of pollutants inside the matrixes hashim et al 2012 that sparkles the potential of cgas as the carrier of oxidants especially the gaseous ones like ozone the coupling of nonionic surfactants and gaseous oxidant in the cga system may develop a novel and robust technology to remove pahs from sediments in situ both of the two components being involved in this method will play essential roles based on their individually attractive characteristics however the relevant work has not been studied and implemented yet to the authors knowledge the present study aims at conceiving and constructing a specific cga system with an ozone contained gaseous core surrounded by multilayers of nonionic surfactant molecules which is named as colloidal ozone aphrons coas the coas were generated by the pressurizing dissolution method and the properties of the newly created bubble system were characterized in terms of surfactant concentration varying with time half life time air hold up and average size phenanthrene phe was chosen as the model pah the specific adhesion of coas on sediments the diffusion of coas in the sediment matrix as well as the remediation performance and behaviors of coas were explored to evaluate this technology

analysis the latter were prepared using ultrapure water from a ultrapure water system smart n15vf healforce china with resistivity of 18 2 mω cm 2 2 preparation and characterization of coas 2 2 1 production of coa suspension coas were created using a continuous ozone production cga generation apparatus hg wnf 1 hangzhou guiguan company china as illustrated in fig 1 ozone was generated from air in the ozonator the bubble generation solution and the ozone contained air were fed into the saturator at the flow rate of 360 ml min and 140 ml min individually the saturator was pressurized to 300 kpa the nonionic surfactant of tween 20 was selected for the preparation of coas given to the hydrophobicity of phe molecules and its critical micelle concentration cmc was determined to be 89 2 mg l see in section 1 of supporting information si the suspensions of cgas ozone microbubbles and air microbubbles were formed in the absence of ozone tween 20 and both of the two respectively with the same procedure the so created bubble suspensions were pumped to the reactor for sediments remediation under the controlled flow rate of 252 ml min by peristaltic pump bt300 2j longerpump china while the rest suspension was recycled through a three way valve for the bubble production 2 2 2 basic characterization of coas after the bubble generation system ran for 7 min and reached a stable state the coa suspension was pumped out for characterization the dissolved ozone concentration in the liquid phase was determined with ozone analyzer pc ii hach u s a the variation of tween 20 concentration with time was first measured using spectrophotometry uv 1800 shimadzu japan with i2 and ki as chromogenic reagents zhang and zhu 2010 the size measurement of coas was conducted by transferring the bubbles on the glass slide sail brand china and photographing them with optical microscope equipped with a digital camera ix71 olympus japan at 100 magnification the images were processed using the imagej software coupled to the analyze particles tool and the bubble size was attained by calculating the average diameter from at least three pictures and each batch was made in triplicate the half life time and air hold up of coas were investigated through the drainage kinetics study which have been specifically reported previously zhang and guiraud 2017 2 2 3 bubble adhesion experiments the glass slides sail brand china were used for the bubble adhesion experiments one side of each slide was surface modified with the phe stock solution at a specific phe concentration to reach a specific level of hydrophobicity besides dcdms was used to obtain the superhydrophobic surface the detailed procedure of surface treatment is elaborated in section 2 of si the contact angle and the coated phe concentration of all the surface treated glass slides were measured by contact angle meter sdc 100 shengding china and hplc individually the glass slides were put into a transparent glass tank 15 10 13 cm3 and the untreated side was attached firmly onto the wall of glass tank while the other side was immersed into the newly generated suspension of bubbles cgas and air microbubbles the images of the bubble attached glass slides were taken at 0 1 2 3 5 7 and 24 h with optical microscope equipped with a digital camera ix71 olympus japan the number of bubbles per 25 mm2 on slide was counted which was repeated at least three times for each slide and each batch was made in triplicate 2 2 4 study of flow expansion and oxidation area in sediments by coas the characteristic flow expansion of coa suspension was explored by injecting the bubble suspension from the bottom center of the surface treated white rubbles 1 2 cm jinmao department china approximately 50 g of anhydrous glucose was dissolved into 2 l of naoh solution 0 5 mol l where 50 ml of methylene blue was subsequently added dropwise after the blue color faded the abovementioned mixed solution was added into 11 5 kg of white rubbles which were then agitated for homogenization then the suspension of coas or ozone microbubbles was injected into the rubbles at the flow rate of 600 ml min and the experimental phenomena were shot by digit camera sony frd ax60 sony japan the blue area indicates the diffusion area of the bubble suspension and the mechanisms of the color change were explained by the principles of the famous blue bottle experiments engerer and cook 1999 the same quantity of white rubbles free from any contamination was adopted to investigate the oxidation degradation efficiency in different areas of the matrix induced by coa suspension within 2 h the contamination procedure was carried out according to section 3 of si the bubble suspension was injected from the bottom center of the surface treated rubbles at the flow rate of 600 ml min after being treated for 2 h the rubbles were collected to measure the residual phe concentration the oxidation degradation efficiency in different areas was then analyzed 2 3 remediation with coa technology 2 3 1 preparation of artificial phe contaminated sediments the model sandy sediments 6 9 mm helei china free from any contamination were selected for remediation experiments the sandy sediments were rinsed with deionized water and then treated with evaporated dcdms for surface hydrophobization the artificial contamination of phe followed the method in section 3 of si the sandy sediments with and without hydrophobic surface treatment were spiked with the phe stock solutions to obtain different homogeneous contamination levels the characteristics of the artificial phe contaminated sandy sediments are shown in table 1 2 3 2 coa performance for remediation of phe contaminated sediments the coa experiments were carried out in semi batch mode as presented in figs 1 and 0 10 l of coa suspension was pumped into the glass reactor from the bottom and was used for remediating 0 02 kg of phe contaminated sediments the reactor was kept to be close during the treatment for 2 h after which the liquid and sediments were collected respectively to measure the residual phe concentration in this study the efficiency of sediment washing and phe oxidation degradation indicated the capacity of coas in removing phe from the sandy sediments and the overall sediment matrix respectively thus the efficiency could be defined and calculated as eqs 1

treated glass slides section 2 2 3 white rubbles section 2 2 4 and model sandy sediments section 2 3 were determined individually according to the method provided by bezza and chirwa 2017 and rodriguez et al 2017 the phe contaminated samples were dried in air and immersed completely in acetonitrile followed by sonication at 36 khz at 55 c 20 min ds 5510dth shanghai sonxi ultrasonic instrument company china the phe contained acetonitrile solution was then filtered through 0 45 μm nylon membrane mairui biotechnology co ltd china the phe was further extracted by hexane in flask which was performed twice for each sample the final extract was evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream and redissolved in acetonitrile for hplc analysis a shimadzu lc 20at series chromatograph japan was coupled with an automatic uv vis detector the chromatographic column intersustain c18 4 6 mm shimadzu japan with a mobile phase of water acetonitrile mixture v v 20 80 was used to identify the extracted phe the injected sample volume was 20 μl and the wavelength was 251 nm with the mobile phase flow of 1 0 ml min all the analytical tests were made in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of coas produced from ozone generation bubble production system tween 20 a nonionic surfactant widely used in food products tian et al 2017 was adopted as environmentally friendly surfactant for the coa production the initial concentration of tween 20 in the bubble generation solution was controlled to be 61 4 122 8 and 184 1 mg l respectively which was no higher than 2 1 times of cmc the properties of coas might be influenced by the encapsulated ozone which could oxidize and thus might destroy the surfactant layers hence the variation of surfactant concentration with time was first examined for the influence of ozone involved air core of coas the tween 20 concentration was measured at 0 7 and 120 min after the coa suspension was pumped out from the generation system as shown in fig 2 the tween 20 molecules were oxidatively decomposed partially or completely by ozone at 7 min at the lowest surfactant concentration of 61 4 mg l cmc for both ozone concentrations for the coa suspensions with higher initial tween 20 concentrations 122 8 and 184 1 mg l the large drop of surfactant concentration was found at 7 min whereas no apparently further reduction in concentration was detected thereafter for the two higher initial tween 20 concentrations different initial ozone concentrations 0 3 and 0 6 mg l did not make great difference on the residual tween 20 concentrations at 120 min which were measured to be 21 0 29 0 mg l the results clearly denote that on the one hand the oxidation effect upon the surfactant layers was significant at the initial 7 min and on the other hand the ozone in the investigated initial concentration range led to the same extent of oxidation on surface layers of coas when the tween 20 concentration was between 1 and 2 times of cmc as an improved cgas the coas were characterized in terms of air hold up stability half life time size distribution and morphology through which the specific features of the robust tool for in situ pollution remediation could be obtained the coas for the property investigation were attained at 7 min when the generation systems ran stable it has been presented in fig 3 a that the air hold up of coas increased from 4 2 to 19 0 from 5 9 to 20 5 and from 5 1 to 23 8 with the tween 20 concentration increasing from 61 4 mg l to 184 1 mg l at the controlled initial ozone concentration of 0 0 3 and 0 6 mg l individually the air hold up was not affected by replacing the air core with ozone involved air core it should be noted that the air hold up of microbubbles obtained by pressurizing air into water was usually 1 2 or even lower azevedo et al 2017 lundh et al 2001 comparatively the air hold up of coas and cgas which were formed in the same process got largely increased that could be attributed to the presence of surfactant molecules which increased the foamability of the bubble generation solution in contrast to that of water the stability of coas was represented by the half life time of bubbles as indicated by fig 3 a the half life time of cgas in the absence of ozone increased from 204 s to 249 s with the increase of initial tween 20 concentration from 61 4 mg l to 184 1 mg l it could be interpreted that higher surfactant concentrations raised the intercohesive forces between surfactant molecules and imparted higher elasticity and mechanical strength to the lamellae enclosing gas save and pangarkar 1994 however for the coas with ozone involved air core important distinction was not found in their stability which remained to be above 200 s over the investigated initial tween 20 concentrations and ozone concentrations that might be ascribed to the oxidation of tween 20 layers by ozone and the residual tween 20 concentration tended to be similar fig 2 which resulted in similar stability of coas the coas were of typical morphology of colloidal aphrons as shown in fig 3 b and c by comparing the images of coas with those of the classical cgas zhang and guiraud 2017 the average size of microbubbles created at the pressure of 300 kpa could be 10 130 μm temesgen et al 2017 as for coas their size slightly exceeded the abovementioned range and rose with the increase of initial tween 20 concentration it is worth noting that the size distribution of coas was apt to be monomodal at the higher adopted ozone concentration of 0 6 mg l while that of coas was not uniform at the lower initial ozone concentration of 0 3 mg l for the sake of sound properties of coas and low dose of surfactant the tween 20 concentration used for all the following experimental study was determined to be 122 8 mg l 3 2 specific adhesion of tween 20 coated bubbles on hydrophobically treated surface the featured structure of coas includes their surfactant multi layers and ozone contained air core which would result in specific performance of surface adhesion and oxidation degradation the former was evaluated in the absence of ozone in terms of the adhesion density of cgas on the surface with different levels of hydrophobicity the bubble counts at 25 mm2 of glass slide increased with the increase of adsorbed phe concentration on slide and reached the highest value for the superhydrophobic dcdms treated slide fig 4 a the bubble counts decreased along with time fig 4 a and b for the air microbubbles in the absence of tween 20 the number of bubbles on slide reduced much faster than that for the tween 20 encapsulated cgas this could also be directly observed by comparing the images between the cga and air microbubbles adsorbed glass slides at the initial 0 h and final 24 h or 4 h time compared with the air microbubbles with hydrophilic surface layers the cgas with nonionic surfactant layers could be preferable attached to the slides with higher phe concentrations or even the dcdms treated surface the increased level of hydrophobicity fig 4 c gave rise to strengthened hydrophobic attraction between tween 20 molecules and hydrophobic surface moreover under the same conditions for bubble production the cgas could be of higher stability and air hold up than the air microbubbles which contributed to the difference in bubble adhesion on slide 3 3 migration and oxidation diagram of coa suspension in sediments of aquifer in addition to the preferable adhesion of coas on the hydrophobic surface the tween 20 layers might also endow coas with specific flow characteristics derived from the surfactant itself for the coas with the initial tween 20 concentration of 122 8 mg l the flow migration in particular horizontally within a short time of 42 s was compared with that of ozone microbubbles created under the same conditions but in the absence of surfactant both of the two types of microbubbles carried the oxidant of ozone which could oxidize the reduced methylene blue into methylene blue resulting in a blue liquid the blue area variation in fig 5 illustrates that the migration area of coa suspension was larger within a given short time in contrast to the ozone microbubble suspension without surfactant layers surfactants have been well recognized for their washing effectiveness ahn et al 2008 li et al 2019 when being covered on the bubble surface the surfactant of tween 20 presented strong capacity of flow diffusion in the rubble matrix facilitated the expansion of coa flow and hence reinforced the transportation of loading agents ozone in this work to further quantify the oxidation of phe induced by the migration of bubble suspension the oxidation efficiency induced by coas and ozone microbubbles in different areas of the rubble matrix was analyzed respectively fig 6 after the treatment for 2 h it can be found that for the ozone microbubbles in the absence of surfactant comparatively higher oxidation efficiency was obtained mainly near the tube for bubble injection little or even no phe was oxidatively degraded in the corners which were far from the bubble injection point in contrast the working area of coas was larger owing to their high stability and strong capacity of oxidant transportation 3 4 desorption and oxidation degradation of phe from sandy sediments by coas the performance of coa suspension for the in situ remediation of phe contaminated sediments was evaluated with respect to the removal of phe from sandy sediments desorption effect and the oxidation degradation of phe from the matrix oxidation elimination effect for the latter the direct reaction with ozone is the way through which phe is eliminated beltran et al 1995 according to fig 7 a for the investigated initial ozone concentrations the removal of phe from the hydrophilically treated sediments with low phe concentration and the hydrophobically treated ones with high phe concentration was higher than that obtained from the sediments with hydrophobic surface and low phe concentration the adsorption force between phe and the hydrophilic surface was weaker than that between phe and the hydrophobic one and the dissolution of phe in the coa suspension was enhanced by partitioning the phe molecules onto tween 20 coated coas for the sandy sediments with hydrophobic surface the phe molecules were attached to the dcdms treated sediments either in the internal pores or onto the external surface at the initial phe concentration of 240 0 μg kg more phe molecules on the external surface of sandy sediments could be desorbed and then be washed out by coa suspension compared with the scenario of the lower phe concentration around 15 2 μg kg thus a higher removal was achieved for the former situation besides the washing effect caused by the surfactant layers of coas should not be the only reason for the phe desorption efficiency the released ozone molecules in the liquid phase could also directly react with the phe molecules being adsorbed on the solid phase which contributed to the overall phe removal from sandy sediments meanwhile the in situ oxidation degradation of phe probably occurred mainly upon the desorbed phe in aqueous phase during the coa involved remediation process the variation of oxidation degradation in fig 7 b consisted of that of the phe desorption in fig 7 a but with lower efficiency that could be attributed to the consumption of ozone by surfactant molecules in the coa layers as well as the limited oxidation capacity of the oxidant in this study moreover it should be pointed out that increasing the ozone concentration from 0 3 mg l to 0 6 mg l helped to increase the efficacy of phe elimination the probable pathway and mechanisms of the coa involved remediation process are given in fig 7 c in the novel method of this study sediment washing and contaminant oxidation degradation simultaneously occurred by adopting the tween 20 coated and ozone contained coas during this in situ remediation process phe desorbed from the sediment surface due to the presence of nonionic surfactant molecules carried by coas step i and ii in fig 7 c the coas drained and released the gaseous oxidant of ozone and thus both of the free ozone and the released ozone in the liquid phase oxidized the phe molecules step iii in fig 7 c the performance of the coa involved remediation technology was compared with that of the matured ozone involved methods in table 2 ozone has been well accepted as the typical oxidant feasible for the in situ remediation masten and davies 1997 however when coupled with the sediment or soil washing processes the remediation would be ex situ since washing and oxidizing were used to be adopted as successive processes herein coas provided the insight of concurring the two processes by constructing the specially functionalized microbubbles with multiple surfactant layers and gaseous oxidant core the multi layered surfactant was able to dissolve the pah molecules in the aqueous phase while the ozone contained air core could oxidatively degrade the target organic contaminants additionally the traditional ozone processes were found to be more widely applied in the remediation of pah contaminated soils where the phe or pah concentration was detected to be apparently higher than that in the sediments of aquifer in those cases high doses of ozone were required to achieve high elimination rates of phe for example 20 mg l based on the results in the present work at such high doses of ozone it is highly possible that the surfactant layers of coas were completely oxidized before the bubbles arrived at the phe contaminated sites as for the contaminated sediment matrix with intrinsically low pah concentrations the demanded dose of ozone encapsulated in coas was low which ensured the stability of the colloidal aphrons accordingly such coas allowed the slow release of ozone and the effective phe oxidation removal by the released and free ozone since the oxidation of surfactant surface layers occurred during the remediation process there would not be important concerns about the secondary contamination induced by surfactant in general the novel coa involved process was appropriate for the remediation of pah contaminated sediments in aquifer 4 conclusions the current work constructed the functionalized colloidal aphrons for the in situ remediation of phe contaminated sediments the coa suspension was created by dissolving ozone contained air into the nonionic surfactant tween 20 solution at the pressure of 300 kpa when the initial concentration of tween 20 was below and above cmc the stability of coas was slightly weakened compared with the cgas in the absence of ozone but the half life time of coas still remained to be greater than 200 s the surfactant concentration for the coa production was suggested to be above cmc since the surfactant layers were oxidized completely within 7 min at the tween 20 concentration lower than cmc compared with the microbubbles in the absence of surfactant the surfactant multi layers endowed the coas with high stability strong hydrophobic attraction with phe great migration capacity and enlarged oxidation area in the sediment matrix generally the removal efficiency from sediments and the oxidation degradation efficiency of phe by coas followed the order of hydrophobic surface with high phe concentration hydrophilic surface with low phe concentration hydrophobic surface with low phe concentration when the initial phe concentration was 240 0 μg kg approximately 96 9 of phe was removed from the sediments and 84 9 of the overall phe was oxidized at the high ozone concentration of 0 6 mg l the coa involved remediation technology provided the insight of combining the processes of washing and oxidizing by constructing a particular type of microbubbles with multi layered surfactant and encapsulated gaseous oxidant thus the in situ and selective removal of hydrophobic organic contaminants from sediments in aquifer was well achieved further work can be carried out with respect to the impact of sediment properties

18722,the hydrophobic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are apt to adhere tightly to the sediments in aquifer and thus pose great threats to the aquatic environment of groundwater and surface water as well as human health the present study constructed functionalized microbubbles named colloidal ozone aphrons coas by dissolving ozone contained air into the nonionic surfactant tween 20 solution at the pressure of 300 kpa for the in situ remediation of phenanthrene phe contaminated sediments the coa system aimed at improving the phe elimination in terms of i enhancing the migration and transportation ability of the bubble system in the contaminated aquifer matrix ii accurately desorbing the target hydrophobic contaminants from sediments and iii reinforcing the in situ oxidation degradation immediately after or simultaneously when the pahs are desorbed into the aqueous phase experimental results demonstrated that the coas exhibited similar characteristics as the classical colloidal gas aphrons cgas including the high stability half life time 200 s typical morphology and average bubble size 114 162 μm higher air hold up of coas was achieved i e 20 compared with the air microbubbles 1 2 obtained under the same generation conditions although the encapsulated ozone could oxidize the surfactant layers the properties and behaviors of coas were not greatly affected the surfactant multi layers endowed the coas with strong hydrophobic attraction with phe great migration capacity and enlarged oxidation area in the sediment matrix approximately 96 9 of phe was removed from the sediments and 84 9 of the overall phe was oxidized at the high ozone concentration of 0 6 mg l when the initial phe concentration was 240 0 μg kg the coa involved remediation technology provided the insight of combining the processes of washing and oxidizing through adopting the particularly conceived microbubbles the in situ and selective removal of hydrophobic organic contaminants from sediments in aquifer was well achieved in this study graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbubble functionalization colloidal zone aphrons in situ contaminant targeting remediation 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs the by products mainly resulting from petroleum pyrolysis acetylene synthesis from natural gas and refinery operations are well known for their teratogenic carcinogenic and mutagenic nature rodriguez et al 2017 owing to the high hydrophobicity and low solubility the persistent and semi volatile pahs are apt to adhere tightly to the sediments in aquifer which are thus probably the transient storage compartment and secondary pollution source of pahs meng et al 2019 the concentration of pahs in sediments has been reported to be 74 1931 μg kg in summer and 97 3140 μg kg in winter in chinese lakes gong et al 2018 zeng et al 2018 considering the direct threat to the aquatic environment and the current status of pollution pahs are listed as the priority control pollutants by the u s environmental protection agency srogi 2007 it has been widely recognized that the substantial improvement of the groundwater or surface water quality often cannot be achieved without appropriate treatment of the contaminated sediments in aquifer by now the effective and efficient removal of pahs from sediments in aquifer has been among the most urgent issues for the pollution control of the groundwater and surface water systems a significant technology for rapid and effective removal of pahs being adsorbed to sediments is washing with surfactant solution during the process the amphiphilic structure of surfactants exerts the strong capacity of enhancing the solubility of pahs by partitioning the molecules of pahs into the hydrophobic tails of surfactants adrion et al 2016 surfactants are capable of promoting the mass transfer of pahs from the solid into the aqueous phase and meanwhile the interfacial tension between pahs and water is decreased ahn et al 2008 the environmentally friendly surfactants are expected considering their little or no acute toxicity as well as the favorable rates for environmental degradation to innocuous products wen and marshall 2011 ye et al 2017 in most cases the washing residues containing pahs need to be further treated via subsequent degradation processes among which the oxidation methods are attractive for their high efficiency and wide application gitipour et al 2018 as a highly effective oxidant e0 2 07 v ozone degrades pahs in the aqueous phase by breaking them into the more simple and biodegradable form through aromatic ring cleavage and or hydroxylation of the aromatic rings through radical reactions gong and zhao 2017 haapea and tuhkanen 2006 it is well known that ozone application is catalogued as one of the most promising systems for in situ or on site remediation of pollution rivas et al 2009 surfactant enhanced washing coupled with ozone oxidation is gaining a growing attention for the remediation of hydrophobic compound contaminated soils liu 2018a 2018b that sheds light on the application of relevant technologies in the remediation of aquifer pollution in particular those combined technologies overcome the limitations imposed by the low aqueous solubility of pahs which inhibits the rates of dissolution and oxidation nevertheless the difficulties and bottlenecks should be well considered and addressed as well in order to achieve the satisfactory remediation effect of pah contaminated sediments in aquifer i enhancing the migration and transportation ability of surfactant solution for the high leaching efficacy of pahs ii accurately desorbing the target hydrophobic contaminants from sediments and iii reinforcing the in situ oxidation degradation immediately after or simultaneously when the pahs are desorbed into the aqueous phase one promising solution is to employ a functionalized bubble system as surfactant and oxidant carrier for the in situ remediation of pah contaminated sediments the colloidal gas aphrons cgas were then taken into account cgas first proposed by felix sebba 1971 are a special type of microbubbles with a gaseous core and a thin multi layered aqueous surfactant shell molaei and waters 2015 the cga system is of striking and attractive features for the elimination of pollutants from different matrixes including large specific surface area high stability strong ability of migration and transportation controllable interfacial properties and great potential of functionalization zhang and guiraud 2017 zhang et al 2018a 2018b for the hydrophobic pollutants such as pahs the nonionic surfactants could be selected for the cga production which facilitates the adhesion of hydrophobic molecules onto the cga surface moreover cgas can also be harnessed to deliver oxygen to a target site for successfully reinforcing the aerobic degradation of pollutants inside the matrixes hashim et al 2012 that sparkles the potential of cgas as the carrier of oxidants especially the gaseous ones like ozone the coupling of nonionic surfactants and gaseous oxidant in the cga system may develop a novel and robust technology to remove pahs from sediments in situ both of the two components being involved in this method will play essential roles based on their individually attractive characteristics however the relevant work has not been studied and implemented yet to the authors knowledge the present study aims at conceiving and constructing a specific cga system with an ozone contained gaseous core surrounded by multilayers of nonionic surfactant molecules which is named as colloidal ozone aphrons coas the coas were generated by the pressurizing dissolution method and the properties of the newly created bubble system were characterized in terms of surfactant concentration varying with time half life time air hold up and average size phenanthrene phe was chosen as the model pah the specific adhesion of coas on sediments the diffusion of coas in the sediment matrix as well as the remediation performance and behaviors of coas were explored to evaluate this technology

production of coa suspension coas were created using a continuous ozone production cga generation apparatus hg wnf 1 hangzhou guiguan company china as illustrated in fig 1 ozone was generated from air in the ozonator the bubble generation solution and the ozone contained air were fed into the saturator at the flow rate of 360 ml min and 140 ml min individually the saturator was pressurized to 300 kpa the nonionic surfactant of tween 20 was selected for the preparation of coas given to the hydrophobicity of phe molecules and its critical micelle concentration cmc was determined to be 89 2 mg l see in section 1 of supporting information si the suspensions of cgas ozone microbubbles and air microbubbles were formed in the absence of ozone tween 20 and both of the two respectively with the same procedure the so created bubble suspensions were pumped to the reactor for sediments remediation under the controlled flow rate of 252 ml min by peristaltic pump bt300 2j longerpump china while the rest suspension was recycled through a three way valve for the bubble production 2 2 2 basic characterization of coas after the bubble generation system ran for 7 min and reached a stable state the coa suspension was pumped out for characterization the dissolved ozone concentration in the liquid phase was determined with ozone analyzer pc ii hach u s a the variation of tween 20 concentration with time was first measured using spectrophotometry uv 1800 shimadzu japan with i2 and ki as chromogenic reagents zhang and zhu 2010 the size measurement of coas was conducted by transferring the bubbles on the glass slide sail brand china and photographing them with optical microscope equipped with a digital camera ix71 olympus japan at 100 magnification the images were processed using the imagej software coupled to the analyze particles tool and the bubble size was attained by calculating the average diameter from at least three pictures and each batch was made in triplicate the half life time and air hold up of coas were investigated through the drainage kinetics study which have been specifically reported previously zhang and guiraud 2017 2 2 3 bubble adhesion experiments the glass slides sail brand china were used for the bubble adhesion experiments one side of each slide was surface modified with the phe stock solution at a specific phe concentration to reach a specific level of hydrophobicity besides dcdms was used to obtain the superhydrophobic surface the detailed procedure of surface treatment is elaborated in section 2 of si the contact angle and the coated phe concentration of all the surface treated glass slides were measured by contact angle meter sdc 100 shengding china and hplc individually the glass slides were put into a transparent glass tank 15 10 13 cm3 and the untreated side was attached firmly onto the wall of glass tank while the other side was immersed into the newly generated suspension of bubbles cgas and air microbubbles the images of the bubble attached glass slides were taken at 0 1 2 3 5 7 and 24 h with optical microscope equipped with a digital camera ix71 olympus japan the number of bubbles per 25 mm2 on slide was counted which was repeated at least three times for each slide and each batch was made in triplicate 2 2 4 study of flow expansion and oxidation area in sediments by coas the characteristic flow expansion of coa suspension was explored by injecting the bubble suspension from the bottom center of the surface treated white rubbles 1 2 cm jinmao department china approximately 50 g of anhydrous glucose was dissolved into 2 l of naoh solution 0 5 mol l where 50 ml of methylene blue was subsequently added dropwise after the blue color faded the abovementioned mixed solution was added into 11 5 kg of white rubbles which were then agitated for homogenization then the suspension of coas or ozone microbubbles was injected into the rubbles at the flow rate of 600 ml min and the experimental phenomena were shot by digit camera sony frd ax60 sony japan the blue area indicates the diffusion area of the bubble suspension and the mechanisms of the color change were explained by the principles of the famous blue bottle experiments engerer and cook 1999 the same quantity of white rubbles free from any contamination was adopted to investigate the oxidation degradation efficiency in different areas of the matrix induced by coa suspension within 2 h the contamination procedure was carried out according to section 3 of si the bubble suspension was injected from the bottom center of the surface treated rubbles at the flow rate of 600 ml min after being treated for 2 h the rubbles were collected to measure the residual phe concentration the oxidation degradation efficiency in different areas was then analyzed 2 3 remediation with coa technology 2 3 1 preparation of artificial phe contaminated sediments the model sandy sediments 6 9 mm helei china free from any contamination were selected for remediation experiments the sandy sediments were rinsed with deionized water and then treated with evaporated dcdms for surface hydrophobization the artificial contamination of phe followed the method in section 3 of si the sandy sediments with and without hydrophobic surface treatment were spiked with the phe stock solutions to obtain different homogeneous contamination levels the characteristics of the artificial phe contaminated sandy sediments are shown in table 1 2 3 2 coa performance for remediation of phe contaminated sediments the coa experiments were carried out in semi batch mode as presented in figs 1 and 0 10 l of coa suspension was pumped into the glass reactor from the bottom and was used for remediating 0 02 kg of phe contaminated sediments the reactor was kept to be close during the treatment for 2 h after which the liquid and sediments were collected respectively to measure the residual phe concentration in this study the efficiency of sediment washing and phe oxidation degradation indicated the capacity of coas in removing phe from the sandy sediments and the overall sediment matrix respectively thus the efficiency could be defined and calculated as eqs 1

treated glass slides section 2 2 3 white rubbles section 2 2 4 and model sandy sediments section 2 3 were determined individually according to the method provided by bezza and chirwa 2017 and rodriguez et al 2017 the phe contaminated samples were dried in air and immersed completely in acetonitrile followed by sonication at 36 khz at 55 c 20 min ds 5510dth shanghai sonxi ultrasonic instrument company china the phe contained acetonitrile solution was then filtered through 0 45 μm nylon membrane mairui biotechnology co ltd china the phe was further extracted by hexane in flask which was performed twice for each sample the final extract was evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream and redissolved in acetonitrile for hplc analysis a shimadzu lc 20at series chromatograph japan was coupled with an automatic uv vis detector the chromatographic column intersustain c18 4 6 mm shimadzu japan with a mobile phase of water acetonitrile mixture v v 20 80 was used to identify the extracted phe the injected sample volume was 20 μl and the wavelength was 251 nm with the mobile phase flow of 1 0 ml min all the analytical tests were made in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of coas produced from ozone generation bubble production system tween 20 a nonionic surfactant widely used in food products tian et al 2017 was adopted as environmentally friendly surfactant for the coa production the initial concentration of tween 20 in the bubble generation solution was controlled to be 61 4 122 8 and 184 1 mg l respectively which was no higher than 2 1 times of cmc the properties of coas might be influenced by the encapsulated ozone which could oxidize and thus might destroy the surfactant layers hence the variation of surfactant concentration with time was first examined for the influence of ozone involved air core of coas the tween 20 concentration was measured at 0 7 and 120 min after the coa suspension was pumped out from the generation system as shown in fig 2 the tween 20 molecules were oxidatively decomposed partially or completely by ozone at 7 min at the lowest surfactant concentration of 61 4 mg l cmc for both ozone concentrations for the coa suspensions with higher initial tween 20 concentrations 122 8 and 184 1 mg l the large drop of surfactant concentration was found at 7 min whereas no apparently further reduction in concentration was detected thereafter for the two higher initial tween 20 concentrations different initial ozone concentrations 0 3 and 0 6 mg l did not make great difference on the residual tween 20 concentrations at 120 min which were measured to be 21 0 29 0 mg l the results clearly denote that on the one hand the oxidation effect upon the surfactant layers was significant at the initial 7 min and on the other hand the ozone in the investigated initial concentration range led to the same extent of oxidation on surface layers of coas when the tween 20 concentration was between 1 and 2 times of cmc as an improved cgas the coas were characterized in terms of air hold up stability half life time size distribution and morphology through which the specific features of the robust tool for in situ pollution remediation could be obtained the coas for the property investigation were attained at 7 min when the generation systems ran stable it has been presented in fig 3 a that the air hold up of coas increased from 4 2 to 19 0 from 5 9 to 20 5 and from 5 1 to 23 8 with the tween 20 concentration increasing from 61 4 mg l to 184 1 mg l at the controlled initial ozone concentration of 0 0 3 and 0 6 mg l individually the air hold up was not affected by replacing the air core with ozone involved air core it should be noted that the air hold up of microbubbles obtained by pressurizing air into water was usually 1 2 or even lower azevedo et al 2017 lundh et al 2001 comparatively the air hold up of coas and cgas which were formed in the same process got largely increased that could be attributed to the presence of surfactant molecules which increased the foamability of the bubble generation solution in contrast to that of water the stability of coas was represented by the half life time of bubbles as indicated by fig 3 a the half life time of cgas in the absence of ozone increased from 204 s to 249 s with the increase of initial tween 20 concentration from 61 4 mg l to 184 1 mg l it could be interpreted that higher surfactant concentrations raised the intercohesive forces between surfactant molecules and imparted higher elasticity and mechanical strength to the lamellae enclosing gas save and pangarkar 1994 however for the coas with ozone involved air core important distinction was not found in their stability which remained to be above 200 s over the investigated initial tween 20 concentrations and ozone concentrations that might be ascribed to the oxidation of tween 20 layers by ozone and the residual tween 20 concentration tended to be similar fig 2 which resulted in similar stability of coas the coas were of typical morphology of colloidal aphrons as shown in fig 3 b and c by comparing the images of coas with those of the classical cgas zhang and guiraud 2017 the average size of microbubbles created at the pressure of 300 kpa could be 10 130 μm temesgen et al 2017 as for coas their size slightly exceeded the abovementioned range and rose with the increase of initial tween 20 concentration it is worth noting that the size distribution of coas was apt to be monomodal at the higher adopted ozone concentration of 0 6 mg l while that of coas was not uniform at the lower initial ozone concentration of 0 3 mg l for the sake of sound properties of coas and low dose of surfactant the tween 20 concentration used for all the following experimental study was determined to be 122 8 mg l 3 2 specific adhesion of tween 20 coated bubbles on hydrophobically treated surface the featured structure of coas includes their surfactant multi layers and ozone contained air core which would result in specific performance of surface adhesion and oxidation degradation the former was evaluated in the absence of ozone in terms of the adhesion density of cgas on the surface with different levels of hydrophobicity the bubble counts at 25 mm2 of glass slide increased with the increase of adsorbed phe concentration on slide and reached the highest value for the superhydrophobic dcdms treated slide fig 4 a the bubble counts decreased along with time fig 4 a and b for the air microbubbles in the absence of tween 20 the number of bubbles on slide reduced much faster than that for the tween 20 encapsulated cgas this could also be directly observed by comparing the images between the cga and air microbubbles adsorbed glass slides at the initial 0 h and final 24 h or 4 h time compared with the air microbubbles with hydrophilic surface layers the cgas with nonionic surfactant layers could be preferable attached to the slides with higher phe concentrations or even the dcdms treated surface the increased level of hydrophobicity fig 4 c gave rise to strengthened hydrophobic attraction between tween 20 molecules and hydrophobic surface moreover under the same conditions for bubble production the cgas could be of higher stability and air hold up than the air microbubbles which contributed to the difference in bubble adhesion on slide 3 3 migration and oxidation diagram of coa suspension in sediments of aquifer in addition to the preferable adhesion of coas on the hydrophobic surface the tween 20 layers might also endow coas with specific flow characteristics derived from the surfactant itself for the coas with the initial tween 20 concentration of 122 8 mg l the flow migration in particular horizontally within a short time of 42 s was compared with that of ozone microbubbles created under the same conditions but in the absence of surfactant both of the two types of microbubbles carried the oxidant of ozone which could oxidize the reduced methylene blue into methylene blue resulting in a blue liquid the blue area variation in fig 5 illustrates that the migration area of coa suspension was larger within a given short time in contrast to the ozone microbubble suspension without surfactant layers surfactants have been well recognized for their washing effectiveness ahn et al 2008 li et al 2019 when being covered on the bubble surface the surfactant of tween 20 presented strong capacity of flow diffusion in the rubble matrix facilitated the expansion of coa flow and hence reinforced the transportation of loading agents ozone in this work to further quantify the oxidation of phe induced by the migration of bubble suspension the oxidation efficiency induced by coas and ozone microbubbles in different areas of the rubble matrix was analyzed respectively fig 6 after the treatment for 2 h it can be found that for the ozone microbubbles in the absence of surfactant comparatively higher oxidation efficiency was obtained mainly near the tube for bubble injection little or even no phe was oxidatively degraded in the corners which were far from the bubble injection point in contrast the working area of coas was larger owing to their high stability and strong capacity of oxidant transportation 3 4 desorption and oxidation degradation of phe from sandy sediments by coas the performance of coa suspension for the in situ remediation of phe contaminated sediments was evaluated with respect to the removal of phe from sandy sediments desorption effect and the oxidation degradation of phe from the matrix oxidation elimination effect for the latter the direct reaction with ozone is the way through which phe is eliminated beltran et al 1995 according to fig 7 a for the investigated initial ozone concentrations the removal of phe from the hydrophilically treated sediments with low phe concentration and the hydrophobically treated ones with high phe concentration was higher than that obtained from the sediments with hydrophobic surface and low phe concentration the adsorption force between phe and the hydrophilic surface was weaker than that between phe and the hydrophobic one and the dissolution of phe in the coa suspension was enhanced by partitioning the phe molecules onto tween 20 coated coas for the sandy sediments with hydrophobic surface the phe molecules were attached to the dcdms treated sediments either in the internal pores or onto the external surface at the initial phe concentration of 240 0 μg kg more phe molecules on the external surface of sandy sediments could be desorbed and then be washed out by coa suspension compared with the scenario of the lower phe concentration around 15 2 μg kg thus a higher removal was achieved for the former situation besides the washing effect caused by the surfactant layers of coas should not be the only reason for the phe desorption efficiency the released ozone molecules in the liquid phase could also directly react with the phe molecules being adsorbed on the solid phase which contributed to the overall phe removal from sandy sediments meanwhile the in situ oxidation degradation of phe probably occurred mainly upon the desorbed phe in aqueous phase during the coa involved remediation process the variation of oxidation degradation in fig 7 b consisted of that of the phe desorption in fig 7 a but with lower efficiency that could be attributed to the consumption of ozone by surfactant molecules in the coa layers as well as the limited oxidation capacity of the oxidant in this study moreover it should be pointed out that increasing the ozone concentration from 0 3 mg l to 0 6 mg l helped to increase the efficacy of phe elimination the probable pathway and mechanisms of the coa involved remediation process are given in fig 7 c in the novel method of this study sediment washing and contaminant oxidation degradation simultaneously occurred by adopting the tween 20 coated and ozone contained coas during this in situ remediation process phe desorbed from the sediment surface due to the presence of nonionic surfactant molecules carried by coas step i and ii in fig 7 c the coas drained and released the gaseous oxidant of ozone and thus both of the free ozone and the released ozone in the liquid phase oxidized the phe molecules step iii in fig 7 c the performance of the coa involved remediation technology was compared with that of the matured ozone involved methods in table 2 ozone has been well accepted as the typical oxidant feasible for the in situ remediation masten and davies 1997 however when coupled with the sediment or soil washing processes the remediation would be ex situ since washing and oxidizing were used to be adopted as successive processes herein coas provided the insight of concurring the two processes by constructing the specially functionalized microbubbles with multiple surfactant layers and gaseous oxidant core the multi layered surfactant was able to dissolve the pah molecules in the aqueous phase while the ozone contained air core could oxidatively degrade the target organic contaminants additionally the traditional ozone processes were found to be more widely applied in the remediation of pah contaminated soils where the phe or pah concentration was detected to be apparently higher than that in the sediments of aquifer in those cases high doses of ozone were required to achieve high elimination rates of phe for example 20 mg l based on the results in the present work at such high doses of ozone it is highly possible that the surfactant layers of coas were completely oxidized before the bubbles arrived at the phe contaminated sites as for the contaminated sediment matrix with intrinsically low pah concentrations the demanded dose of ozone encapsulated in coas was low which ensured the stability of the colloidal aphrons accordingly such coas allowed the slow release of ozone and the effective phe oxidation removal by the released and free ozone since the oxidation of surfactant surface layers occurred during the remediation process there would not be important concerns about the secondary contamination induced by surfactant in general the novel coa involved process was appropriate for the remediation of pah contaminated sediments in aquifer 4 conclusions the current work constructed the functionalized colloidal aphrons for the in situ remediation of phe contaminated sediments the coa suspension was created by dissolving ozone contained air into the nonionic surfactant tween 20 solution at the pressure of 300 kpa when the initial concentration of tween 20 was below and above cmc the stability of coas was slightly weakened compared with the cgas in the absence of ozone but the half life time of coas still remained to be greater than 200 s the surfactant concentration for the coa production was suggested to be above cmc since the surfactant layers were oxidized completely within 7 min at the tween 20 concentration lower than cmc compared with the microbubbles in the absence of surfactant the surfactant multi layers endowed the coas with high stability strong hydrophobic attraction with phe great migration capacity and enlarged oxidation area in the sediment matrix generally the removal efficiency from sediments and the oxidation degradation efficiency of phe by coas followed the order of hydrophobic surface with high phe concentration hydrophilic surface with low phe concentration hydrophobic surface with low phe concentration when the initial phe concentration was 240 0 μg kg approximately 96 9 of phe was removed from the sediments and 84 9 of the overall phe was oxidized at the high ozone concentration of 0 6 mg l the coa involved remediation technology provided the insight of combining the processes of washing and oxidizing by constructing a particular type of microbubbles with multi layered surfactant and encapsulated gaseous oxidant thus the in situ and selective removal of hydrophobic organic contaminants from sediments in aquifer was well achieved further work can be carried out with respect to the impact of sediment properties

autotrophic denitrification ssad system in which siderite buffers ph and provides inorganic carbon source for autotrophic denitrication and the released iron ions used as reagents of p removal siderite is usually used as adsorbent to remove as and cd wang and reardon 2001 hg ha et al 2016 f liu et al 2010 pb mehmeterdem 2005 cr erdem et al 2004 from wastewater recently it was studied for electron donor of fe ii oxidizing denitrifiers to simultaneously remove nitrate and phosphate from wastewater with low c n ratio but the siderite driven autotrophic denitrification was very limited yang et al 2018 zhu et al zhu et al 2018 studied coupled sulfur and fe ii carbonate driven autotrophic denitrification but they did not pay attention to simultaneous nitrate and phosphate to our knowledge ssad system has never been studied for simultaneous nitrate and phosphate removal before in this study the ssad system was constructed the aims of this study were to investigate feasibility of the ssad performances and mechanisms of the ssad for simultaneous nitrate and phosphate removal from wastewater with low c n ratio and microbial community structure in the ssad this study will help to understand the ssad system and develop a novel nutrients removal technology for eutrophication control 2 materials and methods 2 1 siderite and sulfur characteristics siderite was obtained from a mine located in shaanxi province china and was pulverized in a jaw crusher and sieved into particles of 0 25 0 83 and 2 5 mm for batch and column experiments respectively sulfur 99 6 was purchased from zhengzhou henan province china with particle size of 2 2 36 mm and 2 5 mm for batch and column experiments respectively siderite of 0 25 0 83 mm were placed in a 10 v v hcl solution for 2 h for the removal of oxides formed on the surface and then in 75 v v of ethanol solution for 12 h and rinsed with deionized water until the ph of the rinse reached 7 0 1 sulfur of 2 2 36 mm were also placed in 75 v v of ethanol solution for 12 h and then rinsed with deionized water the clean siderite and sulfur particles were dried at 20 c in a vacuum drying oven for 24 h and subsequently stored in airtight bags which were flushed with nitrogen gas to prevent oxidation the siderite sample for xrf analysis was ground into powder and then analyzed according to the manufacturer s instruction arl 9800xp arl switzerland the x ray fluorescence xrf analysis identified the chemical composition of the siderite as follows fe2o3 34 7 sio2 40 1 al2o3 16 2 k2o 0 74 mgo 0 34 mno 0 99 cao 0 34 so3 0 51 x ray diffraction x tra arl switzerland analysis indicates that the siderite mineral was composed of siderite and quartz mineral phases fig s1 2 2 enrichment of autotrophic denitrifiers before the experiments autotrophic denitrifiers were enriched from anaerobic sludge of local wastewater treatment plant the enrichment procedure and culturing of biofilm in the ssad can be found in our previous research li et al 2016 after the enrichment of biomass was successful the biomass in 100 ml of the culturing solution was harvested by centrifugation washed with deionized water resuspended in deionized water of 100 ml and used as the inoculum for batch experiments 2 3 batch experiments 20 g of siderite 0 25 0 83 mm and sulfur 2 2 36 mm with different sulfur siderite volume ratios v v 0 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 7 inoculum 3 5 ml and synthetic wastewater 50 ml were added to 60 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes sarstedt ltd germany one control without siderite and sulfur was used to correct for no3 loss not associated with the ssad and the other without inoculum to monitor possible abiotic siderite and sulfur oxidation coupled to no3 reduction synthetic wastewater used in this study was composed of 0 202 g l 1 kno3 0 027 g l 1 kh2po4 0 050 g l 1 nh4cl 0 050 g l 1 mgcl2 6h2o if not specifically indicated the concentrations of no3 n and po4 3 p in the synthetic wastewater were 28 mg l 1 and 6 2 mg l 1 respectively all the chemicals and reagents used in the experiments were analytical grade for the controls without the inoculum 3 5 ml of deionized water was added instead of the inoculum the plastic centrifuge tubes filled with synthetic wastewater inoculum siderite and sulfur were flushed with n2 for 120 s to exclude air from the solution and headspace sealed and placed on a rotator for mixing in a thermostatic chamber the temperature was kept at 30 c during the batch experiments which lasted for 36 days three tubes were taken out from the rotator for sampling every 2 days three tubes for the control without siderite and sulfur were kept in the rotator until the end of each set of batch experiment and water quality indices of the control without siderite and sulfur were considered as initial values of water quality for the ssad all batch experiments were carried out in triplicate and the average data and standard deviation are presented 2 4 column and pilot experiments three glass columns r1 r2 and r3 fig s2 were established as the anaerobic up flow fixed bed reactors each column had an internal diameter of 10 cm a height of 50 cm and a packed height of the siderite and sulfur particles 2 5 mm of 48 cm the volume ratios of sulfur and siderite particles were 1 1 1 3 and 0 1 for r1 r2 and r3 with a porosity of 45 40 and 40 respectively the calculating method of hydraulic retention time hrt was described in our previous research li et al 2016 five sampling outlets o 1 o 5 located on the column at heights of 90 170 250 330 410 mm from the bottom of the column respectively were used for water and media sampling for further analysis effluent outlet o 6 was located on the column at the height of 500 mm from the bottom of the column after biofilm culture finished as our previous study zhang et al 2019 li et al 2014 the ssad columns were fed with synthetic wastewater which was prepared with tap water kh2po4 kno3 and nh4cl with 28 no3 n mg l 1 3 1 mg l po4 3 p and 4 mg l 1 nh4 n the whole operation time lasted 122 days at room temperature 20 25 c the ssad pilot biofilter ssad pb 1300 1300 2600 mm longth width height with volume of siderite and sulfur 2 5 m3 1300 1300 1500 mm was constructed and there were five outlets for sampling too fig s3 both siderite and sulfur particle size was 2 5 mm and volume ratio of sulfur and siderite was 1 3 the same as the r2 the start up of the ssad pb was the same as the column experiment after the start up finished the ssad pb was continuously fed with the second effluent of a wwtp for chemical industry wastewater from 25 oct 2017 to 15 dec 2018 2 5 sampling and analysis water samples were got from the ssad columns and ssad pb once per 2 or 4 days after water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filter paper the concentrations of no3 n no2 n and so4 2 in the filtrates were measured with ion chromatography mp551 ton no3 n no2 n nh4 and po4 3 p were determined according to the standard methods mep ministry of environmental protection of people s republic of china 2002 ph values were measured with a ph meter wtw 340 germany when measuring metal concentrations in water samples the filtrates were acidified to 1 using nitric acid hno3 trace metal grade 67 69 fisher uk and metal concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms elan drce perkinelmer waltham usa in a class 1000 iso class 6 cleanroom staunton et al 2014 sulfur and siderite samples taken from o 1 o 3 and o 5 of the ssad column and ssad pb were treated following

omega bio tek norcross ga u s following the manufacturer s instructions to determine the final dna concentration and purification nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa was used and dna quality was checked by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis then pcr was conducted and high throughput sequencing was finished on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa the detailed steps were described in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 feasibility of the ssad system for simultaneous nitrate and phosphate removal feasibility of the ssad system for simultaneous nitrate and phosphate removal was tested through batch experiments with different sulfur siderite volume ratios no denitrification occurred in the two control experiments without sulfur and siderite and without the inoculum it demonstrated that the ssad was the only way to remove no3 in the experiments in the experiments of sulfur siderite ratio 0 1 no3 fig 1 a no2 fig 1 b nh4 fig 1 c so4 2 fig 1 e and ph fig 1 f kept stable during the experiment it indicated that sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers could not use siderite as electron donor to reduce no3 though they could use pyrrhotite li et al 2016 pyrite jorgensen et al 2009 and fe2 to reduce no3 yang yang et al 2018 found that siderite could be used as an electron donor by fe ii oxidizing denitrifiers the strain pxl1 but the denitrification rate was very slow no denitrification occurred in the experiment of sulfur siderite ratio 0 1 but po4 3 was effectively removed and even the po4 3 removal rate was the fastest among all sulfur siderite ratio experiments fig 1 d the reason was that siderite is po4 3 adsorbent zhang et al 2017 and the amount of siderite in the sulfur siderite ratio 0 1 was the most among the sulfur siderite ratios studied except the sulfur siderite ratio 0 1 in the experiments of all other sulfur siderite ratios no3 and po4 3 fig 1 a and d respectively were effectively removed from wastewater which demonstrated that the ssad was feasible to simultaneously remove no3 and po4 3 from wastewater among the sulfur siderite ratios studied the order of denitrification rate was 1 3 1 1 1 2 1 7 fig 1a as the total weight of sulfur and siderite remained unchanged more sulfur was beneficial to denitrification but less siderite was unfavorable to buffer ph fig 1 f and provide inorganic carbon source thus the optimal sulfur siderite ratio was 1 3 however in the slad the optimal sulfur limestone ratio was 3 1 zhang and lampe 1999 the reason was that the dissolution rate of siderite is very slow the dissolution rate of siderite was measured on powder at 25 c close to 1 14 10 3 mol m 2 h 1 at ph 1 5 and decreases to 8 06 10 6 mol m 2 h 1 as ph increases to 6 duckworth and martin 2004 and neutralization potential value of siderite was only 20 of that of limestone haney et al 2006 the more the siderite the less the ph decreased fig 1f therefore in order to buffer the same sad more siderite was needed than limestone accumulation of no2 occurred in the ssad and the faster the denitrification rate the earlier the peak of no2 accumulation occurred fig 1b which was also found in our previous study on pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification zhang et al 2019 with no3 reduction nh4 was consumed fig 1c and so4 2 was produced fig 1 e until denitrification finished and the more the denitrification the more nh4 consumed and so4 2 produced in the experiment of sulfur siderite ratio 1 3 as the denitrification finished the molar ratio of δno3 δnh4 was 14 77 which was a little bigger than that of the stoichiometric value of equation 1 and 12 5 and the no3 so4 2 077 was smaller than that of stoichiometric value of equation 1 and 0 91 the differences could be attributed to denitrification based on fe2 released from siderite equation 4 and sulfur oxidation based on the residue o2 in the water the variations of no3 no2 nh4 so4 2 and ph were similar to those in the slad wang et al 2016 3 2 the ssad column for simultaneous no3 and po4 3 removal three column reactors r1 r2 and r3 with sulfur siderite ratio 1 1 1 3 and 0 1 respectively were continuously operated for 122 days after the biofilm culture finished the whole operation period was divided into 6 phases as shown in table 1 phases 1 2 3 and phases 4 5 6 were set to investigate the effects of hrt influent no3 n on the ssad performance respectively fig 2 shows that during phases 1 2 and 3 no3 n no2 n and nh4 n in the r3 effluent were the same as those in the influent namely no denitrification occurred in the r3 the column experiments indicated that sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers could not use siderite as electron donor to reduce no3 which was in agreement with the results of batch experiments due to po4 3 adsorption saturation during biofilm culture siderite in the r3 did not adsorb any more po4 3 during phases 1 2 and 3 therefore r3 did not show any po4 3 removal performance fig 2 d in a short time after the hrt changed from 24 h to 12 h and from 12 to 6 h po4 3 in the effluent was even higher than the influent the reason was that po4 3 on the siderite was rinsed out of r3 in a short time of the water flow becoming faster we stopped operation of r3 after phase 3 because no denitrification and no po4 3 removal occurred in the r3 during phases 1 and 2 r2 completely removed no3 and no no2 was detected in the effluent during phase 3 as operation of r2 was stable effluent no3 n and no2 n were 8 72 1 94 and 5 63 1 44 mg l respectively and the ton no3 n no2 n removal decreased to 48 75 therefore longer hrt made the ssad obtain higher no3 removal r1 had the same denitrification performance as r2 during phase 1 but worse than r2 during phases 2 and 3 it indicated that the denitrification rate of sulfur siderite ratio 1 3 was faster than that of sulfur siderite ratio 1 1 which was in agreement with the batch experiments r2 could completely remove ton as the influent no3 n was 28 mg l at hrt 12 h however treating the same wastewater the slad system with sulfur limestone ratio 3 1 usually needed hrt 1 3 h wan et al 2017 it was due to weaker ph buffer ability of siderite than that of limestone actually effluent ph of r1 and r2 were 5 8 and 6 3 respectively on average at phase 1 after 76 days operation the operation conditions of phase 4 returned to those of phase 1 and then both r1 and r2 regained the denitrification performances of phase 1 it demonstrated that denitrification performance of the ssad system was very stable as the influent no3 n increased to be 60 and 100 mg l during phases 5 and 6 respectively the ton removed was 50 43 and 63 08 mg l for r1 and 59 40 and 79 96 mg l for r2 respectively as the other operation conditions were the same the more the influent no3 n the more the no3 n removed for the ssad system higher influent no3 n was beneficial to growth of autotrophic denitrifiers accordingly more autotrophic denitrifiers increased denitrification rate qambrani et al 2015 whenever the hrt was too short or the initial no3 was too high there was no2 residue in the effluent fig 2b nh4 was consumedin the r1 and r2 and nh4 removed increased with increasing no3 removed with about 14 δno3 δnh4 during phase 4 and 5 fig 2c which was in agreement with the batch experiments during phase 6 nh4 was completely removed for nh4 was in shortage according to the stoichiometric value of equation 1 however during phase 1 2 and 3 nh4 removed decreased it was possibly due to nh4 released from the decay of dead bacteria increasing as hrt was 24 12 and 6 h averaged effluent po4 3 p was 0 72 0 31 1 26 0 32 and1 67 0 27 mg l for r1 and 0 60 0 07 mg l 1 02 0 13 and 1 24 0 16 mg l for r2 respectively as the operation was stable fig 2 d po4 3 removal of r1 was lower than that of r2 due to lower no3 removal as initial no3 n was 60 and 100 mg l no po4 3 p was detected in the effluents of r1 and r2 it indicated that po4 3 removal was related to the amount of no3 removed in the ssad more no3 removed made more iron ions released and then more po4 3 precipitated po4 3 retained in the r1 and r2 was also rinsed out in a short time of the water flow becoming faster thus peaks of po4 3 occurring in fig 2d precipitate in the effluent of r2 was collected and analyzed with xrd fig s4 and xrf table s1 xrd shows that the precipitates were amorphous and contained 18 67 p2o5 and 11 40 fe2o5 therefore po4 3 was mainly removed through fepo4 precipitate the precipitates from the ssad contained p2o5 so high that it could be used as fertilizer vohla et al 2011 3 3 the ssad pilot biofilter for no3 and po4 3 removal the ssad pb started during jul sept 2017 with the same inoculum and method as the ssad column then the ssad pb was operated continuously for 401 days the whole operation was divided into 3 phases and hrts of phase 1 2 3 were 12 8 and 4 h respectively fig 3 shows the results of the ssad pb operation during phase 1 2 and 3 the average no3 n in influent and effluent and its removal were 22 7 2 8 8 0 2 3 mg l 64 6 9 8 15 0 5 3 2 1 2 8 mg l 86 8 15 8 12 8 5 0 3 8 2 1 mg l 67 7 20 0 respectively fig 3a due to the lower the water temperature fig 3f and higher influent no3 concentration during phase 1 its no3 removal was the lowest in the 3 phases though hrt of phase 1 was the longest tn removals fig 3b during phase 1 2 and 3 were 58 5 9 0 55 6 16 9 and 60 0 15 3 respectively they have not obvious difference because of effects of influent no3 temperature and hrt as shown in fig 3c the average po4 3 p in the influent and effluent and its removal were 0 60 0 34 0 02 0 06 mg l 95 5 15 6 0 75 0 94 0 30 0 54 mg l 72 8 28 5 0 54 0 31 0 22 0 19 mg l 60 8 32 1 during phases 1 2 3 respectively po4 3 removed decreased during phases 1 2 and 3 because no3 removed decreased tp removal during phases 1 2 and 3 were 53 7 21 5 46 9 25 8 and 41 3 30 1 which were smaller than those of po4 3 p removal in each phase po4 3 removed was quite similar to the tp removed it indicated that the ssad removed po4 3 effectively but the other phosphorus forms weakly during the whole operation of 401 days no blocking occurred in the ssad pb and no3 n removal rate even increased and po4 3 p removal had some decrease but effluent po4 3 p kept below 0 3 mg l stably the influent and effluent cod waved between 60 and 90 mg l and it clearly indicated n removal was not based on heterotrophic denitrification ph decreased a little after the wastewater was treated by the ssad pb which further supported sulfur autotrophic denitrification in the ssad pb 3 4 mechanisms of no3 and po4 3 removal in the ssad system 3 4 1 shifts of water quality along the ssad column fig 4 shows shifts of no3 n no2 n nh4 n po4 3 p so4 2 and cod along column height of r1 r2 and r3 at day 76 along the whole column of r3 these indexes did not changed with height which further indicated that sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers could not use siderite as electron donor to reduce no3 fig 4a and d shows that no3 n and po4 3 p deceased with increasing column height in the r1 and r2 and they decreased faster in r2 than in r1 no2 n peaked at height 160 and 80 mm in r1 and r2 respectively and then was removed completely with height further increasing fig 4b therefore in order to avoid no2 residue in the effluent of the ssad reactor enough hrt was necessary with no3 removed nh4 n consumed fig 4c and so4 2 produced fig 4e but between height 420 mm and 500 mm of the r1 and r2 so4 2 decreased little which was resulted from so4 2 reduction it was also observed in the pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification biofilter zhang et al 2019 though there was no cod in the influent cod peaked at height 100 mm for both r1 and r2 and then decreased with height further increasing the cod might be from the decay of dead bacteria more bacteria grew in the height 0 80 mm than in the height 80 500 mm of r1 and r2 so cod released from bacteria increased and peaked around height 100 mm and possibly cod in the r1 and r2 was consumed by heterotrophic denitrification and so4 2 reduction so it decreased above 100 mm 3 4 2 investigation of surface of sulfur and siderite particle in the ssad reactor before operation of r1 r2 and r3 biofilm was cultured with inoculum whose microbial communities were shown in our previous study zhang et al 2019 sulfurimonas 97 2 and thiobacillus 0 80 were the predominant bacteria in the inoculum sulfur and siderite were collected from outlets 3 of r1 r2 and r3 as biofilm culture finished and from outlets 1 3 and 5 of r1 and r2 at day 121of operation and of the ssad pb at days 80 and 401 for sem observation and microbial community analyses as shown in fig s5 bacteria were not found on the surface of original sulfur and siderite many bacteria attached on the sulfur and siderite of r1 r2 and r3 after biofilm culture finished etching pit on the sulfur particle from r2 fig s5e indicated that autotrophic denitrifiers used sulfur as electron donor during biofilm culture after operated 121 days sem pictures show that biofilm was still on the sulfur and siderite from r1 fig s6 and r2 fig 5 i and some second mineral attached on the particles fig 5i f more bacteria was at the bottom of r2 fig 5i a and b than at the top of r2 fig 5i e and f and secondary mineral in ball shape in fig 5i f occurred at the top of r2 the secondary mineral in ball shape was mainly fes according to the eds fig s7 it implied that fe2 released from siderite reacted with s2 which supported the so4 2 reduction fig 3e it implied that siderite was utilized as carbon resource and ph buffer in the ssad system the etching pit observed in fig s5e also occurred fig 5i c in the sulfur from outlet 3 of r2 which was the direct evidence that autotrophic denitrifiers used sulfur as electron donor figs 5ii a and b show that biofilm formed as start up of the ssad pb finished etching pits occurred in the sulfur from outlets 1 3 and 5 of the ssad pb fig 5ii c e g respectively at day 80 and the sulfur from outlet 3 at day 401 even became hollow out fig s9a there were products in small ball shape on the surface of siderite fig s8 eds indicated that they were mainly elemental sulfur which should be ascribed to so4 2 reduction 3 4 3 microbial communities in the ssad reactors fig s10shows the relative abundances of microbial communities in r1 r2 and r3 on genus level after start up just finished and genera with abundance above 0 5 though biofilm in the r1 r2 and r3 were cultured with the same medium and inoculum the microbial communities of them were quite different from each other in the r1 r2 and r3 thiobacillus were 65 2 78 0 20 0 and sulfurimonas were 14 8 20 5 50 3 respectively in r3 thiobacillus were much smaller and sulfurimonas much more than those in r1 and r2 it indicated that higher abundance of thiobacillus and sulfurimonas were associated with reactor with more sulfur and more iron containing materials respectively after the ssad columns were operated 121 days thiobacillus and sulfurimonas were still dominant bacteria in r1 fig s11 and r2 fig 6 a and abundance of thiobacillus was more than that of sulfurimonas in both r1 and r2 therefore r1 and r2 keep good autotrophic denitrification performance during the whole operation thiobacillus were 67 8 43 2 51 2 and sulfurimonas were20 0 27 9 3 9 at outlets 1 3 and 5 of r2 respectively in our previous study about pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification biofilter zhang et al 2019 sulfurimonas was also very low at top of the column where no3 n was low it indicated again that sulfurimonas was associated with higher no3 n however in the ssad pb bacterial communities were quite different from those in the ssad columns fig 6b the number of genus 0 5 in the ssad pb were even smaller than that in the ssad column sulfurimonas was the first abundant and 29 4 67 2 and 49 1 at outlets 1 3 and 5 respectively ferritrophicum not occurred in fig 6a became the second abundant and were 15 2 19 2 and 35 5 at outlets 1 3 and 5 respectively thiobacillus became the third abundant and 10 4 4 3 and 1 8 at outlets 1 3 and 5 respectively ferritrophicum is a neutrophilic microaerophilic iron oxidizing bacteria thriving at lower oxygen conditions laroche et al 2018 with wastewater flowing up fe2 concentration increased which made ferritrophicum increase from the bottom to the top of the ssad pb abundance shifts of sulfurimonas and thiobacillus in the ssad pb were different from those in the ssad columns due to huge difference between synthetic and true wastewater but sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers mainly sulfurimonas and thiobacillus were still the dominant most of other bacteria in the ssad pb were related with oxidation reduction of s fe and n 4 conclusions in this study sulfur siderite autotrophic denitrification system was formed and tested through batch column and pilot experiment in the ssad system siderite was used as an inorganic carbon source and ph buffer sulfur was used as an electron donor to reduce no3 to n2 po4 3 was removed through iron phosphate precipitate thus no3 and po4 3 were simultaneous removed in the ssad system in the bottom of ssad column treating synthetic wastewater the main bacteria were thiobacillus 67 8 sulfurimonas 20 0 and simplicispira 3 5 in the bottom of ssad pilot biofilter treating secondary effluent the main bacteria were sulfurimonas 29 4 ferritrophicum 15 2 and thiobacillus 10 3 siderite itself was not found to be used as an electron donor by the sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers but fe2 released form siderite provided additional electron donor for nitrate reduction in the ssad system the optimal volume ratio of sulfur and siderite was 1 3 for the ssad system the ssad column removed 28 mg l no3 n and 3 1 mg l po4 3 p completely at 12 h hrt treating secondary effluent from wwtp of chemical industry the ssad the ssad pilot biofilter could control no3 n and po4 3 p around 4 and 0 2 mg l respectively at 4 h hrt in 401 days the ssad pilot biofilter kept stable no3 and po4 3 removal and no blocking occurred the ssad system was a promising

18723,siderite feco3 is one kind of abundant and cheap carbonate minerals but it has never been used as inorganic carbon sources and ph buffer in the sulfur autotrophic denitrification before in this study sulfur siderite autotrophic denitrification ssad system was formed batch column and pilot experiments of the ssad system showed that siderite could provide inorganic sources and ph buffer for sulfur autotrophic denitrification the optimal volume ratio of sulfur and siderite was 1 3 for the ssad system siderite could not be used as an electron donor by the sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers the ssad column removed 28 mg l no3 n and 3 1 mg l po4 3 p completely at 12 h hrt the ssad pilot biofilter during treating secondary effluent obtained stable no3 and po4 3 removal and controlled effluent no3 n and po4 3 p around 4 and 0 2 mg l respectively at 4 h hrt and no blocking occurred in operation of 401 days in the ssad system the main bacteria were thiobacillus 67 8 sulfurimonas 20 0 and simplicispira 3 5 and sulfurimonas 29 4 ferritrophicum 15 2 and thiobacillus 10 3 during treating synthetic wastewater and secondary effluent respectively po4 3 was removed through iron phosphate precipitate the ssad system was a promising way to remove no3 and po4 3 simultaneously from wastewater lack of organic carbon sources graphical abstract image 1 keywords siderite inorganic carbon sources sulfur autotrophic denitrification simultaneous nitrate and phosphate removal pilot experiment 1 introduction eutrophication is recognized as the most important global water quality problem smith and schindler 2009 excessive external nutrients inputs to water bodies are the main causes downing 2014 water quality improvement requires reductions in both nitrogen n and phosphorus p inputs to water bodies conley et al 2009 usually environmental thresholds for nutrients to protect water bodies from eutrophication were about 0 2 mg l total nitrogen tn and 0 02 mg l total phosphorus tp chambers et al 2012 according to the national discharge standard of pollutants for wastewater treatment plants wwtps gb 18918 2002 in china tn and tp must be below 15 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively therefore the effluent from wwtps meeting these requirements can t prevent receiving water bodies from eutrophication wang 2002 further reducing n and p of effluent from wwtps is needed but the costs of doing this are substantial hence cost effective technologies for simultaneous n and p removal are of huge demand with low costs low sludge production and no need for external carbon sources in

used in the sad the sulfur limestone autotrophic denitrification slad proceeds in accordance with the stoichiometric equation as follows bezbaruah and zhang 2003 1 55 s 50 n o 3 38 h 2 o 20 c o 2 4 n

removal was no more than 60 li et al 2014 for the ph of the effluent from the slad process was not the optimal ph for formation of calcium phosphate precipitate wang and nancollas 2008 siderite feco3 is one kind of abundant and cheap carbonate minerals in china and usually used as iron ore but few siderite reserves were used up to now for lower iron grade yang et al 2018 siderite can react with h as the follows haney et al 2006 3 fec o 3 2 h f e 2 c o 2 h 2 o moreover fe2 can be oxidized by no3 through sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers as the follow li et al 2016 4 n o 3 5 f e 2 6 h 1 2 n 2 5 f e 3 3 h 2 o fe2 and fe3 are usually used for po4 3 removal in a wastewater treatment so we had the assumption that siderite could take the place of limestone in the slad to form sulfur siderite autotrophic denitrification ssad system in which siderite buffers ph and provides inorganic carbon source for autotrophic denitrication and the released iron ions used as reagents of p removal siderite is usually used as adsorbent to remove as and cd wang and reardon 2001 hg ha et al 2016 f liu et al 2010 pb mehmeterdem 2005 cr erdem et al 2004 from wastewater recently it was studied for electron donor of fe ii oxidizing denitrifiers to simultaneously remove nitrate and phosphate from wastewater with low c n ratio but the siderite driven autotrophic denitrification was very limited yang et al 2018 zhu et al zhu et al 2018 studied coupled sulfur and fe ii carbonate driven autotrophic denitrification but they did not pay attention to simultaneous nitrate and phosphate to our knowledge ssad system has never been studied for simultaneous nitrate and phosphate removal before in this study the ssad system was constructed the aims of this study were to investigate feasibility of the ssad performances and mechanisms of the ssad for simultaneous nitrate and phosphate removal from wastewater with low c n ratio and microbial community structure in the ssad this study will help to understand the ssad system and develop a novel nutrients removal technology for eutrophication control 2 materials and methods 2 1 siderite and sulfur characteristics siderite was obtained from a mine located in shaanxi province china and was pulverized in a jaw crusher and sieved into particles of 0 25 0 83 and 2 5 mm for batch and column experiments respectively sulfur 99 6 was purchased from zhengzhou henan province china with particle size of 2 2 36 mm and 2 5 mm for batch and column experiments respectively siderite of 0 25 0 83 mm were placed in a 10 v v hcl solution for 2 h for the removal of oxides formed on the surface and then in 75 v v of ethanol solution for 12 h and rinsed with deionized water until the ph of the rinse reached 7 0 1 sulfur of 2 2 36 mm were also placed in 75 v v of ethanol solution for 12 h and then rinsed with deionized water the clean siderite and sulfur particles were dried at 20 c in a vacuum drying oven for 24 h and subsequently stored in airtight bags which were flushed with nitrogen gas to prevent oxidation the siderite sample for xrf analysis was ground into powder and then analyzed according to the manufacturer s instruction arl 9800xp arl switzerland the x ray fluorescence xrf analysis identified the chemical composition of the siderite as follows fe2o3 34 7 sio2 40 1 al2o3 16 2 k2o 0 74 mgo 0 34 mno 0 99 cao 0 34 so3 0 51 x ray diffraction x tra arl switzerland analysis indicates that the siderite mineral was composed of siderite and quartz mineral phases fig s1 2 2 enrichment of autotrophic denitrifiers before the experiments autotrophic denitrifiers were enriched from anaerobic sludge of local wastewater treatment plant the enrichment procedure and culturing of biofilm in the ssad can be found in our previous research li et al 2016 after the enrichment of biomass was successful the biomass in 100 ml of the culturing solution was harvested by centrifugation washed with deionized water resuspended in deionized water of 100 ml and used as the inoculum for batch experiments 2 3 batch experiments 20 g of siderite 0 25 0 83 mm and sulfur 2 2 36 mm with different sulfur siderite volume ratios v v 0 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 7 inoculum 3 5 ml and synthetic wastewater 50 ml were added to 60 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes sarstedt ltd germany one control without siderite and sulfur was used to correct for no3 loss not associated with the ssad and the other without inoculum to monitor possible abiotic siderite and sulfur oxidation coupled to no3 reduction synthetic wastewater used in this study was composed of 0 202 g l 1 kno3 0 027 g l 1 kh2po4 0 050 g l 1 nh4cl 0 050 g l 1 mgcl2 6h2o if not specifically indicated the concentrations of no3 n and po4 3 p in the synthetic wastewater were 28 mg l 1 and 6 2 mg l 1 respectively all the chemicals and reagents used in the experiments were analytical grade for the controls without the inoculum 3 5 ml of deionized water was added instead of the inoculum the plastic centrifuge tubes filled with synthetic wastewater inoculum siderite and sulfur were flushed with n2 for 120 s to exclude air from the solution and headspace sealed and placed on a rotator for mixing in a thermostatic chamber the temperature was kept at 30 c during the batch experiments which lasted for 36 days three tubes were taken out from the rotator for sampling every 2 days three tubes for the control without siderite and sulfur were kept in the rotator until the end of each set of batch experiment and water quality indices of the control without siderite and sulfur were considered as initial values of water quality for the ssad all batch experiments were carried out in triplicate and the average data and standard deviation are presented 2 4 column and pilot experiments three glass columns r1 r2 and r3 fig s2 were established as the anaerobic up flow fixed bed reactors each column had an internal diameter of 10 cm a height of 50 cm and a packed height of the siderite and sulfur particles 2 5 mm of 48 cm the volume ratios of sulfur and siderite particles were 1 1 1 3 and 0 1 for r1 r2 and r3 with a porosity of 45 40 and 40 respectively the calculating method of hydraulic retention time hrt was described in our previous research li et al 2016 five sampling outlets o 1 o 5 located on the column at heights of 90 170 250 330 410 mm from the bottom of the column respectively were used for water and media sampling for further analysis effluent outlet o 6 was located on the column at the height of 500 mm from the bottom of the column after biofilm culture finished as our previous study zhang et al 2019 li et al 2014 the ssad columns were fed with synthetic wastewater which was prepared with tap water kh2po4 kno3 and nh4cl with 28 no3 n mg l 1 3 1 mg l po4 3 p and 4 mg l 1 nh4 n the whole operation time lasted 122 days at room temperature 20 25 c the ssad pilot biofilter ssad pb 1300 1300 2600 mm longth width height with volume of siderite and sulfur 2 5 m3 1300 1300 1500 mm was constructed and there were five outlets for sampling too fig s3 both siderite and sulfur particle size was 2 5 mm and volume ratio of sulfur and siderite was 1 3 the same as the r2 the start up of the ssad pb was the same as the column experiment after the start up finished the ssad pb was continuously fed with the second effluent of a wwtp for chemical industry wastewater from 25 oct 2017 to 15 dec 2018 2 5 sampling and analysis water samples were got from the ssad columns and ssad pb once per 2 or 4 days after water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filter paper the concentrations of no3 n no2 n and so4 2 in the filtrates were measured with ion chromatography mp551 ton no3 n no2 n nh4 and po4 3 p were determined according to the standard methods mep ministry of environmental protection of people s republic of china 2002 ph values were measured with a ph meter wtw 340 germany when measuring metal concentrations in water samples the filtrates were acidified to 1 using nitric acid hno3 trace metal grade 67 69 fisher uk and metal concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms elan drce perkinelmer waltham usa in a class 1000 iso class 6 cleanroom staunton et al 2014 sulfur and siderite samples taken from o 1 o 3 and o 5 of the ssad column and ssad pb were treated following

omega bio tek norcross ga u s following the manufacturer s instructions to determine the final dna concentration and purification nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa was used and dna quality was checked by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis then pcr was conducted and high throughput sequencing was finished on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa the detailed steps were described in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 feasibility of the ssad system for simultaneous nitrate and phosphate removal feasibility of the ssad system for simultaneous nitrate and phosphate removal was tested through batch experiments with different sulfur siderite volume ratios no denitrification occurred in the two control experiments without sulfur and siderite and without the inoculum it demonstrated that the ssad was the only way to remove no3 in the experiments in the experiments of sulfur siderite ratio 0 1 no3 fig 1 a no2 fig 1 b nh4 fig 1 c so4 2 fig 1 e and ph fig 1 f kept stable during the experiment it indicated that sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers could not use siderite as electron donor to reduce no3 though they could use pyrrhotite li et al 2016 pyrite jorgensen et al 2009 and fe2 to reduce no3 yang yang et al 2018 found that siderite could be used as an electron donor by fe ii oxidizing denitrifiers the strain pxl1 but the denitrification rate was very slow no denitrification occurred in the experiment of sulfur siderite ratio 0 1 but po4 3 was effectively removed and even the po4 3 removal rate was the fastest among all sulfur siderite ratio experiments fig 1 d the reason was that siderite is po4 3 adsorbent zhang et al 2017 and the amount of siderite in the sulfur siderite ratio 0 1 was the most among the sulfur siderite ratios studied except the sulfur siderite ratio 0 1 in the experiments of all other sulfur siderite ratios no3 and po4 3 fig 1 a and d respectively were effectively removed from wastewater which demonstrated that the ssad was feasible to simultaneously remove no3 and po4 3 from wastewater among the sulfur siderite ratios studied the order of denitrification rate was 1 3 1 1 1 2 1 7 fig 1a as the total weight of sulfur and siderite remained unchanged more sulfur was beneficial to denitrification but less siderite was unfavorable to buffer ph fig 1 f and provide inorganic carbon source thus the optimal sulfur siderite ratio was 1 3 however in the slad the optimal sulfur limestone ratio was 3 1 zhang and lampe 1999 the reason was that the dissolution rate of siderite is very slow the dissolution rate of siderite was measured on powder at 25 c close to 1 14 10 3 mol m 2 h 1 at ph 1 5 and decreases to 8 06 10 6 mol m 2 h 1 as ph increases to 6 duckworth and martin 2004 and neutralization potential value of siderite was only 20 of that of limestone haney et al 2006 the more the siderite the less the ph decreased fig 1f therefore in order to buffer the same sad more siderite was needed than limestone accumulation of no2 occurred in the ssad and the faster the denitrification rate the earlier the peak of no2 accumulation occurred fig 1b which was also found in our previous study on pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification zhang et al 2019 with no3 reduction nh4 was consumed fig 1c and so4 2 was produced fig 1 e until denitrification finished and the more the denitrification the more nh4 consumed and so4 2 produced in the experiment of sulfur siderite ratio 1 3 as the denitrification finished the molar ratio of δno3 δnh4 was 14 77 which was a little bigger than that of the stoichiometric value of equation 1 and 12 5 and the no3 so4 2 077 was smaller than that of stoichiometric value of equation 1 and 0 91 the differences could be attributed to denitrification based on fe2 released from siderite equation 4 and sulfur oxidation based on the residue o2 in the water the variations of no3 no2 nh4 so4 2 and ph were similar to those in the slad wang et al 2016 3 2 the ssad column for simultaneous no3 and po4 3 removal three column reactors r1 r2 and r3 with sulfur siderite ratio 1 1 1 3 and 0 1 respectively were continuously operated for 122 days after the biofilm culture finished the whole operation period was divided into 6 phases as shown in table 1 phases 1 2 3 and phases 4 5 6 were set to investigate the effects of hrt influent no3 n on the ssad performance respectively fig 2 shows that during phases 1 2 and 3 no3 n no2 n and nh4 n in the r3 effluent were the same as those in the influent namely no denitrification occurred in the r3 the column experiments indicated that sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers could not use siderite as electron donor to reduce no3 which was in agreement with the results of batch experiments due to po4 3 adsorption saturation during biofilm culture siderite in the r3 did not adsorb any more po4 3 during phases 1 2 and 3 therefore r3 did not show any po4 3 removal performance fig 2 d in a short time after the hrt changed from 24 h to 12 h and from 12 to 6 h po4 3 in the effluent was even higher than the influent the reason was that po4 3 on the siderite was rinsed out of r3 in a short time of the water flow becoming faster we stopped operation of r3 after phase 3 because no denitrification and no po4 3 removal occurred in the r3 during phases 1 and 2 r2 completely removed no3 and no no2 was detected in the effluent during phase 3 as operation of r2 was stable effluent no3 n and no2 n were 8 72 1 94 and 5 63 1 44 mg l respectively and the ton no3 n no2 n removal decreased to 48 75 therefore longer hrt made the ssad obtain higher no3 removal r1 had the same denitrification performance as r2 during phase 1 but worse than r2 during phases 2 and 3 it indicated that the denitrification rate of sulfur siderite ratio 1 3 was faster than that of sulfur siderite ratio 1 1 which was in agreement with the batch experiments r2 could completely remove ton as the influent no3 n was 28 mg l at hrt 12 h however treating the same wastewater the slad system with sulfur limestone ratio 3 1 usually needed hrt 1 3 h wan et al 2017 it was due to weaker ph buffer ability of siderite than that of limestone actually effluent ph of r1 and r2 were 5 8 and 6 3 respectively on average at phase 1 after 76 days operation the operation conditions of phase 4 returned to those of phase 1 and then both r1 and r2 regained the denitrification performances of phase 1 it demonstrated that denitrification performance of the ssad system was very stable as the influent no3 n increased to be 60 and 100 mg l during phases 5 and 6 respectively the ton removed was 50 43 and 63 08 mg l for r1 and 59 40 and 79 96 mg l for r2 respectively as the other operation conditions were the same the more the influent no3 n the more the no3 n removed for the ssad system higher influent no3 n was beneficial to growth of autotrophic denitrifiers accordingly more autotrophic denitrifiers increased denitrification rate qambrani et al 2015 whenever the hrt was too short or the initial no3 was too high there was no2 residue in the effluent fig 2b nh4 was consumedin the r1 and r2 and nh4 removed increased with increasing no3 removed with about 14 δno3 δnh4 during phase 4 and 5 fig 2c which was in agreement with the batch experiments during phase 6 nh4 was completely removed for nh4 was in shortage according to the stoichiometric value of equation 1 however during phase 1 2 and 3 nh4 removed decreased it was possibly due to nh4 released from the decay of dead bacteria increasing as hrt was 24 12 and 6 h averaged effluent po4 3 p was 0 72 0 31 1 26 0 32 and1 67 0 27 mg l for r1 and 0 60 0 07 mg l 1 02 0 13 and 1 24 0 16 mg l for r2 respectively as the operation was stable fig 2 d po4 3 removal of r1 was lower than that of r2 due to lower no3 removal as initial no3 n was 60 and 100 mg l no po4 3 p was detected in the effluents of r1 and r2 it indicated that po4 3 removal was related to the amount of no3 removed in the ssad more no3 removed made more iron ions released and then more po4 3 precipitated po4 3 retained in the r1 and r2 was also rinsed out in a short time of the water flow becoming faster thus peaks of po4 3 occurring in fig 2d precipitate in the effluent of r2 was collected and analyzed with xrd fig s4 and xrf table s1 xrd shows that the precipitates were amorphous and contained 18 67 p2o5 and 11 40 fe2o5 therefore po4 3 was mainly removed through fepo4 precipitate the precipitates from the ssad contained p2o5 so high that it could be used as fertilizer vohla et al 2011 3 3 the ssad pilot biofilter for no3 and po4 3 removal the ssad pb started during jul sept 2017 with the same inoculum and method as the ssad column then the ssad pb was operated continuously for 401 days the whole operation was divided into 3 phases and hrts of phase 1 2 3 were 12 8 and 4 h respectively fig 3 shows the results of the ssad pb operation during phase 1 2 and 3 the average no3 n in influent and effluent and its removal were 22 7 2 8 8 0 2 3 mg l 64 6 9 8 15 0 5 3 2 1 2 8 mg l 86 8 15 8 12 8 5 0 3 8 2 1 mg l 67 7 20 0 respectively fig 3a due to the lower the water temperature fig 3f and higher influent no3 concentration during phase 1 its no3 removal was the lowest in the 3 phases though hrt of phase 1 was the longest tn removals fig 3b during phase 1 2 and 3 were 58 5 9 0 55 6 16 9 and 60 0 15 3 respectively they have not obvious difference because of effects of influent no3 temperature and hrt as shown in fig 3c the average po4 3 p in the influent and effluent and its removal were 0 60 0 34 0 02 0 06 mg l 95 5 15 6 0 75 0 94 0 30 0 54 mg l 72 8 28 5 0 54 0 31 0 22 0 19 mg l 60 8 32 1 during phases 1 2 3 respectively po4 3 removed decreased during phases 1 2 and 3 because no3 removed decreased tp removal during phases 1 2 and 3 were 53 7 21 5 46 9 25 8 and 41 3 30 1 which were smaller than those of po4 3 p removal in each phase po4 3 removed was quite similar to the tp removed it indicated that the ssad removed po4 3 effectively but the other phosphorus forms weakly during the whole operation of 401 days no blocking occurred in the ssad pb and no3 n removal rate even increased and po4 3 p removal had some decrease but effluent po4 3 p kept below 0 3 mg l stably the influent and effluent cod waved between 60 and 90 mg l and it clearly indicated n removal was not based on heterotrophic denitrification ph decreased a little after the wastewater was treated by the ssad pb which further supported sulfur autotrophic denitrification in the ssad pb 3 4 mechanisms of no3 and po4 3 removal in the ssad system 3 4 1 shifts of water quality along the ssad column fig 4 shows shifts of no3 n no2 n nh4 n po4 3 p so4 2 and cod along column height of r1 r2 and r3 at day 76 along the whole column of r3 these indexes did not changed with height which further indicated that sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers could not use siderite as electron donor to reduce no3 fig 4a and d shows that no3 n and po4 3 p deceased with increasing column height in the r1 and r2 and they decreased faster in r2 than in r1 no2 n peaked at height 160 and 80 mm in r1 and r2 respectively and then was removed completely with height further increasing fig 4b therefore in order to avoid no2 residue in the effluent of the ssad reactor enough hrt was necessary with no3 removed nh4 n consumed fig 4c and so4 2 produced fig 4e but between height 420 mm and 500 mm of the r1 and r2 so4 2 decreased little which was resulted from so4 2 reduction it was also observed in the pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification biofilter zhang et al 2019 though there was no cod in the influent cod peaked at height 100 mm for both r1 and r2 and then decreased with height further increasing the cod might be from the decay of dead bacteria more bacteria grew in the height 0 80 mm than in the height 80 500 mm of r1 and r2 so cod released from bacteria increased and peaked around height 100 mm and possibly cod in the r1 and r2 was consumed by heterotrophic denitrification and so4 2 reduction so it decreased above 100 mm 3 4 2 investigation of surface of sulfur and siderite particle in the ssad reactor before operation of r1 r2 and r3 biofilm was cultured with inoculum whose microbial communities were shown in our previous study zhang et al 2019 sulfurimonas 97 2 and thiobacillus 0 80 were the predominant bacteria in the inoculum sulfur and siderite were collected from outlets 3 of r1 r2 and r3 as biofilm culture finished and from outlets 1 3 and 5 of r1 and r2 at day 121of operation and of the ssad pb at days 80 and 401 for sem observation and microbial community analyses as shown in fig s5 bacteria were not found on the surface of original sulfur and siderite many bacteria attached on the sulfur and siderite of r1 r2 and r3 after biofilm culture finished etching pit on the sulfur particle from r2 fig s5e indicated that autotrophic denitrifiers used sulfur as electron donor during biofilm culture after operated 121 days sem pictures show that biofilm was still on the sulfur and siderite from r1 fig s6 and r2 fig 5 i and some second mineral attached on the particles fig 5i f more bacteria was at the bottom of r2 fig 5i a and b than at the top of r2 fig 5i e and f and secondary mineral in ball shape in fig 5i f occurred at the top of r2 the secondary mineral in ball shape was mainly fes according to the eds fig s7 it implied that fe2 released from siderite reacted with s2 which supported the so4 2 reduction fig 3e it implied that siderite was utilized as carbon resource and ph buffer in the ssad system the etching pit observed in fig s5e also occurred fig 5i c in the sulfur from outlet 3 of r2 which was the direct evidence that autotrophic denitrifiers used sulfur as electron donor figs 5ii a and b show that biofilm formed as start up of the ssad pb finished etching pits occurred in the sulfur from outlets 1 3 and 5 of the ssad pb fig 5ii c e g respectively at day 80 and the sulfur from outlet 3 at day 401 even became hollow out fig s9a there were products in small ball shape on the surface of siderite fig s8 eds indicated that they were mainly elemental sulfur which should be ascribed to so4 2 reduction 3 4 3 microbial communities in the ssad reactors fig s10shows the relative abundances of microbial communities in r1 r2 and r3 on genus level after start up just finished and genera with abundance above 0 5 though biofilm in the r1 r2 and r3 were cultured with the same medium and inoculum the microbial communities of them were quite different from each other in the r1 r2 and r3 thiobacillus were 65 2 78 0 20 0 and sulfurimonas were 14 8 20 5 50 3 respectively in r3 thiobacillus were much smaller and sulfurimonas much more than those in r1 and r2 it indicated that higher abundance of thiobacillus and sulfurimonas were associated with reactor with more sulfur and more iron containing materials respectively after the ssad columns were operated 121 days thiobacillus and sulfurimonas were still dominant bacteria in r1 fig s11 and r2 fig 6 a and abundance of thiobacillus was more than that of sulfurimonas in both r1 and r2 therefore r1 and r2 keep good autotrophic denitrification performance during the whole operation thiobacillus were 67 8 43 2 51 2 and sulfurimonas were20 0 27 9 3 9 at outlets 1 3 and 5 of r2 respectively in our previous study about pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification biofilter zhang et al 2019 sulfurimonas was also very low at top of the column where no3 n was low it indicated again that sulfurimonas was associated with higher no3 n however in the ssad pb bacterial communities were quite different from those in the ssad columns fig 6b the number of genus 0 5 in the ssad pb were even smaller than that in the ssad column sulfurimonas was the first abundant and 29 4 67 2 and 49 1 at outlets 1 3 and 5 respectively ferritrophicum not occurred in fig 6a became the second abundant and were 15 2 19 2 and 35 5 at outlets 1 3 and 5 respectively thiobacillus became the third abundant and 10 4 4 3 and 1 8 at outlets 1 3 and 5 respectively ferritrophicum is a neutrophilic microaerophilic iron oxidizing bacteria thriving at lower oxygen conditions laroche et al 2018 with wastewater flowing up fe2 concentration increased which made ferritrophicum increase from the bottom to the top of the ssad pb abundance shifts of sulfurimonas and thiobacillus in the ssad pb were different from those in the ssad columns due to huge difference between synthetic and true wastewater but sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers mainly sulfurimonas and thiobacillus were still the dominant most of other bacteria in the ssad pb were related with oxidation reduction of s fe and n 4 conclusions in this study sulfur siderite autotrophic denitrification system was formed and tested through batch column and pilot experiment in the ssad system siderite was used as an inorganic carbon source and ph buffer sulfur was used as an electron donor to reduce no3 to n2 po4 3 was removed through iron phosphate precipitate thus no3 and po4 3 were simultaneous removed in the ssad system in the bottom of ssad column treating synthetic wastewater the main bacteria were thiobacillus 67 8 sulfurimonas 20 0 and simplicispira 3 5 in the bottom of ssad pilot biofilter treating secondary effluent the main bacteria were sulfurimonas 29 4 ferritrophicum 15 2 and thiobacillus 10 3 siderite itself was not found to be used as an electron donor by the sulfur autotrophic denitrifiers but fe2 released form siderite provided additional electron donor for nitrate reduction in the ssad system the optimal volume ratio of sulfur and siderite was 1 3 for the ssad system the ssad column removed 28 mg l no3 n and 3 1 mg l po4 3 p completely at 12 h hrt treating secondary effluent from wwtp of chemical industry the ssad the ssad pilot biofilter could control no3 n and po4 3 p around 4 and 0 2 mg l respectively at 4 h hrt in 401 days the ssad pilot biofilter kept stable no3 and po4 3 removal and no blocking occurred the ssad system was a promising

18724,a three dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd model was developed to study shear stress induced by spherical cap bubbles in hollow fibre hf membrane modules configured with a packing density of 38 m2 m3 to predict the shear profile in a commercial hollow fibre membrane module of 265 m2 m3 the cfd model s computational effort was minimised by simulating the formation of bubble structures and their rising velocities in modules with packing densities of 1 8 and 38 m2 m3 and validated with experimental calibration of shear profiles via electro diffusion methods edm pulse bubbles 300 ml generated from a single sparger at 0 5 hz produced more satellite bubbles in the wake zone of the leading bubble in high packing density 38 m2 m3 than in low packing density modules 1 8 m2 m3 the bubble rise velocity was approximately 8 lower in the 38 m2 m3 than in the 1 8 m2 m3 module increasing packing density reduced the shear profile from a single sparger and the dispersion of the satellite bubbles in the horizontal plane especially in the upper part of the membrane module for systems with multiple spargers the interaction between pulses generated more shear than the pulses from a single sparger and produced a more uniform shear profile in the module through asynchronous bubble release from adjacent spargers than synchronous release a 33 increase in the zone of influence the flow region where the upward velocity 0 2 m s was achieved by moving from a synchronous to an asynchronous form of aeration graphical abstract image 1 keywords computational fluid dynamics cfd

density μ viscosity τ shear stress 1 introduction the efficient operation of hollow fibre hf membranes in membrane bioreactors mbrs for biological wastewater treatment necessitates optimising the membrane aeration system to induce sufficient tangential surface shear to maintain the filtrate flux while minimising the power consumption judd 2011 membrane aeration systems were originally designed for continuous aeration with coarse 2 10 mm bubbles and subsequently modified to cyclic aeration to reduce power consumption braak et al 2011 buer and cumin 2010 however recently commercial filtration system manufacturers such as suez water technologies solutions and evoqua developed more power efficient systems that release pulse bubbles larger than 50 ml cumin et al 2011 james et al 2012 the efficacy of the pulse aeration compared with coarse aeration has been attributed to the greater fluctuations in shear stress on the membrane surface chan et al 2011 jankhah and bérubé 2014 experimental studies have provided some insight into the factors that influence pulse and coarse bubble behaviour in hf membrane modules abdullah et al 2015 jankhah and bérubé 2013 2014 ye et al 2014 jankhah and bérubé 2013 and jankhah and bérubé 2014 measured the shear stress and fouling rate induced by pulse bubble 150 500 ml and coarse bubble 0 75 2 5 ml in a pilot scale membrane module with 7 membrane fibres in coarse aeration the fouling rate coefficient decreased from 0 002 1 ml to 0 0003 1 ml by only increasing frequency from 0 25 hz to 0 5 hz jankhah and bérubé 2014 while in pulse aeration fouling rate was reduced by controlling both bubble size and frequency for example the fouling rate coefficient decreased from 0 0007 1 ml to 0 0001 1 ml by increasing frequency of 300 ml bubbles from 0 25 hz to 0 5 hz jankhah and bérubé 2014 these observations were interpreted using the new parameter the bubble zone of influence which describes the zone around the membrane where the upward flow velocity was greater than 0 2 m s jankhah and bérubé 2013 direct measurement of flux decline revealed that the rate of fouling inside the zone of influence was lower than outside the zone furthermore the zone of influence in a pulse aeration was larger than coarse aeration system at the same airflow rate 1 l min jankhah and bérubé 2013 detailed investigation of the effect of variables such as bubble size frequency and module packing density membrane area module volume in pulse bubble systems have been based on empirical measurements ye et al 2014 used the electro diffusion method edm to investigate the effects of bubble size and frequency shear stress induced by pulse aeration was measured in small cylinder shaped membrane bundles configured with 40 membrane fibres ye et al 2014 ye et al 2014 found that at constant aeration rate of 3 5 l min smaller pulse bubbles 150 ml at a frequency of 0 39 hz generated a higher root mean square rms shear stress than larger pulse bubbles 250 ml at a lower frequency of 0 39 hz these results provide some insight however the observations were made at low packing density and at frequencies lower than those used for fouling control in commercial systems which range from 0 5 hz to 0 6 hz braak et al 2011 packing densities in commercial hf membrane modules range from 40 to 350 m2 m3 judd 2011 fibre packing density has been reported to significantly influence bubble flow in coarse bubble aeration by increasing the resistance to the liquid flow liu et al 2015 wang et al 2010 furthermore bubble flow is influenced by the interaction of adjacent bubbles that are delivered through multiple ports acuña and finch 2010 rabha and buwa 2010 in pulse bubble systems these interactions include collisions coalescence and break up particularly in the turbulent wake which influences the surface shear and fouling rate radaei et al 2018 consequently it is necessary to extend the study of pulse bubble behaviour to include multiple pulse bubbles spargers in membrane modules with high packing densities unlike traditional experimental techniques cfd modelling has been proven to be a useful tool that can not only evaluate the hydrodynamic behaviour but also predict the overall shear stress profile in full scale mbr modules brannock et al 2010 kang et al 2008 saalbach and hunze 2008 wang et al 2018a b c in previous studies high packed hf membrane modules were simulated either as a solid object ratkovich et al 2012 or as a porous media liu et al 2015 wang et al 2010 in order to minimise the computational effort however these simplifications are not applicable for pulse bubble aeration where the larger bubble size and the production of satellite bubbles due to the bubble break up in the wake zone result in complex bubble fibre interactions which significantly influence shear stress distribution within the module radaei et al 2018 another challenge of simulating pulse aeration in membrane modules with high packing density lies in the complexity of the model s geometry which requires a large number of nodes to describe the fluid domain around every single fibre with the number of nodes increasing exponentially with the increase of packing density in the present study a three dimensional cfd model was developed to investigate pulse bubble behaviour and the induced shear stress distribution in a commercial membrane module with high packing density experimental shear measurements using the edm method böhm et al 2013 were conducted to calibrate the cfd model developed for a reduced number of nodes low packing density to simulate the hydraulic behaviour of commercial membrane modules the cfd model incorporated a rheology function to account for the rheological properties of the activated sludge and a surface force function to account for the effects of surfactants on the bubble shape deformation coalescence collision and breakup of the pulse bubbles in membrane module were simulated via the volume of fluid vof method furthermore the model was used to predict the interaction of pulse bubbles generated in two different bubbling schemes synchronous and asynchronous on the area of influence of pulse bubbles and the shear stress distribution induced in the membrane module 2 methods 2 1 experimental method calibration and validation experiments were conducted in a 360 l plexiglas membrane tank 1 00 m 0 15 m 2 40 m table 1 configured with a commercial zeeweed zw 500d curtain shaped hollow fibre membrane bundle 0 84 m 0 05 m 2 20 m suez water technologies solutions installed 0 1 m above the bottom of the tank z 0 1 m pulse bubble aeration was provided through a pulse bubble sparger located at the bottom of the membrane tank x 0 m y 0 m z 0 m which delivered pulse bubbles with an average volume of approximately 300 ml at a frequency of 0 5 hz equivalent to 0 02 m3 m2 hr specific aeration demand per membrane area shear profiles were measured using edm in an electrolyte solution of 0 003 m ferricyanide 0 006 m ferrocyanide and 0 3 m potassium chloride in deoxygenated dechlorinated tap water 12 membrane fibres were replaced with 1 8 mm diameter teflon tubes containing platinum electrodes 0 5 mm in diameter equally distributed throughout the tank fig 1 the current signal of each electrode was collected at a frequency of 200 hz and logged via labview software version 13 0 the shear stress was calculated based on the quasi steady state leveque relationship sobolik et al 1998 as expressed in equation 1 eq 1 i 0 862 n a f c b d 2 3 d 1 3 τ 1 3 where i is the current

the ions m2 s d is the diameter of the probe m and τ is the shear stress pa the shear probe was calibrated using the ex situ method prior to all experiments as presented in fulton et al 2011 all experiments were conducted at room temperature of 25 0 01 c a complete description of the theory and details of the edm may be found elsewhere bérubé et al 2006 chan et al 2007 fulton et al 2011 mitchell and hanratty 2006 2 2 cfd simulation a three dimensional cfd model was developed using the commercial cfd ansys fluent 17 2 all simulations were performed on the raijin high performance computing facility at the national computational infrastructure nci with four nodes each with 2x 14 core intel xeon e5 2690v4 broadwell 2 6 ghz processors for a total number of 112 cores and 256 gb memory using this system 36 h were required to simulate 1 s of pulse flow and approximately 21 days were required for 14 s 2 2 1 geometry and mesh the computational domain was built based on a full scale membrane cassette configured with the commercial zw500d mbr cassette the curtain shaped membrane bundles were laid out in parallel at a distance of 2 45 cm apart the geometry of each high packed membrane bundle was simplified as having 10 of packing density 38 m2 m3 of the commercial zw500d as calibrated in section 3 1 to reduce the computational effort pulse bubbles were generated through an aeration system that was located at the bottom of the membrane module with the spacing between two adjacent nozzles at 20 cm apart similar to the patent by suez water technologies solutions cumin et al 2011 the computational domain 600 mm 158 mm 2190 mm contained 3 spargers at the bottom of the tank and 3 membrane bundles fig 2 representing a full scale membrane cassette a hexahedron dominated mesh was created for the near membrane zone as well as the flow field in between membrane bundles the inflation method was employed to build the boundary layer with eight inflation layers first layer thickness of 0 1 mm and a growth rate of 1 2 per layer to improve the local resolution of the flow field in membrane bundles the maximum mesh size was set at 3 mm resulting in a total of 32 178 984 elements fig 2 a mesh independence test was conducted by increasing the grid number from 29 102 808 to 37 177 440 using a moderate mesh the grid number of 32 178 984 was obtained and subsequently chosen as the simulated shear stress was within the 4 difference when compared to that obtained when using the finest mesh 37 177 440 grids the mesh was created using a computer machine with intel xeon cpu e5 1630 v3 3 70 ghz and 64 gb memory ram and took approximately 16 h to complete 2 2 2 model setup the pulse bubbles flow in the 38 m2 m3 membrane module was simulated using vof multiphase model which is capable of resolving small scale dynamics around individual bubbles in our previous study the vof showed to be able predict the uprising of pulse bubbles through a liquid phase validated by image analysis of the bubble interface and flow profile including resolution of wake vortices deformation of the bubble shape and bubble bubble interactions such as breakup and coalescence radaei et al 2018 the vof model solves a single set of equations for continuity equation 2 and momentum equation 3 for the two non interpenetrating phases liquid and gas eq 2 ρ t ρ u 0 eq 3 ρ u t ρ uu p μ u ρ g f σ where ρ density μ is viscosity u is velocity p is pressure g is gravity and fσ is the volumetric surface tension force the tracking of the interface between phases is achieved by solving a continuity equation equation 4 for the volume fraction of the primary phase liquid phase eq 4 α l ρ l t α l ρ l u l 0 where the subscript l refers to the liquid phase and α l is the volume fraction of liquid no reaction and no mass transfer between phases were considered the volume fraction α l indicates whether the computational cells contain only liquid α l 1 only gas α l 0 or a mixture of gas and liquid 0 α l 1 details of density viscosity and surface tension force is presented by radaei et al 2018 the realizable k ɛ turbulence model was used to simulate the turbulence flow induced by the uprising pulse bubbles radaei et al 2018 a scalable wall function was employed to simulate the near wall boundary layer liu and schwarz 2009 with details of this method described in our previous paper radaei et al 2018 the activated sludge was simplified as a continuous liquid phase with the experimentally calibrated ostwald de waele rheology model for 8 g l activated sludge with a flow consistency index k 0 0614 pa s0 569 liu et al 2015 radaei et al 2018 employed to represent the rheological properties the mach number for the gas phase is much smaller than 0 3 therefore incompressible air was used to simulate the pulse bubbles a pressure outlet boundary condition was set at the top of the computational domain dhotre et al 2008 and symmetry boundary conditions were set on the four symmetry planes the membrane surface was set as a no slip wall with a roughness of 100 nm for the liquid phase and a free slip smooth wall for the gas phase liu et al 2019 300 ml bubbles at 0 5 hz of frequency were simulated to rise from the bottom of the tank in the middle module the two bubbling schemes for the commercial pulse aeration sparger cumin et al 2011 were synchronous and asynchronous bubbling 1 s delay in bubbling in the middle nozzle with respect to the adjacent nozzles both schemes were investigated to evaluate the impact of bubble interactions on the shear stress distribution in the commercial high packed membrane modules for each bubbling scheme at time zero 300 ml spherical bubbles were patched directly above each nozzle with multiple bubbles being patched at the same location at a time interval of 2 s corresponding to the bubbling period all simulations were performed as transient simulations with a time step of 0 0005 s to ensure that the courant number is smaller than 0 5 keshavarzi et al 2014 the piso algorithm was employed for the pressure velocity coupling method whiles the presto scheme was used for the discretization of the conservation equations table 2 the quick scheme geo reconstruction method and second order upwind scheme were selected to solve the momentum volume fraction and turbulent kinetic energy equations respectively all simulations were converged at 10 4 for each time step the simulation for all cases ran for 14 s which is equivalent to 7 times of bubbling period details of the model setup are summarised in table 2 2 2 3 simulations for validation simulations used for model validation were generated for hydrodynamic conditions in a 360 l pilot scale membrane tank configured with one curtain shaped membrane bundle fig 1s details for the geometry mesh and model setup for this simulation are presented in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental calibration for model development for commercial hf membrane module the time averaged rms shear stress measured using edm varied as a function of fibre position expressed as the distance from the fibre to the rising bubble fig 3 for a commercial membrane module with a 265 m2 m3 packing density the maximum time averaged rms shear stress induced by 300 ml sparged bubbles at a frequency of 0 5 hz was 1 26 pa at point 1 located at the centre of the front layer of the membrane module directly above the sparger x 0 cm y 0 cm fig 1 increasing the distance from the centre along the module length x axis led to a significant decrease in the average shear stress for example the shear stress at point 4 at a distance of 21 cm from the centre of the module was measured to be 0 10 pa compared to 0 52 pa and 0 22 pa obtained at point 2 at 7 cm and point 3 at 14 cm respectively similarly rms shear stress as a function of module width y axis decreased from 1 26 pa at point 1 y 0 cm to 1 01 pa at point 5 y 2 45 cm and 0 87 pa at point 9 y 4 9 cm respectively this shear stress distribution was determined by experimental analysis of the bubble path in the membrane module continuous pulse aeration induced circulation and downward flow in the tank which resulted in a rms shear stress of 0 22 pa at point 12 located the furthest from the centre of membrane module which was greater than 0 12 pa and 0 09 pa obtained at the adjacent points 11 and 8 respectively from fig 3 the average shear stress for the overall membrane module calculated by averaging the time averaged rms shear stress among 12 points was found to be 0 51 pa for the 265 m2 m3 membrane module decreasing the membrane packing density lead to a significant increase in the average shear stress to 0 55 pa for the 114 m2 m3 membrane module 0 60 pa for the 38 m2 m3 membrane module and 0 98 pa for the 1 8 m2 m3 membrane module respectively the increase in average shear stress can be explained by the reduction in the resistance to flow induced by the hfs which is proportional to the membrane packing density in hollow fibre membrane modules based on our previous research liu et al 2015 it should also be noted that the shear stress distributions in membrane modules with lower packing densities of 114 m2 m3 and 38 m2 m3 exhibited similar trends to that obtained for the 265 m2 m3 membrane module fig 3 when packing density decreased from 265 m2 m3 to 38 m2 m3 the maximum rms shear stress at point 1 decreased from 1 77 to 1 26 pa y 0 cm fig 3 this was attributed to the pulse bubbles rising in a straight path within the 38 m2 m3 membrane module in contrast the distribution of rms shear stress in modules with a packing density of 1 8 m2 m3 fibre spacing of 7 cm followed a different trend where the highest rms shear stress of 1 75 pa was measured at points 5 and 6 which were located close to the centre at the middle layer of the membrane module y 2 45 cm also a high average shear stress of 1 66 pa was measured at point 10 y 4 9 cm fig 3 this was much larger than the 0 91 pa measured for point 2 y 0 fig 3 this was attributed to the lower confinement of the hollow fibres in the 1 8 m2 m3 membrane module where the pulse bubbles were observed to enter the membrane module from the height of 0 5 m and followed a zigzag rising path in the membrane module therefore it can be concluded that the packing density has a significant impact on shear stress induced by pulse bubbles in hf membrane modules however similar shear stress distributions were observed in the 38 m2 m3 114 m2 m3 and 265 m2 m3 modules fig 3 consequently the 38 m2 m3 module was used in subsequent simulations to save computational effort 3 2 model validation the cfd model was used to simulate the transient shear stress distribution in a 38 m2 m3 module induced by 300 ml pulse bubbles sparged at a constant frequency of 0 5 hz for a period of 8 s equivalent to 4 bubbling periods the flow conditions reached a relative steady state i e a periodic flow behaviour obtained as shown in the following figures after 3 2 s when the first bubble reached the water surface the cfd model was validated by comparing simulated rms shear stress from 6 s to 14 s at single points as a function of fibre location with shear stress measured by edm fig 4 the simulated data exhibited a similar trend to the experimental results with an overall difference of 15 the maximum error of 25 occurred at point 6 which was located in the middle of the membrane module y 2 45 cm this can be attributed to the irregularly periodic physical contacts between adjacent fibres in the high packed membrane modules berube et al 2006 leading to a large measurement error of 0 2 pa standard deviation value long term measurements are suggested in future work for the measurement of membrane surface shear in high packed membrane module to minimise the impact of measured shear stress fluctuations on the rms shear stress data by neglecting the large error caused by point 6 the overall difference can be decreased to 14 with 85 confidence level taking account of the average standard deviation as high as 21 for experimental measurements the cfd model developed here is reliable to investigate the hydraulic performance of high packed hf membrane module 38 m2 m3 3 3 hydraulic performance of pulse bubbles in high packed membrane module 3 3 1 single bubble behaviour and bubble induced local shear stress cfd simulations of bubble behaviour in the 38 m2 m3 module suggest that the 300 ml pulse bubbles behaved as irregular cap shaped bubbles fig 5 severe bubble breakup was detected in the 38 m2 m3 membrane module with more satellite bubbles observed at the wake zone of the leading bubbles compared to the bubble behaviour in a less packed membrane module 1 8 m2 m3 packing density however the horizontal dispersion of satellite bubbles in the 38 m2 m3 membrane module was less pronounced than that in the 1 8 m2 m3 membrane module supplementary information videos s1 and s2 due to the increase in flow resistance when increasing the packing density this is consistent with the work of liu et al 2016 the average rising velocity of the 300 ml bubbles at 0 5 hz in the high packed membrane module was 0 74 m s which is 8 less than the 0 80 m s in the 1 8 m2 m3 packing density membrane module again this can be explained by the larger resistance to the flow on high packed hollow fibre modules the time averaged rms shear stress at point 1 from simulation time of 6 s 14 s was found to be 1 83 pa for the 38 m2 m3 and was lower than the 2 32 pa measured for the 1 8 m2 m3 membrane module fig 5 this observation was consistent with the experimental observations discussed in section 3 1 the simulated local shear stress at point 1 in the 38 m2 m3 module exhibited periodic patterns with a high peak shear profile as observed by chan et al 2011 this was similar to the shear profile on a single hollow fibre for low packed 1 m2 m3 membrane module as presented by radaei et al 2018 in a numerical study and by jankhah and bérubé 2013 in their experimental investigation a small peak in shear stress of 1 17 pa was observed when the nose of the cap bubble approached point 1 the localised shear stress increased significantly to a maximum value of 4 92 pa when the point 1 was in the wake zone of the bubble the time averaged rms value of near membrane flow velocity in a period of 8 s 4 bubbling periods was used to evaluate the distribution of time averaged shear stress in the membrane module the higher velocity induced higher shear stresses in the membranes close to the rising path of the bubble released directly above the nozzle the zone of influence was determined by the length in the y axis width on which the average velocity is higher than 0 2 m s jankhah and bérubé 2013 jankhah and bérubé 2013 revealed that the rate of fouling inside the zone was lower than outside the zone in the lower half of the 38 m2 m3 membrane module 0 z 0 8 m the zone of influence of a single nozzle ejecting 300 ml bubbles at 0 5 hz was 10 cm the zone of influence increased along the module height to approximately 15 cm near the top fig 6 a which is attributed to the bubble breakup and the horizontal dispersion of satellite bubbles reaching wider regions in the module at greater heights as shown in fig 7 similar distribution of the zone of influence along the height was observed for the 1 8 m2 m3 membrane module but with a wider zone of influence of 20 cm near the top of the module fig 6b 3 3 2 the impact of bubbles interaction on flow behaviour the cfd model was also used to investigate the impact of the interactions among bubbles generated from adjacent nozzles following synchronous and asynchronous bubbling schemes 3 3 2 1 synchronous bubbling the 300 ml bubbles sparged synchronously through adjacent spargers spaced 20 cm apart at a constant frequency of 0 5 hz rose along a straight path with little interactions between the pulse bubbles in the 38 m2 m3 membrane module fig 8 a as with the behaviour of pulses from a single sparger a large number of small satellite bubbles were generated in the wake zone of pulse bubbles the average rise velocity of bubbles from multiple spargers was 6 lower 0 69 m s than the velocity of bubbles from a single sparger however at the upper zone of the membrane module the rising velocities of the three synchronous bubbles varied which was attributed to the different patterns of bubble breakage between the three bubbles fig 8 shows the average flow velocity distribution along the width of the module and along the depth of the module in the x axis the distribution of the average flow velocity induced by the synchronous sparging of 300 ml bubbles at 0 5 hz varied more over the module compared to asynchronous sparging in the lower half of the membrane module 0 z 1 0 m the zone of influence was 10 cm which is half of the 20 cm sparger spacing indicating the existence of flow dead zones which are likely to be susceptible to fouling fig 9 the zone of influence increased on the upper half of the module due to the increased dispersion of small satellite bubbles in the x direction towards the top of the module reaching a zone of influence of 12 cm for height above z 1 7 m this zone of influence which is smaller than the 20 cm sparger spacing indicates that the sparger spacing should be decreased if 300 ml bubbles are ejected synchronously at 0 5 hz in order to diminish the flow dead zone between the adjacent bubbles rising paths and thereby improving the fouling control efficiency 3 3 2 2 asynchronous bubbling the 300 ml pulse bubbles generated with an asynchronous bubbling scheme with 1 s delay in the sparging of the adjacent nozzles compared to the middle nozzle exhibited different flow behaviour as seen in fig 8b more severe bubble breakup was observed in the upper zone of the membrane module due to the greater impact of the wake zone of the preceding bubbles on the trailing bubbles resulting in a stronger vorticity in the upper zone the average bubble rise velocity was 0 75 m s which is 8 higher than that for synchronous bubbling due to the stronger bubbles interactions generated by the asynchronous scheme the spatial distribution of the time averaged flow velocity in the whole membrane module induced by the asynchronous bubbling was different from that utilising the synchronous bubbling scheme the flow velocity distribution was more variable in the lower zone of membrane module z 1 0 m compared to z 1 2 m with the zone of influence of pulse bubbling spargers of 12 cm fig 9 the zone of influence increased along the module with the overlapping of the effective area of the adjacent spargers obtained at z 1 5 m this was attributed to the significant bubbles interaction between the adjacent bubbles acuña and finch 2010 rabha and buwa 2010 subsequently a more even distribution of the time averaged flow velocity was observed in the upper zone of the membrane module z 1 5 m with a larger zone of influence fig 9 closer to the permeate collector where filtration flux is expected to be higher the average zone of influence by asynchronous bubbling was found to be 33 higher than the synchronous bubbling scheme fig 9 indicating a higher efficiency in fouling control these results are consistent with findings by cumin et al 2011 on the commercial suez water technologies solutions pulse bubble sparger 4 conclusion the hydrodynamic behaviour of pulse bubble aeration in hollow fibre membrane modules was investigated using a combination of experimental and numerical cfd modelling methods edm measurements of shear in modules with packing densities ranging from 1 8 m2 m3 to 265 m2 m3 decreased from 0 98 pa to 0 51 pa due to the interaction of the bubble and fibres however the magnitude and distribution of shear stress in a 38 m2 m3 membrane module were similar to the high packed 265 m2 m3 membrane module enabling a cfd model to be then developed to simulate a full scale membrane tank configured with 38 m2 m3 packing density membrane modules to predict the hydraulic performance of a commercial modules with higher packing densities the cfd model was validated by comparing the simulated localised rms shear stress at 12 different points with experimentally measured data the simulation results concluded that pulse bubbles behaved as irregular cap shaped bubbles in the high packed membrane module with a lower rising velocity compared to the bubbles in low packed membrane modules the presence of high packed hollow fibres induced more severe bubble breakup higher rms shear stresses were observed closer to the rising path of pulse bubbles which then diminished with increasing horizontal distance indicating the existence of a zone of influence the zone of influence of pulse bubbles from single spargers in the low packed membrane module was larger than that in the high packed membrane module due to the more pronounced horizontal dispersion of small satellite bubbles interactions of pulse bubbles in membrane modules extended the zone of influence of pulse bubbles and improved the spatial distribution of spatial shear stress making it more evenly distributed in the high packed membrane module the asynchronous bubbling scheme enhanced the bubble interactions and also extended the zone of influence of single pulse bubbles resulting in a more evenly distributed shear stress in the high packed membrane module compared to the synchronous bubbling scheme especially in the upper

18724,a three dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd model was developed to study shear stress induced by spherical cap bubbles in hollow fibre hf membrane modules configured with a packing density of 38 m2 m3 to predict the shear profile in a commercial hollow fibre membrane module of 265 m2 m3 the cfd model s computational effort was minimised by simulating the formation of bubble structures and their rising velocities in modules with packing densities of 1 8 and 38 m2 m3 and validated with experimental calibration of shear profiles via electro diffusion methods edm pulse bubbles 300 ml generated from a single sparger at 0 5 hz produced more satellite bubbles in the wake zone of the leading bubble in high packing density 38 m2 m3 than in low packing density modules 1 8 m2 m3 the bubble rise velocity was approximately 8 lower in the 38 m2 m3 than in the 1 8 m2 m3 module increasing packing density reduced the shear profile from a single sparger and the dispersion of the satellite bubbles in the horizontal plane especially in the upper part of the membrane module for systems with multiple spargers the interaction between pulses generated more shear than the pulses from a single sparger and produced a more uniform shear profile in the module through asynchronous bubble release from adjacent spargers than synchronous release a 33 increase in the zone of influence

membrane aeration system to induce sufficient tangential surface shear to maintain the filtrate flux while minimising the power consumption judd 2011 membrane aeration systems were originally designed for continuous aeration with coarse 2 10 mm bubbles and subsequently modified to cyclic aeration to reduce power consumption braak et al 2011 buer and cumin 2010 however recently commercial filtration system manufacturers such as suez water technologies solutions and evoqua developed more power efficient systems that release pulse bubbles larger than 50 ml cumin et al 2011 james et al 2012 the efficacy of the pulse aeration compared with coarse aeration has been attributed to the greater fluctuations in shear stress on the membrane surface chan et al 2011 jankhah and bérubé 2014 experimental studies have provided some insight into the factors that influence pulse and coarse bubble behaviour in hf membrane modules abdullah et al 2015 jankhah and bérubé 2013 2014 ye et al 2014 jankhah and bérubé 2013 and jankhah and bérubé 2014 measured the shear stress and fouling rate induced by pulse bubble 150 500 ml and coarse bubble 0 75 2 5 ml in a pilot scale membrane module with 7 membrane fibres in coarse aeration the fouling rate coefficient decreased from 0 002 1 ml to 0 0003 1 ml by only increasing frequency from 0 25 hz to 0 5 hz jankhah and bérubé 2014 while in pulse aeration fouling rate was reduced by controlling both bubble size and frequency for example the fouling rate coefficient decreased from 0 0007 1 ml to 0 0001 1 ml by increasing frequency of 300 ml bubbles from 0 25 hz to 0 5 hz jankhah and bérubé 2014 these observations were interpreted using the new parameter the bubble zone of influence which describes the zone around the membrane where the upward flow velocity was greater than 0 2 m s jankhah and bérubé 2013 direct measurement of flux decline revealed that the rate of fouling inside the zone of influence was lower than outside the zone furthermore the zone of influence in a pulse aeration was larger than coarse aeration system at the same airflow rate 1 l min jankhah and bérubé 2013 detailed investigation of the effect of variables such as bubble size frequency and module packing density membrane area module volume in pulse bubble systems have been based on empirical measurements ye et al 2014 used the electro diffusion method edm to investigate the effects of bubble size and frequency shear stress induced by pulse aeration was measured in small cylinder shaped membrane bundles configured with 40 membrane fibres ye et al 2014 ye et al 2014 found that at constant aeration rate of 3 5 l min smaller pulse bubbles 150 ml at a frequency of 0 39 hz generated a higher root mean square rms shear stress than larger pulse bubbles 250 ml at a lower frequency of 0 39 hz these results provide some insight however the observations were made at low packing density and at frequencies lower than those used for fouling control in commercial systems which range from 0 5 hz to 0 6 hz braak et al 2011 packing densities in commercial hf membrane modules range from 40 to 350 m2 m3 judd 2011 fibre packing density has been reported to significantly influence bubble flow in coarse bubble aeration by increasing the resistance to the liquid flow liu et al 2015 wang et al 2010 furthermore bubble flow is influenced by the interaction of adjacent bubbles that are delivered through multiple ports acuña and finch 2010 rabha and buwa 2010 in pulse bubble systems these interactions include collisions coalescence and break up particularly in the turbulent wake which influences the surface shear and fouling rate radaei et al 2018 consequently it is necessary to extend the study of pulse bubble behaviour to include multiple pulse bubbles spargers in membrane modules with high packing densities unlike traditional experimental techniques cfd modelling has been proven to be a useful tool that can not only evaluate the hydrodynamic behaviour but also predict the overall shear stress profile in full scale mbr modules brannock et al 2010 kang et al 2008 saalbach and hunze 2008 wang et al 2018a b c in previous studies high packed hf membrane modules were simulated either as a solid object ratkovich et al 2012 or as a porous media liu et al 2015 wang et al 2010 in order to minimise the computational effort however these simplifications are not applicable for pulse bubble aeration where the larger bubble size and the production of satellite bubbles due to the bubble break up in the wake zone result in complex bubble fibre interactions which significantly influence shear stress distribution within the module radaei et al 2018 another challenge of simulating pulse aeration in membrane modules with high packing density lies in the complexity of the model s geometry which requires a large number of nodes to describe the fluid domain around every single fibre with the number of nodes increasing exponentially with the increase of packing density in the present study a three dimensional cfd model was developed to investigate pulse bubble behaviour and the induced shear stress distribution in a commercial membrane module with high packing density experimental shear measurements using the edm method böhm et al 2013 were conducted to calibrate the cfd model developed for a reduced number of nodes low packing density to simulate the hydraulic behaviour of commercial membrane modules the cfd model incorporated a rheology function to account for the rheological properties of the activated sludge and a surface force function to account for the effects of surfactants on the bubble shape deformation coalescence collision and breakup of the pulse bubbles in membrane module were simulated via the volume of fluid vof method furthermore the model was used to predict the interaction of pulse bubbles generated in two different bubbling schemes synchronous and asynchronous on the area of influence of pulse bubbles and the shear stress distribution induced in the membrane module 2 methods 2 1 experimental method calibration and validation experiments were conducted in a 360 l plexiglas membrane tank 1 00 m 0 15 m 2 40 m table 1 configured with a commercial zeeweed zw 500d curtain shaped hollow fibre membrane bundle 0 84 m 0 05 m 2 20 m suez water technologies solutions installed 0 1 m above the bottom of the tank z 0 1 m pulse bubble aeration was provided through a pulse bubble sparger located at the bottom of the membrane tank x 0 m y 0 m z 0 m which delivered pulse bubbles with an average volume of approximately 300 ml at a frequency of 0 5 hz equivalent to 0 02 m3 m2 hr specific aeration demand per membrane area shear profiles were measured using edm in an electrolyte solution of 0 003 m ferricyanide 0 006 m ferrocyanide and 0 3 m potassium chloride in deoxygenated dechlorinated tap water 12 membrane fibres were replaced with 1 8 mm diameter teflon tubes containing platinum electrodes 0 5 mm in diameter equally distributed throughout the tank fig 1 the current signal of each electrode was collected at a frequency of 200 hz and logged via labview software version 13 0 the shear stress was calculated based on the quasi steady state leveque relationship sobolik et al 1998 as expressed in equation 1 eq 1 i 0 862 n a f c b d 2 3 d 1 3 τ 1 3 where i is the current

experiments were conducted at room temperature of 25 0 01 c a complete description of the theory and details of the edm may be found elsewhere bérubé et al 2006 chan et al 2007 fulton et al 2011 mitchell and hanratty 2006 2 2 cfd simulation a three dimensional cfd model was developed using the commercial cfd ansys fluent 17 2 all simulations were performed on the raijin high performance computing facility at the national computational infrastructure nci with four nodes each with 2x 14 core intel xeon e5 2690v4 broadwell 2 6 ghz processors for a total number of 112 cores and 256 gb memory using this system 36 h were required to simulate 1 s of pulse flow and approximately 21 days were required for 14 s 2 2 1 geometry and mesh the computational domain was built based on a full scale membrane cassette configured with the commercial zw500d mbr cassette the curtain shaped membrane bundles were laid out in parallel at a distance of 2 45 cm apart the geometry of each high packed membrane bundle was simplified as having 10 of packing density 38 m2 m3 of the commercial zw500d as calibrated in section 3 1 to reduce the computational effort pulse bubbles were generated through an aeration system that was located at the bottom of the membrane module with the spacing between two adjacent nozzles at 20 cm apart similar to the patent by suez water technologies solutions cumin et al 2011 the computational domain 600 mm 158 mm 2190 mm contained 3 spargers at the bottom of the tank and 3 membrane bundles fig 2 representing a full scale membrane cassette a hexahedron dominated mesh was created for the near membrane zone as well as the flow field in between membrane bundles the inflation method was employed to build the boundary layer with eight inflation layers first layer thickness of 0 1 mm and a growth rate of 1 2 per layer to improve the local resolution of the flow field in membrane bundles the maximum mesh size was set at 3 mm resulting in a total of 32 178 984 elements fig 2 a mesh independence test was conducted by increasing the grid number from 29 102 808 to 37 177 440 using a moderate mesh the grid number of 32 178 984 was obtained and subsequently chosen as the simulated shear stress was within the 4 difference when compared to that obtained when using the finest mesh 37 177 440 grids the mesh was created using a computer machine with intel xeon cpu e5 1630 v3 3 70 ghz and 64 gb memory ram and took approximately 16 h to complete 2 2 2 model setup the pulse bubbles flow in the 38 m2 m3 membrane module was simulated using vof multiphase model which is capable of resolving small scale dynamics around individual bubbles in our previous study the vof showed to be able predict the uprising of pulse bubbles through a liquid phase validated by image analysis of the bubble interface and flow profile including resolution of wake vortices deformation of the bubble shape and bubble bubble interactions such as breakup and coalescence radaei et al 2018 the vof model solves a single set of equations for continuity equation 2 and momentum equation 3 for the two non interpenetrating phases liquid and gas eq 2 ρ t ρ u 0 eq 3 ρ u t ρ uu p μ u ρ g f σ where ρ density μ is viscosity u is velocity p is pressure g is gravity and fσ is the volumetric surface tension force the tracking of the interface between phases is achieved by solving a continuity equation equation 4 for the volume fraction of the primary phase liquid phase eq 4 α l ρ l t α l ρ l u l 0 where the subscript l refers to the liquid phase and α l is the volume fraction of liquid no reaction and no mass transfer between phases were considered the volume fraction α l indicates whether the computational cells contain only liquid α l 1 only gas α l 0 or a mixture of gas and liquid 0 α l 1 details of density viscosity and surface tension force is presented by radaei et al 2018 the realizable k ɛ turbulence model was used to simulate the turbulence flow induced by the uprising pulse bubbles radaei et al 2018 a scalable wall function was employed to simulate the near wall boundary layer liu and schwarz 2009 with details of this method described in our previous paper radaei et al 2018 the activated sludge was simplified as a continuous liquid phase with the experimentally calibrated ostwald de waele rheology model for 8 g l activated sludge with a flow consistency index k 0 0614 pa s0 569 liu et al 2015 radaei et al 2018 employed to represent the rheological properties the mach number for the gas phase is much smaller than 0 3 therefore incompressible air was used to simulate the pulse bubbles a pressure outlet boundary condition was set at the top of the computational domain dhotre et al 2008 and symmetry boundary conditions were set on the four symmetry planes the membrane surface was set as a no slip wall with a roughness of 100 nm for the liquid phase and a free slip smooth wall for the gas phase liu et al 2019 300 ml bubbles at 0 5 hz of frequency were simulated to rise from the bottom of the tank in the middle module the two bubbling schemes for the commercial pulse aeration sparger cumin et al 2011 were synchronous and asynchronous bubbling 1 s delay in bubbling in the middle nozzle with respect to the adjacent nozzles both schemes were investigated to evaluate the impact of bubble interactions on the shear stress distribution in the commercial high packed membrane modules for each bubbling scheme at time zero 300 ml spherical bubbles were patched directly above each nozzle with multiple bubbles being patched at the same location at a time interval of 2 s corresponding to the bubbling period all simulations were performed as transient simulations with a time step of 0 0005 s to ensure that the courant number is smaller than 0 5 keshavarzi et al 2014 the piso algorithm was employed for the pressure velocity coupling method whiles the presto scheme was used for the discretization of the conservation equations table 2 the quick scheme geo reconstruction method and second order upwind scheme were selected to solve the momentum volume fraction and turbulent kinetic energy equations respectively all simulations were converged at 10 4 for each time step the simulation for all cases ran for 14 s which is equivalent to 7 times of bubbling period details of the model setup are summarised in table 2 2 2 3 simulations for validation simulations used for model validation were generated for hydrodynamic conditions in a 360 l pilot scale membrane tank configured with one curtain shaped membrane bundle fig 1s details for the geometry mesh and model setup for this simulation are presented in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental calibration for model development for commercial hf membrane module the time averaged rms shear stress measured using edm varied as a function of fibre position expressed as the distance from the fibre to the rising bubble fig 3 for a commercial membrane module with a 265 m2 m3 packing density the maximum time averaged rms shear stress induced by 300 ml sparged bubbles at a frequency of 0 5 hz was 1 26 pa at point 1 located at the centre of the front layer of the membrane module directly above the sparger x 0 cm y 0 cm fig 1 increasing the distance from the centre along the module length x axis led to a significant decrease in the average shear stress for example the shear stress at point 4 at a distance of 21 cm from the centre of the module was measured to be 0 10 pa compared to 0 52 pa and 0 22 pa obtained at point 2 at 7 cm and point 3 at 14 cm respectively similarly rms shear stress as a function of module width y axis decreased from 1 26 pa at point 1 y 0 cm to 1 01 pa at point 5 y 2 45 cm and 0 87 pa at point 9 y 4 9 cm respectively this shear stress distribution was determined by experimental analysis of the bubble path in the membrane module continuous pulse aeration induced circulation and downward flow in the tank which resulted in a rms shear stress of 0 22 pa at point 12 located the furthest from the centre of membrane module which was greater than 0 12 pa and 0 09 pa obtained at the adjacent points 11 and 8 respectively from fig 3 the average shear stress for the overall membrane module calculated by averaging the time averaged rms shear stress among 12 points was found to be 0 51 pa for the 265 m2 m3 membrane module decreasing the membrane packing density lead to a significant increase in the average shear stress to 0 55 pa for the 114 m2 m3 membrane module 0 60 pa for the 38 m2 m3 membrane module and 0 98 pa for the 1 8 m2 m3 membrane module respectively the increase in average shear stress can be explained by the reduction in the resistance to flow induced by the hfs which is proportional to the membrane packing density in hollow fibre membrane modules based on our previous research liu et al 2015 it should also be noted that the shear stress distributions in membrane modules with lower packing densities of 114 m2 m3 and 38 m2 m3 exhibited similar trends to that obtained for the 265 m2 m3 membrane module fig 3 when packing density decreased from 265 m2 m3 to 38 m2 m3 the maximum rms shear stress at point 1 decreased from 1 77 to 1 26 pa y 0 cm fig 3 this was attributed to the pulse bubbles rising in a straight path within the 38 m2 m3 membrane module in contrast the distribution of rms shear stress in modules with a packing density of 1 8 m2 m3 fibre spacing of 7 cm followed a different trend where the highest rms shear stress of 1 75 pa was measured at points 5 and 6 which were located close to the centre at the middle layer of the membrane module y 2 45 cm also a high average shear stress of 1 66 pa was measured at point 10 y 4 9 cm fig 3 this was much larger than the 0 91 pa measured for point 2 y 0 fig 3 this was attributed to the lower confinement of the hollow fibres in the 1 8 m2 m3 membrane module where the pulse bubbles were observed to enter the membrane module from the height of 0 5 m and followed a zigzag rising path in the membrane module therefore it can be concluded that the packing density has a significant impact on shear stress induced by pulse bubbles in hf membrane modules however similar shear stress distributions were observed in the 38 m2 m3 114 m2 m3 and 265 m2 m3 modules fig 3 consequently the 38 m2 m3 module was used in subsequent simulations to save computational effort 3 2 model validation the cfd model was used to simulate the transient shear stress distribution in a 38 m2 m3 module induced by 300 ml pulse bubbles sparged at a constant frequency of 0 5 hz for a period of 8 s equivalent to 4 bubbling periods the flow conditions reached a relative steady state i e a periodic flow behaviour obtained as shown in the following figures after 3 2 s when the first bubble reached the water surface the cfd model was validated by comparing simulated rms shear stress from 6 s to 14 s at single points as a function of fibre location with shear stress measured by edm fig 4 the simulated data exhibited a similar trend to the experimental results with an overall difference of 15 the maximum error of 25 occurred at point 6 which was located in the middle of the membrane module y 2 45 cm this can be attributed to the irregularly periodic physical contacts between adjacent fibres in the high packed membrane modules berube et al 2006 leading to a large measurement error of 0 2 pa standard deviation value long term measurements are suggested in future work for the measurement of membrane surface shear in high packed membrane module to minimise the impact of measured shear stress fluctuations on the rms shear stress data by neglecting the large error caused by point 6 the overall difference can be decreased to 14 with 85 confidence level taking account of the average standard deviation as high as 21 for experimental measurements the cfd model developed here is reliable to investigate the hydraulic performance of high packed hf membrane module 38 m2 m3 3 3 hydraulic performance of pulse bubbles in high packed membrane module 3 3 1 single bubble behaviour and bubble induced local shear stress cfd simulations of bubble behaviour in the 38 m2 m3 module suggest that the 300 ml pulse bubbles behaved as irregular cap shaped bubbles fig 5 severe bubble breakup was detected in the 38 m2 m3 membrane module with more satellite bubbles observed at the wake zone of the leading bubbles compared to the bubble behaviour in a less packed membrane module 1 8 m2 m3 packing density however the horizontal dispersion of satellite bubbles in the 38 m2 m3 membrane module was less pronounced than that in the 1 8 m2 m3 membrane module supplementary information videos s1 and s2 due to the increase in flow resistance when increasing the packing density this is consistent with the work of liu et al 2016 the average rising velocity of the 300 ml bubbles at 0 5 hz in the high packed membrane module was 0 74 m s which is 8 less than the 0 80 m s in the 1 8 m2 m3 packing density membrane module again this can be explained by the larger resistance to the flow on high packed hollow fibre modules the time averaged rms shear stress at point 1 from simulation time of 6 s 14 s was found to be 1 83 pa for the 38 m2 m3 and was lower than the 2 32 pa measured for the 1 8 m2 m3 membrane module fig 5 this observation was consistent with the experimental observations discussed in section 3 1 the simulated local shear stress at point 1 in the 38 m2 m3 module exhibited periodic patterns with a high peak shear profile as observed by chan et al 2011 this was similar to the shear profile on a single hollow fibre for low packed 1 m2 m3 membrane module as presented by radaei et al 2018 in a numerical study and by jankhah and bérubé 2013 in their experimental investigation a small peak in shear stress of 1 17 pa was observed when the nose of the cap bubble approached point 1 the localised shear stress increased significantly to a maximum value of 4 92 pa when the point 1 was in the wake zone of the bubble the time averaged rms value of near membrane flow velocity in a period of 8 s 4 bubbling periods was used to evaluate the distribution of time averaged shear stress in the membrane module the higher velocity induced higher shear stresses in the membranes close to the rising path of the bubble released directly above the nozzle the zone of influence was determined by the length in the y axis width on which the average velocity is higher than 0 2 m s jankhah and bérubé 2013 jankhah and bérubé 2013 revealed that the rate of fouling inside the zone was lower than outside the zone in the lower half of the 38 m2 m3 membrane module 0 z 0 8 m the zone of influence of a single nozzle ejecting 300 ml bubbles at 0 5 hz was 10 cm the zone of influence increased along the module height to approximately 15 cm near the top fig 6 a which is attributed to the bubble breakup and the horizontal dispersion of satellite bubbles reaching wider regions in the module at greater heights as shown in fig 7 similar distribution of the zone of influence along the height was observed for the 1 8 m2 m3 membrane module but with a wider zone of influence of 20 cm near the top of the module fig 6b 3 3 2 the impact of bubbles interaction on flow behaviour the cfd model was also used to investigate the impact of the interactions among bubbles generated from adjacent nozzles following synchronous and asynchronous bubbling schemes 3 3 2 1 synchronous bubbling the 300 ml bubbles sparged synchronously through adjacent spargers spaced 20 cm apart at a constant frequency of 0 5 hz rose along a straight path with little interactions between the pulse bubbles in the 38 m2 m3 membrane module fig 8 a as with the behaviour of pulses from a single sparger a large number of small satellite bubbles were generated in the wake zone of pulse bubbles the average rise velocity of bubbles from multiple spargers was 6 lower 0 69 m s than the velocity of bubbles from a single sparger however at the upper zone of the membrane module the rising velocities of the three synchronous bubbles varied which was attributed to the different patterns of bubble breakage between the three bubbles fig 8 shows the average flow velocity distribution along the width of the module and along the depth of the module in the x axis the distribution of the average flow velocity induced by the synchronous sparging of 300 ml bubbles at 0 5 hz varied more over the module compared to asynchronous sparging in the lower half of the membrane module 0 z 1 0 m the zone of influence was 10 cm which is half of the 20 cm sparger spacing indicating the existence of flow dead zones which are likely to be susceptible to fouling fig 9 the zone of influence increased on the upper half of the module due to the increased dispersion of small satellite bubbles in the x direction towards the top of the module reaching a zone of influence of 12 cm for height above z 1 7 m this zone of influence which is smaller than the 20 cm sparger spacing indicates that the sparger spacing should be decreased if 300 ml bubbles are ejected synchronously at 0 5 hz in order to diminish the flow dead zone between the adjacent bubbles rising paths and thereby improving the fouling control efficiency 3 3 2 2 asynchronous bubbling the 300 ml pulse bubbles generated with an asynchronous bubbling scheme with 1 s delay in the sparging of the adjacent nozzles compared to the middle nozzle exhibited different flow behaviour as seen in fig 8b more severe bubble breakup was observed in the upper zone of the membrane module due to the greater impact of the wake zone of the preceding bubbles on the trailing bubbles resulting in a stronger vorticity in the upper zone the average bubble rise velocity was 0 75 m s which is 8 higher than that for synchronous bubbling due to the stronger bubbles interactions generated by the asynchronous scheme the spatial distribution of the time averaged flow velocity in the whole membrane module induced by the asynchronous bubbling was different from that utilising the synchronous bubbling scheme the flow velocity distribution was more variable in the lower zone of membrane module z 1 0 m compared to z 1 2 m with the zone of influence of pulse bubbling spargers of 12 cm fig 9 the zone of influence increased along the module with the overlapping of the effective area of the adjacent spargers obtained at z 1 5 m this was attributed to the significant bubbles interaction between the adjacent bubbles acuña and finch 2010 rabha and buwa 2010 subsequently a more even distribution of the time averaged flow velocity was observed in the upper zone of the membrane module z 1 5 m with a larger zone of influence fig 9 closer to the permeate collector where filtration flux is expected to be higher the average zone of influence by asynchronous bubbling was found to be 33 higher than the synchronous bubbling scheme fig 9 indicating a higher efficiency in fouling control these results are consistent with findings by cumin et al 2011 on the commercial suez water technologies solutions pulse bubble sparger 4 conclusion the hydrodynamic behaviour of pulse bubble aeration in hollow fibre membrane modules was investigated using a combination of experimental and numerical cfd modelling methods edm measurements of shear in modules with packing densities ranging from 1 8 m2 m3 to 265 m2 m3 decreased from 0 98 pa to 0 51 pa due to the interaction of the bubble and fibres however the magnitude and distribution of shear stress in a 38 m2 m3 membrane module were similar to the high packed 265 m2 m3 membrane module enabling a cfd model to be then developed to simulate a full scale membrane tank configured with 38 m2 m3 packing density membrane modules to predict the hydraulic performance of a commercial modules with higher packing densities the cfd model was validated by comparing the simulated localised rms shear stress at 12 different points with experimentally measured data the simulation results concluded that pulse bubbles behaved as irregular cap shaped bubbles in the high packed membrane module with a lower rising velocity compared to the bubbles in low packed membrane modules the presence of high packed hollow fibres induced more severe bubble breakup higher rms shear stresses were observed closer to the rising path of pulse bubbles which then diminished with increasing horizontal distance indicating the existence of a zone of influence the zone of influence of pulse bubbles from single spargers in the low packed membrane module was larger than that in the high packed membrane module due to the more pronounced horizontal dispersion of small satellite bubbles interactions of pulse bubbles in membrane modules extended the zone of influence of pulse bubbles and improved the spatial distribution of spatial shear stress making it more evenly distributed in the high packed membrane module the asynchronous bubbling scheme enhanced the bubble interactions and also extended the zone of influence of single pulse bubbles resulting in a more evenly distributed shear stress in the high packed membrane module compared to the synchronous bubbling scheme especially in the upper
