chemicals in present study activated carbons acs from chars of pyrolytic 500 c and hydrothermal 190 c treatment of waste milk thistle mt extrudes were obtained by koh 1 3 activation the obtained mt

surface chemical characteristics influenced the kinetics as well as the mechanism of ipu adsorption but the adsorption capacity at equilibrium was pore size dependent the basic surface characteristics

efficiency adsorption processes appeared to be convenient for the removal of pesticides due to the high efficiency activated carbons have gained attention in removal of pollutants from industrial

in table 2 korram et al 39 investigated the adsorption and desorption properties of ipu using bio chars and hydro chars it was found that hydro chars due to the lack of micropores cannot be treated as high efficiency sorbents of ipu whereas pyro chars were found to be effective as a result of greater micropore distribution thus the porosity and pore development of the sorption material play a significant role in ipu adsorption nevertheless pyro chars are characterized with rather low ssa development of adsorbents with high specific surface area and developed microporosity improves the removal properties of various pollutants 40 general purpose of research was to find reasonable treatment method for the utilization of solid waste bioproduct obtained during extrusion of milk thistle oil a source of antioxidants and flavonolignans furthermore the research was conducted to examine the influence of bio char production method thermal pretreatment at 500 c and without thermal pretreatment on the porosity development in koh activated carbons acs in comparison with hydro char derived ac the additional aim of present work was to evaluate the utility of produced acs towards removal of the organic water impurities the static conditions were applied to measure adsorption of ipu so the novelty of this work is expressed in the use of hydro char from waste milk thistle oil as main product of extrusion is widely used for the preparation of pharmaceuticals in liver treatment for the preparation of activated carbons efficient in ipu removal as presented in next chapters we were able to prepare activated carbons with well developed porosity furthermore we have proved that the ipu adsorption is enhanced by basic surface chemistry characteristics and pore volume of width 1 2 times larger than the biggest molecular dimension as far as we aware no such research was previously performed 2 experimental waste milk thistle extrudates mt were grinded to a particle size below 0 4 mm for further processing hydrothermal carbonization was conducted in stainless steel reactor with teflon vessel the biomass water ratio was 1 10 process temperature 190 c and residence time 1 h resultant hydro char was then filtrated washed with small portions of acetone and stored for further processing pyrolysis process was carried out in a quartz tube reactor with quartz vessel biomass was heated in n2 flow of 20 l h 1 up to 500 c the heating rate was 10 c min 1 and the residence time 1 h the resultant pyro char was collected for further processing chemical activation was conducted with potassium hydroxide avantor perfomance materials poland s a gliwice poland approximately 2 g of carbon source raw biomass hydro char pyro char was mixed with 6 g of koh and placed into a quartz tube reactor in a nickel vessel the temperature was ramped with heating rate of 10 c min 1 under n2 flow of 20 l h 1 up to 800 c the activation time was 1 h after the sample was cooled to room temperature it was washed with 5 hcl solution and distilled water until ph 7 next activated carbons were dried in oven at 105 c overnight the acs obtained from raw biomass hydro char and pyro char were named mt koh mt htc koh and mt 500 koh respectively the porous texture of resultant activated carbons was evaluated from n2 adsorption isotherms measurements carried out at 77 k as described in details elsewhere 41 isoproturon pestanal merck was dissolved in distilled water to obtain the solution with concentration of 20 mg dm 3 isoproturon adsorption was conducted by mixing 5 mg of activated carbon with 100 ml of ipu in a 200 ml glass flask the concentration of ipu was than measured with uv vis spectrophotometer hitachi u 2800a at wavelength of 239 2 nm the point of zero charge phpzc of adsorbents were obtained as described elsewhere 42 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of activated carbons the activated carbons were produced from hydro char pyro char and raw waste milk thistle extrudates via koh activation the main characteristics of obtained adsorbents was given in table 3 the ash content in starting biomass was as high as 4 6 wt and increased up to 15 3 wt during pyrolysis at 500 c all pyrolytic biochar based mt acs were characterized by low content of mineral matter which is designated by the ash content of less than 0 8 wt hydrothermal treatment of waste extrudates at 190 c led to the deep leaching of the inorganic components so that its content was lower than 0 1 and 0 2 wt in hydro char and related activated carbon respectively the low ash content is desired in the case of adsorbents in the water treatment it allows to eliminate the risk of re pollution of water by the mineral impurities that can be rinsed from the acs the surface characteristics of studied acs depended on the pre treatment process prior to the activation the phpzc values were in the range between 3 85 and 10 57 the lowest phpzc was observed for mt htc koh while the mt 50 koh had the highest value the differences in the value of phpzc were the result of distinct elemental composition of activated material the pyro char was characterized by the lowest oxygen content 8 0 while the hydro char as well as the raw material had high oxygen content 27 9 and 35 1 respectively the nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 k for mt acs depicted in fig 1 are of type i bddt classification 43 which is typical for microporous sorbents although microporous structure was well developed in all tested activated carbons a significant difference between the char based acs and the raw biomass based ac were observed table 3 the bet surface area was in the range 940 2970 m2 g 1 whereas micropore volume vmicro varied from 0 36 to 1 19 cm3 g 1 the total pore volume vtotal of the char based acs varied between 1 44 and 1 47 cm3 g 1 whereas for mt koh it was 0 44 cm3 g 1 only the size distribution of micropores obtained by qsdft method was presented in fig 2 there were clearly visible changes in the pore size distribution psd in relation to the mt ac formation route the maximum of pore volume was observed at the pore width of 0 9 1 0 nm for all carbons but the volume of pore was completely different the volume of pore at that maximum varied in direction mt htc koh mt koh mt 500 koh an additional small maximum in psd was observed at wider micropore width 1 5 1 6 nm for the pyro char based ac while the mt koh carbon had more homogenous psd and did not show any wider micropores the mesopore volume increased in direction mt koh 0 08 cm3 g 1 mt 500 koh 0 28 cm3 g 1 mt htc koh 0 37 cm3 g 1 such changes in porous structure of resultant acs depended on carbon source preparation before activation process it can be stated the thermal treatment of milk thistle extrudates was responsible for the creation of primary microstructure which was developed during chemical activation with koh 3 2 adsorption of isoproturon from aqueous solution the static conditions were applied for the adsorption of isoproturon the time of attaining equilibrium and the equilibrium concentration were established for all studied acs the equilibrium adsorption isotherms were obtained only for the char based mt acs the adsorption of ipu versus time was given in fig 3 it was found that the adsorption processes were very fast only 30 min was required to achieve over 50 of equilibrium sorption capacity it took nearly six hours to attain the equilibrium for char based acs whereas double longer time was required in case of mt koh various factors were recognized as influencing the equilibrium time i e speed of agitation adsorbent particle size and porous texture the most importantly mesopores volume in present study all activated carbons were used as powders the speed of agitation was the same in all tests the main difference between the two series of tested adsorbents was the big micropore and mesopore volume the larger volume of mesopores 0 37 cm3 g 1 0 28 cm3 g 1 in char based acs resulted in a much shorter equilibrium time in comparison with mt koh characterized with skimp mesoporosity 0 08 cm3 g 1 another meaningful difference in the adsorption processes was found in the amount of ipu removed at equilibrium as high as 361 and 371 mg of ipu was adsorbed on 1 g of hydro char and pyro char based acs respectively that gives the removal of ipu at level of about 92 95 contrarily the mt koh removed only 136 mg of ipu per gram thus only 33 of ipu removal was reached and it was three fold less than for other acs the variations in the amount of ipu adsorbed at equilibrium reflected the differences in the porosity development the amount of ipu adsorbed at equilibrium raised in the same order as the surface area sbet i e mt 500 koh mt htc koh mt koh 3 2 1 adsorption kinetics model to investigate the adsorption rate the mathematical kinetics models were used to interpret the results obtained the pseudo first lagergren table 4 eq 1 and pseudo second order model table 4 eq 2 are the mostly used equations in our work both models were used to characterize the adsorption of isoproturon over mt acs additionally the elovich model table 4 eq 3 weber morris table 4 eq 4 and bangham s table 4 eq 5 equations were used to gain a deeper insight into the mechanism of adsorption kinetics the data were summarized in table 5 the correlation coefficient r2 for the lagergren equation appeared to be rather low as it was between 0 93 and 0 95 for tested systems it was probably a result of rapid initial adsorption and slow rate of achieving the equilibrium also reported in our other works 22 23 44 also the experimental qexp values were not close to the computed ones while the plot of t qt vs t showed a linear fit to experimental data as the magnitudes of correlation coefficients r2 were close to 1 0 the pseudo second order model was proper for the adsorption systems tested in present study good correlation r2 of pseudo second order model is often observed in adsorption of various pollutants it suggests occurrence of chemisorption or electron exchange between the adsorbent and pollutant 45 additionally the calculated qeq values fitted to the experimental data very well as presented in table 5 in another work on adsorption of organic compound from water on activated carbons the trend of an increase of k2 rate constant with a decrease in the time of adsorption equilibrium was noticed 18 there was no such relation found in present work the elovich equation which assumes chemical adsorption chemical reaction mechanism in nature was used in adsorption kinetics studies as well 46 the correlation coefficients r2 for that equation were the same for all acs studied in this work 0 95 however it should be emphasized that the b constant sometimes used to describe the adsorption capacity was very similar for the char based mt acs 0 19 0 16 what more the a constant was the highest for mt htc koh which indicated that the surface chemistry will influence the ipu adsorption no uniform physical definition of kinetics constant in the first and second order kinetic equitation is known so the mechanism of adsorption of organic compounds from water cannot be discussed on the basis of these models that is why the kinetic model describing the film and pore diffusion were also applied in this study in weber morris model table 4 eq 4 the intraparticle diffusion ip was considered to be the rate limiting step such a plot may represent a multi linearity revealing that several steps took place the rate of adsorbate uptake was mostly affected by its molecule size concentration as well as the diffusion coefficient of adsorbate in the bulk phase and the porous structure of adsorbent affinity towards adsorbent and degree of mixing plots depicted in fig 4 showed fractional ipu uptake vs square root time on mt acs as the plots were not linear over the entire time range it implied that more than one process influenced the adsorption of ipu on studied acs the multi step of graphs may be explained for several processes i e the initial part of the curve describes boundary layer diffusion whereas further linear parts visualize intraparticle diffusion if the intraparticle diffusion is the only step controlling the rate graphs pass through the origin otherwise the boundary layer is responsible to some extent for controlling the adsorption process 47 the presence of boundary layer diffusion can be deduced from the fact that the charts do not go through the origin and is expressed in the ci value table 5 in this work the ci for the ipu mt 500 koh system had negative value indicating that external film diffusion resistance occurred in this systems 48 or the was controlled by surface reaction 49 in our works on adsorption 18 41 50 we showed the relationship between the thickness of boundary layer and the affinity of phenol for hydrophilic surfaces when adsorption was carried out from water the greater the number of hydrophilic functional groups in ac the thinner the boundary layer was in the case of the adsorption of ipu on mt based acs it was found that the value of ci decreased with increase of carbon basicity i e the higher the value of phpzc the lower the value of ci due to the high basicity phpzc 10 57 and high surface area the system ipu mt 500 koh showed resistance to the migration of the adsorbate molecules from bulk solution to the adsorbed state through the boundary layer around the adsorbent as was mentioned earlier the intraparticle diffusion usually occurs in two stages the isoproturon molecules rapidly penetrate transporting pores macropores and wider mesopores as described in the first part of the plot then herbicide molecules more slowly enter smaller pores in which the final adsorption occurs the second part of the graph in this work the ip model occurs in three steps such behaviour has been already noticed in the case of dyes adsorption 51 52 and it only shows that the intraparticle diffusion in various parts of porous texture at different adsorption rate appears for intraparticle diffusion the slope of the part of the graph indicated the adsorption rate the slope of the plots expressed as k for all ipu acs systems changed in the same order that is ki kii kiii the step controlling the adsorption rate was the adsorption in micropores as the slope of the part for adsorption in smaller pores kiii was much lower than the slope of the part for adsorption in macropores or transporting pores additional confirmation that the pore diffusion controls the ipu adsorption was given by bangham s equation table 4 eq 5 the correlation coefficient for that equation was very high close to 1 and implied the important role of the pore diffusion involved in ipu adsorption 49 3 2 2 adsorption equilibrium the ipu adsorption was carried out in unbuffered solutions on char based acs the carbons used for adsorption differ significantly in the surface chemistry characteristics that is expressed in the phpzc value had similarly developed surface area but psd despite similarities in the appearing maximum had different pore volume when considering the ph of a solution during adsorption presented in table 3 it can be assumed that the electrostatic forces affected the adsorption on mt htc koh due to low phpzc value that led to negative surface charge of the ac the surface will be charged positively in the case of ipu mt 500 koh system as its surface was characterized by a very high phpzc however because in the case of adsorption of ipu no information on its ionic form in aqueous solution is given and additionally in literature the influence of ph on ipu and carbonaceous material adsorption behaviour was not studied well it is hard to predict which carbon s feature i e surface characteristics or porous texture will affect the adsorption processes to a higher extend the isotherms for ipu adsorption on activated carbons were depicted as fig 5 and can be described by different types of giles classification the isotherm for the ipu mt 500 koh belongs to the l type whereas the s type isotherm can be assigned to the ipu mt htc koh the l type isotherm was already reported in adsorption on ipu on acs 38 53 while the c type was found in adsorption on zeolites 29 the shape of the adsorption isotherm was indicative of the interaction between the components of the studied system hence the different shapes revealed different regimes of adsorption the l type indicates no strong competition between the adsorptive and the solvent for the vacant adsorption sites the type s describes the systems where a strong competition between the solvent and adsorbates for active sites appears as was mentioned earlier the hydro char based acs was acidic and in the adsorption conditions it surface is charged negatively while the acs obtained from pyro char had basic characteristics and in the adsorption system in this work it was rather positively charge surface based on that we could conclude that the isoproturon adsorption was favored on ac with basic properties this phenomenon was due to its hydrophobic nature and low solubility table 1 that enhanced the ipu adsorption on mt 500 koh however at higher equilibrium concentration where the surface characteristics did not play an important role anymore the adsorption of ipu on hydro char based ac increased and attained adsorption capacity at the level of 375 mg g 1 that was 70 the amount of ipu on pyro char based ac in present study only the langmuir table 4 eq 6 and freundlich table 4 eq 7 models were used table 6 to interpret the equilibrium adsorption isotherms the r2 values for linearized form of both equations indicated that the langmuir model r2 0 991 ensured a better fit for the ipu mt 500 koh system whereas the ipu htc koh was described better by the freundlich model table 6 as in present work none of the equations fit all studied systems for further interpretation of the ipu adsorption mechanism the amount adsorbed at equilibrium concentration 3 5 mg dm 3 qmax mg g 1 will be used generally there are limited works on the adsorption of ipu on carbonaceous material 53 some of the data were presented in table 2 the adsorption capacity of mt htc koh was comparable with the amount of ipu adsorbed on commercial ac with much lower surface area sbet but was much lower than the amount adsorbed on mt 500 koh with similar sbet in our previous studies on the phenol adsorption 41 we found a correlation between the adsorption capacity and pore volume with defined size so considering the size of ipu molecule table 1 we correlated the adsorption capacity at highest equilibrium concentration with pore of different size if the smaller size 0 43 nm of ipu rules the adsorption based on the higher pore volume of pore size less than 1 0 nm that correspond to pore size 1 5 2 time bigger than the molecules size a higher adsorption should be observed for the mt htc koh that was not our case the mt 500 htc that was characterized by higher adsorption capacity had bigger volume of micropores with bigger size this pore width corresponded well with the second size of ipu 1 2 nm additionally the contribution of pore volume with size 1 3 2 4 between the mt htc koh 0 39 cm3 g 1 and mt 500 koh 0 66 cm3 g 1 was similar to the 30 of difference between the ipu adsorption capacity for the two studied carbons it corresponded with the statement issued by kasaoka et al 47 that the removal of organic compounds from an aqueous solution is ruled by the adsorption in the pores 1 5 2 0 fold wider than the second widest dimension of adsorptive 4 conclusions in summary so far poorly studied milk thistle extrudates are promising waste biomass for the production of activated carbons both thermal or hydrothermal treatment were effective biomass valorization methods for biochar formation prior to its chemical activation as it was demonstrated koh activated carbons from solid residues obtained during pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization of waste milk thistle extrudes were very efficient in the isoproturon removal the type of applied thermal treatment method influenced the porosity development and surface characteristics the obtained acs had very low ash content the phpzc ranged from 3 85 to 10 57 while the sbet varied from 940 2970 m2 g 1 the char based acs despite similar total pore volume 1 44 vs 1 47 significantly differ in their pore size distribution the surface chemistry had strong impact on the mechanism of ipu adsorption which was mirrored in many aspects including the shape of isotherm and in the boundary layer behavior the time required to achieve the equilibrium was very short i e only 6 h in the case of char based acs and 12 h for mt koh the boundary layer effect expressed in the ci value decrease as the phpzc value of studied acs increase rather seldom observed negative value of ci in weber morris model proved that adsorption mechanism of ipu over acs was complex and multiple stages were involved the final adsorption capacity results from the porous texture of the adsorbent used as was proved by good correlation with bangham s model r2 above 0 98 the pseudo second order mechanism was found the describe the best the adsorption of ipu using examined acs with high r2 values above 0 99 the basic characteristics of surface and higher volume of pores wider than 1 3 nm will enhance the adsorption capacity of isoproturon on activated carbon nevertheless nonionic characteristics of ipu suggests that the adsorption mechanism will be shifted rather towards physical adsorption onto porous texture of adsorbent rather than to interactions with specific functional groups over acs surface declaration of competing interest nothing to declare acknowledgement the research was financially supported by the polish ministry of science and higher education as a subsidy for the faculty of chemistry of wrocław university of science and technology

waste extrudates at 190 c led to the deep leaching of the inorganic components so that its content was lower than 0 1 and 0 2 wt in hydro char and related activated carbon respectively the low ash content is desired in the case of adsorbents in the water treatment it allows to eliminate the risk of re pollution of water by the mineral impurities that can be rinsed from the acs the surface characteristics of studied acs depended on the pre treatment process prior to the activation the phpzc values were in the range between 3 85 and 10 57 the lowest phpzc was observed for mt htc koh while the mt 50 koh had the highest value the differences in the value of phpzc were the result of distinct elemental composition of activated material the pyro char was characterized by the lowest oxygen content 8 0 while the hydro char as well as the raw material had high oxygen content 27 9 and 35 1 respectively the nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 k for mt acs depicted in fig 1 are of type i bddt classification 43 which is typical for microporous sorbents although microporous structure was well developed in all tested activated carbons a significant difference between the char based acs and the raw biomass based ac were observed table 3 the bet surface area was in the range 940 2970 m2 g 1 whereas micropore volume vmicro varied from 0 36 to 1 19 cm3 g 1 the total pore volume vtotal of the char based acs varied between 1 44 and 1 47 cm3 g 1 whereas for mt koh it was 0 44 cm3 g 1 only the size distribution of micropores obtained by qsdft method was presented in fig 2 there were clearly visible changes in the pore size distribution psd in relation to the mt ac formation route the maximum of pore volume was observed at the pore width of 0 9 1 0 nm for all carbons but the volume of pore was completely different the volume of pore at that maximum varied in direction mt htc koh mt koh mt 500 koh an additional small maximum in psd was observed at wider micropore width 1 5 1 6 nm for the pyro char based ac while the mt koh carbon had more homogenous psd and did not show any wider micropores the mesopore volume increased in direction mt koh 0 08 cm3 g 1 mt 500 koh 0 28 cm3 g 1 mt htc koh 0 37 cm3 g 1 such changes in porous structure of resultant acs depended on carbon source preparation before activation process it can be stated the thermal treatment of milk thistle extrudates was responsible for the creation of primary microstructure which was developed during chemical activation with koh 3 2 adsorption of isoproturon from aqueous solution the static conditions were applied for the adsorption of isoproturon the time of attaining equilibrium and the equilibrium concentration were established for all studied acs the equilibrium adsorption isotherms were obtained only for the char based mt acs the adsorption of ipu versus time was given in fig 3 it was found that the adsorption processes were very fast only 30 min was required to achieve over 50 of equilibrium sorption capacity it took nearly six hours to attain the equilibrium for char based acs whereas double longer time was required in case of mt koh various factors were recognized as influencing the equilibrium time i e speed of agitation adsorbent particle size and porous texture the most importantly mesopores volume in present study all activated carbons were used as powders the speed of agitation was the same in all tests the main difference between the two series of tested adsorbents was the big micropore and mesopore volume the larger volume of mesopores 0 37 cm3 g 1 0 28 cm3 g 1 in char based acs resulted in a much shorter equilibrium time in comparison with mt koh characterized with skimp mesoporosity 0 08 cm3 g 1 another meaningful difference in the adsorption processes was found in the amount of ipu removed at equilibrium as high as 361 and 371 mg of ipu was adsorbed on 1 g of hydro char and pyro char based acs respectively that gives the removal of ipu at level of about 92 95 contrarily the mt koh removed only 136 mg of ipu per gram thus only 33 of ipu removal was reached and it was three fold less than for other acs the variations in the amount of ipu adsorbed at equilibrium reflected the differences in the porosity development the amount of ipu adsorbed at equilibrium raised in the same order as the surface area sbet i e mt 500 koh mt htc koh mt koh 3 2 1 adsorption kinetics model to investigate the adsorption rate the mathematical kinetics models were used to interpret the results obtained the pseudo first lagergren table 4 eq 1 and pseudo second order model table 4 eq 2 are the mostly used equations in our work both models were used to characterize the adsorption of isoproturon over mt acs additionally the elovich model table 4 eq 3 weber morris table 4 eq 4 and bangham s table 4 eq 5 equations were used to gain a deeper insight into the mechanism of adsorption kinetics the data were summarized in table 5 the correlation coefficient r2 for the lagergren equation appeared to be rather low as it was between 0 93 and 0 95 for tested systems it was probably a result of rapid initial adsorption and slow rate of achieving the equilibrium also reported in our other works 22 23 44 also the experimental qexp values were not close to the computed ones while the plot of t qt vs t showed a linear fit to experimental data as the magnitudes of correlation coefficients r2 were close to 1 0 the pseudo second order model was proper for the adsorption systems tested in present study good correlation r2 of pseudo second order model is often observed in adsorption of various pollutants it suggests occurrence of chemisorption or electron exchange between the adsorbent and pollutant 45 additionally the calculated qeq values fitted to the experimental data very well as presented in table 5 in another work on adsorption of organic compound from water on activated carbons the trend of an increase of k2 rate constant with a decrease in the time of adsorption equilibrium was noticed 18 there was no such relation found in present work the elovich equation which assumes chemical adsorption chemical reaction mechanism in nature was used in adsorption kinetics studies as well 46 the correlation coefficients r2 for that equation were the same for all acs studied in this work 0 95 however it should be emphasized that the b constant sometimes used to describe the adsorption capacity was very similar for the char based mt acs 0 19 0 16 what more the a constant was the highest for mt htc koh which indicated that the surface chemistry will influence the ipu adsorption no uniform physical definition of kinetics constant in the first and second order kinetic equitation is known so the mechanism of adsorption of organic compounds from water cannot be discussed on the basis of these models that is why the kinetic model describing the film and pore diffusion were also applied in this study in weber morris model table 4 eq 4 the intraparticle diffusion ip was considered to be the rate limiting step such a plot may represent a multi linearity revealing that several steps took place the rate of adsorbate uptake was mostly affected by its molecule size concentration as well as the diffusion coefficient of adsorbate in the bulk phase and the porous structure of adsorbent affinity towards adsorbent and degree of mixing plots depicted in fig 4 showed fractional ipu uptake vs square root time on mt acs as the plots were not linear over the entire time range it implied that more than one process influenced the adsorption of ipu on studied acs the multi step of graphs may be explained for several processes i e the initial part of the curve describes boundary layer diffusion whereas further linear parts visualize intraparticle diffusion if the intraparticle diffusion is the only step controlling the rate graphs pass through the origin otherwise the boundary layer is responsible to some extent for controlling the adsorption process 47 the presence of boundary layer diffusion can be deduced from the fact that the charts do not go through the origin and is expressed in the ci value table 5 in this work the ci for the ipu mt 500 koh system had negative value indicating that external film diffusion resistance occurred in this systems 48 or the was controlled by surface reaction 49 in our works on adsorption 18 41 50 we showed the relationship between the thickness of boundary layer and the affinity of phenol for hydrophilic surfaces when adsorption was carried out from water the greater the number of hydrophilic functional groups in ac the thinner the boundary layer was in the case of the adsorption of ipu on mt based acs it was found that the value of ci decreased with increase of carbon basicity i e the higher the value of phpzc the lower the value of ci due to the high basicity phpzc 10 57 and high surface area the system ipu mt 500 koh showed resistance to the migration of the adsorbate molecules from bulk solution to the adsorbed state through the boundary layer around the adsorbent as was mentioned earlier the intraparticle diffusion usually occurs in two stages the isoproturon molecules rapidly penetrate transporting pores macropores and wider mesopores as described in the first part of the plot then herbicide molecules more slowly enter smaller pores in which the final adsorption occurs the second part of the graph in this work the ip model occurs in three steps such behaviour has been already noticed in the case of dyes adsorption 51 52 and it only shows that the intraparticle diffusion in various parts of porous texture at different adsorption rate appears for intraparticle diffusion the slope of the part of the graph indicated the adsorption rate the slope of the plots expressed as k for all ipu acs systems changed in the same order that is ki kii kiii the step controlling the adsorption rate was the adsorption in micropores as the slope of the part for adsorption in smaller pores kiii was much lower than the slope of the part for adsorption in macropores or transporting pores additional confirmation that the pore diffusion controls the ipu adsorption was given by bangham s equation table 4 eq 5 the correlation coefficient for that equation was very high close to 1 and implied the important role of the pore diffusion involved in ipu adsorption 49 3 2 2 adsorption equilibrium the ipu adsorption was carried out in unbuffered solutions on char based acs the carbons used for adsorption differ significantly in the surface chemistry characteristics that is expressed in the phpzc value had similarly developed surface area but psd despite similarities in the appearing maximum had different pore volume when considering the ph of a solution during adsorption presented in table 3 it can be assumed that the electrostatic forces affected the adsorption on mt htc koh due to low phpzc value that led to negative surface charge of the ac the surface will be charged positively in the case of ipu mt 500 koh system as its surface was characterized by a very high phpzc however because in the case of adsorption of ipu no information on its ionic form in aqueous solution is given and additionally in literature the influence of ph on ipu and carbonaceous material adsorption behaviour was not studied well it is hard to predict which carbon s feature i e surface characteristics or porous texture will affect the adsorption processes to a higher extend the isotherms for ipu adsorption on activated carbons were depicted as fig 5 and can be described by different types of giles classification the isotherm for the ipu mt 500 koh belongs to the l type whereas the s type isotherm can be assigned to the ipu mt htc koh the l type isotherm was already reported in adsorption on ipu on acs 38 53 while the c type was found in adsorption on zeolites 29 the shape of the adsorption isotherm was indicative of the interaction between the components of the studied system hence the different shapes revealed different regimes of adsorption the l type indicates no strong competition between the adsorptive and the solvent for the vacant adsorption sites the type s describes the systems where a strong competition between the solvent and adsorbates for active sites appears as was mentioned earlier the hydro char based acs was acidic and in the adsorption conditions it surface is charged negatively while the acs obtained from pyro char had basic characteristics and in the adsorption system in this work it was rather positively charge surface based on that we could conclude that the isoproturon adsorption was favored on ac with basic properties this phenomenon was due to its hydrophobic nature and low solubility table 1 that enhanced the ipu adsorption on mt 500 koh however at higher equilibrium concentration where the surface characteristics did not play an important role anymore the adsorption of ipu on hydro char based ac increased and attained adsorption capacity at the level of 375 mg g 1 that was 70 the amount of ipu on pyro char based ac in present study only the langmuir table 4 eq 6 and freundlich table 4 eq 7 models were used table 6 to interpret the equilibrium adsorption isotherms the r2 values for linearized form of both equations indicated that the langmuir model r2 0 991 ensured a better fit for the ipu mt 500 koh system whereas the ipu htc koh was described better by the freundlich model table 6 as in present work none of the equations fit all studied systems for further interpretation of the ipu adsorption mechanism the amount adsorbed at equilibrium concentration 3 5 mg dm 3 qmax mg g 1 will be used generally there are limited works on the adsorption of ipu on carbonaceous material 53 some of the data were presented in table 2 the adsorption capacity of mt htc koh was comparable with the amount of ipu adsorbed on commercial ac with much lower surface area sbet but was much lower than the amount adsorbed on mt 500 koh with similar sbet in our previous studies on the phenol adsorption 41 we found a correlation between the adsorption capacity and pore volume with defined size so considering the size of ipu molecule table 1 we correlated the adsorption capacity at highest equilibrium concentration with pore of different size if the smaller size 0 43 nm of ipu rules the adsorption based on the higher pore volume of pore size less than 1 0 nm that correspond to pore size 1 5 2 time bigger than the molecules size a higher adsorption should be observed for the mt htc koh that was not our case the mt 500 htc that was characterized by higher adsorption capacity had bigger volume of micropores with bigger size this pore width corresponded well with the second size of ipu 1 2 nm additionally the contribution of pore volume with size 1 3 2 4 between the mt htc koh 0 39 cm3 g 1 and mt 500 koh 0 66 cm3 g 1 was similar to the 30 of difference between the ipu adsorption capacity for the two studied carbons it corresponded with the statement issued by kasaoka et al 47 that the removal of organic compounds from an aqueous solution is ruled by the adsorption in the pores 1 5 2 0 fold wider than the second widest dimension of adsorptive 4 conclusions in summary so far poorly studied milk thistle extrudates are promising waste biomass for the production of activated carbons both thermal or hydrothermal treatment were effective biomass valorization methods for biochar formation prior to its chemical activation as it was demonstrated koh activated carbons from solid residues obtained during pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization of waste milk thistle extrudes were very efficient in the isoproturon removal the type of applied thermal treatment method influenced the porosity development and surface characteristics the obtained acs had very low ash content the phpzc ranged from 3 85 to 10 57 while the sbet varied from 940 2970 m2 g 1 the char based acs despite similar total pore volume 1 44 vs 1 47 significantly differ in their pore size distribution the surface chemistry had strong impact on the mechanism of ipu adsorption which was mirrored in many aspects including the shape of isotherm and in the boundary layer behavior the time required to achieve the equilibrium was very short i e only 6 h in the case of char based acs and 12 h for mt koh the boundary layer effect expressed in the ci value decrease as the phpzc value of studied acs increase rather seldom observed negative value of ci in weber morris model proved that adsorption mechanism of ipu over acs was complex and multiple stages were involved the final adsorption capacity results from the porous texture of the adsorbent used as was proved by good correlation with bangham s model r2 above 0 98 the pseudo second order mechanism was found the describe the best the adsorption of ipu using examined acs with high r2 values above 0 99 the basic characteristics of surface and higher volume of pores wider than 1 3 nm will enhance the adsorption capacity of isoproturon on activated carbon nevertheless nonionic characteristics of ipu suggests that the adsorption mechanism will be shifted rather towards physical adsorption onto porous texture of adsorbent rather than to interactions with specific functional groups over acs surface declaration of competing interest nothing to declare acknowledgement the research was financially supported by the polish ministry of science and higher education as

13931,a feasible approach was studied for utilizing the harvested lemna minor to treat ni electroplating waste water neww the lemna minor was pyrolyzed under oxygen limited condition at various temperatures to produce biochar firstly and the optimal biochar was selected according to the yield of biochars and the adsorption capacity of biochars to treat the simulated ni containing wastewater a combination method of pre precipitation and biochar adsorption was proposed and validated by treatment of an actual neww results indicated that the biochar fabricated from lemna minor at 400 c lm400 was the optimal biochar for ni2 adsorption and the adsorption capacity of lm400 was 41 68 mg g precipitation with 5 0 g l ca oh 2 succeeded by two step adsorption with lm400 could yield qualified treatment streams when the actual neww was treated moreover the adsorption mechanism of biochars to ni2 could mainly be ascribed to the complexation and ion exchange reactions of ni2 in wastewater with the oxygen containing functional groups and k ions of the biochar according to the results of ftir and xrd this study shows that lemna minor is a viable raw material to produce strong adsorption biochar which could be used as excellent adsorbents for heavy metals such as ni cu and zn meanwhile the actual neww treated with the combined process of two steps could meet discharge requirements keywords lemna minor biochar nickel electroplating wastewater preliminary precipitation two step adsorption 1 introduction electroplating wastewaters are mainly rinse wastewaters from electroplating metallurgy printing and nonferrous metal smelting industries it contains a large amount of heavy metals such as cu cr pb zn and ni 1 ni2 accumulates in the food chain and poses serious risks to ecosystem security and human health because of its strong toxicity potential carcinogenicity stable morphology and low biodegradability 2 in addition actual ni electroplating waste water neww is strongly acidic and has a complex composition for example it often contains high concentrations of nh4 po4 3 cu zn and other pollutants in addition to ni neww also features high chromaticity and turbidity which prevent neww from meeting discharge requirements drs through traditional or single methods gb21900 2008 ni 0 5 mg l at present the methods used to treat ni electroplating wastewater mainly consists of processes using microfiltration membrane reverse osmosis and ion exchange 3 or the combined process of photocatalytic degradation fenton oxidation and flocculation precipitation 4 5 or the process combined nanofiltration microbial desalination and chemical production cell with fenton process etc 6 although these methods can purify ni containing wastewater they often have some drawbacks such as high costs complicated processes unstable treatment efficiency and difficulties in meeting discharge requirements the above drawbacks necessitate the exploration of a novel method for the efficient treatment of neww biochar exhibits superior properties in heavy metal adsorption due to its numerous surface pores and usually is produced through pyrolyzing bioresidues of high carbon content under anoxic conditions 7 8 there are a wide variety of raw materials for biochar production and terrestrial plants are the dominant raw materials at present for example cheng et al adopted peanut shell to produce biochar which had an adsorption capacity of 25 0 mg g for cd in an aqueous solution 9 while runtti et al adopted wood chips to produce biochar that had the maximum adsorption capacity of 18 0 mg g for ni in an aqueous solution 10 though aquatic plants contain higher carbon level widely distributed around the world scientists did not pay much attention to it among the aquatic plants lemna minor is the most widely distributed aquatic plant and characterized as lower growth environment requirements and a high growth rate 11 it has been reported that lemna minor has a strong absorption capacity for heavy metals such as lead and cadmium during its growth period 12 14 however whether the biochar produced from lemna minor still has the efficient adsorption capacity for heavy metals remains to be explored moreover most researches testing the adsorption capacity of biochar to heavy metals used a simulated wastewater which could be very different from the heavy metals in the actual wastewater 15 17 to solve the above problems this study used lemna minor to produce biochars through pyrolysis processes under an oxygen limited condition at various temperatures and selected the optimal biochar for an actual neww treatment a typical process was proposed and explored to treat actual neww based on the combination of biochar adsorption and ca oh 2 precipitation therefore this study could provide a feasible approach for the utilization of lemna minor and the treatment of actual neww simultaneously 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical agent ni no3 2 6h2o ca oh 2 and the other reagents used in this experiment were purchased from tianjin kermel chemical pharmaceutical co ltd 2 2 preparation and production of biochar the lemna minor used in this experiment was collected from an artificial lake of xi an and air dried naturally for 7 days then the lemna minor was cleaned with deionized water and was ground into powder subsequently the lemna minor was roasted in an oven at 105 c for 24 h to a constant weight and the dried powder was passed through a 60 mesh screen the dried powder was compacted in a series of 100 ml porcelain crucibles with covered lids to ensure oxygen limited environment and then placed in a box resistance muffle furnace sx 4 10 to pyrolyze at 200 c 300 c 400 c 500 c 600 c and 700 c for 2 h respectively later the pyrolyzed powder was passed through a 60 mesh screen after cooling to room temperature and the biochar was acquired the prepared biochar was repeatedly washed with distilled water to remove the ash content in the sample and then the washed biochar was dried in an oven at 60 c for 24 h and stored in a desiccator for later use these biochars were numbered as lm200 lm300 lm400 lm500 lm600 and lm700 respectively 2 3 selection and characterization of biochar 2 3 1 selection of the optimal biochar different biochars were tested to select the optimal adsorption media for ni2 in the simulated wastewater which had seven initial ni2 concentrations of 25 50 100 200 300 400 and 500 mg l and was adjusted ph to 7 0 0 2 a total of 49 centrifuge tubes 50 ml were numbered and loaded with 40 ml aliquots of the above solution for seven groups in each group one sample was used as the control and the other six tubes were loaded with 0 2 g different biochars after the centrifuge tubes were shaken at 200 rpm and 25 0 5 c for 12 h in a shaker the supernatants were filtered with 0 22 μm filters and the residual ni2 concentrations were measured in addition the yield of biochar was calculated on the basis of the mass difference of the lemna minor between before roasting and after screening the optimal biochar was selected according to its adsorption performance energy consumption and yields of biochars 2 3 2 characterization of the optimal biochar the surface functional group and mineral composition of the optimal biochar were determined through fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is50 and x ray diffractometer xrd ultimqlv respectively 2 4 treatment of actual ni electroplating wastewater neww with the optimal biochar 2 4 1 water quality of actual neww and discharge requirements drs the neww used in this experiment was collected from an electroplating factory for mobile phone shell production in chengdu china the wastewater quality and drs are shown in table 1 2 4 2 adsorption performance of the optimal biochar on actual neww two 250 ml flasks were loaded with 150 ml of actual neww one flask was used as the control whereas the other was loaded with 0 75 g of optimal biochar both flasks were shaken in a shaker at 200 rpm and 25 0 5 c for 12 h after mixing the supernatants were collected for the detection of turbidity ph and salinity after 0 5 h of standing and then filtered through a 0 45 um acetate membrane for the measurement of nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations as well as the residual concentrations of heavy metals ni cu and zn the removal rates was measured using the following formula 1 1 removal rate η c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of pollutant respectively 2 4 3 effect of chemical precipitation combined with biochar adsorption 2 4 3 1 dosage optimization of ca oh 2 nine 250 ml beakers were numbered and loaded with 150 ml aliquots of the actual neww one was used as the control and the other eight beakers were added into ca oh 2 with the dosages of 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 g l respectively all the beakers were stirred at 200 rpm for 2 min and then at 50 rpm for 10 min in a constant temperature oscillator hj 6s then the turbidity ph salinity and the concentrations of nh4 n po4 3 p and heavy metal ni cu and zn were determined after the mixtures had been settled for 30 min and two appropriate dosages were selected after comparison 2 4 3 2 combination of chemical precipitation and biochar adsorption 2 4 3 2 1 chemical precipitation followed by one step biochar adsorption a total eighteen flasks 250 ml divided equally into two groups were loaded with 150 ml aliquots of supernatant obtained after precipitation with ca oh 2 in each group one of the flasks was used as the control and the other eight flasks were added the optimal biochar at the dosages of 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 g l respectively adsorption performance were measured as previously described 2 4 3 2 2 chemical precipitation followed by two step biochar adsorption second step adsorption tests were conducted based on the optimal precipitant and biochar dosages nine 250 ml flasks were loaded with 150 ml aliquots of the supernatant obtained from one step adsorption one was used as the control and the other eight flasks were added with the optimal biochar at dosages of 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 g l respectively adsorption performance were measured as previously described 2 5 analytical methods ni cu and zn were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry solaar atomic absorption spectrometer ice 3000 series the ph values of the solutions were measured using a ph meter phs 3c and salinity was measured by using a portable mineralization meter az8371 turbidity nh4 n and po4 3 p were analyzed with a spectrophotometer xinmao752 n 2 6 statistical analysis all the batch experiments were conducted in triplicate and the mean value was used for the calculation of the adsorption capacity and removal rate the spss computer package pasw statistics 22 0 was used to calculate means and standard deviation 3 results 3 1 selection of optimal biochar 3 1 1 change of the biochar yield with the various pyrolysis temperatures change of the biochar yield with the various pyrolysis temperatures is shown in table 2 table 2 showed that the biochar yield was decreased with the pyrolysis temperature increase it was obvious that the biochar yield was relatively low when the pyrolysis temperature was higher than 400 c 3 1 2 adsorption capacity of biochars to ni2 in the simulated wastewater fig 1 presents the adsorption performance of different biochars at various initial ni2 concentration it is clear that the amount of ni2 ions adsorbed by the biochar was increased when the initial ni2 concentration was increased the adsorption capacity was increased rapidly when the initial concentration of ni2 was below 200 mg l but increased gradually when the initial concentration of ni2 was above 200 mg l at the same dose 5 0 g l the biochars of lm600 lm500 and lm400 had a ni2 removal rate more than of 90 at the ni2 concentration was 200 mg l the adsorption capacity of the six adsorbents in the simulated wastewater followed the order of lm600 lm500 lm400 lm700 lm300 lm200 with 43 90 42 84 41 68 40 82 33 96 and 21 43 mg g respectively it can be concluded that there is no significant difference in the adsorption capacity of ni2 among lm400 lm500 lm600 and lm700 therefore lm400 the biochar produced through the pyrolysis of lemna minor at 400 c was selected as the optimal biochar based on the overall consideration of biochar yield adsorption capacity and pyrolysis temperature equal to energy consumption 3 2 characterization of optimal biochar before and after ni2 adsorption 3 2 1 ftir analysis fig 2 shows the ftir spectra of the optimal biochar lm400 before and after ni2 adsorption the spectra of biochar before ni2 adsorption presented broad and strong peaks near 3 421 26 cm 1 and intense absorption peaks near 1 431 97 and 1 115 88 cm 1 absorption peaks were observed near 1 577 38 and 874 74 cm 1 in the spectra of biochar the peaks observed near 3 421 26 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of oh 18 intense co3 2 peaks were located near 1 431 97 cm 1 19 the absorption bands observed at 1 115 88 cm 1 could be assigned to the co stretching vibration 20 the peak at 1 577 38 cm 1 was attributed to the coo stretching vibration and the peaks at 874 74 cm 1 corresponded to the ch out of plane bending vibration of the aromatic ring 21 most of the peaks shown in fig 2 except for those corresponding to co3 2 and ch exhibited drastic changes in wave number or intensity after ni2 adsorption for example ni2 adsorption caused the wave number of the oh stretching vibration to shift from 3 421 26 cm 1 to 3 405 05 cm 1 and the absorption intensity of coo at 1 577 38 cm 1 in the spectra of biochar drastically reduced furthermore the wave number of the co stretching vibration had shifted from 1 115 88 cm 1 to 1 048 48 cm 1 3 2 2 xrd analysis fig 3 shows the xrd patterns of optimal biochar lm400 before and after ni2 adsorption the diffraction peaks of kcl and caco3 appeared sharp in the patterns of the optimal biochar before ni2 adsorption this result indicates that lm400 were mainly composed of kcl and caco3 kcl diffraction peaks weakened in the xrd patterns of the biochar compositions after ni2 adsorption and numerous diffraction peaks that correspond to nickel carbide nicx appeared 3 3 effect of lm400 on the actual neww 3 3 1 adsorption performance only by lm400 table 3 shows the effect of biochar adsorption on neww without pretreatment it exhibited the turbidity and nh4 n removal rates reached 92 33 and 89 54 accompanied with a small increase of ph value in neww after lm400 adsorption at the dose of 5 0 g l although cu and zn removal rates were 77 37 and 61 48 the ni removal rate from neww was only 37 22 which was lower than that from simulated wastewater under similar conditions in addition only quarter of the po4 3 p was removed however the color of neww changed from pink to transparent after direct biochar adsorption this result indicates that biochar has an excellent capacity for wastewater decolorization but a limited adsorption ability for ni and po4 3 p from actual neww it demonstrated that the performance of biochar adsorption is hindered by the complex composition and high pollutant concentration in neww 3 3 2 combination of chemical precipitation and lm400 adsorption 3 3 2 1 chemical precipitation using ca oh 2 with different dosages table 4 shows the effect of ca oh 2 dosages on neww it is obvious that the ph value of the neww was increased obviously with increasing ca oh 2 dosages while the turbidity and the concentrations of nh4 n po4 3 p ni cu zn were decreased as ca oh 2 dosage increased vpp vsf was adopted to represent the volume ratio of the precipitation product to the supernatant fluid after 0 5 h precipitation and it was also increased with increasing ca oh 2 dosage this indicates that higher ca oh 2 dosages would produce extra precipitation products hence the water quality and precipitation product amount must be balanced when ca oh 2 was used as the precipitant in the actual applications table 4 showed the measurable precipitation production was 3 0 g l and the acceptable precipitation production was 5 0 g l for ca oh 2 the removal rates of po4 3 p and ni were 97 79 and 78 67 respectively and the ph value was close to neutral at the dosage of 5 0 g l when the dosage of ca oh 2 increased to 6 0 g l ph value increased to 8 41 and the volume of precipitation product doubled to that of 5 0 g l dosage although the removal rates of po4 3 p and ni reached 99 05 and 94 63 respectively precipitation production sharply increased when ca oh 2 dosage exceeded 6 0 g l so a higher ca oh 2 dosage could reduce the pollutant concentration but increase the precipitate production and ph value therefore ca oh 2 dosages of 5 0 and 6 0 g l were selected for subsequent experiments in consideration of water quality and precipitation production 3 3 2 2 combination of precipitation and lm400 adsorption 3 3 2 2 1 effect of chemical precipitation succeeded by one step biochar adsorption after the pretreatment of neww with 5 0 or 6 0 g l ca oh 2 the supernatants were collected for one step lm400 adsorption and the result is shown in fig 4 fig 4 illustrated that ni nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations were decreased with the addition of lm400 after neww was pretreated with ca oh 2 the concentrations of all pollutants were decreased sharply when lm400 dosage was increased from 1 0 g l to 4 0 g l regardless of the ca oh 2 dosage used in the pre precipitation process hereafter the pollutant concentration was stabilized even if lm400 dosage was increased to 8 0 g l thus the residual ni concentration in neww remained at 0 89 and 0 53 mg l after pre precipitation with 5 0 and 6 0 g l ca oh 2 succeeded by adsorption with 8 0 g l lm400 therefore the wastewater quality did not reach the drs for neww which required ni concentration below 0 5 mg l hence chemical precipitation followed by one step biochar adsorption failed to meet the requirement for discharging based on the overall consideration of costs and treatment performances pre precipitation with 5 0 g l ca oh 2 followed by adsorption with 2 0 g l lm400 was adopted as the optimal dosage combination for one step adsorption 3 3 2 2 2 effect of two step biochar adsorption the results of two step biochar adsorption based on one step adsorption is shown in table 5 which exhibited the concentration of almost all pollutants in neww were decreased rapidly and then tended to stabilize as lm400 dosage was increased except for the salinity when 3 0 g l lm400 was used for adsorption the residual po4 3 p nh4 n cu and zn concentrations and ph in neww could meet the drs meanwhile the residual ni concentration of 0 42 mg l was also below the drs ni 0 5 mg l in addition ni po4 3 p and nh4 n concentrations in neww tended to stabilize as the biochar dosage exceeded 3 0 g l therefore 3 0 g l lm400 was adopted for the second adsorption step which can effectively treat actual neww 4 discussion 4 1 ni2 adsorption mechanism of biochars produced from lemna minor raw materials of biochar could be obtained from bamboo rice straw hardwood and agricultural wastes 22 23 this study utilized lemna minor collected from aquatic environment to produce biochars for ni adsorption from wastewater which can achieve a win win situation whether for reducing ni concentration of wastewater or utilizing the waste in aquatic environment the biochars produced in this experiment exhibited an efficient ni2 adsorption performance in the simulated wastewater for example the adsorption capacity of lm400 reached 41 68 mg g which was higher than the biochar produced from the almond shell with the adsorption capacity of 20 0 mg g 24 the excellent adsorption capacity of biochar was conferred by their characteristics such as oxygen containing functional groups and crystal composition first oxygen containing functional groups such as the carboxyl groups coo and hydroxyl groups oh of the biochar may adsorb ni2 in the solution via complexation 25 26 the ftir spectra of the biochar before and after ni2 adsorption confirmed that the changes in absorption intensity and the wave number shift of the functional groups could be attributed to the interaction of metal ions with the active sites of the biochar through complexation 27 28 in addition the ion exchange between k ions and ni2 ions is another good reason to remove ni2 ions by the biochar although ni2 ions can also form precipitates on the biochar surface with co3 2 and other acid ions in biochar xrd analysis indicated that the biochar mainly contained caco3 and kcl crystals consistent with previous reports the pronounced decrease in the diffraction peak of kcl and the appearance of the diffraction peak of nicx may be attributed to the ion exchange mechanism between k and ni2 ions 29 however in contrast to previous results the mineral component co3 2 and oh in biochar produced from lemna minor negligibly contributed to ni2 absorption 30 32 4 2 feasibility of combining precipitation with biochar adsorption for the treatment of neww this study proposed a feasible and simple process for actual neww treatment as shown in fig 5 which combined ca oh 2 precipitation with biochar adsorption together as discussed previously the biochar produced from lemna minor had strong adsorption capacity to ni in wastewater as well as to other heavy metals such as cu and zn in addition some obvious advantages such as abundant source of raw materials convenient and low energy consumption biochar production process and simple operation also made a good utilization of lemna minor however this study found that biochar adsorption without pretreatment failed to meet the drs for neww which may be attributed to the characteristics of actual wastewater the extremely complex and low ph of actual wastewater would limit complexation between metal ions and oxygen containing functional groups and increase the competition between h and ni2 for the number of active sites as previously claimed 33 34 fortunately our study testified ca oh 2 could be used as ph regulator and the optimal precipitant for pollutant removal in the treatment of actual neww oh ions can elevate ph value to a suitable level for maximizing the adsorption of the biochar 29 and ca2 can react with po4 3 to form a poorly soluble amorphous metal po4 3 precipitate ca5 po4 3oh 35 meanwhile the precipitation with ca oh 2 sharply reduced the concentrations of heavy metals and nh4 in the actual neww which reduced the subsequent load for biochar adsorption however an optimal dosage of ca oh 2 is crucial to ensure an appropriate cost for neww treatment from reagent and chemical sludge in our study 5 0 g l ca oh 2 was selected as the optimal dosage based on balancing the treated wastewater quality the amount of chemical sludge produced and the reagent cost a residual ni concentration of 7 79 mg l ph value of 7 01 and an acceptable amount of chemical sludge were gained simultaneously under the optimal dosage of ca oh 2 5 conclusion this study produced biochars by using lemna minor collected from an artificial lake as raw materials the lemna minor was pyrolyzed under oxygen limited condition at different temperatures the feasibility of applying biochar to treat neww was explored and the main conclusions are as follows 1 the biochars produced from lemna minor collected from an artificial lake could adsorb ni2 from solutions effectively high pyrolysis temperatures enhanced the adsorption effect of biochars ni2 removal rates could exceed 90 under treatment with 5 0 g l lm400 xrd and ftir results indicated that the ni2 adsorption mechanisms of the biochar were mainly involved in ion exchange adsorption and complexation between heavy metal ions and the surface functional groups of biochars 2 the ni2 adsorption capacity of lm400 in simulated wastewater was 41 68 mg g lm400 alone had a limited effect on the direct treatment of actual electroplating wastewater but demonstrated an excellent capacity for the decolorization of neww neww treated through biochar adsorption succeeded by pre precipitation with ca oh 2 could meet drs 3 actual neww treated through the combined two step adsorption process with lm400 at dosages of 2 0 and 3 0 g l and pre precipitation with 5 0 g l ca oh 2 satisfied drs declaration of competing interest the authors

13931,a feasible approach was studied for utilizing the harvested lemna minor to treat ni electroplating waste water neww the lemna minor was pyrolyzed under oxygen limited condition at various temperatures to produce biochar firstly and the optimal biochar was selected according to the yield of biochars and the adsorption capacity of biochars to treat the simulated ni containing wastewater a combination method of pre precipitation and biochar adsorption was proposed and validated by treatment of an actual neww results indicated that the biochar fabricated from lemna minor at 400 c lm400 was the optimal biochar for ni2 adsorption and the adsorption capacity of lm400 was 41 68 mg g precipitation with 5 0 g l ca oh 2 succeeded by two step adsorption with lm400 could yield qualified treatment streams when the actual neww was treated moreover the adsorption mechanism of biochars to ni2 could mainly be ascribed to the complexation and ion exchange reactions of ni2 in wastewater with the oxygen containing functional groups and k ions of the biochar according to the results of ftir and xrd this study shows that lemna minor is a viable raw material to produce strong adsorption biochar which could be used as excellent adsorbents for heavy metals such as ni cu and zn meanwhile the actual neww treated with the combined process of two steps could meet discharge requirements keywords lemna minor biochar nickel electroplating wastewater preliminary precipitation two step adsorption 1 introduction electroplating wastewaters are mainly rinse wastewaters from electroplating metallurgy printing and nonferrous metal smelting industries it contains a large amount of heavy metals such as cu cr pb zn and ni 1 ni2 accumulates in the food chain and poses serious risks to ecosystem security and human health because of its strong toxicity potential carcinogenicity stable morphology and low biodegradability 2 in addition actual ni electroplating waste water neww is strongly acidic and has a complex composition for example it often contains high concentrations of nh4 po4 3 cu zn and other pollutants in addition to ni neww also features high chromaticity and turbidity which prevent neww from meeting discharge requirements drs through traditional or single methods gb21900 2008 ni 0 5 mg l at present the methods used to treat ni electroplating wastewater mainly consists of processes using microfiltration membrane reverse osmosis and ion exchange 3 or the combined process of photocatalytic degradation fenton oxidation and flocculation precipitation 4 5 or the process combined nanofiltration microbial desalination and chemical production cell with fenton process etc 6 although these methods can purify ni containing wastewater they often have some drawbacks such as high costs complicated processes unstable treatment efficiency and difficulties in meeting discharge requirements the above drawbacks necessitate the exploration of a novel method for the efficient treatment of neww biochar exhibits superior properties in heavy metal adsorption due to its numerous surface pores and usually is produced through pyrolyzing bioresidues of high carbon content under anoxic conditions 7 8 there are a wide variety of raw materials for biochar production and terrestrial plants are the dominant raw materials at present for example cheng et al adopted peanut shell to produce biochar which had an adsorption capacity of 25 0 mg g for cd in an aqueous solution 9 while runtti et al adopted wood chips to produce biochar that had the maximum adsorption capacity of 18 0 mg g for ni in an aqueous solution 10 though aquatic plants contain higher carbon level widely distributed around the world scientists did not pay much attention to it among the aquatic plants lemna minor is the most widely distributed aquatic plant and characterized as lower growth environment requirements and a high growth rate 11 it has been reported that lemna minor has a strong absorption capacity for heavy metals such as lead and cadmium during its growth period 12 14 however whether the biochar produced from lemna minor still has the efficient adsorption capacity for heavy metals remains to be explored moreover most researches testing the adsorption capacity of biochar to heavy metals used a simulated wastewater which could be very different from the heavy metals in the actual wastewater 15 17 to solve the above problems this study used lemna minor to produce biochars through pyrolysis processes under an oxygen limited condition at various temperatures and selected the optimal biochar for an actual neww treatment a typical process was proposed and explored to treat actual neww based on the combination of biochar adsorption and ca oh 2 precipitation therefore this study could provide a feasible approach for the utilization of lemna minor and the treatment of actual neww simultaneously 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical agent ni no3 2 6h2o ca oh 2 and the other reagents used in this experiment were purchased from tianjin kermel chemical pharmaceutical co ltd 2 2 preparation and production of biochar the lemna minor used in this experiment was collected from an artificial lake of xi an and air dried naturally for 7 days then the lemna minor was cleaned with deionized water and was ground into powder subsequently the lemna minor was roasted in an oven at 105 c for 24 h to a constant weight and the dried powder was passed through a 60 mesh screen the dried powder was compacted in a series of 100 ml porcelain crucibles with covered lids to ensure oxygen limited environment and then placed in a box resistance muffle furnace sx 4 10 to pyrolyze at 200 c 300 c 400 c 500 c 600 c and 700 c for 2 h respectively later the pyrolyzed powder was passed through a 60 mesh screen after cooling to room temperature and the biochar was acquired the prepared biochar was repeatedly washed with distilled water to remove the ash content in the sample and then the washed biochar was dried in an oven at 60 c for 24 h and stored in a desiccator for later use these biochars were numbered as lm200 lm300 lm400 lm500 lm600 and lm700 respectively 2 3 selection and characterization of biochar 2 3 1 selection of the optimal biochar different biochars were tested to select the optimal adsorption media for ni2 in the simulated wastewater which had seven initial ni2 concentrations of 25 50 100 200 300 400 and 500 mg l and was adjusted ph to 7 0 0 2 a total of 49 centrifuge tubes 50 ml were numbered and loaded with 40 ml aliquots of the above solution for seven groups in each group one sample was used as the control and the other six tubes were loaded with 0 2 g different biochars after the centrifuge tubes were shaken at 200 rpm and 25 0 5 c for 12 h in a shaker the supernatants were filtered with 0 22 μm filters and the residual ni2 concentrations were measured in addition the yield of biochar was calculated on the basis of the mass difference of the lemna minor between before roasting and after screening the optimal biochar was selected according to its adsorption performance energy consumption and yields of biochars 2 3 2 characterization of the optimal biochar the surface functional group and mineral composition of the optimal biochar were determined through fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is50 and x ray diffractometer xrd ultimqlv respectively 2 4 treatment of actual ni electroplating wastewater neww with the optimal biochar 2 4 1 water quality of actual neww and discharge requirements drs the neww used in this experiment was collected from an electroplating factory for mobile phone shell production in chengdu china the wastewater quality and drs are shown in table 1 2 4 2 adsorption performance of the optimal biochar on actual neww two 250 ml flasks were loaded with 150 ml of actual neww one flask was used as the control whereas the other was loaded with 0 75 g of optimal biochar both flasks were shaken in a shaker at 200 rpm and 25 0 5 c for 12 h after mixing the supernatants were collected for the detection of turbidity ph and salinity after 0 5 h of standing and then filtered through a 0 45 um acetate membrane for the measurement of nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations as well as the residual concentrations of heavy metals ni cu and zn the removal rates was measured using the following formula 1 1 removal rate η c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of pollutant respectively 2 4 3 effect of chemical precipitation combined with biochar adsorption 2 4 3 1 dosage optimization of ca oh 2 nine 250 ml beakers were numbered and loaded with 150 ml aliquots of the actual neww one was used as the control and the other eight beakers were added into ca oh 2 with the dosages of 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 g l respectively all the beakers were stirred at 200 rpm for 2 min and then at 50 rpm for 10 min in a constant temperature oscillator hj 6s then the turbidity ph salinity and the concentrations of nh4 n po4 3 p and heavy metal ni cu and zn were determined after the mixtures had been settled for 30 min and two appropriate dosages were selected after comparison 2 4 3 2 combination of chemical precipitation and biochar adsorption 2 4 3 2 1 chemical precipitation followed by one step biochar adsorption a total eighteen flasks 250 ml divided equally into two groups were loaded with 150 ml aliquots of supernatant obtained after precipitation with ca oh 2 in each group one of the flasks was used as the control and the other eight flasks were added the optimal biochar at the dosages of 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 g l respectively adsorption performance were measured as previously described 2 4 3 2 2 chemical precipitation followed by two step biochar adsorption second step adsorption tests were conducted based on the optimal precipitant and biochar dosages nine 250 ml flasks were loaded with 150 ml aliquots of the supernatant obtained from one step adsorption one was used as the control and the other eight flasks were added with the optimal biochar at dosages of 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 g l respectively adsorption performance were measured as previously described 2 5 analytical methods ni cu and zn were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry solaar atomic absorption spectrometer ice 3000 series the ph values of the solutions were measured using a ph meter phs 3c and salinity was measured by using a portable mineralization meter az8371 turbidity nh4 n and po4 3 p were analyzed with a spectrophotometer xinmao752 n 2 6 statistical analysis all the batch experiments were conducted in triplicate and the mean value was used for the calculation of the adsorption capacity and removal rate the spss computer package pasw statistics 22 0 was used to calculate means and standard deviation 3 results 3 1 selection of optimal biochar 3 1 1 change of the biochar yield with the various pyrolysis temperatures change of the biochar yield with the various pyrolysis temperatures is shown in table 2 table 2 showed that the biochar yield was decreased with the pyrolysis temperature increase it was obvious that the biochar yield was relatively low when the pyrolysis temperature was higher than 400 c 3 1 2 adsorption capacity of biochars to ni2 in the simulated wastewater fig 1 presents the adsorption performance of different biochars at various initial ni2 concentration it is clear that the amount of ni2 ions adsorbed by the biochar was increased when the initial ni2 concentration was increased the adsorption capacity was increased rapidly when the initial concentration of ni2 was below 200 mg l but increased gradually when the initial concentration of ni2 was above 200 mg l at the same dose 5 0 g l the biochars of lm600 lm500 and lm400 had a ni2 removal rate more than of 90 at the ni2 concentration was 200 mg l the adsorption capacity of the six adsorbents in the simulated wastewater followed the order of lm600 lm500 lm400 lm700 lm300 lm200 with 43 90 42 84 41 68 40 82 33 96 and 21 43 mg g respectively it can be concluded that there is no significant difference in the adsorption capacity of ni2 among lm400 lm500 lm600 and lm700 therefore lm400 the biochar produced through the pyrolysis of lemna minor at 400 c was selected as the optimal biochar based on the overall consideration of biochar yield adsorption capacity and pyrolysis temperature equal to energy consumption 3 2 characterization of optimal biochar before and after ni2 adsorption 3 2 1 ftir analysis fig 2 shows the ftir spectra of the optimal biochar lm400 before and after ni2 adsorption the spectra of biochar before ni2 adsorption presented broad and strong peaks near 3 421 26 cm 1 and intense absorption peaks near 1 431 97 and 1 115 88 cm 1 absorption peaks were observed near 1 577 38 and 874 74 cm 1 in the spectra of biochar the peaks observed near 3 421 26 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of oh 18 intense co3 2 peaks were located near 1 431 97 cm 1 19 the absorption bands observed at 1 115 88 cm 1 could be assigned to the co stretching vibration 20 the peak at 1 577 38 cm 1 was attributed to the coo stretching vibration and the peaks at 874 74 cm 1 corresponded to the ch out of plane bending vibration of the aromatic ring 21 most of the peaks shown in fig 2 except for those corresponding to co3 2 and ch exhibited drastic changes in wave number or intensity after ni2 adsorption for example ni2 adsorption caused the wave number of the oh stretching vibration to shift from 3 421 26 cm 1 to 3 405 05 cm 1 and the absorption intensity of coo at 1 577 38 cm 1 in the spectra of biochar drastically reduced furthermore the wave number of the co stretching vibration had shifted from 1 115 88 cm 1 to 1 048 48 cm 1 3 2 2 xrd analysis fig 3 shows the xrd patterns of optimal biochar lm400 before and after ni2 adsorption the diffraction peaks of kcl and caco3 appeared sharp in the patterns of the optimal biochar before ni2 adsorption this result indicates that lm400 were mainly composed of kcl and caco3 kcl diffraction peaks weakened in the xrd patterns of the biochar compositions after ni2 adsorption and numerous diffraction peaks that correspond to nickel carbide nicx appeared 3 3 effect of lm400 on the actual neww 3 3 1 adsorption performance only by lm400 table 3 shows the effect of biochar adsorption on neww without pretreatment it exhibited the turbidity and nh4 n removal rates reached 92 33 and 89 54 accompanied with a small increase of ph value in neww after lm400 adsorption at the dose of 5 0 g l although cu and zn removal rates were 77 37 and 61 48 the ni removal rate from neww was only 37 22 which was lower than that from simulated wastewater under similar conditions in addition only quarter of the po4 3 p was removed however the color of neww changed from pink to transparent after direct biochar adsorption this result indicates that biochar has an excellent capacity for wastewater decolorization but a limited adsorption ability for ni and po4 3 p from actual neww it demonstrated that the performance of biochar adsorption is hindered by the complex composition and high pollutant concentration in neww 3 3 2 combination of chemical precipitation and lm400 adsorption 3 3 2 1 chemical precipitation using ca oh 2 with different dosages table 4 shows the effect of ca oh 2 dosages on neww it is obvious that the ph value of the neww was increased obviously with increasing ca oh 2 dosages while the turbidity and the concentrations of nh4 n po4 3 p ni cu zn were decreased as ca oh 2 dosage increased vpp vsf was adopted to represent the volume ratio of the precipitation product to the supernatant fluid after 0 5 h precipitation and it was also increased with increasing ca oh 2 dosage this indicates that higher ca oh 2 dosages would produce extra precipitation products hence the water quality and precipitation product amount must be balanced when ca oh 2 was used as the precipitant in the actual applications table 4 showed the measurable precipitation production was 3 0 g l and the acceptable precipitation production was 5 0 g l for ca oh 2 the removal rates of po4 3 p and ni were 97 79 and 78 67 respectively and the ph value was close to neutral at the dosage of 5 0 g l when the dosage of ca oh 2 increased to 6 0 g l ph value increased to 8 41 and the volume of precipitation product doubled to that of 5 0 g l dosage although the removal rates of po4 3 p and ni reached 99 05 and 94 63 respectively precipitation production sharply increased when ca oh 2 dosage exceeded 6 0 g l so a higher ca oh 2 dosage could reduce the pollutant concentration but increase the precipitate production and ph value therefore ca oh 2 dosages of 5 0 and 6 0 g l were selected for subsequent experiments in consideration of water quality and precipitation production 3 3 2 2 combination of precipitation and lm400 adsorption 3 3 2 2 1 effect of chemical precipitation succeeded by one step biochar adsorption after the pretreatment of neww with 5 0 or 6 0 g l ca oh 2 the supernatants were collected for one step lm400 adsorption and the result is shown in fig 4 fig 4 illustrated that ni nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations were decreased with the addition of lm400 after neww was pretreated with ca oh 2 the concentrations of all pollutants were decreased sharply when lm400 dosage was increased from 1 0 g l to 4 0 g l regardless of the ca oh 2 dosage used in the pre precipitation process hereafter the pollutant concentration was stabilized even if lm400 dosage was increased to 8 0 g l thus the residual ni concentration in neww remained at 0 89 and 0 53 mg l after pre precipitation with 5 0 and 6 0 g l ca oh 2 succeeded by adsorption with 8 0 g l lm400 therefore the wastewater quality did not reach the drs for neww which required ni concentration below 0 5 mg l hence chemical precipitation followed by one step biochar adsorption failed to meet the requirement for discharging based on the overall consideration of costs and treatment performances pre precipitation with 5 0 g l ca oh 2 followed by adsorption with 2 0 g l lm400 was adopted as the optimal dosage combination for one step adsorption 3 3 2 2 2 effect of two step biochar adsorption the results of two step biochar adsorption based on one step adsorption is shown in table 5 which exhibited the concentration of almost all pollutants in neww were decreased rapidly and then tended to stabilize as lm400 dosage was increased except for the salinity when 3 0 g l lm400 was used for adsorption the residual po4 3 p nh4 n cu and zn concentrations and ph in neww could meet the drs meanwhile the residual ni concentration of 0 42 mg l was also below the drs ni 0 5 mg l in addition ni po4 3 p and nh4 n concentrations in neww tended to stabilize as the biochar dosage exceeded 3 0 g l therefore 3 0 g l lm400 was adopted for the second adsorption step which can effectively treat actual neww 4 discussion 4 1 ni2 adsorption mechanism of biochars produced from lemna minor raw materials of biochar could be obtained from bamboo rice straw hardwood and agricultural wastes 22 23 this study utilized lemna minor collected from aquatic

was higher than the biochar produced from the almond shell with the adsorption capacity of 20 0 mg g 24 the excellent adsorption capacity of biochar was conferred by their characteristics such as oxygen containing functional groups and crystal composition first oxygen containing functional groups such as the carboxyl groups coo and hydroxyl groups oh of the biochar may adsorb ni2 in the solution via complexation 25 26 the ftir spectra of the biochar before and after ni2 adsorption confirmed that the changes in absorption intensity and the wave number shift of the functional groups could be attributed to the interaction of metal ions with the active sites of the biochar through complexation 27 28 in addition the ion exchange between k ions and ni2 ions is another good reason to remove ni2 ions by the biochar although ni2 ions can also form precipitates on the biochar surface with co3 2 and other acid ions in biochar xrd analysis indicated that the biochar mainly contained caco3 and kcl crystals consistent with previous reports the pronounced decrease in the diffraction peak of kcl and the appearance of the diffraction peak of nicx may be attributed to the ion exchange mechanism between k and ni2 ions 29 however in contrast to previous results the mineral component co3 2 and oh in biochar produced from lemna minor negligibly contributed to ni2 absorption 30 32 4 2 feasibility of combining precipitation with biochar adsorption for the treatment of neww this study proposed a feasible and simple process for actual neww treatment as shown in fig 5 which combined ca oh 2 precipitation with biochar adsorption together as discussed previously the biochar produced from lemna minor had strong adsorption capacity to ni in wastewater as well as to other heavy metals such as cu and zn in addition some obvious advantages such as abundant source of raw materials convenient and low energy consumption biochar production process and simple operation also made a good utilization of lemna minor however this study found that biochar adsorption without pretreatment failed to meet the drs for neww which may be attributed to the characteristics of actual wastewater the extremely complex and low ph of actual wastewater would limit complexation between metal ions and oxygen containing functional groups and increase the competition between h and ni2 for the number of active sites as previously claimed 33 34 fortunately our study testified ca oh 2 could be used as ph regulator and the optimal precipitant for pollutant removal in the treatment of actual neww oh ions can elevate ph value to a suitable level for maximizing the adsorption of the biochar 29 and ca2 can react with po4 3 to form a poorly soluble amorphous metal po4 3 precipitate ca5 po4 3oh 35 meanwhile the precipitation with ca oh 2 sharply reduced the concentrations of heavy metals and nh4 in the actual neww which reduced the subsequent load for biochar adsorption however an optimal dosage of ca oh 2 is crucial to ensure an appropriate cost for neww treatment from reagent and chemical sludge in our study 5 0 g l ca oh 2 was selected as the optimal dosage based on balancing the treated wastewater quality the amount of chemical sludge produced and the reagent cost a residual ni concentration of 7 79 mg l ph value of 7 01 and an acceptable amount of chemical sludge were gained simultaneously under the optimal dosage of ca oh 2 5 conclusion this study produced biochars by using lemna minor collected from an artificial lake as raw materials the lemna minor was pyrolyzed under oxygen limited condition at different temperatures the feasibility of applying biochar to treat neww was explored and the main conclusions are as follows 1 the biochars produced from lemna minor collected from an artificial lake could adsorb ni2 from solutions effectively high pyrolysis temperatures enhanced the adsorption effect of biochars ni2 removal rates could exceed 90 under treatment

plant of jamnagar gujarat the wastewater treatment plant capacity to treat the water is 70 mld designed with the peak factor of 2 25 the wwtp was established for the protection of the marine biodiversity and resources under sustainable development of coastal region conservation the plant started its operation in august 2016 the treated water is discharged to rangmati and nagmati rivers which are connected to arabian sea in marine national park coastline the web location of jmc wwtp is detailed in supplementary information the domestic wastewater is collected through the sewer network of the city to a central location which is then pumped to the wastewater treatment plant the wwtp is located near rangmati and nagmati rivers in navagam the influent wastewater is treated in

indicated in each cell in the table a matrix of correlation is used to summarise data as input into a more complex analysis and as diagnosis for advanced analysis 42 it determines whether the relationship between two variables is present or not and that two variables are associated to a certain degree the degree of linearity between two variables was derived from the coefficient of

when the correlation coefficient was between 0 1 and 0 3 an average positive negative linear correlation when it was between 0 3 and 0 7 and a strong positive negative linear correlation when it was

like the human brain and trained to create a superhuman intelligence to emulate the presence of faecal coliform in treated water through historical data collection 44 the key difference between different types of ann models is the training function and the adaptive learning function used for model training the most used training function is trainlm and adaptation learning function is learngdm the performance function used for model training is mean square error mse which is used to train ann models to reduce the difference between model output and target output 41 the training of neural network is sensitive to the number of neurons in the hidden layer the more the number of hidden neurons better is the performance of neural network in fitting the data however it must be taken into account that presence of numerous neurons in hidden layer can be a reason for overfitting 45 the architecture of ann should be like a pyramid 1 n u m b e r o f h i d d e n n e u r o n s n u m b e

two separate data sets 1 data set includes 67 245 d data used for model training and 2 the remaining 33 120 d data as testing validation data set the training data set was used for training ann models and validation data set was used for the independent validation of the developed ann model to check how well the developed model generalises the unseen data set the ann models were trained using levenberg marquardt backpropagation algorithm gradient descent with momentum weight and bias learning function was used as adaptive learning function for model training the developed ann models and number of input parameters were fixed the network architecture was changed by varying the number of hidden neurons in the hidden layer the number of hidden neurons varied from 2 10 in the hidden layer

between 0 7 and 1 0 43 the correlation matrix for influent water quality parameters and effluent faecal and total coliform is shown in table 2 2 4 ann model development ann models are designed to work like the human brain and trained to create a superhuman intelligence to emulate the presence of faecal coliform in treated water through historical data collection 44 the key difference between different types of ann models is the training function and the adaptive learning function used for model training the most used training function is trainlm and adaptation learning function is learngdm the performance function used for model training is mean square error mse which is used to train ann models to reduce the difference between model output and target output 41 the training of neural network is sensitive to the number of neurons in the hidden layer the more the number of hidden neurons better is the performance of neural network in fitting the data however it must be taken into account that presence of numerous neurons in hidden layer can be a reason for overfitting 45 the architecture of ann should be like a pyramid 1 n u m b e r o f h i d d e n n e u r o n s n u m b e

o n s i n i n p u t l a y e r 1 the eqs 1 and 2 were used to select the range of hidden neurons 46 the artificial neural network contains three layers input hidden and output layers fig 2 depicts the architecture of developed ann models which contain an input layer of 10 input parameters a hidden layer of 10 to 2 hidden neurons and an output layer of a parameter at a time fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of developed ann models the developed model predicts the concentration of faecal coliform and total coliform in the wwtp effluent the ann models were developed and validated in matlab r2019b the modelling process for faecal coliform and total coliform prediction using ann model is shown in fig 4 the wwtp influent and effluent water quality data set was first randomised and then divided in two separate data sets 1 data set includes 67 245 d data used for model training and 2 the remaining 33 120 d data as testing validation data set the training data set was used for training ann models and validation data set was used for the independent validation of the developed ann model to check how well the developed model generalises the unseen data set the ann models were trained using levenberg marquardt backpropagation algorithm gradient descent with momentum weight and bias learning function was used as adaptive learning function for model training the developed ann models and number of input parameters were fixed the network architecture was changed by varying the number of hidden neurons in the hidden layer the number of hidden neurons varied from 2 10 in the hidden layer there were 9 models developed for each predicted parameter the developed ann models for predication of faecal coliform and total coliform in wwtp effluent were analysed by calculating correlation coefficient r mad rmse and mape using eq no 3 6 these values were analysed for optimisation to select the best model out of all the simulated models 3 r j 1 n y o j y o j x y p j y p j j 1 n y o j y o

discussion 3 1 performance of the ann model the performance of ann models was analysed by calculating correlation coefficient mad mape and rmse the correlation coefficient values for faecal coliform prediction were from 0 920 to 0 986 while for total coliform prediction the values were from 0 878 to 0 977 the highest correlation of 0 986 was observed in ann model 10 61 for faecal coliform which is significantly higher than astray et al 47 the correlation coefficient of 0 977 was optimum in ann model 10 8 1 for the total coliform which close to anupam et al 45 wang and deng developed a ann model for the prediction of faecal coliform concentration in louisiana gulf coast with correlation coefficient of 0 742 which is significantly lower than our study 48 the correlation coefficient more close to 1 the predicted value is close to the actual value the mad value for faecal coliform prediction varies from 0 494 to 1 212 and for total coliform prediction varies it differs from 0 839 to 1 906 the minimum mad for faecal coliform was ann model 10 6 1 and for total coliform was ann model 10 8 1 the mape varies from 4 593 to 11 334 for faecal coliform and 4 950 11 500 for total coliform the standard deviation of residuals prediction errors is rmse residuals measure how far data points are from the regression line rmse is a measure of how these residuals are distributed the rmse was observed as 0 603 1 468 for faecal coliform prediction and 0 990 2 297 for total coliform respectively the correlation coefficient mad mape and rmse variation with number of hidden neuron for faecal and total coliform are detailed in supplementary information the actual and predicted percentage elimination of faecal coliform and total coliform in the jmc wwtp wastewater process is presented in table 3 actual mean percentage removal of faecal coliform in the wastewater process was 95 20 and the mean of predicted removal rate was 95 14 the difference of 0 06 was observed in the actual and the predicted removal rate using selected ann 10 6 1 model hendricks and pool reported 92 removal of faecal coliform in conventional activated sludge plants which is lower than iceas sbr based jmc wwtp 49 the faecal coliform and total coliform removal rates were higher in jmc wwtp due to extended aeration in the bioreactor 50 fig 5 a illustrates the percentage of actual and predicted removal of faecal coliform through selected ann 10 6 1 model during the independent validation in case of total coliform the mean of actual percentage removal was 95 11 in wastewater treatment and 95 08 through the selected predicted ann model the sequential batch reactor sbr operates on high mixed liquor suspended solids mlss level and longer mean cell retention time results in enhanced removal of the microbial pathogens 50 fig 5 b shows the actual and the predicted percentage removal of total coliform through selected ann 10 8 1 model during independent validation phase the observed and predicted values in independent validation of selected ann model 10 6 1 for the faecal coliform in treated water effluent from jmc wwtp are presented in fig 6 a fig 6 b shows the observed values and predicted values through ann model 10 8 1 for total coliform 3 2 factors affecting the faecal coliform and total coliform in wastewater the factors affecting the concentration of faecal coliform and total coliform in effluent were identified using pearson s correlation coefficient matrix faecal coliform showed significant positive correlation with ph and influent faecal coliform and weak positive correlation with influent total coliform it showed significant negative correlation with tss cod tkn tp and weak negative correlation with o g bod and an total coliform showed significant positive correlation with influent faecal coliform ph and influent total coliform and weak negative correlation with cod tp tss tkn o g and bod the degree of correlation between faecal coliform and influent wastewater quality parameter ranked in the following order ph tss cod tkn tp fc tc o g bod an that for total coliform and influent wastewater quality parameter ranked as fc ph tc cod tp tss tkn o g bod the ph exhibited the strongest correlation with faecal coliform and the influent faecal coliform with total coliform wahyuni showed that the faecal coliform have greater survival in neutral environments in the ph range of 6 7 in acidic environments ph less than 7 faecal coliform decreased by approximately 40 for each ph decrease while in alkaline environments ph greater than 7 faecal coliform decreased by approximately 30 for each ph increase 51 seo et al concluded that the total coliform is depending upon the organic matter while the faecal coliform is depending upon phosphate phosphorous and suspended solids concentration 43 3 3 practical applications and future research prospects the artificial neural network is the unique state of art modelling technique for complex non linear processes

running of the automated process the model simulated in this work may be further implemented for the performance investigation of pathogenic contaminant removal in wastewater treatment over a wide range of wastewater process parameters the developed ann model can predict daily and seasonal variations of faecal coliform and total coliform removal the heath of natural water sources can be analysed and regulated by automating the wastewater treatment plant to regulate the concentration of the effluent discharged the ann model makes it possible to reduce harvesting and consumption of faecally contaminated oysters and thus significantly reduce the health risk to the general public and in particular to oyster consumers the ability of the ann to predict and its ability to quickly adapt to changes in the status of a dynamic process allows an artificial neural network to be integrated into an automatic real time control system for wwtp in future 4 conclusions ann models were used to delve into the complicated interactions between the wastewater influent parameters and faecal coliform and total coliform removal in treated effluent the result provides an insight into the dependence of faecal coliform and total coliform removal in iceas sbr wwtp on influents ph bod cod tss tkn an o g tp faecal coliform and total coliform concentration the most popular feedforward backpropagation algorithm was used to model the neural networks a three layered neural network with learngdm learning function and trainlm training function was used nine feedforward backpropagation models were compared to select best fitting model for each predicted parameter the network with 6 hidden neurons 10 6 1 was optimum for faecal coliform and 8 hidden neurons 10 8 1 was optimum for total coliform mape was within 5 for both selected optimum models the results presented in this paper confirm that the developed ann models are equipped to be used in simulation work for design and development of automated wastewater treatment plant for removal of faecal coliform and total coliform the developed models can predict faecal coliform and total coliform significantly and becomes successful for efficient run of an automated process the models simulated in this work can further be extended for the performance investigation of faecal coliform and total coliform removal over a

removal efficiency 1 introduction the need for fresh water has been increasing up to seven times with the fast growing world s population 1 the estimates of world health organization who revealed that 1100 million people are facing water shortage globally 2 climate change and lack of adequate infrastructure are the two major causes of water scarcity accordingly millions of humans die annually due to unhealthy drinking water 3 5 at present the biggest challenge of developing countries is to provide healthy clean and sustainable drinking water to their citizens the highest consumption of water takes place in manufacturing sector especially in paper and pulp industry which require fresh water in every stage of processes 6 water is mainly used for transporting chemicals and fibers in production process of paper the conservation of water can be achieved by using wastewater recycle technique in water management of paper mills membrane separation is the most widely used low cost energy saving and highly efficient technology for wastewater treatment due to these features membrane technology is playing a prominent role in the treatment of wastewater brackish and seawater chemical and dairy industry 7 10 the fouling of accumulated undesirable pollutants on membrane pores is the main obstacle in its operation and almost half of the cost consumes in fouling control or prevention 11 a membrane is a physical barrier used for separation of desirable solutes and unwanted solvents 12 separation membranes are majorly divided into two categories polymer and inorganic membranes polymeric membranes were widely used due to their high selectivity mechanical strength chemical resistance low cost and flexibility but there are some problems associated such as fouling to resolve these issues researchers are more focused on nanocomposite membranes since last ten years in nanocomposite membranes inorganic nanofiller was incorporated into polymer membranes for enhancing separation features of pure polymer membranes 13 15 nanoparticles as organic fillers in composite membranes enhance antifouling potential permeability selectivity mechanical properties hydrophilicity antimicrobial features and thermal stability in polymeric membranes due to high aspect ratio 16 17 polyvinyl alcohol is one of the most used polymers for membranes fabrication it is a semi crystalline polymer having high hydrophilicity completely hydrolyzed 18 chemical thermal and environmental stability and mechanical strength it is highly soluble in water and insoluble in organic solvents 19 the widely used areas of polyvinyl alcohol are membrane separation technology photoluminescence and fuel cell electrolytes 20 22 the crystal structure depends on the hydrogen bonding between molecules 23 it is used in synthesis of polymer membranes for application in pressure driven processes like microfiltration 24 25 ultrafiltration 26 32 nanofiltration reverse osmosis as well as gas separation 32 34 and pervaporation 35 the chemical structure of pva in hydrolyzed and partially hydrolyzed form shown in fig 1 the nanoparticles are being used for enhancing separation efficiency and properties as well as improving its life time it has been reported that various nanoparticles incorporated in polymer membranes for mitigating fouling such as tio2 36 38 tio2 nanofiller has gained much attention due high uv resistance chemical stability photocatalytic action antimicrobial properties and transparency 39 41 on the other hand the biggest challenge is the formation of aggregates of inorganic nanofillers 42 43 polydopamine pda is an environment friendly neurotransmitter hormone having strong adhesiveness and absorbability its coating increase antimicrobial potential 44 and separation efficiency of membranes a considerable amount of research has already been done on coating of nanoparticles a biomimetic coating of polydopamine was done by alkaline dopamine solution for incorporation into thin films the resulting films showed photocurrents and photodegradation 45 an investigation was also done on solar photocatalytic oxidation of paper mill wastewater by titanium dioxide this study concluded that photocatalytic degradation can be used as an effective pretreatment process in biological post treating of paper industry pollutants 46 in order to overcome the challenges of paper mill wastewater our objective was to fabricate highly efficient novel dopamine coated polyvinyl alcohol nanofiltration membranes for improving antifouling ability and solving environmental issues associated with paper and pulp industry as per our knowledge dopamine coated titanium dioxide core shell nanoparticles have not been incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol membranes for application in paper and pulp mills wastewater treatment the effect of coated tio2 nanoparticles on the mechanical properties surface morphology crystal structure fouling resistance physicochemical features and thermal stability of membranes was analyzed the synthesized pva nanocomposite membranes were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis tga tensile testing scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray diffraction xrd the pollutants removal efficiency was examined using wastewater of security papers limited pakistan in filtration experiments the manufactured paper used in educational boards and universities degree certificates banknotes prize bonds saving certificates financial instruments and other applications 2 experminetal 2 1 materials and reagents polyvinyl alcohol lab grade resin mw 85000 124000 g mol 99 hydrolyzed caustic soda naoh sodium sulphate na2so4 and dopamine monomer were purchased from siga aldrich usa anatase titanium iv oxide 98 from daejung chemicals and metals co ltd south korea deionized di water was used directly in experiments without any further purification 2 2 membrane synthesis the nanocomposite polyvinyl alcohol membrane was prepared by solution casting method pva aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving 15 wt pva in 100 ml of water at 85ᴼc using magnetic stirrer until a clear transparent and homogeneous solution formed pva tio2 solution was obtained by mixing 15 wt pva and 5 wt tio2 in water by the same procedure as stated previously pva tio2 dopamine solution was made by first dissolving 1 g dopamine methacrylate in 10 ml of 2 n sodium hydroxide ph 13 8 alkaline solution 47 48 then 5 wt tio2 was dissolved by continuously stirring for 12 min and a desired time is provided for drying the obtained highly controlled thickness was 20 nm the resulting pda coated tio2 mixture was added with 15 wt pva and 100 ml demineralized water and heated at 85ᴼc for 60 90 min the preparation method of pva tio2 dopamine membrane is shown in fig 2 the three prepared solutions were poured onto glass plates using a casting knife and then immersed for 10 15 seconds in coagulation bath composed of 4 g na2so4 8 g naoh in 100 ml of water finally the membranes were dried at room temperature for 24 h 3 sample characterization 3 1 x ray diffraction xrd the x ray diffraction analysis was performed for analyzing the crystal structure xrd patterns of fabricated membranes were obtained by bruker d8 x ray diffractometer operating at 40 kv to 25 ma with kα radiation source of cu having wavelength λ 1 542 aᴼ and a nickel filter the patterns were recorded in the angle range 2ө of 0 80ᴼ 3 2 field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem the elemental composition and surface morphology of the synthesized membranes were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy model evo 18 carl zeiss images the samples were viewed at 10 kv accelerating voltages under a high vacuum 3 3 thermogravimetric analysis tga the thermal stability of membrane samples was determined by thermal analyzer model shimadzu dt 60h japan the 5 10 mg samples were heated in aluminum pans at 800ᴼc with a heating rate of 10ᴼc min 3 4 tensile testing the tensile strength and elongation of membrane samples were examined by universal testing machine zwick roell germany by astm d882 02 standard the specifications used in this testing are gauge length 2 in dimensions 1 in width x 5 in length testing speed 25 mm min 3 5 filtration experiments the wastewater filtration experiments were carried out in a nanofiltration system shown in fig 3 the pretreatment of paper mill wastewater is the most prominent technique for removal of foulants before the membrane process the pretreatment method will minimize requirement for frequent cleaning and will ultimately prevent the drop in flux the adsorption and ultrafiltration pretreatment was done for reducing the tss cod and color prior to nanofiltration the total dissolved solids tds total suspended solids tds chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod total colony count tcc were determined by conventional filtration method tds meter calorimeter technique 5 day bod5 test and agar diffusion test respectively table 1 illustrates the measured composition of wastewater of security papers limited pakistan the permeate flux j of the synthesized membranes was calculated after every 25 min for 5 h using the following equation j v a δ t where v is the volume of permeate a is the area of membrane and δt is the permeation time of the sample the rejection percentage of the water samples can be described by the following equation r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and c f are the permeate and feed concentrations respectively 3 6 uv vis spectrum analysis the uv vis spectra of water samples was recorded by shimadzu uv 1800 visible spectrophotometer the change in absorbance was measured as a function of wavelength the filtered water samples were dispensed between a detector and uv vis light by using cuvette 4 results and discussion 4 1 xrd analysis the xrd pattern of the developed membranes is shown in fig 4 generally amorphous polymers give broad peaks and the crystalline polymers depicts high intensity and sharp peaks 49 it is well known that a semi crystalline peak is shown by polyvinyl alcohol pva at 2ө 20 50 52 at a diffraction spacing of 4 5 a the pva tio2 membrane exhibited many distinct diffraction peaks at 2ө values of 20 25 25 34 5 53 84 62 67 68 89 and 74 84 in reference with jcpds card no 21 1274 the peaks at 25 25 34 5 53 84 62 67 and 68 89 were matched with crystal planes of 101 004 105 204 and 116 respectively which confirms the incorporation of anatase tio2 nanoparticles in pva tio2 dopamine membrane a prominent peak of polydopamine was observed at 2ө of 12 75 with diffraction spacing of 6 95 a which validates the successful polymerization and coating on anatase nanoparticle the tio2 peak only appears at 25 25 which confirm that crystallization is not similar in all directions of the membrane sample the other peaks of tio2 disappear because the crystals have grown only in 101 direction due to less crystalline phase and impurities as well as high pva and dopamine concentration 4 2 morphological studies of membranes the surface morphology of the developed nanocomposite membranes was recorded in fesem micrographs shown in figs 5 7 the small size and high specific surface area caused the tio2 nanoparticles to segregate and agglomerate during dispersing in the polymer matrix for overcoming this problem tio2 nps need to be surface functionalized by modifying with polydopamine to enhance their covalent bonding to the polymer matrix the magnified images confirmed that the polydopamine coating on anatase nanoparticles improved the uniformity in dispersion the sem images of anatase titanium dioxide nanoparticles and dopamine coated anatase nanoparticles confirmed the successful coating of polydopamine on anatase tio2 nanoparticles in both images of cross sectional view the top dark layer was a catalyst layer and the light layer on bottom surface shows transparent porous structure of membranes the pva tio2 membrane has slightly lower thickness of 34 8 μm 36 0 μm in comparison with pva tio2 dopamine membrane of 35 7 μm 37 7 μm which shows that effect of dopamine on thickness of membranes 4 3 mechanical properties the mechanical strength and elongation at break of synthesized membranes is represented in fig 8 it can be seen that by the addition of anatase nanoparticles the tensile strength improved from 5 5 n to 13 3 n but elongation slightly decreased by 1 the tio2 molecules filled the gaps between pva polymer chains and increased the tensile strength 53 the coating of dopamine on tio2 enhanced the elasticity of pva membrane to 156 when uniaxial stress applied the particles which were debonded caused shear yielding and showed voids in the matrix therefore the plastic deformation ability and high toughness reduced the hardness which ultimately causes low tensile strength and less dispersion 4 4 thermal degradation the thermogravimetric analysis was performed to determine the effect of membranes structure on the degradation behavior according to fig 9 it was evident that all three synthesized membranes exhibited thermal degradation in three steps in the first region the evaporation of volatile matter moisture takes place which accounts for 19 4 28 3 and 19 2 weight loss in three different membranes the second step revealed that pva pva tio2 membrane showed degradation from 200 to 400ᴼc with weight loss of 64 and 70 5 the decomposition in pva tio2 starts from 200 up to 600ᴼc the third region represents the cleavage of carbon backbone in pva and carbonization of degraded elements to ash in three membranes the final degradation temperatures of pva pva tio2 and pva tio2 dopamine observed are 660 725 and 1000ᴼc respectively the thermal stability of pva polymer increased by the addition of nanoparticles 54 due to strong interaction between polymer matrix and tio2 55 4 5 filtered water analysis 4 5 1 total suspended solids tss removal conventional filtration technique was applied for determining total suspended solids tss concentration through 4 μm filter paper the untreated wastewater had tss value of 80 mg l the poly vinyl alcohol membrane decreased the tss concentration from 80 to 30 mg l the incorporation of dopamine coated tio2 nps decreased the pore size and enhance the quality of filtered water therefore the addition of nanoparticles reduced tss value as they act as nanofillers by blocking the penetration of suspended contaminants into the filtrate this is the reason why both pva tio2 and pva tio2 dopamine membranes showed tss removal efficiencies of 80 and 87 5 respectively tio2 would also function as a self cleaning material to prevent the pollutants from attaching with membrane and will eventually enhance the chemical stability and antimicrobial resistance due to the highly functional nature of pda some of its quantity got removed with biodegradable organics present in wastewater therefore we were not be able to get 90 removal efficiency fig 10 shows the removal efficiencies of membranes 4 5 2 total dissolved solids tds removal the tds meter was used for finding the total dissolved solids tds concentration the tds value of paper mill wastewater was 1100 mg l the pva membrane reduced the tds to 1000 mg l and pva tio2 membrane showed 940 mg l with removal efficiency of 14 55 the water treated with pva tio2 dopamine membrane had highest removal percentage due to the hydrophilicity of polydopamine the overall tds removal percentage was considerably low because dissolved impurities could not be removed by nanopores of fabricated membranes the results indicated that these membranes were not much effective for removing dissolved salts and impurities therefore coagulation flocculation aided clarification and primary settling 56 was needed before nanofiltration the tds removal percentage of nanofiltration membranes were given in fig 11 4 5 3 effect on chemical oxygen demand cod calorimeter technique was used for finding the chemical oxygen demand cod of treated water samples the cod of untreated water was found to be 326 mg l the recorded tds value of wastewater treated with pva membrane was 264 mg l with removal percentage of 19 03 the highest removal efficiency of 62 05 was obtained from pva tio2 membrane due to the advanced action of anatase tio2 nanoparticles which enhanced the biodegradability of the wastewater contaminants the reaction of catechol hydroxyl in pda with hydroxyl groups present on tio2 nps formed a hydrogen bonding and susceptible to produce an organic thin coating on tio2 surface and reduces the agglomerates formed by nps however dopamine is highly sensitive to oxygen and liable to direct oxidization by reacting with oxygen or other oxidants present in wastewater and yield quinones and many free radicals 57 thus the layer formed by pda broken and the agglomeration of tio2 took place consequently the highly reactive properties of polydopamine in pva tio2 dopamine membrane caused it to react with inactive organic matter 58 which increased the cod value to 652 mg l the antimicrobial action of dopamine also decreased the rate of bacterial growth in wastewater which take part in the degradation of organic matter and consequently cod value increased table 2 illustrates the cod removal percentage of treated water samples 4 5 4 effect on biochemical oxygen demand bod a 5 day bod5 analysis test was applied for measuring the values of biochemical oxygen demand bod concentration of the water treated with developed nanofiltration membranes the wastewater sample found to had a bod concentration of 128 mg l the water treated with pva membrane showed 104 mg l bod value with removal percentage of 19 54 the pva tio2 membrane reduced the bod value to 65 mg l showing a reduction of 50 in initial bod concentration the dopamine coating in pva tio2 dopamine membrane increased the bod concentration to 182 mg l the experiments were conducted at 30ᴼc but in pva tio2 dopamine membrane the reaction of pda with organic contaminants and dissolved salts raised the temperature of wastewater which caused decrease in oxygen content 59 and lowers the microbial activity therefore the potential to remove the contaminants decreased 60 as a result the bod value became high in pvatio2 dopamine sample the bod concentrations of treated water samples are given in table 3 4 5 5 total colony count tcc removal the agar diffusion technique was used for measuring the total colony count tcc of treated water samples the untreated paper mill wastewater showed tcc value of 3000 cfu mlx103 the pure pva membrane decreased the initial tcc concentration by 50 the incorporation of anatase tio2 nanoparticles caused the tcc to get reduced from 3000 to 1100 cfu mlx103 showing microbial removal percentage of 63 35 the tcc concentration of pva tio2 dopamine membrane was found to be 600 cfu mlx103 which the lowest value the dopamine coating on tio2 nanoparticles improved the microbes removal efficiency by 30 due to the presence of catechols which help in its strong bonding with organic inorganic surfaces 61 for enhancing the adhesive and antimicrobial properties of polydopamine the microbial removal efficiencies of membranes are shown in fig 12 4 5 6 permeate quality of the water samples the salt rejection conductivity of the fabricated membranes was measured and the quality of the treated water was determined for characterizing their performance table 4 presents the recorded average values of different parameters the quality of obtained permeates by the different membrane samples was analyzed by comparing with the actual wastewater sample of security papers limited pakistan the permeate removal percentage was calculated from the initial feed concentration and the final concentration of the permeate for the evaluation of salt rejection and separation performance the membrane containing dopamine coated tio2 nps showed the highest removal rate of caco3 sulphate and chloride and the resulted conductivity was 340 μs cm therefore this membrane is most suitable in terms of quality the salt removal study concluded that the obtained permeate sample was colorless and had less suspended solids and total hardness furthermore the resulting sulphate chloride and conductivity removal efficiency of pva tio2 dopamine membrane were achieved as 85 70 and 75 respectively the flux of paper mill wastewater passing through the pores of nanocomposite membranes containing tio2 and dopamine coated tio2 was lower as compared to pure pva membrane as recorded in fig 13 the decline in flux caused by the lower pore sizes because nps acted as fillers and decreased the permeability the tio2 agglomerates blocked the pores of membrane 62 the pva membrane showed high flux but the quality of permeate was not good moreover pva tio2 dopamine membrane exhibited lower values of flux but the rejection rate of salts and other contaminants were much better than other two membranes 4 5 7 uv vis spectrum the absorption spectra of water samples was recorded between 200 nm 750 nm wavelength and shown in fig 14 it was clear that the absorption intensity of wastewater was obviously the highest due to the presence of aliphatic aromatic and organic constituents the uv vis spectrum analysis showed the absence of colored constituents in the water the obtained results imply that pva tio2 dopamine membrane was the most effective membrane for the removal of contaminants from wastewater of paper and pulp industry the values of maximum absorbance λmax of all the water samples are given in table 5 5 conclusions the nanofiltration membranes were prepared by the incorporation of dopamine coated anatase core shell nanoparticles in poly vinyl alcohol the addition of nanoparticles improved the mechanical and thermal stability as validated by tensile and tga testing the fesem and xrd results confirmed that the added particles were anatase tio2 and their successful coating with polydopamine the dissolved pollutants and microbes removal rate was enhanced by the advanced action of anatase nanoparticles and pda due to which pva tio2 dopamine membrane exhibited highest removal percentage of tss tds and microorganisms removal they showed high cod and bod values due to highly functional nature of dopamine so it got removed with organic matter although the flux was lower due to blockage of pores by nps but the quality of permeate was better as compared to other synthesized membranes the overall results indicated that these membranes have low cost easy operation and high potential to remove waste contaminants from wastewater of paper and pulp industry but a suitable technique should be applied for the removal of dissolved tio2 nanoparticles as they may pose threat to humans and aquatic ecosystems declaration of competing interest with

production process of paper the conservation of water can be achieved by using wastewater recycle technique in water management of paper mills membrane separation is the most widely used low cost energy saving and highly efficient technology for wastewater treatment due to these features membrane technology is playing a prominent role in the treatment of wastewater brackish and seawater chemical and dairy industry 7 10 the fouling of accumulated undesirable pollutants on membrane pores is the main obstacle in its operation and almost half of the cost consumes in fouling control or prevention 11 a membrane is a physical barrier used for separation of desirable solutes and unwanted solvents 12 separation membranes are majorly divided into two categories polymer and inorganic membranes polymeric membranes were widely used due to their high selectivity mechanical strength chemical resistance low cost and flexibility but there are some problems associated such as fouling to resolve these issues researchers are more focused on nanocomposite membranes since last ten years in nanocomposite membranes inorganic nanofiller was incorporated into polymer membranes for enhancing separation features of pure polymer membranes 13 15 nanoparticles as organic fillers in composite membranes enhance antifouling potential permeability selectivity mechanical properties hydrophilicity antimicrobial features and thermal stability in polymeric membranes due to high aspect ratio 16 17 polyvinyl alcohol is one of the most used polymers for membranes fabrication it is a semi crystalline polymer having high hydrophilicity completely hydrolyzed 18 chemical thermal and environmental stability and mechanical strength it is highly soluble in water and insoluble in organic solvents 19 the widely used areas of polyvinyl alcohol are membrane separation technology photoluminescence and fuel cell electrolytes 20 22 the crystal structure depends on the hydrogen bonding between molecules 23 it is used in synthesis of polymer membranes for application in pressure driven processes like microfiltration 24 25 ultrafiltration 26 32 nanofiltration reverse osmosis as well as gas separation 32 34 and pervaporation 35 the chemical structure of pva in hydrolyzed and partially hydrolyzed form shown in fig 1 the nanoparticles are being used for enhancing separation efficiency and properties as well as improving its life time it has been reported that various nanoparticles incorporated in polymer membranes for mitigating fouling such as tio2 36 38 tio2 nanofiller has gained much attention due high uv resistance chemical stability photocatalytic action antimicrobial properties and transparency 39 41 on the other hand the biggest challenge is the formation of aggregates of inorganic nanofillers 42 43 polydopamine pda is an environment friendly neurotransmitter hormone having strong adhesiveness and absorbability its coating increase antimicrobial potential 44 and separation efficiency of membranes a considerable amount of research has already been done on coating of nanoparticles a biomimetic coating of polydopamine was done by alkaline dopamine solution for incorporation into thin films the resulting films showed photocurrents and photodegradation 45 an investigation was also done on solar photocatalytic oxidation of paper mill wastewater by titanium dioxide this study concluded that photocatalytic degradation can be used as an effective pretreatment process in biological post treating of paper industry pollutants 46 in order to overcome the challenges of paper mill wastewater our objective was to fabricate highly efficient novel dopamine coated polyvinyl alcohol nanofiltration membranes for improving antifouling ability and solving environmental issues associated with paper and pulp industry as per our knowledge dopamine coated titanium dioxide core shell nanoparticles have not been incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol membranes for application in paper and pulp mills wastewater treatment the effect of coated tio2 nanoparticles on the mechanical properties surface morphology crystal structure fouling resistance physicochemical features and thermal stability of membranes was analyzed the synthesized pva nanocomposite membranes were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis tga tensile testing scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray diffraction xrd the pollutants removal efficiency was examined using wastewater of security papers limited pakistan in filtration experiments the manufactured paper

polyvinyl alcohol lab grade resin mw 85000 124000 g mol 99 hydrolyzed caustic soda naoh sodium sulphate na2so4 and dopamine monomer were purchased from siga aldrich usa anatase titanium iv oxide 98 from daejung chemicals and metals co ltd south korea deionized di water was used directly in experiments without any further purification 2 2 membrane synthesis the nanocomposite polyvinyl alcohol membrane was prepared by solution casting method pva aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving 15 wt pva in 100 ml of water at 85ᴼc using magnetic stirrer until a clear transparent and homogeneous solution formed pva tio2 solution was obtained by mixing 15 wt pva and 5 wt tio2 in water by the same procedure as stated previously pva tio2 dopamine solution was made by first dissolving 1 g dopamine methacrylate in 10 ml of 2 n sodium hydroxide ph 13 8 alkaline solution 47 48 then 5 wt tio2 was dissolved by continuously stirring for 12 min and a desired time is provided for drying the obtained highly controlled thickness was 20 nm the resulting pda coated tio2 mixture was added with 15 wt pva and 100 ml demineralized water and heated at 85ᴼc for 60 90 min the preparation method of pva tio2 dopamine membrane is shown in fig 2 the three prepared solutions were poured onto glass plates using a casting knife and then immersed for 10 15 seconds in coagulation bath composed of 4 g na2so4 8 g naoh in 100 ml of water finally the membranes were dried at room temperature for 24 h 3 sample characterization 3 1 x ray diffraction xrd the x ray diffraction analysis was performed for analyzing the crystal structure xrd patterns of fabricated membranes were obtained by bruker d8 x ray diffractometer operating at 40 kv to 25 ma with kα radiation source of cu having wavelength λ 1 542 aᴼ and a nickel filter the patterns were recorded in the angle range 2ө of 0 80ᴼ 3 2 field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem the elemental composition and surface morphology of the synthesized membranes were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy model evo 18 carl zeiss images the samples were viewed at 10 kv accelerating voltages under a high vacuum 3 3 thermogravimetric analysis tga the thermal stability of membrane samples was determined by thermal analyzer model shimadzu dt 60h japan the 5 10 mg samples were heated in aluminum pans at 800ᴼc with a heating rate of 10ᴼc min 3 4 tensile testing the tensile strength and elongation of membrane samples were examined by universal testing machine zwick roell germany by astm d882 02 standard the specifications used in this testing are gauge length 2 in dimensions 1 in width x 5 in length testing speed 25 mm min 3 5 filtration experiments the wastewater filtration experiments were carried out in a nanofiltration system shown in fig 3 the pretreatment of paper mill wastewater is the most prominent technique for removal of foulants before the membrane process the pretreatment method will minimize requirement for frequent cleaning and will ultimately prevent the drop in flux the adsorption and ultrafiltration pretreatment was done for reducing the tss cod and color prior to nanofiltration the total dissolved solids tds total suspended solids tds chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod total colony count tcc were determined by conventional filtration method tds meter calorimeter technique 5 day bod5 test and agar diffusion test respectively table 1 illustrates the measured composition of wastewater of security papers limited pakistan the permeate flux j of the synthesized membranes was calculated after every 25 min for 5 h using the following equation j v a δ t where v is the volume of permeate a is the area of membrane and δt is the permeation time of the sample the rejection percentage of the water samples can be described by the following equation r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and c f are the permeate and feed concentrations respectively 3 6 uv vis spectrum analysis the uv vis spectra of water samples was recorded by shimadzu uv 1800 visible spectrophotometer the change in absorbance was measured as a function of wavelength the filtered water samples were dispensed between a detector and uv vis light by using cuvette 4 results and discussion 4 1 xrd analysis the xrd pattern of the developed membranes is shown in fig 4 generally amorphous polymers give broad peaks and the crystalline polymers depicts high intensity and sharp peaks 49 it is well known that a semi crystalline peak is shown by polyvinyl alcohol pva at 2ө 20 50 52 at a diffraction spacing of 4 5 a the pva tio2 membrane exhibited many distinct diffraction peaks at 2ө values of 20 25 25 34 5 53 84 62 67 68 89 and 74 84 in reference with jcpds card no 21 1274 the peaks at 25 25 34 5 53 84 62 67 and 68 89 were matched with crystal planes of 101 004 105 204 and 116 respectively which confirms the incorporation of anatase tio2 nanoparticles in pva tio2 dopamine membrane a prominent peak of polydopamine was observed at 2ө of 12 75 with diffraction spacing of 6 95 a which validates the successful polymerization and coating on anatase nanoparticle the tio2 peak only appears at 25 25 which confirm that crystallization is not similar in all directions of the membrane sample the other peaks of tio2 disappear because the crystals have grown only in 101 direction due to less crystalline phase and impurities as well as high pva and dopamine concentration 4 2 morphological studies of membranes the surface morphology of the developed nanocomposite membranes was recorded in fesem micrographs shown in figs 5 7 the small size and high specific surface area caused the tio2 nanoparticles to segregate and agglomerate during dispersing in the polymer matrix for overcoming this problem tio2 nps need to be surface functionalized by modifying with polydopamine to enhance their covalent bonding to the polymer matrix the magnified images confirmed that the polydopamine coating on anatase nanoparticles improved the uniformity in dispersion the sem images of anatase titanium dioxide nanoparticles and dopamine coated anatase nanoparticles confirmed the successful coating of polydopamine on anatase tio2 nanoparticles in both images of cross sectional view the top dark layer was a catalyst layer and the light layer on bottom surface shows transparent porous structure of membranes the pva tio2 membrane has slightly lower thickness of 34 8 μm 36 0 μm in comparison with pva tio2 dopamine membrane of 35 7 μm 37 7 μm which shows that effect of dopamine on thickness of membranes 4 3 mechanical properties the mechanical strength and elongation at break of synthesized membranes is represented in fig 8 it can be seen that by the addition of anatase nanoparticles the tensile strength improved from 5 5 n to 13 3 n but elongation slightly decreased by 1 the tio2 molecules filled the gaps between pva polymer chains and increased the tensile strength 53 the coating of dopamine on tio2 enhanced the elasticity of pva membrane to 156 when uniaxial stress applied the particles which were debonded caused shear yielding and showed voids in the matrix therefore the plastic deformation ability and high toughness reduced the hardness which ultimately causes low tensile strength and less dispersion 4 4 thermal degradation the thermogravimetric analysis was performed to determine the effect of membranes structure on the degradation behavior according to fig 9 it was evident that all three synthesized membranes exhibited thermal degradation in three steps in the first region the evaporation of volatile matter moisture takes place which accounts for 19 4 28 3 and 19 2 weight loss in three different membranes the second step revealed that pva pva tio2 membrane showed degradation from 200 to 400ᴼc with weight loss of 64 and 70 5 the decomposition in pva tio2 starts from 200 up to 600ᴼc the third region represents the cleavage of carbon backbone in pva and carbonization of degraded elements to ash in three membranes the final degradation temperatures of pva pva tio2 and pva tio2 dopamine observed are 660 725 and 1000ᴼc respectively the thermal stability of pva polymer increased by the addition of nanoparticles 54 due to strong interaction between polymer matrix and tio2 55 4 5 filtered water analysis 4 5 1 total suspended solids tss removal conventional filtration technique was applied for determining total suspended solids tss concentration through 4 μm filter paper the untreated wastewater had tss value of 80 mg l the poly vinyl alcohol membrane decreased the tss concentration from 80 to 30 mg l the incorporation of dopamine coated tio2 nps decreased the pore size and enhance the quality of filtered water therefore the addition of nanoparticles reduced tss value as they act as nanofillers by blocking the penetration of suspended contaminants into the filtrate this is the reason why both pva tio2 and pva tio2 dopamine membranes showed tss removal efficiencies of 80 and 87 5 respectively tio2 would also function as a self cleaning material to prevent the pollutants from attaching with membrane and will eventually enhance the chemical stability and antimicrobial resistance due to the highly functional nature of pda some of its quantity got removed with biodegradable organics present in wastewater therefore we were not be able to get 90 removal efficiency fig 10 shows the removal efficiencies of membranes 4 5 2 total dissolved solids tds removal the tds meter was used for finding the total dissolved solids tds concentration the tds value of paper mill wastewater was 1100 mg l the pva membrane reduced the tds to 1000 mg l and pva tio2 membrane showed 940 mg l with removal efficiency of 14 55 the water treated with pva tio2 dopamine membrane had highest removal percentage due to the hydrophilicity of polydopamine the overall tds removal percentage was considerably low because dissolved impurities could not be removed by nanopores of fabricated membranes the results indicated that these membranes were not much effective for removing dissolved salts and impurities therefore coagulation flocculation aided clarification and primary settling 56 was needed before nanofiltration the tds removal percentage of nanofiltration membranes were given in fig 11 4 5 3 effect on chemical oxygen demand cod calorimeter technique was used for finding the chemical oxygen demand cod of treated water samples the cod of untreated water was found to be 326 mg l the recorded tds value of wastewater treated with pva membrane was 264 mg l with removal percentage of 19 03 the highest removal efficiency of 62 05 was obtained from pva tio2 membrane due to the advanced action of anatase tio2 nanoparticles which enhanced the biodegradability of the wastewater contaminants the reaction of catechol hydroxyl in pda with hydroxyl groups present on tio2 nps formed a hydrogen bonding and susceptible to produce an organic thin coating on tio2 surface and reduces the agglomerates formed by nps however dopamine is highly sensitive to oxygen and liable to direct oxidization by reacting with oxygen or other oxidants present in wastewater and yield quinones and many free radicals 57 thus the layer formed by pda broken and the agglomeration of tio2 took place consequently the highly reactive properties of polydopamine in pva tio2 dopamine membrane caused it to react with inactive organic matter 58 which increased the cod value to 652 mg l the antimicrobial action of dopamine also decreased the rate of bacterial growth in wastewater which take part in the degradation of organic matter and consequently cod value increased table 2 illustrates the cod removal percentage of treated water samples 4 5 4 effect on biochemical oxygen demand bod a 5 day bod5 analysis test was applied for measuring the values of biochemical oxygen demand bod concentration of the water treated with developed nanofiltration membranes the wastewater sample found to had a bod concentration of 128 mg l the water treated with pva membrane showed 104 mg l bod value with removal percentage of 19 54 the pva tio2 membrane reduced the bod value to 65 mg l showing a reduction of 50 in initial bod concentration the dopamine coating in pva tio2 dopamine membrane increased the bod concentration to 182 mg l the experiments were conducted at 30ᴼc but in pva tio2 dopamine membrane the reaction of pda with organic contaminants and dissolved salts raised the temperature of wastewater which caused decrease in oxygen content 59 and lowers the microbial activity therefore the potential to remove the contaminants decreased 60 as a result the bod value became high in pvatio2 dopamine sample the bod concentrations of treated water samples are given in table 3 4 5 5 total colony count tcc removal the agar diffusion technique was used for measuring the total colony count tcc of treated water samples the untreated paper mill wastewater showed tcc value of 3000 cfu mlx103 the pure pva membrane decreased the initial tcc concentration by 50 the incorporation of anatase tio2 nanoparticles caused the tcc to get reduced from 3000 to 1100 cfu mlx103 showing microbial removal percentage of 63 35 the tcc concentration of pva tio2 dopamine membrane was found to be 600 cfu mlx103 which the lowest value the dopamine coating on tio2 nanoparticles improved the microbes removal efficiency by 30 due to the presence of catechols which help in its strong bonding with organic inorganic surfaces 61 for enhancing the adhesive and antimicrobial properties of polydopamine the microbial removal efficiencies of membranes are shown in fig 12 4 5 6 permeate quality of the water samples the salt rejection conductivity of the fabricated membranes was measured and the quality of the treated water was determined for characterizing their performance table 4 presents the recorded average values of different parameters the quality of obtained permeates by the different membrane samples was analyzed by comparing with the actual wastewater sample of security papers limited pakistan the permeate removal percentage was calculated from the initial feed concentration and the final concentration of the permeate for the evaluation of salt rejection and separation performance the membrane containing dopamine coated tio2 nps showed the highest removal rate of caco3 sulphate and chloride and the resulted conductivity was 340 μs cm therefore this membrane is most suitable in terms of quality the salt removal study concluded that the obtained permeate sample was colorless and had less suspended solids and total hardness furthermore the resulting sulphate chloride and conductivity removal efficiency of pva tio2 dopamine membrane were achieved as 85 70 and 75 respectively the flux of paper mill wastewater passing through the pores of nanocomposite membranes containing tio2 and dopamine coated tio2 was lower as compared to pure pva membrane as recorded in fig 13 the decline in flux caused by the lower pore sizes because nps acted as fillers and decreased the permeability the tio2 agglomerates blocked the pores of membrane 62 the pva membrane showed high flux but the quality of permeate was not good moreover pva tio2 dopamine membrane exhibited lower values of flux but the rejection rate of salts and other contaminants were much better than other two membranes 4 5 7 uv vis spectrum the absorption spectra of water samples was recorded between 200 nm 750 nm wavelength and shown in fig 14 it was clear that the absorption intensity of wastewater was obviously the highest due to the presence of aliphatic aromatic and organic constituents the uv vis spectrum analysis showed the absence of colored constituents in the water the obtained results imply that pva tio2 dopamine membrane was the most effective membrane for the removal of contaminants from wastewater of paper and pulp industry the values of maximum absorbance λmax of all the water samples are given in table 5 5 conclusions the nanofiltration membranes were prepared by the incorporation of dopamine coated anatase core shell nanoparticles in poly vinyl alcohol the addition of nanoparticles improved the mechanical and thermal stability as validated by tensile and tga testing the fesem and xrd results confirmed that the added particles were anatase tio2 and their successful coating with polydopamine the dissolved pollutants and microbes removal rate was enhanced by the advanced action of anatase nanoparticles and pda due to which pva tio2 dopamine membrane exhibited highest removal percentage of tss tds and microorganisms removal they showed high cod and bod values due to highly functional nature of dopamine so it got removed with organic matter although the flux was lower due to blockage of pores by nps but the quality of permeate was better as compared to other synthesized membranes the overall results indicated that these membranes have low cost easy operation and high potential to remove waste contaminants from wastewater of paper and pulp industry but a suitable technique should be applied for the removal of dissolved tio2 nanoparticles as they may pose threat to humans and aquatic ecosystems declaration of competing interest with

13934,in this study a bubble column reactor bcr was evaluated for producing lipid rich biomass of rhodococcus opacus using refinery wastewater as the substrate the biomass obtained was used for bio oil production by hydrothermal liquefaction htl process initially the effect of three media constituents viz nh4cl kh2po4 and na2hpo4 and three physicochemical parameters i e ph agitation and temperature on refinery wastewater treatment by r opacus was studied employing placket burman experimental design from the results it was observed that variation in the levels of these parameters does not have any significant effect on the wastewater treatment efficiency indicating the robust nature of r opacus in treating refinery wastewater during the continuous wastewater treatment using bcr a very high chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency of 97 was obtained along with 2 4 g l 1 of biomass and 1 33 g l 1 lipid yield the lipid rich bacterial biomass was later subjected to htl treatment which resulted in production of bio oil with 26 5 yield on biomass detailed characterization of the bio oil revealed that it primarily contains different complex organic hydrocarbons characterization of solid residue bio char obtained as a byproduct of htl process contained a high amount of carbon 41 8 of large porosity and many active groups over its surface indicating its potential high application value overall this study serves as an excellent example of zero waste strategy for recovering energy in the form of bio oil from industrial wastewater keywords refinery wastewater bubble column reactor r opacus hydrothermal liquefaction bio oil bio char 1 introduction biological treatment of refinery wastewater not only achieves good effluent standard but also provides an opportunity for resource recovery in terms of microbial biomass produced during the process the utilization of microbial biomass for bio energy production can potentially solve the problem of ever growing energy demand and global warming there are innumerable challenges attributed to the development of biomass based next generation biofuels whereas the second generation bio fuels are completely based on lignocellulosic biomass micro algae are considered as appropriate for third generation biofuels 1 in this context microbial biomass including bacteria can serve as an excellent source for bio oil production which has not been examined in detail so far barreiro et al 2 reported that compared with conventional biofuels the bio oil has better stability and relatively high energy content among the different thermochemical processes for bio oil production hydrothermal liquefaction htl is more advantageous as moisture rich biomass can be used directly for htl thus eliminating the drying step or any pretreatment of the biomass 1 3 other than bio oil htl produces aqueous phase as a byproduct which contains an enormous amount of ions e g anions and can be reused as a growth supplement for microorganisms in the wastewater treatment system other than htl for bio oil production the most commonly used thermochemical process is pyrolysis 3 however only lignocellulosic biomass or algae have been studied for bio oil production using htl technology the use of lipid rich rhodococcus opacus biomass cultivated using refinery wastewater seems to be an economical and sustainable option for bio oil production hence in this study the oleaginous bacterium r opacus that is well known for its capability to utilize waste substrate 8 24 was cultivated using petroleum refinery wastewater for production of bio oil by hydrothermal liquefaction owing to the presence of high cod and complex organics in refinery wastewater it could serve as a suitable substrate for lipid rich biomass production by r opacus 8 however due to the complexity of both the wastewater and the lipid production pathway involved the stoichiometry of the conversion process requires a more detailed study bubble column reactors bcrs are widely used in chemical and biological processes owing to certain advantages such as efficient heat and mass transfer easy operation compactness and relatively low maintenance cost requirement 4 performance of bcr greatly relies on the hydrodynamics and it is considered as one of the most primitive multiphase flow reactors yet useful for the production of fuels fermentation and other biochemical processes 5 7 however the reactor has not been evaluated for treating refinery wastewater which consists of complex recalcitrant organics and requires improved hydrodynamics for efficient treatment also the commercial success of such a method depends on using a suitable bioreactor for growing the bacteria among different bioreactors used for refinery wastewater treatment 8 the bubble column reactor is novel and less explored choice however two main bioreactors that have been reported widely for treating refinery wastewater are continuous stirred tank reactors 8 and membrane sequencing bioreactors 12 therefore the main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a bcr for simultaneous lipid rich r opacus biomass production for converting it into bio oil by htl different process parameters to utilize the refinery wastewater as a substrate were initially screened by using a suitable statistical design of experiments plackett burman and their levels were optimized by performing batch experiments using shake flasks results of batch experiments performed using statistical design of experiments e g plackett burman design provide valuable insights into the effect of different process variables on refinery wastewater treatment by r opacus moreover the optimization of levels of variables affecting the process is essential to improve the process efficiency continuous experiments were then performed employing bcr for lipid rich biomass production from wastewater finally bio oil produced from the bacterial biomass by htl was characterized along with its byproducts however the thermo chemical conversion process employed in this study htl converts not only lipids but also carbohydrates and proteins present in the wet biomass which further enhances the efficiency of this process as compared to other thermochemical processes pyrolysis 14 this study describes simultaneous treatment and utilization of refinery wastewater by oleaginous hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium r opacus in an indigenous laboratory scale bubble column reactor for bio oil production which has not been reported thus far hence this is the first report on the treatment of refinery wastewater and production of bio oil as an alternative and sustainable form of energy from the lipid rich bacterial biomass by htl however the bio oil obtained may have certain drawbacks such as high oxygen content high viscosity and corrosiveness which could be overcome with certain up gradation techniques for a better application potential of the energy rich product these techniques include esterification emulsification catalytic cracking and solvent extraction 14 16 2 material and methods 2 1 refinery wastewater and microorganism raw refinery wastewater was collected from a petroleum refinery plant located at bongaigaon assam india and stored in a freezer at 4 c until used detailed characterization of the wastewater was previously reported in paul et al 8 which revealed a very high chemical oxygen demand cod of 4500 mg l 1 along with the presence of recalcitrant compounds such as aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons for utilizing the refinery wastewater as the substrate for r opacus biomass growth it was mixed with mineral salt media msm of composition as described previously by paul et al 8 the oleaginous gram positive bacterium rhodococcus opacus pd630 was obtained from microbial type culture collection mtcc chandigarh india the strain was grown on 1 8 w v nutrient broth nb agar slants and was stored at 4 c for preparing a seed culture a loop full of the bacteria was inoculated into a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml of luria bertani lb broth after the culture broth reached an absorbance value of 0 99 at 660 nm the bacteria were harvested and used as the inoculum in required quantities it is reported that owing to the presence of highly recalcitrant organics in refinery wastewater microorganisms other than hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria such as r opacus used in this study are unable to grow on such wastewater as the substrate 8 hence it could be surmised that at optimum values of the parameters the wastewater contained predominantly r opacus which could efficiently utilize the organics present in the wastewater as the sole carbon source for lipid rich biomass production 2 2 effect of different factors on lipid rich biomass production from refinery wastewater plackett burman experimental design consisting of a set of 12 experimental runs was used to determine the relative significance of six factors that influenced biomass growth cod removal and lipid production by r opacus the factors in this study included three media constituents viz nh4cl kh2po4 and na2hpo4 and three physicochemical variables i e ph agitation speed and temperature all the batch experimental runs in this statistically designed study were performed in duplicate using 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks with 100 ml working volume 2 3 continuous experiments with bubble column reactor bcr for lipid rich biomass production from refinery wastewater under continuous operation mode a bubble column reactor with a total volume of 2 l and a working volume of 1 8 l was fabricated out of perspex material the reactor height and diameter were 45 and 8 cm respectively the reactor bottom consisted of a stainless steel made nozzle for air inlet along with another port for introducing wastewater into the reactor through a peristaltic pump the reactor was operated in upflow mode and samples were drawn from the reactor outlet fig 1 illustrates a schematic of the bubble column bioreactor used in this study initially the bioreactor was operated under a batch mode of operation by adding wastewater along with minimal salt media msm 1 4 ratio and bacterial inoculum 10 v v followed by continuous aeration following the batch study the reactor was operated at different hydraulic retention times hrt ranging from 24 to 8 h under continuous operation mode to study the effect of hrt on the reactor performance during the continuous experiments with the reactor the influent ph was adjusted to 7 0 and the reactor was operated at an ambient temperature of 27 2 c however no efforts were made to control these parameters as no drastic change in the parameters were observed during the experiments sample analysis was carried out in triplicate and results were presented as mean standard deviation 2 4 hydrothermal liquefaction htl of residual biomass lipid rich r opacus biomass produced in the bioreactor was converted to bio oil by htl and for which biomass was recovered from the reactor and was loaded into stainless steel made htl vessel along with deionized water at a ratio of 1 5 the vessel was then heated to 250 c and the temperature was maintained for 60 min later the vessel was cooled down to room temperature and the contents were separated and recovered by following the methods described by paul et al 8 fig 2 a briefly the htl product mixture was washed with dichloromethane dcm the solids were separated by filtration using whatman filter paper and dried in an oven for 24 h at 105 c whereas the non aqueous dcm phase was used to obtain the bio oil by evaporating the solvent the aqueous phase was filtered and characterized separately the bio oil yield was calculated using the following eq 1 1 b i o o i l y i e l d w t m a s s o f b i o o i l m a s s o f r o p a c u s b i o m a s s 100 the bio oil was further characterized by liquid chromatography

analytical methods cod g l 1 estimation was carried out as per the standard methods 9 by first centrifuging the samples at 10 000 g for 10 min followed by digestion of the supernatant for 2 h at 120 c drb 200 hach usa lipid rich r opacus biomass concentration g l 1 was estimated by measuring optical density od of the culture broth at 660 nm wavelength using a uv vis spectrophotometer agilent technologies cary 100 series singapore cell dry weight cdw was determined by lyophilizing wet biomass obtained by centrifugation of the culture at 10 000 g for 10 min and weighing lipid concentration g l 1 in the r opacus biomass was determined by the standard folch method details of all these methods were provided in 8 all the analyses were performed in triplicates for accuracy and reproducibility of the results and error obtained was within 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of different factors the results presented in table 1 indicate variation in cod removal biomass concentration g l 1 and lipid accumulation g l 1 in the experiments carried out by varying the levels of the six factors in this study the cod removal efficiency is maximum in experimental run 9 with the factors set at their respective low levels maximum biomass concentration is observed in the case of experimental run 1 whereas maximum lipid accumulation is obtained in experimental run 12 which was followed closely in experimental runs 5 9 and 10 the variations in the results in the different experimental runs can be attributed to the different roles played by the factors on biomass growth lipid accumulation and cod utilization by the bacterium for example nitrogen limitation or physical stress enhances lipid accumulation in r opacus 10 however physicochemical factors ph temperature and agitation as well as media constituents play a combined role for efficient biomass growth and substrate utilization furthermore the substrate used in this i e refinery wastewater is known to contain several toxic compounds that inhibit biomass activity 11 thus due to the presence of recalcitrant toxic compounds present in the refinery wastewater microbial biomass attains optimal growth after a prolonged time period as compared with other wastewater as substrate dairy wastewater 10 analysis of variance anova of the individual responses revealed that kh2po4 f value 5 60 and p value 0 064 and temperature f value 5 83 and p value 0 060 played a major role towards utilizing refinery wastewater as the substrate by the bacterium the other parameters did not show any significant effect suggesting that at these levels they do not influence refinery wastewater treatment using r opacus these results prove that the present refinery wastewater treatment process using r opacus is robust and is independent of certain parameters 3 2 bubble column reactor experiments the results of cod removal biomass growth and lipid accumulation by r opacus in the batch operated bcr are shown in fig 3 a the cod removal efficiency gradually increased with time and reached its maximum 95 after 72 h of the batch operation and after this time period it almost remained constant following a short lag phase of 8 h r opacus biomass growth entered the exponential growth phase and remained in this phase till 36 h the stationary phase lasted for 60 h i e until 96 h of the batch operation time and then the bacteria entered the death phase the batch experiment was continued for a period of 112 h and the maximum biomass concentration obtained was 2 1 g l 1 the lipid profile matched well with the biomass growth profile as it is a growth associated product the maximum lipid accumulation value is found to be 1 56 g l 1 which is 78 by cell dry weight cdw the results from the batch study are much higher than those obtained previously using a cstr with the same bacterial strain paul et al 8 reported a cod removal of 86 with maximum biomass and lipid concentrations of 1 5 g l 1 and 0 83 g l 1 the better performance of the bcr than that of cstr is attributed to the improved hydrodynamics in particular mixing conditions without damaging or causing shear stress on the bacterial strain r opacus is well known to degrade recalcitrant compounds in such wastewater and accumulate lipids inside the cell however depending upon the waste substrate and bioreactor configuration lipid accumulation by the bacterium greatly varies from the results of the batch experiments with the bcr it is clear that the reactor system is ideal for achieving a maximum lipid accumulation and biomass concentration by r opacus along with efficient utilization of the industrial wastewater as the substrate following batch experiments with the bcr continuous experiments were carried out to understand the effect of hrt on the simultaneous treatment of refinery wastewater treatment and lipid rich biomass production by r opacus at 48 h hrt the cod removal efficiency was initially low and it gradually increased to reach a steady state value of 97 fig 3b interestingly when the hrt was lowered to 24 h the cod removal value quickly dropped to 70 and later the value increased to a value of 92 on the 40th day of continuous bioreactor operation at 16 h the cod removal efficiency drastically lowered to 56 on 52nd day however with time the bioreactor performance improved and a steady state cod removal value of 83 was achieved at this hrt in the case of 12 h hrt the cod removal efficiency was nearly 71 after the 85th day of continuous bioreactor operation hence from these results 24 h is found to be an optimum hrt for efficient utilization of the wastewater by the organism at 48 h hrt the cod removal efficiency was only 3 higher than at 24 h hrt which is negligible from a treatment perspective similar to the cod removal efficiency values at different hrts the biomass concentration varied with a change in the hrt at 48 h hrt the biomass concentration was 0 25 g l 1 which steadily increased to 2 4 g l 1 on 10th day of continuous bioreactor operation and remained almost at steady state with minor fluctuation until the hrt value was reduced to 24 h on the 23rd day a drastic change in the biomass concentration was observed when the hrt was reduced to 24 h however a steady state biomass concentration of 2 34 g l 1 was obtained at this hrt which is close to the value obtained at 48 h hrt but the value obtained was very low 0 95 g l 1 at 16 h hrt and it took a long time to reach a final value of 1 71 g l 1 at this hrt the biomass concentration was minimum 1 26 g l 1 at 12 h hrt the lipid accumulation profile well matched with the biomass profile in the bioreactor the lipid concentration was observed to be 1 33 1 1 0 91 0 79 g l 1at 48 h 24 h 16 h and 12 h hrt respectively the maximum lipid concentration was found to be 58 by cell dry weight for 48 h hrt which is less when compared with that obtained in the batch operated reactor which might be due to unwanted biomass wash out occurring during the continuous mode of operating the reactor these results of batch studies match well with the cod removal values obtained which confirms that the hrt significantly affects lipid rich biomass production from refinery wastewater under continuous operation mode with the bcr unlike in a batch system hrt plays a critical role in continuously operated bioreactor systems for substrate utilization as it determines the contact time between biomass and substrate in the reactor for efficient utilization hence in this study the cod removal efficiency decreased with a reduction in the hrt due to insufficient contact between the bacteria and the substrate 12 13 shariati et al 12 found that cod removal using a membrane sequencing batch reactor was better at 24 h hrt than at 12 h and 16 h hrt values as observed similarly in this study however thakur et al 13 reported an optimum hrt value of 0 83 d 20 h treating petroleum refinery wastewater using a sequential batch reactor and obtained maximum cod removal of 77 3 3 characterization of bio oil and htl byproducts the bio oil yield on bacterial biomass was 26 5 3 8 w w which matches with the bio oil obtained by htl of bacterial biomass after polyhydroxyalkanoate extraction 14 ftir spectra fig 4 a of the bio oil revealed the presence of different functional groups which matched well with the gcms analysis results the oh stretching indicated by the wide peak at 3450 cm 1 is attributed to alcohols and phenols in the product the peak at 2080 cm 1 confirmed the presence of a cc triple bond of alkynyl stretching the peak at1650 cm 1is either due to amide co stretch or alkenyl cc stretch which are typical ketones and aldehydes confirming the conversion of lipids into fatty acids by htl reactions the presence of aromatic compounds was established by aromatic cc bending 1420 cm 1 and aromatic c h bending 720 cm 1 in the ftir spectra of the bio oil the bio oil obtained after phase separation was characterized using gcms fig 4b which revealed the presence of different complex hydrocarbons details of these hydrocarbons were provided in table 2 the presence of such hydrocarbons in bio oil from bacterial or algal biomass has been reported previously by 14 15 fig 4c shows 1h nmr and 13c spectra of the bio oil produced from the r opacus biomass which confirmed the presence of the ch chr group in the bio oil 16 moreover kennedy pathway is known to be involved in tag biosynthesis by rhodococci 27 in this pathway glycerol 3 phosphate which is synthesized from the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetonephosphate acts as the starting compound for lipid synthesis and undergoes sequential acylation with different enzymes encoded by responsible genes present in the bacteria to finally produce lipids a schematic showing the main steps involved in lipid biosynthesis by rhodococci and its conversion to bio oil by htl is depicted in fig 2b characterization results of the aqueous soluble fraction by ic ftir and gc ms are presented in fig 5 the ic spectra shown in fig 5a revealed the presence of a chloride along with a small amount of sulfate and phosphate the ftir analysis revealed that it contains hydroxyl o h and primary amine n h groups with prominent peaks at 3338 7 and 1635 13 cm 1 respectively fig 5b some of the amine compounds produced by htl treatment of the r opacus biomass were water soluble and these compounds are detected in the aqueous fraction by ftir analysis the gc ms spectra of the aqueous fraction show the presence of complex hydrocarbons fig 5c but these numbers and quantities were very less as compared with that in bio oil table 3 these characterization results of the aqueous phase suggest its reuse as a nutrient media in the bcr for r opacus biomass growth using refinery wastewater as the substrate the solid residue obtained after htl treatment of the bacterial biomass was characterized using fesem edx fig 6 a these solids recovered from the aqueous phase are primarily bio char with very high carbon content 65 1 as reported earlier by 14 the ash content in the bio char is also high which is indicated by the high oxygen content other elements such as zn p k fe and mg present in the solid residue are sourced from the wastewater or the msm elemental analysis of the solids further revealed that it contained 41 8 c 3 9 h and 5 1 n a zeta potential value of 38 7 mv signifies the presence of highly negatively charged species in bio char solid residue the average particle size of the bio char was found to be 892 3 nm with a total surface area of 16 8 m2 g 1 fig 6b depicts the thermal characteristics of the solid residue the weight loss observed in the temperature 100 300 c range is low and is attributed to the loss of moisture in the sample major weight loss was observed in the range 300 500 c due to the exclusion of volatile compounds above this temperature no weight loss is observed until 900 c and a final weight of 58 of the initial bio char is obtained fig 6c shows the xrd profile of the solid residue the wide peaks at 20 and 25 2ɵ degree are due to aromatic layers stacking 17 peaks at 33 and 65 2ɵ degree is due to sio2 18 other small peaks observed in the figure are due to the presence of caco3 cao mgo feo etc commonly reported to be present in bio char derived from biomass 17 19 ftir spectra is shown in fig 6d reveal prominent peaks at 551 67 1453 90 1532 36 1626 52 2924 12 3276 46 cm 1 these peaks indicate the presence of hydroxyl o h alkanes c h primary amine n h aliphatic amines c n aromatic compounds c c in the solid residue 20 21 the characterization results of the solid residue confirm that the htl byproduct is bio char properties of bio char vary greatly depending upon biomass used and process conditions applied during htl 14 owing to its high porosity high surface area and adsorptive capacity it serves as an excellent adsorbent for application in pollutant removal from wastewater stream 22 bio char has also been extensively used for biogas up gradation by adsorptive removal of h2s from biogas 23 recently it has been shown to improve biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah by making such highly water insoluble compounds more bio available to degrading microorganisms 24 moreover high ash content and oxygen content of the bio char is useful for soil remediation and as a soil amendment to improve soil fertility 25 hence bio oil and other htl byproducts obtained from refinery wastewater using lipid rich r opacus biomass find many applications thus an upgraded product i e bio oil from bacterial biomass can be obtained in the form of energy from industrial waste this gives rise to the bio refinery concept an emerging field that is nowadays the most attractive topic amongst the researchers moreover the techno economic feasibility study can be carried out to estimate the product cost and also the possibility of scaling up this process elemental analysis of the lipid rich r opacus biomass obtained from refinery wastewater showed that it consists of about 60 carbon by htl of the r opacus biomass lipids along with carbohydrates and proteins present were converted to bio oil gc ms analysis of the bio oil further revealed mainly the presence of methyl esters aldehydes and ketones liu et al 26 reported that several reactions including depolymerization re polymerization and hydrolysis were involved in biomass conversion to such compounds by htl besides it has been reported that htl produces bio char as a thermally stable byproduct from carbon rich biomass in order to further improve the properties of bio oil obtained by htl of the bacterial biomass cell disruption followed by cell debris removal and lipid extraction could be evaluated moreover downstream processing of the lipid rich biomass for enhancing the bio oil yield needs to be scaled up beyond the commonly used mini reactor and operated under continuous mode besides detailed techno economic analysis of the htl method followed for bio oil production from such oleaginous microorganisms needs to be carried out and compared with other thermochemical methods to establish its large scale application potential 4 conclusions this study demonstrated efficient utilization of refinery wastewater for lipid rich biomass production by r opacus in bcr operated under batch and continuous modes htl treatment of the r opacus biomass from the bioreactor produced high quality bio oil containing primarily complex hydrocarbons bio char and

13934,in this study a bubble column reactor bcr was evaluated for producing lipid rich biomass of rhodococcus opacus using refinery wastewater as the substrate the biomass obtained was used for bio oil production by hydrothermal liquefaction htl process initially the effect of three media constituents viz nh4cl kh2po4 and na2hpo4 and three physicochemical parameters i e ph agitation and temperature on refinery wastewater treatment by r opacus was studied employing placket burman experimental design from the results it was observed that variation in the levels of these parameters does not have any significant effect on the wastewater treatment efficiency indicating the robust nature of r opacus in treating refinery wastewater during the continuous wastewater treatment using bcr a very high chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency of 97 was obtained along with 2 4 g l 1 of biomass and 1 33 g l 1 lipid yield the lipid rich bacterial biomass was later subjected to htl treatment which resulted in production of bio oil with 26 5 yield on biomass detailed characterization of the bio oil revealed that it primarily contains different complex organic hydrocarbons characterization of solid residue bio char obtained as a byproduct of htl process contained a high amount of carbon 41 8 of large porosity and many active groups over its surface indicating its potential high application value overall this study serves as an excellent example of zero waste strategy for recovering energy in the form of bio oil from industrial wastewater keywords refinery wastewater bubble column reactor r opacus hydrothermal liquefaction bio oil bio char 1 introduction biological treatment of refinery wastewater not only achieves good effluent standard but also provides an opportunity for resource recovery in terms of microbial biomass produced during the process the utilization of microbial biomass for bio energy production can potentially solve the problem of ever growing energy demand and global warming there are innumerable challenges attributed to the development of biomass based next generation biofuels whereas the second generation bio fuels are completely based on lignocellulosic biomass micro algae are considered as appropriate for third generation biofuels 1 in this context microbial biomass including bacteria can serve as an excellent source for bio oil production which has not been examined in detail so far barreiro et al 2 reported that compared with conventional biofuels the bio oil has better stability and relatively high energy content among the different thermochemical processes for bio oil production hydrothermal liquefaction htl is more advantageous as moisture rich biomass can be used directly for htl thus eliminating the drying step or any pretreatment of the biomass 1 3 other than bio oil htl produces aqueous phase as a byproduct which contains an enormous amount of ions e g anions and can be reused as a growth supplement for microorganisms in the wastewater treatment system other than htl for bio oil production the most commonly used thermochemical process is pyrolysis 3 however only lignocellulosic biomass or algae have been studied for bio oil production using htl technology the use of lipid rich rhodococcus opacus biomass cultivated using refinery wastewater seems to be an economical and sustainable option for bio oil production hence in this study the oleaginous bacterium r opacus that is well known for its capability to utilize waste substrate 8 24 was cultivated using petroleum refinery wastewater for production of bio oil by hydrothermal liquefaction owing to the presence of high cod and complex organics in refinery wastewater it could serve as a suitable substrate for lipid rich biomass production by r opacus 8 however due to the complexity of both the wastewater and the lipid production pathway involved the stoichiometry of the conversion process requires a more detailed study bubble column reactors bcrs are widely used in chemical and biological processes owing to certain advantages such as efficient heat and mass transfer easy operation compactness and relatively low maintenance cost requirement 4 performance of bcr greatly relies on the hydrodynamics and it is considered as one of the most primitive multiphase flow reactors yet useful for the production of fuels fermentation and other biochemical processes 5 7 however the reactor has not been evaluated for treating refinery wastewater which consists of complex recalcitrant organics and requires improved hydrodynamics for efficient treatment also the commercial success of such a method depends on using a suitable bioreactor for growing the bacteria among different bioreactors used for refinery wastewater treatment 8 the bubble column reactor is novel and less explored choice however two main bioreactors that have been reported widely for treating refinery wastewater are continuous stirred tank reactors 8 and membrane sequencing bioreactors 12 therefore the main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a bcr for simultaneous lipid rich r opacus biomass production for converting it into bio oil by htl different process parameters to utilize the refinery wastewater as a substrate were initially screened by using a suitable statistical design of experiments plackett burman and their levels were optimized by performing batch experiments using shake flasks results of batch experiments performed using statistical design of experiments e g plackett burman design provide valuable insights into the effect of different process variables on refinery wastewater treatment by r opacus moreover the optimization of levels of variables affecting the process is essential to improve the process efficiency continuous experiments were then performed employing bcr for lipid rich biomass production from wastewater finally bio oil produced from the bacterial biomass by htl was characterized along with its byproducts however the thermo chemical conversion process employed in this study htl converts not only lipids but also carbohydrates and proteins present in the wet biomass which further enhances the efficiency of this process as compared to other thermochemical processes pyrolysis 14 this study describes simultaneous treatment and utilization of refinery wastewater by oleaginous hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium r opacus in an indigenous laboratory scale bubble column reactor for bio oil production which has not been reported thus far hence this is the first report on the treatment of refinery wastewater and production of bio oil as an alternative and sustainable form of energy from the lipid rich bacterial biomass by htl however the bio oil obtained may have certain drawbacks such as high oxygen content high viscosity and corrosiveness which could be overcome with certain up gradation techniques for a better application potential of the energy rich product these techniques include esterification emulsification catalytic cracking and solvent extraction 14 16 2 material and methods 2 1 refinery wastewater and microorganism raw refinery wastewater was collected from a petroleum refinery plant located at bongaigaon assam india and stored in a freezer at 4 c until used detailed characterization of the wastewater was previously reported in paul et al 8 which revealed a very high chemical oxygen demand cod of 4500 mg l 1 along with the presence of recalcitrant compounds such as aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons for utilizing the refinery wastewater as the substrate for r opacus biomass growth it was mixed with mineral salt media msm of composition as described previously by paul et al 8 the oleaginous gram positive bacterium rhodococcus opacus pd630 was obtained from microbial type culture collection mtcc chandigarh india the strain was grown on 1 8 w v nutrient broth nb agar slants and was stored at 4 c for preparing a seed culture a loop full of the bacteria was inoculated into a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml of luria bertani lb broth after the culture broth reached an absorbance value of 0 99 at 660 nm the bacteria were harvested and used as the inoculum in required quantities it is reported that owing to the presence of highly recalcitrant organics in refinery wastewater microorganisms other than hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria such as r opacus used in this study are unable to grow on such wastewater as the substrate 8 hence it could be surmised that at optimum values of the parameters the wastewater contained predominantly r opacus which could efficiently utilize the organics present in the wastewater as the sole carbon source for lipid rich biomass production 2 2 effect of different factors on lipid rich biomass production from refinery wastewater plackett burman experimental design consisting of a set of 12 experimental runs was used to determine the relative significance of six factors that influenced biomass growth cod removal and lipid production by r opacus the factors in this study included three media constituents viz nh4cl kh2po4 and na2hpo4 and three physicochemical variables i e ph agitation speed and temperature all the batch experimental runs in this statistically designed study were performed in duplicate using 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks with 100 ml working volume 2 3 continuous experiments with bubble column reactor bcr for lipid rich biomass production from refinery wastewater under continuous operation mode a bubble column reactor with a total volume of 2 l and a working volume of 1 8 l was fabricated out of perspex material the reactor height and diameter were 45 and 8 cm respectively the reactor bottom consisted of a stainless steel made nozzle for air inlet along with another port for introducing wastewater into the reactor through a peristaltic pump the reactor was operated in upflow mode and samples were drawn from the reactor outlet fig 1 illustrates a schematic of the bubble column bioreactor used in this study initially the bioreactor was operated under a batch mode of operation by adding wastewater along with minimal salt media msm 1 4 ratio and bacterial inoculum 10 v v followed by continuous aeration following the batch study the reactor was operated at different hydraulic retention times hrt ranging from 24 to 8 h under continuous operation mode to study the effect of hrt on the reactor performance during the continuous experiments with the reactor the influent ph was adjusted to 7 0 and the reactor was operated at an ambient temperature of 27 2 c however no efforts were made to control these parameters as no drastic change in the parameters were observed during the experiments sample analysis was carried out in triplicate and results were presented as mean standard deviation 2 4 hydrothermal liquefaction htl of residual biomass lipid rich r opacus biomass produced in the bioreactor was converted to bio oil by htl and for which biomass was recovered from the reactor and was loaded into stainless steel made htl vessel along with deionized water at a ratio of 1 5 the vessel was then heated to 250 c and the temperature was maintained for 60 min later the vessel was cooled down to room temperature and the contents were separated and recovered by following the methods described by paul et al 8 fig 2 a briefly the htl product mixture was washed with dichloromethane dcm the solids were separated by filtration using whatman filter paper and dried in an oven for 24 h at 105 c whereas the non aqueous dcm phase was used to obtain the bio oil by evaporating the solvent the aqueous phase was filtered and characterized separately the bio oil yield

analytical methods cod g l 1 estimation was carried out as per the standard methods 9 by first centrifuging the samples at 10 000 g for 10 min followed by digestion of the supernatant for 2 h at 120 c

g l 1 in the r opacus biomass was determined by the standard folch method details of all these methods were provided in 8 all the analyses were performed in triplicates for accuracy and reproducibility of the results and error obtained was within 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of different factors the results presented in table 1 indicate variation in cod removal biomass concentration g l 1 and lipid accumulation g l 1 in the experiments carried out by varying the levels of the six factors in this study the cod removal efficiency is maximum in experimental run 9 with the factors set at their respective low levels maximum biomass concentration is observed in the case of experimental run 1 whereas maximum lipid accumulation is obtained in experimental run 12 which was followed closely in experimental runs 5 9 and 10 the variations in the results in the different experimental runs can be attributed to the different roles played by the factors on biomass growth lipid accumulation and cod utilization by the bacterium for example nitrogen limitation or physical stress enhances lipid accumulation in r opacus 10 however physicochemical factors ph temperature and agitation as well as media constituents play a combined role for efficient biomass growth and substrate utilization furthermore the substrate used in this i e refinery wastewater is known to contain several toxic compounds that inhibit biomass activity 11 thus due to the presence of recalcitrant toxic compounds present in the refinery wastewater microbial biomass attains optimal growth after a prolonged time period as compared with other wastewater as substrate dairy wastewater 10 analysis of variance anova of the individual responses revealed that kh2po4 f value 5 60 and p value 0 064 and temperature f value 5 83 and p value 0 060 played a major role towards utilizing refinery wastewater as the substrate by the bacterium the other parameters did not show any significant effect suggesting that at these levels they do not influence refinery wastewater treatment using r opacus these results prove that the present refinery wastewater treatment process using r opacus is robust and is independent of certain parameters 3 2 bubble column reactor experiments the results of cod removal biomass growth and lipid accumulation by r opacus in the batch operated bcr are shown in fig 3 a the cod removal efficiency gradually increased with time and reached its maximum 95 after 72 h of the batch operation and after this time period it almost remained constant following a short lag phase of 8 h r opacus biomass growth entered the exponential growth phase and remained in this phase till 36 h the stationary phase lasted for 60 h i e until 96 h of the batch operation time and then the bacteria entered the death phase the batch experiment was continued for a period of 112 h and the maximum biomass concentration obtained was 2 1 g l 1 the lipid profile matched well with the biomass growth profile as it is a growth associated product the maximum lipid accumulation value is found to be 1 56 g l 1 which is 78 by cell dry weight cdw the results from the batch study are much higher than those obtained previously using a cstr with the same bacterial strain paul et al 8 reported a cod removal of 86 with maximum biomass and lipid concentrations of 1 5 g l 1 and 0 83 g l 1

until 900 c and a final weight of 58 of the initial bio char is obtained fig 6c shows the xrd profile of the solid residue the wide peaks at 20 and 25 2ɵ degree are due to aromatic layers stacking 17 peaks at 33 and 65 2ɵ degree is due to sio2 18 other small peaks observed in the figure are due to the presence of caco3 cao mgo feo etc commonly reported to be present in bio char derived from biomass 17 19 ftir spectra is shown in fig 6d reveal prominent peaks at 551 67 1453 90 1532 36 1626 52 2924 12 3276 46 cm 1 these peaks indicate the presence of hydroxyl o h alkanes c h primary amine

greatly depending upon biomass used and process conditions applied during htl 14 owing to its high porosity high surface area and adsorptive capacity it serves as an excellent adsorbent for application in pollutant removal from wastewater stream 22 bio char has also been extensively used for biogas up gradation by adsorptive removal of h2s from biogas 23 recently it has been shown to improve biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah by making such highly water insoluble compounds more bio available to degrading microorganisms 24 moreover high ash content and oxygen content of the bio char is useful for soil remediation and as a soil amendment to improve soil fertility 25 hence bio oil and other htl byproducts obtained from refinery wastewater using lipid rich r opacus biomass find many applications thus an upgraded product i e bio oil from bacterial biomass can be obtained in the form of energy from industrial waste this gives rise to the bio refinery concept an emerging field that is nowadays the most attractive topic amongst the researchers moreover the techno economic feasibility study can be carried out to estimate the product cost and also the possibility of scaling up this process elemental analysis of the lipid rich r opacus biomass obtained from refinery wastewater showed that it consists of about 60 carbon by htl of the r opacus biomass lipids along with carbohydrates and proteins present were converted to bio oil gc ms analysis of the bio oil further revealed mainly the presence of methyl esters aldehydes and ketones liu et al 26 reported that several reactions including depolymerization re polymerization and hydrolysis were involved in biomass conversion to such compounds by htl besides it has been reported that htl produces bio char as a thermally stable byproduct from carbon rich biomass in order to further improve the properties of bio oil obtained by htl of the bacterial biomass cell disruption followed by cell debris removal and lipid extraction could be evaluated moreover downstream processing of the lipid rich biomass for enhancing the bio oil yield needs to be scaled up beyond the commonly used mini reactor and operated under continuous mode besides detailed techno economic analysis of the htl method followed for bio oil production from such oleaginous microorganisms needs to be carried out and compared with other thermochemical methods to establish its large scale application potential 4 conclusions this study demonstrated efficient utilization of refinery wastewater for lipid rich biomass production by r opacus in bcr operated under batch and continuous modes htl treatment of the r opacus biomass from the bioreactor produced high quality bio oil containing primarily complex hydrocarbons bio char and aqueous phase rich in nutrients such as chloride sulfate phosphate were obtained overall this study showed a sustainable zero waste strategy for refinery wastewater treatment with provisions for
