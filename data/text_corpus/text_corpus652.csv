3260,understanding the hydrological alterations caused by climate change and human activities and the underlying impact factors are essential for sustainable water resource management in river basins several statistical methods particularly the indicator of hydrologic alteration iha have been successfully employed to assess the degree of hydrologic alteration this study proposed a new approach the cloud model combined with the multiple weighting method cm mw for better quantification of the overall degree of hydrologic alteration this approach adopts game theory to select reasonable weights for the iha parameters therefore improving the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation by estimating the similarity between the evaluation cloud and the category cloud this method quantifies the percent data for which the overall degree of hydrological alteration odha would fall into the respective category analysis based on the budyko framework indicated that in the illinois river basin the dominant causes of hydrologic alteration for watersheds with moderate odha and low odha were human activities and climate change the proposed method had a distinct advantage over the conventional approach in classifying the overall hydrological alteration which would provide more accurate information for comprehensive and adaptive river basin management keywords hydrological alteration cloud model illinois river basin 1 introduction rivers provide both natural resources and cultural and ecological services for humankind and essential functions and biotic compositions for a healthy riverine ecosystem peñas and barquín 2019 approximately 31 of the 145 major rivers worldwide have exhibited statistically significant hydrological changes due to climate change and human impacts lan et al 2020 the hydrological alteration of river flow is considered a threat to the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems and a challenge for water resource management schneider et al 2013 mezger et al 2020 li and quiring 2021 hence for better water resource management there is an urgent need to assess the degree of hydrological alteration and to understand the underlying causes of the alterations in watersheds of various scales li et al 2009b piqué et al 2016 tian et al 2019 there are several statistical methods to assess hydrologic alterations the indicator of hydrologic alteration iha developed by richter et al 1996 has been commonly employed shiau and wu 2008 gao et al 2012 piqué et al 2016 gebremicael et al 2019 kiesel et al 2019 tian et al 2019 gunawardana et al 2021 this method has been further improved in multiple types of research gao et al 2009 chen et al 2010 lin et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the iha method uses a total of 33 parameters that exist index redundancy caused by the intercorrelation among those parameters gao et al 2009 wang et al 2017 to avoid index redundancy gao et al 2009 utilized the principal component analysis pca and wang et al 2017 applied the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation critic method to select the representative hydrological indicators however approaches that select representative iha parameters inevitably lose some information weighting each iha parameter with a different value is another preferable way to evaluate the overall hydrological regime as long as the weighting factors can be properly assessed zhou et al 2020 employed the data mining and optimization method of projection pursuit pp to estimate the weight for each iha parameter and to evaluate the overall hydrological alteration considering that the single objective weighting method may not benefit from the knowledge and experience of decision makers sahoo et al 2016 the combination weighting method which gives each iha parameter a different weight based on the data characteristics and empirical judgment provides additional insights into overcoming the one sidedness of a single subjective or objective weighting method to fully utilize the subjective and objective weighting method s advantage and to reduce conflict when integrating them game theory which is designed to handle conflict and cooperation of objects is employed hydrological regime assessment occurs in a multiuncertain environment which involves the complexity of hydrological regimes themselves and the impact of external factors therefore a comprehensive and rational hydrological alteration assessment can not be derived unless the uncertainty can be described and addressed the cloud model which is an effective approach for converting qualitative descriptions into quantitative values and for mitigating the impacts of uncertainties on the accuracy of the evaluating results yao et al 2021 has been successfully employed in water quality assessment liao et al 2019 yao et al 2021 river health assessment yang and wang 2020 flood susceptibility evaluation li et al 2020 and other related water resource studies lu et al 2017 thus we believe that the cloud model combined with the multiple weighting method cm mw would be a useful tool for comprehensively and reasonably assessing hydrological alterations changes in climatic conditions such as precipitation evaporation and soil moisture wang et al 2019 and anthropogenic factors driven by urbanization ecological restoration water storage consumption human land use change and the construction of water resource facilities todhunter et al 2020 are considered the major causes of hydrologic alterations an increasing number of studies have focused on the hydrological alteration response to climate change and human activities tian et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 gunawardana et al 2021 tian et al 2019 investigated the relationship among hydrological connectivity reservoirs and the degree of hydrological alteration dha and found that dha was highly affected by land use changes and dam reservoir construction and was more sensitive to land use changes in northwestern china zhou et al 2020 showed that with an increase in the number of reservoirs the degree of alteration for iha parameters gradually increased not only in groups 1 2 3 and 4 but also in the overall degree of hydrological alteration odha albeit with a decrease in group 5 gunawardana et al 2021 revealed with corroborating evidence that land use precipitation and temperature affected different aspects of the hydrological regime these studies have highlighted the importance of climate change and human activities on the hydrological regime however studies that quantify the causes of hydrological alteration are limited the main objective of this study was to develop an approach cm mw to evaluate the overall degree of hydrologic alteration and to understand the contributions to the alteration by climate and human impacts 2 study area and data the illinois river basin irb with an area of approximately 75 156 km2 is located in the midwest united states and is one of the major tributary watersheds to the mississippi river the illinois river with its main stem of 435 km serves as a commercial waterway that links the great lakes to the mississippi river hodgkins et al 2007 fig 1 the land use within the irb is predominantly agriculture except for the highly urbanized areas in the chicago metropolitan region similar to the major tributaries of the mississippi river the irb is a focus area of federal agencies and other organizations concerned with watershed management and ecological restoration in the united states niemann and eltahir 2004 lian et al 2007 however due to climate changes and intensive human activities such as urbanization levee development and other anthropogenic stressors the irb experienced significant hydrological modification subsequent river ecosystem degradation biological invasion etc lian et al 2012 deboer et al 2021 the streamflow data employed in this study were obtained from the united states geologic survey usgs stream gauge network http nwis waterdata usgs gov nwis to study the long term effect only 11 streamflow gauges with continuous daily flow records from 1950 to 2019 were selected for this study the annual precipitation mm and annual mean max and mean minimum air temperature c were obtained from the national climatic data center ncdc for the same periods fig 1 shows the locations of the flow gauge stations and meteorological stations with continuous long term records from 1950 to 2019 the thiessen polygon method was selected to interpolate the average annual weather data for watersheds without observed data the potential evapotranspiration pet mm was estimated by using the hargreaves equation hargreaves 1985 which is one of the methods shown to be effective for pet estimation arnold and allen 1996 xu and singh 2001 3 methods 3 1 trend free prewhitening mann kendall test and pettitt test the mann kendall test has been widely utilized to evaluate the change trend of hydrological time series data particularly when the slope of the change trend is steep however the trend free prewhitening mann kendall test tfpw mk test is more advantageous for data series without significance by effectively reducing the autocorrelation of the serial trend or eliminating it the tfpw mk test would be more suitable for detecting the potential trends of the annual runoff for the majority of the watersheds with dominant agricultural land the tfpw mk test can be stated as follows zheng et al 2018 1 β median x j x i j i j i 2 x 1 t x t β t 3 r 1 i 1 n 1 x i x i x i 1 x i 1 i 1 n 1 x i x i 2 i 1 n 1 x i 1 x i 1 2 4 x 2 t x 1 t r 1 x 1 t 1 5 x 3 t x 2 t β t where β is the slope of the trend in the sample data series x x 1 t is the data series after removing the trend component r 1 is the coefficient of the first order autocorrelation x 2 t is the data series after removing the autocorrelation and x 3 t is the new data series that will not be affected by the autocorrelation it is worth noting that eq 4 works when r 1 passes the significance test otherwise the original mann kendall test is directly applied to x 1 t the details of the original mann kendall test which is considered a widely employed method are discussed in zheng et al 2018 the iha analysis needs to separate the hydrologic data series into pre and postchange periods lian et al 2012 performed the pettitt test to identify the major change point for flow and stage data series in the main stem of the illinois river providing justification to separate the data into pre and postchange series the pettitt test is based on the correlation between the ranks of a time series and their time order and can handle nonnormality and censoring data with high asymptotic efficiency bao et al 2019 this study also utilized the pettitt test to identify change points in the streamflow time series data thus properly grouping the flow data for the pre and postchange periods 3 2 cloud model approach for iha 3 2 1 indicator of hydrologic alteration iha the iha system comprising 33 hydrologic parameters was applied to characterize the flow regime in terms of five fundamental ecological attributes i e magnitude timing frequency duration and rate of change richter et al 1996 the dha is quantified by the range of variability approach rva for each iha parameter by comparing the streamflow regimes between the pre change periods and postchange periods zhang et al 2019 6 d i n oi n exp n exp 100 where n oi is the count of years in which the observed value of the hydrologic parameter fell within the targeted range and n exp is the number of years in which the value is expected to fall within the targeted range n exp could be calculated by n exp γ n t γ 50 when the target range falls between the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile value and n t is the total number of years during the postchange period the overall degree of hydrological alteration odha becomes the summation of the product derived from dha and its respective weight for each parameter which is 7 d o i 1 m w i d i in which w i is the weight of dha for the i th iha parameter conventionally the same weight 1 32 was assumed for each parameter when estimating the odha in this study several weighting methods were adopted to estimate the weight for each iha parameter w i and the overall degree of alteration the odha from these weighting methods and the conventional method were compared to understand how representative the equal weight odha would be 3 2 2 cloud model based approach to improve the assessment of odha a study by gao et al 2009 showed certain redundancies among the iha parameters and that the uncertainty was generally disregarded in the evaluation of hydrological alteration the cloud model proposed by li et al 2009a can effectively address the uncertainty and fuzziness inherent in the dataset based on the cloud s operation reasoning and control li et al 2020 liao et al 2019 the cm mw methods for better estimation of the weights for the iha parameters and subsequently employed game theory to estimate the average of the weights from multiple weighting methods 3 2 2 1 weighting methods estimation of weights for the iha parameters is essential for the overall degree of hydrological alteration the weighting methods selected for this study include the analytic hierarchy process ahp method the pp method the critic method and the entropy et method the ahp method is one of the most widely employed subjective weighting methods the ahp can integrate the effects of various variables and comprehensively consider the subjective experience of the data xu et al 2018 this method is further detailed in a paper by bathrellos et al 2017 the pp method can reflect the characteristics of original data by projecting high dimensional data into low dimensional space thus identifying the best projection direction through a certain combination zhou et al 2020 the pp method is an objective weighting method for data mining and optimization herrera et al 2010 the critic method diakoulaki et al 1995 is another objective weighting method this method estimates the weight by the conflict and contrast intensities of the data evaluated the contrast intensity is calculated by the mean square deviation and conflict represents the correlation between the two evaluation indices the weight calculated by the et method wang and lee 2009 describes the difference between two alternatives with regard to a certain attribute the entropy weight is small when the entropy value is high 3 2 2 2 game theory gt game theory is a subset of optimality modeling in certain respects game theory is the science of strategy or at least the optimal decision making of independent and competing actors in a strategic setting game theory explores the outcomes of the interactions among two or more self interested agents who exchange or share resources chhipi shrestha et al 2019 each self interested agent is assumed to be a rational and intelligent player who aims to maximize the expected payoff william et al 2017 game theory can provide the mathematical support required to obtain the optimal strategy maximizing the payoffs achieved by all agents jato espino and ruiz puente 2021 in this study the subjective and objective weighting methods can be considered two agents or players in the game the combination weight subjective objective can be calculated by game theory therefore avoiding the one sidedness of the combination results jato espino and ruiz puente 2021 the combination weight based on game theory is the result of the weight game the gt method is further detailed in the publication by liu et al 2020 3 2 2 3 cloud model the cloud model was proposed by li et al 2009a as a cognitive model this model can effectively address the uncertainty and fuzziness inherent in the dataset based on the cloud s operation reasoning and control liao et al 2019 li et al 2020 the cloud model realizes the transformation between qualitative concepts and quantitative concepts through the forward drop generator fdg and backward drop generator bdg li et al 2020 the fdg is used to transform the qualitative concept into multiple cloud drops with three numerical characters e x e n h e which involves the following four steps step 1 to generate a normal random number e nn n e n h e 2 step 2 to generate a normal random number x i n e x e nn 2 step 3 determine the gaussian membership degree related to the qualitative concept the following formula 8 is used 8 f e x e x 2 2 e nn 2 step 4 repeat steps 1 2 and 3 until the total n cloud droplets are generated n was 1500 in this study the bdg transforms a group of cloud drops into three characters e x e n h e 9 ex 1 m j 1 m x j e n π 2 1 m j 1 m x j e x h e s 2 e n 2 where ex is the mean value x j is the data series j 1 2 m m is the number of data series s 2 is the variance s 2 1 m 1 j 1 m x j e x 2 en is the entropy for ex and he is the entropy of en 10 e x cat x max x min 2 e n cat x max x min 6 h e cat k e n cat where e x cat e n cat and h e cat are the mean value entropy of e x cat and entropy of e n cat respectively for the category cloud x max and x min are the maximum value and minimum value respectively for each category boundary k is a coefficient that is used to adjust the linear relationship between e n class and h e class and k was set to 0 1 yao et al 2021 similarity for normal cloud models based on the fuzzy nearness degree scmfnd was adopted to realize the qualitative concept transition based on the cloud model with the quantitative data in the process of data mining 11 scmfnd n 1 n 2 1 2 1 2 φ m φ m where φ x x 1 2 π e t 2 2 d t m e x 2 e x 1 e n 1 2 h

steps that would provide a better understanding of the proposed cloud model based approach for assessing hydrological alterations step 1 iha analysis the iha software supported by the nature conservancy https www conservationgateway org conservationpractices freshwater environmentalflows methodsandtools indicatorsofhydrologicalteration pages iha software download aspx was selected to calculate the degree of hydrological alteration for each iha parameter step 2 estimation of combination weight the subjective weight was calculated by ahp and the objective weights were separately estimated by the pp et and critic methods game theory was then applied to integrate the subjective and objective weights and to generate the combination weight matrix w ij 32 3 step 3 estimation of cloud characteristics based on the combination weight generated in step 2 the multiweighting cloud s characteristics e x w e n w and h e w of each iha parameter were calculated by the bdg yao et al 2021 using formula 9 the evaluation cloud characteristics e x eva e n eva and h e eva for the odha are obtained by multiplying the multiweighting cloud characteristics e x w e n w and h e w by the dha for each iha parameter simultaneously the category cloud characteristics e x cat e n cat and h e cat for the hydrological alteration high alteration 0 33 moderate alteration 33 67 and low alteration 67 100 are calculated by another bdg that is formula 10 step 4 generation of cloud model the multiweighting cloud evaluation cloud of overall hydrological alteration and category cloud of hydrological alteration are all calculated by the fdg using formula 8 the hydrological alteration category was determined using the scmfnd method with formula 11 3 3 budyko framework for contributing factors hydrological processes in watersheds are significantly affected by changes in climatic conditions and intensified human activities this study employed the budyko framework to quantify the contributions of climate and human factors to hydrological alteration according to the budyko framework assuming that the storage change is negligible on the multiyear scale todhunter et al 2020 liu et al 2021 the actual annual evapotranspiration e t a can be estimated from precipitation p and runoff q 12 e t a p q the budyko hypothesis stipulated an analytical solution for e t a with the potential evapotranspiration pet and precipitation p roderick and farquhar 2011 13 e t a p p e t p ω p e t ω 1 ω where ω represents the catchment specific land surface parameter todhunter et al 2020 zhou et al 2016 waggoner 1990 introduced the elasticity concept to represent the quantitative change in streamflow q caused by changes in p pet and ω changes in the streamflow can be expressed by the following equation roderick and farquhar 2011 14 dq q ε p dp p ε pet dpet pet ε ω d ω ω where the sensitivity coefficients ε p q q p p ε pet q q p e t p e t and ε ω q q ω ω represent the relative change in q as a function of the per unit relative change in p pet and parameter ω li and quiring 2021 eq 14 can also be expressed as 15 dq q p d p q p e t d p e t q ω d ω 16 q p 1 et p pe t ω p ω p e

following equations 19 d q c ε p dp p ε pet dpet pet q 20 d q ω ε ω d ω ω q 4 results and discussion 4 1 identifying change trends and change points fig 3 shows the change trends of streamflow and precipitation for the respective gauging stations in the illinois river basin the annual streamflow in all watersheds with the exception of la moine had an increasing trend with a significance level greater than 5 seven of these ten watersheds i e kankakee river des plaines river hickory creek du page river fox river vermilion river and mackinaw river show an increasing trend with 1 significance levels which were mainly located in the upper irb for precipitation the kankakee river des plaines river hickory creek du page river and fox river watersheds had a more significant increasing trend with p values 0 01 whereas other watersheds which were mainly located in the lower irb did not show a significant increasing trend fig 3b the years over which the precipitation and streamflow exhibited significant change were identified through the pettitt test analysis thus providing justification to divide the time series data into pre and postchange periods for the iha analysis listed in table 1 were periods when a significant change in streamflow occurred as shown in table 1 abrupt streamflow change occurred for the majority of the watersheds in the period of approximately 1967 1972 which might be primarily attributed to the change in precipitation within the river basin however the period when the abrupt change occurred for hickory creek at joliet and du page river at shorewood gauge station was approximately 1989 1990 when the most intensive human activities population shifts and land use changes occurred near the end of the 1980 s in chicago sciences 2001 4 2 assessing hydrological alteration 4 2 1 hydrological alteration indicated by individual parameters the dha for all iha parameters was calculated using iha software with the daily flow data and is presented in the heatmap shown in fig 4 the heatmap shows that the dha for the 1 day 3 day 7 day and 30 day minimum flows low and high pulse counts and durations rise rate and fall rate in the des plain hickory du page and fox river watersheds were greater than 0 67 which was in the high degree of hydrological alteration category the high hydrological alteration would have impacts on the water resources and ecosystem larsen et al 2021 showed that the low flow pulse counts could influence the habitat availability in the river basin and further affect the health of the river ecosystem which could also be rippled by the extremely low flow 1 day 3 day 7 day and 30 day minimum flows and the rise fall rate by affecting the life cycles of aquatic and riparian species and spawning habitat yang et al 2008 the fox river had a moderate degree of change for the minimum flow rise rate and fall rate which is typically caused by urbanization the big bureau creek and kankakee river might have been impacted by urban land development but the dha was low for most of the iha parameters the dha for other watersheds was generally in the low category because the land use had been predominantly agriculture without much change over the study period 4 2 2 weights for individual iha parameters the weight for each iha parameter was also an indication of relative importance in evaluating the overall degree of hydrological alteration odha among the four weighting methods ahp was considered a subjective approach and pp critic and et were considered objective weights for 32 iha parameters in the ahp method are selected by referring to experience and previous studies in a similar region gao et al 2009 yang et al 2008 whereas the pp critic and et methods estimate weights based on the variability inherent in the data the weight matrix for pp ahp critic ahp and et ahp combinations was then established for the game theory method the cloud characteristics e x w e n w and h e w of the weight matrix were generated by the backward drop generator and the multiweighting cloud was then generated by the forward drop generator as shown in fig 5 the possible cloud drops of weight with a membership degree greater than 95 were selected to represent a weight range for each iha parameter e x w is the most representative weight when the membership degree is 1 it can be seen in fig 5 that the most representative weight calculated by the cloud model e x w ranged between the weights from ahp and other objective weighting methods the representative weight e x w calculated by the cm mw method reduced the dispersion of weight for 32 iha parameters at all gauging stations compared with the other four single methods the cm mw method also provides a variable weight range for each iha parameter based on the inherent characteristics of data this range appears to be more reasonable by combining the subjective judgment and objective characteristics in the data the results in fig 5 indicated that the 7 day and 30 day minimum 3 day maximum high pulse duration and rise rate had higher weights in most of the watersheds in the illinois river basin which was similar to the patterns in the results obtained by yang et al 2008 and gao et al 2009 for watersheds in the upper irb the iha parameters with higher weights also include the february flow for watersheds in the lower irb the monthly flows in november also had higher weights which could be attributed to the change in climate conditions the overlapped iha parameters for high weight ranking and dha analysis which had an important role in reflecting alteration to ecological flow regimes include the magnitude of extreme low flows 7 day and 30 day minimum related to biodiversity high pulse duration associated with the survival rate of organisms and rise rate linked with spawning habitat yang et al 2008 the results from the above analysis provide insight into the level of importance for the iha parameter in reflecting alteration 4 2 3 overall degree of hydrological alteration odha the odha for each parameter was the sum of the products of dha and its respective weight with the weight for each iha parameter that is being estimated the odha for each watershed was calculated table 2 in the rva method all 32 iha parameters were assigned an equal weight of 1 32 and weights for the other 5 methods were calculated as previously introduced a comparison of the odha from each weighting method table 2 showed that for the same watershed despite the variation in the weights estimated by different methods the odha computed from each weighting method fell into the same category the results from this study showed that the simplest uniform weight assigned to all 32 parameters in the iha method would classify the odha into the same category as other subjective methods or even the most complicated cloud model based multiweighting method cm mw introduced in this study implying that the iha method of assigning equal weight to all iha parameters might be the simplest and most acceptable method for estimating the odha and that the consistency of cm mw with other methods proved that cm mw is also a feasible method for odha however incorporating expert experience and the information in data into game theory and cloud modeling cm mw would select more reasonable weights for the iha parameters and prevent double counting of certain aspects of the hydrological regime thus enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation results wang et al 2017 furthermore the cloud model based method would also be able to quantify the multiple uncertainties of actual information and information acquisition in the process of evaluating odha wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b based on the cloud model all possible odhas were represented by three cloud characters e x eva e n eva and h e eva for each gauging station fig 6 shows the cloud maps for the three hydrological alteration categories and the overall evaluation cloud map for each watershed each point along the x axis represents a possible odha and the y axis represents the membership degree of the possible odha or the relative likelihood of each possible odha the central value of the evaluation cloud e x eva was the most representative odha with a relative likelihood of one additionally in fig 6 the spread of the evaluation cloud e n eva can be considered a measurement of randomness and fuzziness or uncertainty li et al 2009a among all eleven watersheds the e n eva values for the des plains river du page river and fox river watersheds were distinctly greater than those for the other watersheds indicating greater uncertainty in the representative odha due to the likelihood of a greater complexity of hydrological conditions in the more urbanized watersheds h e eva as a measurement of the degree of uncertainty of e n eva also had greater values for these three watersheds the pearson correlation test showed a good correlation between e x eva and e n eva and between e x eva and h e eva with both coefficients greater than 0 90 the cm mw method proposed in this study had a distinct advantage over the conventional approach in classifying the overall hydrological alteration by estimating the similarity between the evaluation cloud and the category cloud as shown in fig 7 the cm mw method was able to provide the percent data for which the odha would fall into the respective category for example for the des plaines river watershed 39 of the data fell into the high odha category 64 of the data fell into the moderate category and 12 fell into the low category fig 7 shows that watersheds had the highest similarity with moderate category clouds such as the du page river des plains river fox river and hickory creek watersheds which were mainly located in more urbanized areas other watersheds such as the vermilion river sangamon river spoon river mackinaw river kankakee river big bureau creek and la moine river watersheds had higher similarity with the low category cloud 4 3 quantifying the contribution of climate change and human activities to odha 4 3 1 quantifying the changes in climate and human activities the budyko frame has been widely and successfully employed to characterize the contributions of climate factors and human activities to hydrological impacts the budyko statistics of climate p and pet and catchment characteristics ω were calculated to quantify the total changes that occurred during the last 70 years within the illinois river basin fig 8 the budyko analyses applied the data series in the pre and postchange periods for the watersheds with odha in the low and moderate hydrological alteration categories as shown in fig 8a the medians of p for the low category and moderate category in the postchange periods were 975 80 mm and 993 46 mm respectively and both had a distinct increase compared with the medians of p of 871 92 mm and 895 31 mm respectively for the low and moderate categories in the prechange period the percentage of increase for the low and moderate categories was approximately 10 the change in pet for both the low category and moderate category of watersheds was not as significant as p which was decreased by approximately 2 05 and 1 40 respectively in the postchange period fig 8d the medians for parameter ω between the post and prechange periods were reduced by 13 55 for the low category watershed but exhibited a maximum of 29 37 for the moderate category watersheds fig 8f implying possible changes in land surface conditions that might have reduced the infiltration and increased surface runoff 4 3 2 partitioning the contribution of climate change and human activities the relative contributions from climatic conditions human activities and other factors to hydrological alteration were estimated for each watershed fig 9 a it can be seen from the comparison of the bar plots in fig 9a that watersheds in the upper part of the illinois river basin such as the du page des plain and hickory which were more urbanized had more contributions to hydrological alterations than climate factors for watersheds in the middle part of the basin including the big bureau creek kankakee vermillion and mackinaw watersheds the impacts from climate conditions and human activities were approximately the same for the spoon river sangamon river and la moine river watersheds located in the low part of the basin climate conditions had a much greater impact than human activities although the fox river watershed had significant urbanization in its low reach area its major contrition of flow was derived from the chain of lakes in its upper reach so the overall impact from climate conditions was still greater than that from human activities the violin plots in fig 9b show the relative contribution of human activities and climate changes for all watersheds in the low and moderate hydrological alteration categories human activities had a greater contribution than the climatic factors to the hydrological alteration for the moderate odha watershed group with a median of 56 88 for human activities and a median of 34 18 for climatic factors for the watershed group in the low odha category the relative contribution of climate change was greater than that of human activities with medians of 50 19 for climate and 45 37 for human activities considering the human activities represented by the parameter ω the relative contribution of its change to hydrological alteration was greater than that of climate change for the moderate odha watersheds the parameter ω encodes various catchment properties affecting runoff generation such as vegetation land cover changes and topography roderick and farquhar 2011 li et al 2019 in this study the significant changes in the relative contribution of parameter ω may be linked to the intensive urbanization since 1970 hejazi and markus 2009 li and quiring 2021 and the land use change driven by human activities with the speed of urbanization the impervious surface area expands gradually and reduces the agricultural area it is worth emphasizing that the land cover changes and topography changes accelerated runoff generation and further increased streamflow in addition the improvement in the water quality since the 1970 s could contribute to the land use changes around the river and the ecological system in the river to some extent this finding is consistent with previous studies zhang and schilling 2006 hejazi and markus 2009 li and quiring 2021 that suggested that in human induced watersheds human activities were the main driving factor for streamflow variations considering climate change represented by p and pet the relative change in p between the prechange period and the postchange period is more significant than that in pet that is the increased precipitation is also the major climate factor affecting hydrological alteration the hydrological alteration for the low odha watersheds can be mainly attributed to the increased precipitation which could be explained by the climate variability driven by the impact of the north atlantic oceans and great lakes basin hodgkins et al 2007 mallakpour and villarini 2017 regionally human induced climate change could also cause an increase in p such as the percentage of cultivated crops this result was consistent with the findings of stahl et al 2010 who observed that hydrological alteration was predominated by climate change in watersheds with low alternation however certain limitations still exist in the current study which need to be further explored in this research another driver others affecting hydrological alteration was shown albeit with a low value of the relative contribution the definitions of other researchers includes water consumption for urban residents and the diversion flow from other lakes wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b however there still exist some errors and uncertainties in the process of analyzing data as there are inevitably some missing data at meteorological stations additionally the coupling effect of human activities and climate change on hydrological alteration is also an expected reason for exploration 5 conclusion the study proposed a new approach using the cloud model combined with multiple weighting methods cm mw to evaluate the impact or weight of individual iha indices on hydrological alteration and to provide a more reasonable assessment of the overall degree of hydrological alteration by applying the method to the eleven subwatersheds with flow data series for the period 1950 2019 in the illinois river basin this study showed that the abrupt streamflow change for the majority of the watersheds occurred in the period of approximately 1967 1972 which might be primarily attributed to the change in precipitation within the river basin however for more urbanized watersheds the abrupt change occurred in the period of approximately 1989 1990 the odha assessment analysis indicated that the simplest uniform weight assigned to all 32 parameters in the iha method would classify the odha into the same category as other subjective methods implying that the iha method by assigning equal weight to all iha parameters might be the simplest and most acceptable for estimating the odha however by combining the subjective and objective weighting methods using game theory the cm mw method would select more reasonable weights for the iha parameters thus enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation result the cm mw method proposed in this study had a distinct advantage over the conventional approach in classifying the overall hydrological alteration by estimating the similarity between the evaluation cloud and the category cloud the cm mw method was able to provide the percent data for which the odha would fall into the respective category the budyko analyses indicated that in the illinois river basin human activities were the primary driver for watersheds with moderate overall hydrological alteration whereas climate change was the major contributor to the overall hydrological alteration for watersheds in the low odha authors contributions academician dr jianyun zhang provided guidance for this research dr yanqing lian dr kairong lin

3260,understanding the hydrological alterations caused by climate change and human activities and the underlying impact factors are essential for sustainable water resource management in river basins several statistical methods particularly the indicator of hydrologic alteration iha have been successfully employed to assess the degree of hydrologic alteration this study proposed a new approach the cloud model combined with the multiple weighting method cm mw for better quantification of the overall degree of hydrologic alteration this approach adopts game theory to select reasonable weights for the iha parameters therefore improving the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation by estimating the similarity between the evaluation cloud and the category cloud this method quantifies the percent data for which the overall degree of hydrological alteration odha would fall into the respective category analysis based on the budyko framework indicated that in the illinois river basin the dominant causes of hydrologic alteration for watersheds with moderate odha and low odha were human activities and climate change the proposed method had a distinct advantage over the conventional approach in classifying the overall hydrological alteration which would provide more accurate information for comprehensive and adaptive river basin management keywords hydrological alteration cloud model illinois river basin 1 introduction rivers provide both natural resources and cultural and ecological services for humankind and essential functions and biotic compositions for a healthy riverine ecosystem peñas and barquín 2019 approximately 31 of the 145 major rivers worldwide have exhibited statistically significant hydrological changes due to climate change and human impacts lan et al 2020 the hydrological alteration of river flow is considered a threat to the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems and a challenge for water resource management schneider et al 2013 mezger et al 2020 li and quiring 2021 hence for better water resource management there is an urgent need to assess the degree of hydrological alteration and to understand the underlying causes of the alterations in watersheds of various scales li et al 2009b piqué et al 2016 tian et al 2019 there are several statistical methods to assess hydrologic alterations the indicator of hydrologic alteration iha developed by richter et al 1996 has been commonly employed shiau and wu 2008 gao et al 2012 piqué et al 2016 gebremicael et al 2019 kiesel et al 2019 tian et al 2019 gunawardana et al 2021 this method has been further improved in multiple types of research gao et al 2009 chen et al 2010 lin et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the iha method uses a total of 33 parameters that exist index redundancy caused by the intercorrelation among those parameters gao et al 2009 wang et al 2017 to avoid index redundancy gao et al 2009 utilized the principal component analysis pca and wang et al 2017 applied the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation critic method to select the representative hydrological indicators however approaches that select representative iha parameters inevitably lose some information weighting each iha parameter with a different value is another preferable way to evaluate the overall hydrological regime as long as the weighting factors can be properly assessed zhou et al 2020 employed the data mining and optimization method of projection pursuit pp to estimate the weight for each iha parameter and to evaluate the overall hydrological alteration considering that the single objective weighting method may not benefit from the knowledge and experience of decision makers sahoo et al 2016 the combination weighting method which gives each iha parameter a different weight based on the data characteristics and empirical judgment provides additional insights into overcoming the one sidedness of a single subjective or objective weighting method to fully utilize the subjective and objective weighting method s advantage and to reduce conflict when integrating them game theory which is designed to handle conflict and cooperation of objects is employed hydrological regime assessment occurs in a multiuncertain environment which involves the complexity of hydrological regimes themselves and the impact of external factors therefore a comprehensive and rational hydrological alteration assessment can not be derived unless the uncertainty can be described and addressed the cloud model which is an effective approach for converting qualitative descriptions into quantitative values and for mitigating the impacts of uncertainties on the accuracy of the evaluating results yao et al 2021 has been successfully employed in water quality assessment liao et al 2019 yao et al 2021 river health assessment yang and wang 2020 flood susceptibility evaluation li et al 2020 and other related water resource studies lu et al 2017 thus we believe that the cloud model combined with the multiple weighting method cm mw would be a useful tool for comprehensively and reasonably assessing hydrological alterations changes in climatic conditions such as precipitation evaporation and soil moisture wang et al 2019 and anthropogenic factors driven by urbanization ecological restoration water storage consumption human land use change and the construction of water resource facilities todhunter et al 2020 are considered the major causes of hydrologic alterations an increasing number of studies have focused on the hydrological alteration response to climate change and human activities tian et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 gunawardana et al 2021 tian et al 2019 investigated the relationship among hydrological connectivity reservoirs and the degree of hydrological alteration dha and found that dha was highly affected by land use changes and dam reservoir construction and was more sensitive to land use changes in northwestern china zhou et al 2020 showed that with an increase in the number of reservoirs the degree of alteration for iha parameters gradually increased not only in groups 1 2 3 and 4 but also in the overall degree of hydrological alteration odha albeit with a decrease in group 5 gunawardana et al 2021 revealed with corroborating evidence that land use precipitation and temperature affected different aspects of the hydrological regime these studies have highlighted the importance of climate change and human activities on the hydrological regime however studies that quantify the causes of hydrological alteration are limited the main objective of this study was to develop an approach cm mw to evaluate the overall degree of hydrologic alteration and to understand the contributions to the alteration by climate and human impacts 2 study area and data the illinois river basin irb with an area of approximately 75 156 km2 is located in the midwest united states and is one of the major tributary watersheds to the mississippi river the illinois river with its main stem of 435 km serves as a commercial waterway that links the great lakes to the mississippi river hodgkins et al 2007 fig 1 the land use within the irb is predominantly agriculture except for the highly urbanized areas in the chicago metropolitan region similar to the major tributaries of the mississippi river the irb is a focus area of federal agencies and other organizations concerned with watershed management and ecological restoration in the united states niemann and eltahir 2004 lian et al 2007 however due to climate changes and intensive human activities such as urbanization levee development and other anthropogenic stressors the irb experienced significant hydrological modification subsequent river ecosystem degradation biological invasion etc lian et al 2012 deboer et al 2021 the streamflow data employed in this study were obtained from the united states geologic survey usgs stream gauge network http nwis waterdata usgs gov nwis to study the long term effect only 11 streamflow gauges with continuous daily flow records from 1950 to 2019 were selected for this study the annual precipitation mm and annual mean max and mean minimum air temperature c were obtained from the national climatic data center ncdc for the same periods fig 1 shows the locations of the flow gauge stations and meteorological stations with continuous long term records from 1950 to 2019 the thiessen polygon method was selected to interpolate the average annual weather data for watersheds without observed data the potential evapotranspiration pet mm was estimated by using the hargreaves equation hargreaves 1985 which is one of the methods shown to be effective for pet estimation arnold and allen 1996 xu and singh 2001 3 methods 3 1 trend free prewhitening mann kendall test and pettitt test the mann kendall test has been widely utilized to evaluate the change trend of hydrological time series data particularly when the slope of the change trend is steep however the trend free prewhitening mann kendall test tfpw mk test is more advantageous for data series without significance by effectively reducing the autocorrelation of the serial trend or eliminating it the tfpw mk test would be more suitable for detecting the potential trends of the annual runoff for the majority of the watersheds with dominant agricultural land the tfpw mk test can be stated as follows zheng et al 2018 1 β median x j x i j i j i 2 x 1 t x t β t 3 r 1 i 1 n 1 x i x i x i 1 x i 1 i 1 n 1 x i x i 2 i 1 n 1 x i 1 x i 1 2 4 x 2 t x 1 t r 1 x 1 t 1 5 x 3 t x 2 t β t where β is the slope of the trend in the sample data series x x 1 t is the data series after removing the trend component r 1 is the coefficient of the first order autocorrelation x 2 t is the data series after removing the autocorrelation and x 3 t is the new data series that will not be affected by the autocorrelation it is worth noting that eq 4 works when r 1 passes the significance test otherwise the original mann kendall test is directly applied to x 1 t the details of the original mann kendall test which is considered a widely employed method are discussed in zheng et al 2018 the iha analysis needs to separate the hydrologic data series into pre and postchange periods lian et al 2012 performed the pettitt test to identify the major change point for flow and stage data series in the main stem of the illinois river providing justification to separate the data into pre and postchange series the pettitt test is based on the correlation between the ranks of a time series and their time order and can handle nonnormality and censoring data with high asymptotic efficiency bao et al 2019 this study also utilized the pettitt test to identify change points in the streamflow time series data thus properly grouping the flow data for the pre and postchange periods 3 2 cloud model approach for iha 3 2 1 indicator of hydrologic alteration iha the iha system comprising 33 hydrologic parameters was applied to characterize the flow regime in terms of five fundamental ecological attributes i e magnitude timing frequency duration and rate of change richter et al 1996 the dha is quantified by the range of variability approach rva for each iha parameter by comparing the streamflow regimes between the pre change periods and postchange periods zhang et al 2019 6 d i n oi n exp n exp 100 where n oi is the count of years in which the observed value of the hydrologic parameter fell within the targeted range and n exp is the number of years in which the value is expected to fall within the targeted range n exp could be calculated by n exp γ n t γ 50 when the target range falls between the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile value and n t is the total number of years during the postchange period the overall degree of hydrological alteration odha becomes the summation of the product derived from dha and its respective weight for each parameter which is 7 d o i 1 m w i d i in which w i is the weight of dha for the i th iha parameter conventionally the same weight 1 32 was assumed for each parameter when estimating the odha in this study several weighting methods were adopted to estimate the weight for each iha parameter w i and the overall degree of alteration the odha from these weighting methods and the conventional method were compared to understand how representative the equal weight odha would be 3 2 2 cloud model based approach to improve the assessment of odha a study by gao et al 2009 showed certain redundancies among the iha parameters and that the uncertainty was generally disregarded in the evaluation of hydrological alteration the cloud model proposed by li et al 2009a can effectively address the uncertainty and fuzziness inherent in the dataset based on the cloud s operation reasoning and control li et al 2020 liao et al 2019 the cm mw methods for better estimation of the weights for the iha parameters and subsequently employed game theory to estimate the average of the weights from multiple weighting methods 3 2 2 1 weighting methods estimation of weights for the iha parameters is essential for the overall degree of hydrological alteration the weighting methods selected for this study include the analytic hierarchy process ahp method the pp method the critic method and the entropy et method the ahp method is one of the most widely employed subjective weighting methods the ahp can integrate the effects of various variables and comprehensively consider the subjective experience of the data xu et al 2018 this method is further detailed in a paper by bathrellos et al 2017 the pp method can reflect the characteristics of original data by projecting high dimensional data into low dimensional space thus identifying the best projection direction through a certain combination zhou et al 2020 the pp method is an objective weighting method for data mining and optimization herrera et al 2010 the critic method diakoulaki et al 1995 is another objective weighting method this method estimates the weight by the conflict and contrast intensities of the data evaluated the contrast intensity is calculated by the mean square deviation and conflict represents the correlation between the two evaluation indices the weight calculated by the et method wang and lee 2009 describes the difference between two alternatives with regard to a certain attribute the entropy weight is small when the entropy value is high 3 2 2 2 game theory gt game theory is a subset of optimality modeling in certain respects game theory is the science of strategy or at least the optimal decision making of independent and competing actors in a strategic setting game theory explores the outcomes of the interactions among two or more self interested agents who exchange or share resources chhipi shrestha et al 2019 each self interested agent is assumed to be a rational and intelligent player who aims to maximize the expected payoff william et al 2017 game theory can provide the mathematical support required to obtain the optimal strategy maximizing the payoffs achieved by all agents jato espino and ruiz puente 2021 in this study the subjective and objective weighting methods can be considered two agents or players in the game the combination weight subjective objective can be calculated by game theory therefore avoiding the one sidedness of the combination results jato espino and ruiz puente 2021 the combination weight based on game theory is the result of the weight game the gt method is further detailed in the publication by liu et al 2020 3 2 2 3 cloud model the cloud model was proposed by li et al 2009a as a cognitive model this model can effectively address the uncertainty and fuzziness inherent in the dataset based on the cloud s operation reasoning and control liao et al 2019 li et al 2020 the cloud model realizes the transformation between qualitative concepts and quantitative concepts through the forward drop generator fdg and backward drop generator bdg li et al 2020 the fdg is used to transform the qualitative concept into multiple cloud drops with three numerical characters e x e n h e which involves the following four steps step 1 to generate a normal random number e nn n e n h e 2 step 2 to generate a normal random number x i n e x e nn 2 step 3 determine the gaussian membership degree related to the qualitative concept the following formula 8 is used 8 f e x e x 2 2 e nn 2 step 4 repeat steps 1 2 and 3 until the total n cloud droplets are generated n was 1500 in this study the bdg transforms a group of cloud drops into three characters e x e

entropy of e n cat respectively for the category cloud x max and x min are the maximum value and minimum value respectively for each category boundary k is a coefficient that is used to adjust the linear relationship between e n class and h e class and k was set to 0 1 yao et al 2021 similarity for normal cloud models based on the fuzzy nearness degree scmfnd was adopted to realize the qualitative concept transition based on the cloud model with the quantitative data in the process of data mining 11 scmfnd n 1 n 2 1 2 1 2 φ m φ m where φ x x 1 2 π e t 2 2 d t m e x 2 e x 1 e n 1 2 h

steps that would provide a better understanding of the proposed cloud model based approach for assessing hydrological alterations step 1 iha analysis the iha software supported by the nature conservancy https www conservationgateway org conservationpractices freshwater environmentalflows methodsandtools indicatorsofhydrologicalteration pages iha software download aspx was selected to calculate the degree of hydrological alteration for each iha parameter step 2 estimation of combination weight the subjective weight was calculated by ahp and the objective weights were separately estimated by the pp et and critic methods game theory was then applied to integrate the subjective and objective weights and to generate the combination weight matrix w ij 32 3 step 3 estimation of cloud characteristics based on the combination weight generated in step 2 the multiweighting cloud s characteristics e x w e n w and h e w of each iha parameter were calculated by the bdg yao et al 2021 using formula 9 the evaluation cloud characteristics e x eva e n eva and h e eva for the odha are obtained by multiplying the multiweighting cloud characteristics e x w e n w and h e w by the dha for each iha parameter simultaneously the category cloud characteristics e x cat e n cat and h e cat for the hydrological alteration high alteration 0 33 moderate alteration 33 67 and low alteration 67 100 are calculated by another bdg that is formula 10 step 4 generation of cloud model the multiweighting cloud evaluation cloud of overall hydrological alteration and category cloud of hydrological alteration are all calculated by the fdg using formula 8 the hydrological alteration category was determined using the scmfnd method with formula 11 3 3 budyko framework for contributing factors hydrological processes in watersheds are significantly affected by changes in climatic conditions and intensified human activities this study employed the budyko framework to quantify the contributions of climate and human factors to hydrological alteration according to the budyko framework assuming that the storage change is negligible on the multiyear scale todhunter et al 2020 liu et al 2021 the actual annual evapotranspiration e t a can be estimated from precipitation p and runoff q 12 e t a p q the budyko hypothesis stipulated an analytical solution for e t a with the potential evapotranspiration pet and precipitation p roderick and farquhar 2011 13 e t a p p e t p ω p e t ω 1 ω where ω represents the catchment specific land surface parameter todhunter et al 2020 zhou et al 2016 waggoner 1990 introduced the elasticity concept to represent the quantitative change in streamflow q caused by changes in p pet and ω changes in the streamflow can be expressed by the following equation roderick and farquhar 2011 14 dq q ε p dp p ε pet dpet pet ε ω d ω ω where the sensitivity coefficients ε p q q p p ε pet q q p e t p e t and ε ω q q ω ω represent the relative

precipitation for the respective gauging stations in the illinois river basin the annual streamflow in all watersheds with the exception of la moine had an increasing trend with a significance level greater than 5 seven of these ten watersheds i e kankakee river des plaines river hickory creek du page river fox river vermilion river and mackinaw river show an increasing trend with 1 significance levels which were mainly located in the upper irb for precipitation the kankakee river des plaines river hickory creek du page river and fox river watersheds had a more significant increasing trend with p values 0 01 whereas other watersheds which were mainly located in the lower irb did not show a significant increasing trend fig 3b the years over which the precipitation and streamflow exhibited significant change were identified through the pettitt test analysis thus providing justification to divide the time series data into pre and postchange periods for the iha analysis listed in table 1 were periods when a significant change in streamflow occurred as shown in table 1 abrupt streamflow change occurred for the majority of the watersheds in the period of approximately 1967 1972 which might be primarily attributed to the change in precipitation within the river basin however the period when the abrupt change occurred for hickory creek at joliet and du page river at shorewood gauge station was approximately 1989 1990 when the most intensive human activities population shifts and land use changes occurred near the end of the 1980 s in chicago sciences 2001 4 2 assessing hydrological alteration 4 2 1 hydrological alteration indicated by individual parameters the dha for all iha parameters was calculated using iha software with the daily flow data and is presented in the heatmap shown in fig 4 the heatmap shows that the dha for the 1 day 3 day 7 day and 30 day minimum flows low and high pulse counts and durations rise rate and fall rate in the des plain hickory du page and fox river watersheds were greater than 0 67 which was in the high degree of hydrological alteration category the high hydrological alteration would have impacts on the water resources and ecosystem larsen et al 2021 showed that the low flow pulse counts could influence the habitat availability in the river basin and further affect the health of the river ecosystem which could also be rippled by the extremely low flow 1 day 3 day 7 day and 30 day minimum flows and the rise fall rate by affecting the life cycles of aquatic and riparian species and spawning habitat yang et al 2008 the fox river had a moderate degree of change for the minimum flow rise rate and fall rate which is typically caused by urbanization the big bureau creek and kankakee river might have been impacted by urban land development but the dha was low for most of the iha parameters the dha for other watersheds was generally in the low category because the land use had been predominantly agriculture without much change over the study period 4 2 2 weights for individual iha parameters the weight for each iha parameter was also an indication of relative importance in evaluating the overall degree of hydrological alteration odha among the four weighting methods ahp was considered a subjective approach and pp critic and et were considered objective weights for 32 iha parameters in the ahp method are selected by referring to experience and previous studies in a similar region gao et al 2009 yang et al 2008 whereas the pp critic and et methods estimate weights based on the variability inherent in the data the weight matrix for pp ahp critic ahp and et ahp combinations was then established for the game theory method the cloud characteristics e x w e n w and h e w of the weight matrix were generated by the backward drop generator and the multiweighting cloud was then generated by the forward drop generator as shown in fig 5 the possible cloud drops of weight with a membership degree greater than 95 were selected to represent a weight range for each iha parameter e x w is the most representative weight when the membership degree is 1 it can be seen in fig 5 that the most representative weight calculated by the cloud model e x w ranged between the weights from ahp and other objective weighting methods the representative weight e x w calculated by the cm mw method reduced the dispersion of weight for 32 iha parameters at all gauging stations compared with the other four single methods the cm mw method also provides a variable weight range for each iha parameter based on the inherent characteristics of data this range appears to be more reasonable by combining the subjective judgment and objective characteristics in the data the results in fig 5 indicated that the 7 day and 30 day minimum 3 day maximum high pulse duration and rise rate had higher weights in most of the watersheds in the illinois river basin which was similar to the patterns in the results obtained by yang et al 2008 and gao et al 2009 for watersheds in the upper irb the iha parameters with higher weights also include the february flow for watersheds in the lower irb the monthly flows in november also had higher weights which could be attributed to the change in climate conditions the overlapped iha parameters for high weight ranking and dha analysis which had an important role in reflecting alteration to ecological flow regimes include the magnitude of extreme low flows 7 day and 30 day minimum related to biodiversity high pulse duration associated with the survival rate of organisms and rise rate linked with spawning habitat yang et al 2008 the results from the above analysis provide insight into the level of importance for the iha parameter in reflecting alteration 4 2 3 overall degree of hydrological alteration odha the odha for each parameter was the sum of the products of dha and its respective weight with the weight for each iha parameter that is being estimated the odha for each watershed was calculated table 2 in the rva method all 32 iha parameters were assigned an equal weight of 1 32 and weights for the other 5 methods were calculated as previously introduced a comparison of the odha from each weighting method table 2 showed that for the same watershed despite the variation in the weights estimated by different methods the odha computed from each weighting method fell into the same category the results from this study showed that the simplest uniform weight assigned to all 32 parameters in the iha method would classify the odha into the same category as other subjective methods or even the most complicated cloud model based multiweighting method cm mw introduced in this study implying that the iha method of assigning equal weight to all iha parameters might be the simplest and most acceptable method for estimating the odha and that the consistency of cm mw with other methods proved that cm mw is also a feasible method for odha however incorporating expert experience and the information in data into game theory and cloud modeling cm mw would select more reasonable weights for the iha parameters and prevent double counting of certain aspects of the hydrological regime thus enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation results wang et al 2017 furthermore the cloud model based method would also be able to quantify the multiple uncertainties of actual information and information acquisition in the process of evaluating odha wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b based on the cloud model all possible odhas were represented by three cloud characters e x eva e n eva and h e eva for each gauging station fig 6 shows the cloud maps for the three hydrological alteration categories and the overall evaluation cloud map for each watershed each point along the x axis represents a possible odha and the y axis represents the membership degree of the possible odha or the relative likelihood of each possible odha the central value of the evaluation cloud e x eva was the most representative odha with a relative likelihood of one additionally in fig 6 the spread of the evaluation cloud e n eva can be considered a measurement of randomness and fuzziness or uncertainty li et al 2009a among all eleven watersheds the e n eva values for the des plains river du page river and fox river watersheds were distinctly greater than those for the other watersheds indicating greater uncertainty in the representative odha due to the likelihood of a greater complexity of hydrological conditions in the more urbanized watersheds h e eva as a measurement of the degree of uncertainty of e n eva also had greater values for these three watersheds the pearson correlation test showed a good correlation between e x eva and e n eva and between e x eva and h e eva with both coefficients greater than 0 90 the cm mw method proposed in this study had a distinct advantage over the conventional approach in classifying the overall hydrological alteration by estimating the similarity between the evaluation cloud and the category cloud as shown in fig 7 the cm mw method was able to provide the percent data for which the odha would fall into the respective category for example for the des plaines river watershed 39 of the data fell into the high odha category 64 of the data fell into the moderate category and 12 fell into the low category fig 7 shows that watersheds had the highest similarity with moderate category clouds such as the du page river des plains river fox river and hickory creek watersheds which were mainly located in more urbanized areas other watersheds such as the vermilion river sangamon river spoon river mackinaw river kankakee river big bureau creek and la moine river watersheds had higher similarity with the low category cloud 4 3 quantifying the contribution of climate change and human activities to odha 4 3 1 quantifying the changes in climate and human activities the budyko frame has been widely and successfully employed to characterize the contributions of climate factors and human activities to hydrological impacts the budyko statistics of climate p and pet and catchment characteristics ω were calculated to quantify the total changes that occurred during the last 70 years within the illinois river basin fig 8 the budyko analyses applied the data series in the pre and postchange periods for the watersheds with odha in the low and moderate hydrological alteration categories as shown in fig 8a the medians of p for the low category and moderate category in the postchange periods were 975 80 mm and 993 46 mm respectively and both had a distinct increase compared with the medians of p of 871 92 mm and 895 31 mm respectively for the low and moderate categories in the prechange period the percentage of increase for the low and moderate categories was approximately 10 the change in pet for both the low category and moderate category of watersheds was not as significant as p which was decreased by approximately 2 05 and 1 40 respectively in the postchange period fig 8d the medians for parameter ω between the post and prechange periods were reduced by 13 55 for the low category watershed but exhibited a maximum of 29 37 for the moderate category watersheds fig 8f implying possible changes in land surface conditions that might have reduced the infiltration and increased surface runoff 4 3 2 partitioning the contribution of climate change and human activities the relative contributions from climatic conditions human activities and other factors to hydrological alteration were estimated for each watershed fig 9 a it can be seen from the comparison of the bar plots in fig 9a that watersheds in the upper part of the illinois river basin such as the du page des plain and hickory which were more urbanized had more contributions to hydrological alterations than climate factors for watersheds in the middle part of the basin including the big bureau creek kankakee vermillion and mackinaw watersheds the impacts from climate conditions and human activities were approximately the same for the spoon river sangamon river and la moine river watersheds located in the low part of the basin climate conditions had a much greater impact than human activities although the fox river watershed had significant urbanization in its low reach area its major contrition of flow was derived from the chain of lakes in its upper reach so the overall impact from climate conditions was still greater than that from human activities the violin plots in fig 9b show the relative contribution of human activities and climate changes for all watersheds in the low and moderate hydrological alteration categories human activities had a greater contribution than the climatic factors to the hydrological alteration for the moderate odha watershed group with a median of 56 88 for human activities and a median of 34 18 for climatic factors for the watershed group in the low odha category the relative contribution of climate change was greater than that of human activities with medians of 50 19 for climate and 45 37 for human activities considering the human activities represented by the parameter ω the relative contribution of its change to hydrological alteration was greater than that of climate change for the moderate odha watersheds the parameter ω encodes various catchment properties affecting runoff generation such as vegetation land cover changes and topography roderick and farquhar 2011 li et al 2019 in this study the significant changes in the relative contribution of parameter ω may be linked to the intensive urbanization since 1970 hejazi and markus 2009 li and quiring 2021 and the land use change driven by human activities with the speed of urbanization the impervious surface area expands gradually and reduces the agricultural area it is worth emphasizing that the land cover changes and topography changes accelerated runoff generation and further increased streamflow in addition the improvement in the water quality since the 1970 s could contribute to the land use changes around the river and the ecological system in the river to some extent this finding is consistent with previous studies zhang and schilling 2006 hejazi and markus 2009 li and quiring 2021 that suggested that in human induced watersheds human activities were the main driving factor for streamflow variations considering climate change represented by p and pet the relative change in p between the prechange period and the postchange period is more significant than that in pet that is the increased precipitation is also the major climate factor affecting hydrological alteration the hydrological alteration for the low odha watersheds can be mainly attributed to the increased precipitation which could be explained by the climate variability driven by the impact of the north atlantic oceans and great lakes basin hodgkins et al 2007 mallakpour and villarini 2017 regionally human induced climate change could also cause an increase in p such as the percentage of cultivated crops this result was consistent with the findings of stahl et al 2010 who observed that hydrological alteration was predominated by climate change in watersheds with low alternation however certain limitations still exist in the current study which need to be further explored in this research another driver others affecting hydrological alteration was shown albeit with a low value of the relative contribution the definitions of other researchers includes water consumption for urban residents and the diversion flow from other lakes wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b however there still exist some errors and uncertainties in the process of analyzing data as there are inevitably some missing data at meteorological stations additionally the coupling effect of human activities and climate change on hydrological alteration is also an expected reason for exploration 5 conclusion the study proposed a new approach using the cloud model combined with multiple weighting methods cm mw to evaluate the impact or weight of individual iha indices on hydrological alteration and to provide a more reasonable assessment of the overall degree of hydrological alteration by applying the method to the eleven subwatersheds with flow data series for the period 1950 2019 in the illinois river basin this study showed that the abrupt streamflow change for the majority of the watersheds occurred in the period of approximately 1967 1972 which might be primarily attributed to the change in precipitation within the river basin however for more urbanized watersheds the abrupt change occurred in the period of approximately 1989 1990 the odha assessment analysis indicated that the simplest uniform weight assigned to all 32 parameters in the iha method would classify the odha into the same category as other subjective methods implying that the iha method by assigning equal weight to all iha parameters might be the simplest and most acceptable for estimating the odha however by combining the subjective and objective weighting methods using game theory the cm mw method would select more reasonable weights for the iha parameters thus enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation result the cm mw method proposed in this study had a distinct advantage over the conventional approach in classifying the overall hydrological alteration by estimating the similarity between the evaluation cloud and the category cloud the cm mw method was able to provide the percent data for which the odha would fall into the respective category the budyko analyses indicated that in the illinois river basin human activities were the primary driver for watersheds with moderate overall hydrological alteration whereas climate change was the major contributor to the overall hydrological alteration for watersheds in the low odha authors contributions academician dr jianyun zhang provided guidance for this research dr yanqing lian dr kairong lin

3261,the accurate estimation of precipitation has a basis for atmospheric and hydrological applications however large uncertainties exist in the estimation of regional precipitation derived solely from remote sensing data herein we develop an effective method to fuse multiple satellite based precipitation products to capitalize on their strengths and maximize their applicability at the 0 25 resolution scale specifically we describe an approach based on bias correction in individual satellite based products and their merging with up scaled 1 0 gauge based interpolated data to produce finer resolution 0 25 data outputs by focusing on seven regions to generate the estimates of merged precipitation across the chinese mainland mpcm we performed a full evaluation based on a range of error metrics the results showed that the bias correction procedure can reduce the discrepancies in the individual satellite based precipitation products in addition the mean absolute error values are also considerably reduced 20 45 with respect to the original data over the chinese mainland error statistical metrics demonstrated that the mpcm generated considerably better estimates on a daily scale and performed better than the satellite based precipitation products across different precipitation thresholds the intercomparison results clearly states the superiority of the mpcm against multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 global product nonetheless we also suggest that the large uncertainties in satellite based products should be paid more attention over mountainous areas where rain gauge data are insufficient keywords merged precipitation chinese mainland satellite based precipitation product bias correction 1 introduction in addition to weather forecasting sikder and hossain 2016 precipitation is one of the most important atmospheric variables for a wide range of scientific fields including hydrological modeling siddique e akbor et al 2014 water resource management tangdamrongsub et al 2016 and disaster prediction he et al 2016 hong et al 2015 kirschbaum et al 2020 li et al 2017 satellite based remote sensing techniques have been developed to generate quantitative precipitation estimates currently various satellite based precipitation products ashouri et al 2015 funk et al 2015 gebregiorgis et al 2018 huffman et al 2007 kubota et al 2007 are publicly available the quasi global coverage and near real time availability of satellite based precipitation products allow for application in poorly gauged basins ruan and wu 2018 sungmin and pierre emmanuel 2018 however satellite based estimates are accompanied by systematic and random errors compared to in situ observations aghakouchak et al 2012 maggioni et al 2016 maggioni and massari 2018 these errors originate from the limitations of the satellite sensors hossain and anagnostou 2004 tang et al 2014 retrieval algorithms kim et al 2017 and spatial sampling frequency indu and nagesh kumar 2014 several studies have proven that the accuracy of satellite based precipitation estimates vary with topography seasonality and precipitation regime because of these uncertainties salio et al 2015 tan et al 2018 tian et al 2010a specifically they tend to underestimate extreme precipitation but overestimate low precipitation events in the form of drizzle when compared to gauge data alsumaiti et al 2020 chen et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 miao et al 2015 for example keikhosravi kiany et al 2020 evaluated the capability of the 3b42 version 7 3b42v7 product of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm for extreme precipitation analysis over southwestern iran and consistently observed underestimated values ayoub et al 2020 also concluded that 3b42v7 and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps overestimated precipitation rates of 2 5 and 10 20 mm day respectively to reduce this deficiency in individual satellite based estimates various bias correction techniques that incorporate in situ observations have been designed based on probability density function pdf matching xie et al 2017 quantile mapping katiraie boroujerdy et al 2020 ringard et al 2017 and multiplicative bias correction methods beaufort et al 2019 saber and yilmaz 2018 tian et al 2010b tao et al 2016 and beck et al 2020 have concluded that the systematic errors of satellite based precipitation products could be reduced by bias correction techniques however less research has focused on bias magnitude and the potential for variation in error characteristics with precipitation intensity duan et al 2016 maggioni et al 2017 wright et al 2017 for extreme precipitation estimation it is particularly difficult to ensure that individual satellite based precipitation products benefit from bias removal ma et al 2019 data fusion is a feasible solution to obtain high quality precipitation estimates by merging multiple satellite based precipitation products román cascón et al 2017 sun et al 2018 several attempts have been made to establish appropriate algorithms to merge precipitation datasets in varying spatial domains ma et al 2021 manz et al 2016 park et al 2017 shrestha et al 2011 including conditional merging sinclair and pegram 2005 weighted fusion sapiano et al 2008 linear regression turlapaty et al 2012 geographically

specifically global merged precipitation products are often generated using weighted fusion methods that assign specific weights for distinct precipitation inputs for example beck et al 2019 developed the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 mswep v2 global product in which weight maps for each input dataset were derived from the interpolation of correction coefficients of gauge observations for 3 days xu et al 2020 proposed a three cornered hat merging method at a global scale in which the weights of individual precipitation products were determined by an inverse error variance covariance matrix however validations of these products have shown regional scale deficiencies due to the inconsistences in their level of accuracy awange et al 2019 sharifi et al 2019 for example liu et al 2019 demonstrated that mswep v2 had a positive deviation over the qinghai tibet plateau but was associated with systematic underestimation of precipitation over eastern china xu et al 2019 recently machine and deep learning methods have been used as advanced level fusion techniques ehsan bhuiyan et al 2019 proposed a quantile regression forest ensemble technique to blend multiple precipitation datasets over mountainous regions but this required large training datasets however the systematic error varied from overestimation to underestimation as the rate of rainfall increased over the validated regions similarly baez villanueva et al 2020 developed a random forest rf merging procedure to improve the quality of precipitation information in data scarce regions in this case it was shown that the rain gauge network density can affect estimation performance wu et al 2020 also proposed a deep fusion model by combining a convolutional neural network with a long short term memory network however this model was susceptible to the input of an individual satellite product given that high density rain gauge data are not widely available in the public domain methods that take advantage of publicly available satellite based precipitation datasets to enhance the overall accuracy are essential in this study we propose a procedure to fuse six open source satellite based precipitation products to maximize their applicability at a 0 25 resolution the procedure uses gauge based interpolated data with 1 0 resolution as the background field and aims to 1 correct the estimation bias of individual satellite based precipitation products by matching the pdf of the 1 0 background field and 2 merge the corrected satellite based precipitation products for each grid according to the grid precipitation level of the 1 0 background field to distribute fusion weights with light 10 mm day or heavy 50 mm day precipitation the 0 25 resolution merged precipitation values were provided by the corrected satellite based precipitation product with optimized estimation when the precipitation level was moderate 10 50 mm day the merged precipitation values were produced by weighted fusion furthermore we also evaluated the relative improvements in data quality achieved by our proposed fusion precipitation procedure 2 study area and data preparation 2 1 study area the chinese mainland 18 54 n 73 135 e was selected as the region for this case study to evaluate the performance of the proposed fusion algorithm the study area was divided into seven sub regions labeled reg based on climatic factors and the density of the rain gauge network see fig 1 reg1 and reg2 are dominated by a temperate monsoon climate with a rainy season between june and august reg3 and reg4 are characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with hot and wet summers and mild and dry winters the northern and southern parts of reg5 have a temperate monsoon climate and a subtropical monsoon climate respectively with annual precipitation ranging from approximately 600 mm in the northwest to 1000 mm in the south reg6 has a plateau mountain climate with an average elevation of approximately 4000 m where the complex terrain leads to pronounced precipitation spatial variability reg7 is differentiated from the other regions having a temperate continental climate with a low yearly precipitation of approximately 150 mm 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 rain gauge data daily rain gauge observations for the period 2003 2015 were obtained from the chinese national meteorological information center https data cma cn all gauge observations were subjected to quality control to remove the outlier values fig 1a shows the spatial distribution of rain gauges across the country where 1959 gauges green dots were interpolated for data fusion and 340 gauges red dots were used for independent evaluation the densities of the rain gauge networks in reg2 and reg3 are high compared to those of other sub regions owing to the occurrence of highly developed urban agglomerations in these regions the rain gauge networks in reg1 reg6 and reg7 are particularly sparse 2 2 2 satellite based precipitation products six mainstream satellite based precipitation products from 2003 to2015 were used in this study these include tropical rainfall measuring mission multi

monthly product version 2 2 ashouri et al 2015 cmorph is generated by the climate prediction center at the national centers for environmental prediction using infrared imagery by propagating precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave data craw is not calibrated against gauges whereas ccrt and cbld adopt pdf or pdf oi techniques respectively to reduce the bias in the unified daily gauge analysis joyce et al 2004 finally chirps is a land only dataset and it incorporates 0 05 resolution satellite imagery cold cloud duration based precipitation estimates and in situ gauge data to create gridded precipitation outputs funk et al 2015 the six tested satellite based precipitation products were aggregated into a daily scale 2 2 3 mswep v2 mswep v2 is a global fusion precipitation product with a 3 hour temporal and a 0 1 spatial resolution covering the period 1979 2015 it was designed to optimally merge the highest quality precipitation data products two interpolation datasets of gauge observations four satellite based precipitation products and two atmospheric model reanalysis datasets to yield reliable estimates beck et al 2019 in this study mswep v2 was resampled into 0 25 spatial resolution using the bilinear method and solely used for data comparison to evaluate the accuracy of our proposed merged precipitation product 3 methodology 3 1 gridding process the quality of spatially interpolated precipitation is directly related to the performance of the fusion data in this section the gridding process included two primary steps the first step was to obtain the monthly spatial surface data by interpolating the monthly precipitation based on the thin plate spline algorithm hutchinson 1995 tait et al 2006 this algorithm has been chosen to produce precipitation products and performs well over large and complex terrains arowolo et al 2017 hong et al 2005 huang et al 2014 plouffe et al 2015 zhao et al 2014 for monthly precipitation the spatial distribution is largely affected by the orography factor over the chinese mainland therefore a trivariate latitude longitude and elevation spline interpolation model including a generalized cross validation smoothing parameter was used for the elevation of rain gauges the second step involved interpolating the daily precipitation using the regular co kriging method adhikary et al 2017 dong jun et al 1990 krajewski 1987 with regards to the information from monthly surface data co kriging is one of the kriging interpolation methods that requires known point data as input to estimate raster map information however it mainly uses the covariates ahmadi and sedghamiz 2008 that is monthly surface data to conduct analysis with the precipitation estimation model in this study owing to the uneven distribution of rain gauges it was necessary to ensure that the interpolation blocks covered at least one rain gauge when averaging pointwise observations in this study we selected 1 0 as the basic grid unit and the spatially interpolated grids covering one or more rain gauges were considered as the synthetic truth data hereinafter gp1d whereas those grids that covered no gauges were considered none see fig 1b 3 2 merging technique as an incremental improvement to the six satellite based precipitation products in table 1 we selected the gp1d data as the merging background field for the precipitation values at 1 0 resolution for each gp1d grid the fusion process was organized into the following three steps fig 2 step 1 bias correction each gp1d grid covers 16 4 4 spatial grids each with a 0 25 resolution for the six satellite based precipitation products a bias correction procedure was applied to reduce the estimation bias of the individual products by matching the pdfs to the 1 0 gp1d precipitation values using a previously developed algorithm li et al 2019 step 2 calculation of precipitation probability density in step 2 the pdfs of the corrected precipitation estimates on grid x were simulated for the six corrected satellite based precipitation products cor spps using an assumed normal distribution 1 f p k i j 1 σ 2 π e p k i j μ 2 2 σ 2 where k ranged from 1 to 6 which corresponds to the cor spps that is cor 3b42v7 cor craw cor ccrt cor cbld cor pcdr and cor chirps respectively p k i j is a 0 25 precipitation estimate from the cor spps in grid x i and j are the row and column indexes of element p k i j in grid x ranging from 1 to 4 respectively f p k i j is the probability density of p k i j μ and σ are the mean precipitation estimate and standard deviation of the cor spps in grid x respectively thus in this 4 4 spatial grid a 0 25 gridded precipitation value p k i j corresponding to the maximum probability density can be obtained step 3 merging precipitation in this study the error between p k i j and grid x was considered as a key factor in precipitation merging first the absolute error ae n between p k i j and the gp1d precipitation value s on the grid x was computed as follows 2 ae k s p k i j the 0 25 gridded precipitation value p k i j of a cor spp that gives the minimum absolute error is considered as the optimal estimation value using day 1 as an example when the absolute error between p 1 i j and s was the lowest we considered the 0 25 gridded precipitation value of p 1 i j as the optimal estimation value for day 1 indicating that the cor 3b42v7 product had the optimal estimate next the precipitation fusion procedure for each grid was classified into two schemes based on the precipitation value of gp1d using day 1 as an example when s 50 mm or 10 mm the 0 25 resolution merged precipitation values within the grid x mp i j were given by the precipitation values from the cor spp that had the optimal estimates otherwise the merged data within grid x were based on the following equation 3 mp i j w 1 p 1 i j w 2 p 2 i j w 6 p 6 i j where w 1 w 6 are the merging weights of the cor spps on day 1 in grid x respectively the merging weight w k of a certain cor spp was given as follows 4 w k ae k 1 ae 1 1 ae 2 1 ae 6 1 finally we generated the daily merged precipitation across the chinese mainland mpcm for the period 2003 2015 based on the fusion procedure 3 3 evaluation methods at the daily scale the performance of the satellite based precipitation products and the mpcm were directly evaluated against the 340 independent gauge point records i e point to pixel analysis using standard evaluation metrics four statistical metrics mean absolute error mae relative bias rb spearman correlation coefficient cc and modified kling gupta efficiency kge were included to quantitatively estimate the magnitude of error in the precipitation products pan et al 2014 rahman et al 2020 these are given as follows 5 mae m 1 n x m y m n r b m 1 n x m y m m 1 n y m 100 7 cc l 1 n x m x y m y m 1 n x m x 2 m 1 n y m y 2 8 kge 1 cc 1 2 x y 1 2 σ x y σ y x 1 2 where n is the data number during 2003 2015 x m and y m are the satellite and gauge measurements respectively and x σ x and y σ y are the mean values standard deviations of satellite and gauge measurements during 2003 2015 respectively in general mae was used to indicate the average error of a precipitation product rb reflected the degree of deviation between the actual and the predicted value where rb values greater than and less than 0 indicated overestimation and underestimation respectively cc was used as a measure of statistical agreement between the precipitation products and the gauge records and kge depicted the performance evaluation in three different components correlation bias and relative variability in the estimated and observed values the values of which range from negative infinity to 1 in addition rb and mae were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the bias correction procedure 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of the bias correction scheme the evaluation results of the bias correction procedure for the individual satellite based precipitation products are summarized in fig 3 the rb and mae values revealed that each satellite based precipitation product had large errors in estimated daily precipitation which required further correction among the six uncorrected precipitation products the ccrt performed the best with an average rb of 6 33 and mae values ranging from 0 to 5 mm day the rb values of corrected precipitation products were consistently improved through bias correction the correction procedure was particularly effective for cor craw in adjusting its negative and positive biases the average rb decreased from 8 46 to 4 44 moreover the mae values of the six satellite based precipitation products after bias correction were considerably reduced 20 45 with respect to the original data over the chinese mainland fig 4 shows the spatial distributions of the rb and mae values for the uncorrected and bias corrected precipitation products over the chinese mainland all original satellite based precipitation products exhibited severe overestimation over the southwestern and northwestern regions and large negative biases were observed in craw over the eastern chinese mainland it was observed that the biases of cor craw were noticeably reduced over the chinese mainland however over the northwestern chinese mainland with only sparsely distributed gauges the positive biases were not eliminated for the other products in addition the decrease in mae was more pronounced for the southeastern chinese mainland than for other regions with the mae values ranging from 0 and 8 mm day to 0 and 4 mm day respectively overall the bias correction approach can reduce the systematic errors of satellite based precipitation products over the chinese mainland 4 2 evaluation of merged precipitation the error statistical metrics for all satellite based precipitation products and mpcm from 2003 to 2015 are summarized in table 2 these values show that the mpcm generated accurate estimates at a daily scale as the mae value was lower 1 57 mm day and the cc and kge values 0 75 and 0 62 respectively were higher than those of the original and bias corrected precipitation products after bias correction the six satellite based precipitation products presented considerably improved accuracy furthermore the mpcm reduced the bias magnitude when estimating daily precipitation by data fusion the results demonstrated that systematic errors could be diminished further by the merging technique and this method can be applied over the chinese mainland moreover in this section the capability of the uncorrected satellite based precipitation products in data fusion a critical issue should be investigated when bias correction is not conducted the directly merged results from the uncorrected data merged raw had a worse performance in all four metrics compared to mpcm table 2 fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of the four error statistical metrics for mpcm and merged raw from 2003 to 2015 relatively large errors mae 4 mm day were observed in merged raw over the southeastern chinese mainland which has a humid climate mean daily precipitation amount recorded by rain gauges was 3 9 mm mpcm had considerably better performance over the southern chinese mainland in terms of cc and kge with values ranging from 0 8 to 1 and 0 6 to 0 9 respectively notably although a lower mae was observed in the western inland regions which have the driest climates mean daily precipitation of 1 mm all merged results had a relatively high overestimation and a low kge value in these regions this might be partially explained by the sparse distribution of gauges which could induce uncertainties in the merging process to access the performance of merged data across different precipitation thresholds the daily precipitation events were further divided into five categories based on rain gauge precipitation intensities including light precipitation ⅰ 0 1 5 and ⅱ 5 10 mm day moderate precipitation iii 10 20 and ⅳ 20 50 mm day and heavy precipitation ⅴ 50 mm day fig 6 shows the overall evaluation results rb and mae for the merged and original bias corrected satellite based precipitation products in the five precipitation categories against the rain gauges from 2003 to 2015 it is suggested that the original satellite based precipitation products exhibited very large errors in heavy precipitation estimates mae 50 mm day and generated serious underestimations in moderate and heavy precipitation events with rb values ranging from 12 to 52 this result is attributed to the fact that satellite based precipitation products failed to provide high quality precipitation estimates for high intensity precipitation kidd and levizzani 2011 mehran and aghakouchak 2014 scofield and kuligowski 2003 after bias correction and data fusion the merged precipitation data performed better than the satellite based precipitation products reducing the average mae values approximately 47 and exhibiting low biases both bias correction and data fusion should be employed to improve satellite based precipitation products 4 3 comparison with mswep v2 fig 7 shows the boxplots of the four evaluation metrics calculated at a daily scale for mpcm merged raw and mswep v2 over the chinese mainland from 2003 to 2015 the plots represent that the accuracy of the results generated by mpcm was the highest for daily precipitation events with lower mae and higher cc kge values followed by the directly merged results from original satellite data merged raw because of the difference between mswep v2 and mpcm in terms of the data sources gauge satellite reanalysis versus gauge and satellite bias correction and fusion procedures this evaluation offered a potential reference for our proposed fusion procedure which deals with an effective method that would take advantage of publicly available satellite based precipitation datasets to enhance the overall accuracy 4 4 discussion as indicated in section 4 2 it is challenging to obtain reliable estimates from both satellite based and merged precipitation products over the complex topography of the western chinese mainland previous studies confirmed that the retrieval algorithms of satellite data are prone to certain errors when detecting orographic and light precipitation events over mountainous regions dinku et al 2007 and produce poor quality precipitation estimates anjum et al 2016 derin and yilmaz 2014 moreover rain gauges are notably sparse in these regions this sparsity can lead to considerable errors when estimating precipitation from bias corrected satellite based precipitation products in turn this affects the final performance of the merged results previous studies have found that the accuracy of merged products is sensitive to spatial heterogeneity characteristics e g topography and climatology background and the size of training datasets as shown in table 3 this table summarizes some of the recent studies that used different fusion algorithms to obtain improved precipitation estimations relevant to our analysis in addition to the capabilities of fusion algorithms other factors such as climate background and the deficiencies in space owing to the density of rain gauge network need to be discussed fig 8 shows the mae and kge statistics for the merged and original bias corrected satellite based precipitation products over seven sub regions of the chinese mainland from 2003 to 2015 the evaluation results of mpcm are notably better than the original satellite based precipitation products this is especially true in reg4 and reg6 where the mae and kge values were improved by approximately 43 and 44 respectively the mae curves exhibit similar change patterns indicating that peaks are primarily concentrated in reg3 and reg4 thus this resulted in a higher amount of precipitation estimated in these regions than in the other regions as mentioned above insufficient observation data or low quality of gauge precipitation records remain a challenge for data fusion behboudian et al 2021 chen et al 2020b in our study we first up scaled the point observation to the grid scale with a 1 0 resolution and the effective interpolated grids were chosen as background fields to conduct the fusion procedure the sparse distribution of gauges see fig 1a may affect the results of the proposed merged approach in this study for example relatively lower kge values were observed in reg7 in addition we obtained four independent rainfall records located in the northwest region fig 1a from the qinghai tibet plateau center https data tpdc ac cn to evaluate the accuracy of merged product over the sparse gauge area the statistical results of mae for mpcm 0 78 mm day were still lower than the original 1 35 mm day and bias corrected 0 85 mm day satellite based precipitation products from 2003 to 2015 5 conclusions our approach utilized up scaled 1 0 resolution gauge based interpolated data as the fusion background field to effectively merge 0 25 resolution satellite based precipitation products using the following three step procedure first the estimation biases of individual satellite based precipitation products were corrected by matching the pdfs to that of the 1 0 gauge interpolated dataset second the cor spps were used to simulate the pdfs of corrected satellite precipitation estimates in 16 4 4 spatial grids in a gp1d grid giving 0 25 gridded precipitation values of the maximum probability density these were eventually used to calculate the optimal estimation value finally the corrected satellite based precipitation products for each grid were merged according to the grid precipitation level of the 1 0 background field to distribute fusion weights using the chinese mainland as an example we validated the merged precipitation product mpcm against the independent gauge data our major findings can be summarized as follows the bias correction procedure effectively reduced the discrepancies in the individual satellite based precipitation products the mae values of bias corrected satellite based products were also considerably reduced 20 45 with respect to the original data over the chinese mainland error statistical metrics demonstrated that the merged precipitation data mpcm typically generated increased accuracy in estimations on a daily scale as the mae value was lower and the cc and kge values were higher than those of the individual products moreover the intercomparison results demonstrated the superiority of the mpcm against the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 global product in this study we aimed to merge open source satellite based precipitation products to maximize their applicability owing to the sparse distribution of ground rain gauges the proposed fusion procedure has not been fully verified over the western chinese mainland furthermore the fusion procedure in scarcely populated ground data regions should receive a more systematic evaluation through global publicly available gauge datasets credit authorship

forecasting sikder and hossain 2016 precipitation is one of the most important atmospheric variables for a wide range of scientific fields including hydrological modeling siddique e akbor et al 2014 water resource management tangdamrongsub et al 2016 and disaster prediction he et al 2016 hong et al 2015 kirschbaum et al 2020 li et al 2017 satellite based remote sensing techniques have been developed to generate quantitative precipitation estimates currently various satellite based precipitation products ashouri et al 2015 funk et al 2015 gebregiorgis et al 2018 huffman et al 2007 kubota et al 2007 are publicly available the quasi global coverage and near real time availability of satellite based precipitation products allow for application in poorly gauged basins ruan and wu 2018 sungmin and pierre emmanuel 2018 however satellite based estimates are accompanied by systematic and random errors compared to in situ observations aghakouchak et al 2012 maggioni et al 2016 maggioni

indu and nagesh kumar 2014 several studies have proven that the accuracy of satellite based precipitation estimates vary with topography seasonality and precipitation regime because of these uncertainties salio et al 2015 tan et al 2018 tian et al 2010a specifically they tend to underestimate extreme precipitation but overestimate low precipitation events in the form of drizzle when compared to gauge data alsumaiti et al 2020 chen et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 miao et al 2015 for example keikhosravi kiany et al 2020 evaluated the capability of the 3b42 version 7 3b42v7 product of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm for extreme precipitation analysis over southwestern iran and consistently observed underestimated values ayoub et al 2020 also concluded that 3b42v7 and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps overestimated precipitation rates of 2 5 and 10 20 mm day respectively to reduce this deficiency in individual satellite based estimates various bias correction techniques that incorporate in situ observations have been designed based on probability density function pdf matching xie et al 2017 quantile mapping katiraie boroujerdy et al 2020 ringard et al 2017 and multiplicative bias correction methods beaufort et al 2019 saber and yilmaz 2018 tian et al 2010b tao et al 2016 and beck et al 2020 have concluded that the systematic errors of satellite based precipitation products could be reduced by bias correction techniques however less research has focused on bias magnitude and the potential for variation in error characteristics with precipitation intensity duan et al 2016 maggioni et al 2017 wright et al 2017 for extreme precipitation estimation it is particularly difficult to ensure that individual satellite based precipitation products benefit from bias removal ma et al 2019 data fusion is a feasible solution to obtain high quality precipitation estimates by merging multiple satellite based precipitation products román cascón et al 2017 sun et al 2018 several attempts have been made to establish appropriate algorithms to merge precipitation datasets in varying spatial domains ma et al 2021 manz et al 2016 park et al 2017 shrestha et al 2011 including conditional merging sinclair and pegram 2005 weighted fusion sapiano et al 2008 linear regression turlapaty et al 2012 geographically

specifically global merged precipitation products are often generated using weighted fusion methods that assign specific weights for distinct precipitation inputs for example beck et al 2019 developed the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 mswep v2 global product in which weight maps for each input dataset were derived from the interpolation of correction coefficients of gauge observations for 3 days xu et al 2020 proposed a three cornered hat merging method at a global scale in which the weights of individual precipitation products were determined by an inverse error variance covariance matrix however validations of these products have shown regional scale deficiencies due to the inconsistences in their level of accuracy awange et al 2019 sharifi et al 2019 for example liu et al 2019 demonstrated that mswep v2 had a positive deviation over the qinghai tibet plateau but was associated with systematic underestimation of precipitation over eastern china xu et al 2019 recently machine and deep learning methods have been used as advanced level fusion techniques ehsan bhuiyan et al 2019 proposed a quantile regression forest ensemble technique to blend multiple precipitation datasets over mountainous regions but this required large training datasets however the systematic error varied from overestimation to underestimation as the rate of rainfall increased over the validated regions similarly baez villanueva et al 2020 developed a random forest rf merging procedure to improve the quality of precipitation information in data scarce regions in this case it was shown that the rain gauge network density can affect estimation performance wu et al 2020 also proposed a deep fusion model by combining a convolutional neural network with a long short term memory network however this model was susceptible to the input of an individual satellite product given that high density rain gauge data are not widely available in the public domain methods that take advantage of publicly available satellite based precipitation datasets to enhance the overall accuracy are essential in this study we propose a procedure to fuse six open source satellite based precipitation products to maximize their applicability at a 0 25 resolution the procedure uses gauge based interpolated data with 1 0 resolution as the background field and aims to 1 correct the estimation bias of individual satellite based precipitation products by matching the pdf of the 1 0 background field and 2 merge the corrected satellite based precipitation products for each grid according to the grid precipitation level of the 1 0 background field to distribute fusion weights with light 10 mm day or heavy 50 mm day precipitation the 0 25 resolution merged precipitation values were provided by the corrected satellite based precipitation product with optimized estimation when the precipitation level was moderate 10 50 mm day the merged precipitation values were produced by weighted fusion furthermore we also evaluated the relative improvements in data quality achieved by our proposed fusion precipitation procedure 2 study area and data preparation 2 1 study area the chinese mainland 18 54 n 73 135 e was selected as the region for this case study to evaluate the performance of the proposed fusion algorithm the study area was divided into seven sub regions labeled reg based on climatic factors and the density of the rain gauge network see fig 1 reg1 and reg2 are dominated by a temperate monsoon climate with a rainy season between june and august reg3 and reg4 are characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with hot and wet summers and mild and dry winters the northern and southern parts of reg5 have a temperate monsoon climate and a subtropical monsoon climate respectively with annual precipitation ranging from approximately 600 mm in the northwest to 1000 mm in the south reg6 has a plateau mountain climate with an average elevation of approximately 4000 m where the complex terrain leads to pronounced precipitation spatial variability reg7 is differentiated from the other regions having a temperate continental climate with a low yearly precipitation of approximately 150 mm 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 rain gauge data daily rain gauge observations for the period 2003 2015 were obtained from the chinese national meteorological information center https data cma cn all gauge observations were subjected to quality control to remove the outlier values fig 1a shows the spatial distribution of rain gauges across the country where 1959 gauges green dots were interpolated for data fusion and 340 gauges red dots were used for independent evaluation the densities of the rain gauge networks in reg2 and reg3 are high compared to those of other sub regions owing to the occurrence of highly developed urban agglomerations in these regions the rain gauge networks in reg1 reg6 and reg7 are particularly sparse 2 2 2 satellite based precipitation products six mainstream satellite based precipitation products from 2003 to2015 were used in this study these include tropical rainfall measuring mission multi

analysis huffman et al 2007 the precipitation estimates of pcdr are retrieved from gridsat b1 infrared data using the persiann algorithm and adjusted using global precipitation climatology project monthly product version 2 2 ashouri et al 2015 cmorph is generated by the climate prediction center at the national centers for environmental prediction using infrared imagery by propagating precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave data craw is not calibrated against gauges whereas ccrt and cbld adopt pdf or pdf oi techniques respectively to reduce the bias in the unified daily gauge analysis joyce et al 2004 finally chirps is a land only dataset and it incorporates 0 05 resolution satellite imagery cold cloud duration based precipitation estimates and in situ gauge data to create gridded precipitation outputs funk et al 2015 the six tested satellite based precipitation products were aggregated into a daily scale 2 2 3 mswep v2 mswep v2 is a global fusion precipitation product with a 3 hour temporal and a 0 1 spatial resolution covering the period 1979 2015 it was designed to optimally merge the highest quality precipitation data products two interpolation datasets of gauge observations four satellite based precipitation products and two atmospheric model reanalysis datasets to yield reliable estimates beck et al 2019 in this study mswep v2 was resampled into 0 25 spatial resolution using the bilinear method and solely used for data comparison to evaluate the accuracy of our proposed merged precipitation product 3 methodology 3 1 gridding process the quality of spatially interpolated precipitation is directly related to the performance of the fusion data in this section the gridding process included two primary steps the first step was to obtain the monthly spatial surface data by interpolating the monthly precipitation based on the thin plate spline algorithm hutchinson 1995 tait et al 2006 this algorithm has been chosen to produce precipitation products and performs well over large and complex terrains arowolo et al 2017 hong et al 2005 huang et al 2014 plouffe et al 2015 zhao et al 2014 for monthly precipitation the spatial distribution is largely affected by the orography factor over the chinese mainland therefore a trivariate latitude longitude and elevation spline interpolation model including a generalized cross validation smoothing parameter was used for the elevation of rain gauges the second step involved interpolating the daily precipitation using the regular co kriging method adhikary et al 2017 dong jun et al 1990 krajewski 1987 with regards to the information from monthly surface data co kriging is one of the kriging interpolation methods that requires known point data as input to estimate raster map information however it mainly uses the covariates ahmadi and sedghamiz 2008 that is monthly surface data to conduct analysis with the precipitation estimation model in this study owing to the uneven distribution of rain gauges it was necessary to ensure that the interpolation blocks covered at least one rain gauge when averaging pointwise observations in this study we selected 1 0 as the basic grid unit and the spatially interpolated grids covering one or more rain gauges were considered as the synthetic truth data hereinafter gp1d whereas those grids that covered no gauges were considered none see fig 1b 3 2 merging technique as an incremental improvement to the six satellite based precipitation products in table 1 we selected the gp1d data as the merging background field for the precipitation values at 1 0 resolution for each gp1d grid the fusion process was organized into the following three steps fig 2 step 1 bias correction each gp1d grid covers 16 4 4 spatial grids each with a 0 25 resolution for the six satellite based precipitation products a bias correction procedure was applied to reduce the estimation bias of the individual products by matching the pdfs to the 1 0 gp1d precipitation values using a previously developed algorithm li et al 2019 step 2 calculation of precipitation probability density in step 2 the pdfs of the corrected precipitation estimates on grid x were simulated for the six corrected satellite based precipitation products cor spps using an assumed normal distribution 1 f p k i j 1 σ 2 π e p k i j μ 2 2 σ 2 where k ranged from 1 to 6 which corresponds to the cor spps that is cor 3b42v7 cor craw cor ccrt cor cbld cor pcdr and cor chirps respectively p k i j is a 0 25 precipitation estimate from the cor spps in grid x i and j are the row and column indexes of element p k i j in grid x ranging from 1 to 4 respectively f p k i j is the probability density of p k i j μ and σ are the mean precipitation estimate and standard deviation of the cor spps in grid x respectively thus in this 4 4 spatial grid a 0 25 gridded precipitation value p k i j corresponding to the maximum probability density can be obtained step 3 merging precipitation in this study the error between p k i j and grid x was considered as a key factor in precipitation merging first the absolute error ae n between p k i j and the gp1d precipitation value s on the grid x was computed as follows 2 ae k s p k i j the 0 25 gridded precipitation value p k i j of a cor spp that gives the minimum absolute error is considered as the optimal estimation value using day 1 as an example when the absolute error between p 1 i j and s was the lowest we considered the 0 25 gridded precipitation value of p 1 i j as the optimal estimation value for day 1 indicating that the cor 3b42v7 product had the optimal estimate next the precipitation fusion procedure for each grid was classified into two schemes based on the precipitation value of gp1d using day 1 as an example when s 50 mm or 10 mm the 0 25 resolution merged precipitation values within the grid x mp i j were given by the precipitation values from the cor spp that had the optimal estimates otherwise the merged data within grid x were based on the following equation 3 mp i j w 1 p 1 i j w 2 p 2 i j w 6 p 6 i j where w 1 w 6 are the merging weights of the cor spps on day 1 in grid x respectively the merging weight w k of a certain cor spp was given as follows 4 w k ae k 1 ae 1 1 ae 2 1 ae 6 1 finally we generated the daily merged precipitation across the chinese mainland mpcm for the period 2003 2015 based on the fusion procedure 3 3 evaluation methods at the daily scale the performance of the satellite based precipitation products and the mpcm were directly evaluated against the 340 independent gauge point records i e point to pixel analysis using standard evaluation metrics four statistical metrics mean absolute error mae relative bias rb spearman correlation coefficient cc and modified kling gupta efficiency kge were included to quantitatively estimate the magnitude of error in the precipitation products pan et al 2014 rahman et al 2020 these are given as follows 5 mae m 1 n x m y m n r b m 1 n x m y m m 1 n y m 100 7 cc l 1 n x m x y m y m 1 n x m x 2 m 1 n y m y 2 8 kge 1 cc 1 2 x y 1 2 σ x y σ y x 1 2 where n is the data number during 2003 2015 x m and y m are the satellite and gauge measurements respectively and x σ x and y σ y are the mean values standard deviations of satellite and gauge measurements during 2003 2015 respectively in general mae was used to indicate the average error of a precipitation product rb reflected the degree of deviation between the actual and the predicted value where rb values greater than and less than 0 indicated overestimation and underestimation respectively cc was used as a measure of statistical agreement between the precipitation products and the gauge records and kge depicted the performance evaluation in three different components correlation bias and relative variability in the estimated and observed values the values of which range from negative infinity to 1 in addition rb and mae were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the bias correction procedure 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of the bias correction scheme the evaluation results of the bias correction procedure for the individual satellite based precipitation products are summarized in fig 3 the rb and mae values revealed that each satellite based precipitation product had large errors in estimated daily precipitation which required further correction among the six uncorrected precipitation products the ccrt performed the best with an average rb of 6 33 and mae values ranging from 0 to 5 mm day the rb values of corrected precipitation products were consistently improved through bias correction the correction procedure was particularly effective for cor craw in adjusting its negative and positive biases the average rb decreased from 8 46 to 4 44 moreover the mae values of the six satellite based precipitation products after bias correction were considerably reduced 20 45 with respect to the original data over the chinese mainland fig 4 shows the spatial distributions of the rb and mae values for the uncorrected and bias corrected precipitation products over the chinese mainland all original satellite based precipitation products exhibited severe overestimation over the southwestern and northwestern regions and large negative biases were observed in craw over the eastern chinese mainland it was observed that the biases of cor craw were noticeably reduced over the chinese mainland however over the northwestern chinese mainland with only sparsely distributed gauges the positive biases were not eliminated for the other products in addition the decrease in mae was more pronounced for the southeastern chinese mainland than for other regions with the mae values ranging from 0 and 8 mm day to 0 and 4 mm day respectively overall the bias correction approach can reduce the systematic errors of satellite based precipitation products over the chinese mainland 4 2 evaluation of merged precipitation the error statistical metrics for all satellite based precipitation products and mpcm from 2003 to 2015 are summarized in table 2 these values show that the mpcm generated accurate estimates at a daily scale as the mae value was lower 1 57 mm day and the cc and kge values 0 75 and 0 62 respectively were higher than those of the original and bias corrected precipitation products after bias correction the six satellite based precipitation products presented considerably improved accuracy furthermore the mpcm reduced the bias magnitude when estimating daily precipitation by data fusion the results demonstrated that systematic errors could be diminished further by the merging technique and this method can be applied over the chinese mainland moreover in this section the capability of the uncorrected satellite based precipitation products in data fusion a critical issue should be investigated when bias correction is not conducted the directly merged results from the uncorrected data merged raw had a worse performance in all four metrics compared to mpcm table 2 fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of the four error statistical metrics for mpcm and merged raw from 2003 to 2015 relatively large errors mae 4 mm day were observed in merged raw over the southeastern chinese mainland which has a humid climate mean daily precipitation amount recorded by rain gauges was 3 9 mm mpcm had considerably better performance over the southern chinese mainland in terms of cc and kge with values ranging from 0 8 to 1 and 0 6 to 0 9 respectively notably although a lower mae was observed in the western inland regions which have the driest climates mean daily precipitation of 1 mm all merged results had a relatively high overestimation and a low kge value in these regions this might be partially explained by the sparse distribution of gauges which could induce uncertainties in the merging process to access the performance of merged data across different precipitation thresholds the daily precipitation events were further divided into five categories based on rain gauge precipitation intensities including light precipitation ⅰ 0 1 5 and ⅱ 5 10 mm day moderate precipitation iii 10 20 and ⅳ 20 50 mm day and heavy precipitation ⅴ 50 mm day fig 6 shows the overall evaluation results rb and mae for the merged and original bias corrected satellite based precipitation products in the five precipitation categories against the rain gauges from 2003 to 2015 it is suggested that the original satellite based precipitation products exhibited very large errors in heavy precipitation estimates mae 50 mm day and generated serious underestimations in moderate and heavy precipitation events with rb values ranging from 12 to 52 this result is attributed to the fact that satellite based precipitation products failed to provide high quality precipitation estimates for high intensity precipitation kidd and levizzani 2011 mehran and aghakouchak 2014 scofield and kuligowski 2003 after bias correction and data fusion the merged precipitation data performed better than the satellite based precipitation products reducing the average mae values approximately 47 and exhibiting low biases both bias correction and data fusion should be employed to improve satellite based precipitation products 4 3 comparison with mswep v2 fig 7 shows the boxplots of the four evaluation metrics calculated at a daily scale for mpcm merged raw and mswep v2 over the chinese mainland from 2003 to 2015 the plots represent that the accuracy of the results generated by mpcm was the highest for daily precipitation events with lower mae and higher cc kge values followed by the directly merged results from original satellite data merged raw because of the difference between mswep v2 and mpcm in terms of the data sources gauge satellite reanalysis versus gauge and satellite bias correction and fusion procedures this evaluation offered a potential reference for our proposed fusion procedure which deals with an effective method that would take advantage of publicly available satellite based precipitation datasets to enhance the overall accuracy 4 4 discussion as indicated in section 4 2 it is challenging to obtain reliable estimates from both satellite based and merged precipitation products over the complex topography of the western chinese mainland previous studies confirmed that the retrieval algorithms of satellite data are prone to certain errors when detecting orographic and light precipitation events over mountainous regions dinku et al 2007 and produce poor quality precipitation estimates anjum et al 2016 derin and yilmaz 2014 moreover rain gauges are notably sparse in these regions this sparsity can lead to considerable errors when estimating precipitation from bias corrected satellite based precipitation products in turn this affects the final performance of the merged results previous studies have found that the accuracy of merged products is sensitive to spatial heterogeneity characteristics e g topography and climatology background and the size of training datasets as shown in table 3 this table summarizes some of the recent studies that used different fusion algorithms to obtain improved precipitation estimations relevant to our analysis in addition to the capabilities of fusion algorithms other factors such as climate background and the deficiencies in space owing to the density of rain gauge network need to be discussed fig 8 shows the mae and kge statistics for the merged and original bias corrected satellite based precipitation products over seven sub regions of the chinese mainland from 2003 to 2015 the evaluation results of mpcm are notably better than the original satellite based precipitation products this is especially true in reg4 and reg6 where the mae and kge values were improved by approximately 43 and 44 respectively the mae curves exhibit similar change patterns indicating that peaks are primarily concentrated in reg3 and reg4 thus this resulted in a higher amount of precipitation estimated in these regions than in the other regions as mentioned above insufficient observation data or low quality of gauge precipitation records remain a challenge for data fusion behboudian et al 2021 chen et al 2020b in our study we first up scaled the point observation to the grid scale with a 1 0 resolution and the effective interpolated grids were chosen as background fields to conduct the fusion procedure the sparse distribution of gauges see fig 1a may affect the results of the proposed merged approach in this study for example relatively lower kge values were observed in reg7 in addition we obtained four independent rainfall records located in the northwest region fig 1a from the qinghai tibet plateau center https data tpdc ac cn to evaluate the accuracy of merged product over the sparse gauge area the statistical results of mae for mpcm 0 78 mm day were still lower than the original 1 35 mm day and bias corrected 0 85 mm day satellite based precipitation products from 2003 to 2015 5 conclusions our approach utilized up scaled 1 0 resolution gauge based interpolated data as the fusion background field to effectively merge 0 25 resolution satellite based precipitation products using the following three step procedure first the estimation biases of individual satellite based precipitation products were corrected by matching the pdfs to that of the 1 0 gauge interpolated dataset second the cor spps were used to simulate the pdfs of corrected satellite precipitation estimates in 16 4 4 spatial grids in a gp1d grid giving 0 25 gridded precipitation values of the maximum probability density these were eventually used to calculate the optimal estimation value finally the corrected satellite based precipitation products for each grid were merged according to the grid precipitation level of the 1 0 background field to distribute fusion weights using the chinese mainland as an example we validated the merged precipitation product mpcm against the independent gauge data our major findings can be summarized as follows the bias correction procedure effectively reduced the discrepancies in the individual satellite based precipitation products the mae values of bias corrected satellite based products were also considerably reduced 20 45 with respect to the original data over the chinese mainland error statistical metrics demonstrated that the merged precipitation data mpcm typically generated increased accuracy in estimations on a daily scale as the mae value was lower and the cc and kge values were higher than those of the individual products moreover the intercomparison results demonstrated the superiority of the mpcm against the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 global product in this study we aimed to merge open source satellite based precipitation products to maximize their applicability owing to the sparse distribution of ground rain gauges the proposed fusion procedure has not been fully verified over the western chinese mainland furthermore the fusion procedure in scarcely populated ground data regions should receive a more systematic evaluation through global publicly available gauge datasets credit authorship

reconstructed march july streamflow series correlated positively with the seasonally averaged drought index and precipitation in the central west himalayan region and vicinities the streamflow reconstruction revealed an increasing frequency of extreme low flow and pluvial events in the central west himalayan region especially during the past century we found short 2 1 3 3 6 2 6 3 and 8 5 8 7 years to medium 12 2 12 5 years periodicities in the reconstructed streamflow series implying teleconnections with broad scale climate modes like the el niño southern oscillation enso and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo our karnali river streamflow reconstruction represents an update of regional hydroclimate variability which may serve as a useful reference for water resource

introduction the himalayan mountains known as asian freshwater tower provide a wide range of ecosystem services and are the basis for the livelihoods of millions of people living in south asia

this rapid climate change is affecting the water resources and hydroclimate variability in the region is still poorly understood lutz et al 2014 since climate change is severely affecting the asian freshwater towers immerzeel et al 2010 the impacts on agriculture water and energy resources sectors are anticipated to further aggravate on the other hand existing hydrological records in the

factors for both moisture limited tree growth and water amount that reaches the river woodhouse and lukas 2006 although there is an indirect relationship between tree growth and streamflow both of which are strongly linked by the regional climate in view of that trees within the watershed areas provide reliable tree ring proxies to assess the long term streamflow variability of a river even trees growing far away from the river basin can capture streamflow at a certain gauging station because the atmospheric moisture that greatly affects both tree growth and river flow goes through drainage divides woodhouse and lukas 2006 accordingly tree ring data have been extensively used to reconstruct long term river discharges and their management in various water resource sectors chen et

reconstructed the upper indus basin streamflow in pakistan over the past five centuries using a conifer tree ring width chronology misra et al 2015 also conducted a satluj river flow reconstruction in the western indian himalaya using cedrus deodara chronology shah et al 2014 developed larix griffithiana tree ring chronology to reconstruct lachen chhu river flow in the eastern himalaya india the satluj river flow in the western himalaya india was also reconstructed by singh and yadav 2013 for the past seven centuries based on tree ring chronologies of pinus gerardiana and cedrus deodara interestingly all the studied species showed similar growth responses to hydroclimatic conditions i e negative correlation with temperature and positive correlations with precipitation and streamflow but for different seasons though there is a huge potential for dendrohydrological research in the krb region in nepal no multi centuries streamflow reconstruction is available yet this study developed a composite tree ring width chronology of five tree species based on 354 individual tree ring series from the krb this study aims 1 to reconstruct streamflow variability of the karnali river for the past four centuries using multi species tree ring proxies and 2 to explore linkages of streamflow variability in the central himalaya with broader scale climate modes the scientific questions are 1 what are the predominant hydro climatic factors limiting tree radial growth of coniferous tree species in the karnali river basin 2 can multi species tree ring composite chronologies be used as a high resolution proxy of centennial long streamflow variability in the central himalaya 3 how is the streamflow variability of the karnali river linked with broader scale climate modes it was hypothesized that 1 radial growth of the studied tree species in the krb is mainly controlled by moisture availability during the spring and early summer seasons 2 tree ring records can provide information about the past streamflow variability of the karnali river which is strongly influenced by global climatic drivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and hydro climatic conditions this study was carried out in the karnali river basin krb fig 1 which lies in western nepal 28 33 30 68 n 80 55 83 67 e and extends from dhaulagiri mountain in the east to nanda devi mountain in the west covering an area of 45 269 km2 khatiwada and pandey 2019 sharma 1993 originating from the south of mansarovar and rakshastal lakes on the tibetan plateau the karnali river is the longest river flowing in nepal khatiwada and pandey 2019 sharma 1993 the elevation of the krb varies from about 100 to 7 721 m a s l khatiwada and pandey 2019 the karnali river is a perennial and snow fed river with six major snow fed tributaries and watersheds sharma 1993 till the present study the karnali river basin has not yet undergone any human intervention e g dam reservoir and hydropower project assuming that discharge records of chisapani and asaraghat gauging stations reflect natural streamflow variability the climate of krb is mainly influenced by the indian summer monsoon ism system the extreme orography of the region and the westerlies khatiwada et al 2016 the ism and westerlies control the precipitation in the krb during summer and winter respectively dhm 2017 talchabhadel et al 2018 about 68 of the annual rainfall occurs during the ism season june to september whereas only 9 occurs in winter december to february and 17 in the pre monsoon march to may period fig s1 khatiwada et al 2016 most of the regional climate stations show decreasing trends in precipitation khatiwada et al 2016 talchabhadel et al 2018 while mean temperatures show an overall increase dhm 2017 khatiwada et al 2016 the monthly streamflow records of three gauging stations in krb revealed that the flow has a unimodal distribution with maximum flow during the summer monsoon months june to september and a peak in august fig s2 the monthly seasonal and annual average streamflow analysis indicates that the flow is slightly decreasing in most months and seasons winter djf spring mam summer jjas and on autumn in almost all studied gauging stations data not shown annual flow at chisapani is almost constant while at asaraghat it is slightly decreasing the global climate research unit data cruts4 04 harris et al 2020 covering the krb revealed an overall increase in temperatures but a slight decrease in precipitation and increasing drought conditions fig s3 2 2 tree ring data fieldwork was carried out in the dolpa mugu and jumla districts of the karnali province nepal fig 1 from the known list of dendroclimatically suitable species from the nepal himalaya thapa et al 2017 abies spectabilis cedrus deodara picea smithiana pinus roxburghii and pinus wallichiana were selected for tree core sample collection these species have been demonstrated as potential paleoclimatic proxies due to their long life span distinct annual ring boundaries fig s4 as well as strong climatic signals tree ring sampling sites are located in the remote upstream of the karnali river where forests were less disturbed by human activities i e fuelwood collection increment cores were collected using a 5 mm diameter increment borer following the commonly used dendrochronological procedure speer 2010 one or two cores per tree were taken at breast height 1 3 m of dominant or co dominant healthy and old looking trees in total more than 400 tree cores were sampled in addition existing tree ring data from the krb of the nepal himalaya were downloaded from a public repository namely international tree ring data bank itrdb https www ncdc noaa gov data access paleoclimatology data 2 3 standardization and chronology development samples were processed for ring width measurements following standard dendrochronological procedure speer 2010 ring widths were measured to the nearest 0 01 mm accuracy using a lintab5tm tree ring measurement system attached to a computer with tsap win software rinn 2013 tree ring width measurements were cross dated in tsap by curve matching and statistics such as gleichläufigkeit glk t statistics and cross dating index cdi rinn 2013 a necessary correction was done for the samples that showed poor crossdating skills mainly due to the presence of false or locally missing rings though the tree ring series collected from the public repository sites 5 7 8 and 9 were already cross dated by the data contributors bhattacharyya et al 1992 cook et al 2003 the crossdating quality was checked again to remove any errors still present to remove biological growth trends and to maximize inherent climatic signals each tree ring series was standardized using modified negative exponential detrending approaches using the dplr package in r bunn 2008 the final tree ring width chronologies were computed by calculating a biweight robust mean cook and kairiukstis 1990 chronology quality was checked using mean inter series correlation rbar and expressed population signal eps wigley et al 1984 most site chronologies are significantly correlated table s1 and the first principal component pc 1 among all site chronologies explained 47 1 of the total variance for all site chronologies table s2 in order to characterize tree growth variations in different parts of the hydrological catchment of karnali river we developed the composite ring width chronologies by applying the same detrending method used for site chronology development 2 4 hydrological data and climate growth responses monthly streamflow and climatic temperature and precipitation data within the krb were collected from the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm nepal since most of the meteorological stations data were short with missing values only data from the jumla station was used for further analysis to fill these gaps in data in many regions and also to supplement jumla station data gridded climatic data were extracted from the climate research unit cru by averaging twelve grids covering the tree ring sampling sites in the krb 28 75 29 75 n 81 25 82 75 e the self calibrated palmer s drought severity index scpdsi was used to assess spatio temporal differences in drought intensity and response of trees to drought index monthly streamflow data of the main karnali river chisapani and asaraghat gauges were collected and used to assess the hydrological response of tree growth and model development for hydrological reconstruction the data of chisapani and asaraghat gauges in the main karnali river span for the periods 1962 2010 and 1962 2006 respectively to establish relationships between tree growth and hydroclimatic variables simple pearson s correlation between site and composite chronologies and the monthly and seasonal precipitation scpdsi temperature and river discharge were calculated for their periods of overlap with station data and cru data correlations were calculated for a 15 month dendroclimatic window from the previous august to the current october using the treeclim package zang and biondi 2015 in r environment additionally we calculated the correlation for seasonal windows such as winter dec feb spring mar may summer jun sep and spring early summer mar jul 2 5 streamflow reconstruction the gauging stations asaraghat and chisapani represent the central part and the complete hydrological catchment of the karnali river basin respectively fig 1 accordingly the composite chronologies were named asaraghat composite and chisapani composite and include those chronologies that were located inside the central part of karnali catchment sites 1 9 for asaragath or in the total catchment area sites 1 11 for chisapani the composite residual chronology produced by autoregressive modelling cook and kairiukstis 1990 exhibited the highest correlations with the streamflow record and thus were used to develop the calibration model based on the growth response analysis a linear regression model was constructed to calibrate tree ring data with hydroclimate data y s treamflow β 0 β 1 x rwi t ε where y streamflow is the reconstructed streamflow m3 s 1 for each gauging station i e asaragath and chisapani x rwi t is the tree ring width index at the t year β 0 is the intercept of the regression β 1 is the slope of the regression ɛ is the standard error of the estimate the reliability of the regression model was validated with several statistical tests cook and kairiukstis 1990 such as pearson s correlation coefficient r explained variance r2 adjusted explained variance r2 adj standard error se f test and durbin watson statistics dw for detecting the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals of a regression leave one out cross validation loocv michaelsen 1987 was performed to assess the validity of the linear regression model considering several statistics such as verified correlation

actual observations interpreting that the lower rmse the more closely a model predicts the actual observations the positive value of the re indicates predictive skill in the tree ring estimates fritts 1976 cook and kairiukstis 1990 the st is a non parametric test of similarity which only accounts for the number of agreements and disagreements in the sign of departure from their mean in between observed and reconstructed series in contrast pmt accounts for both direction and magnitude of agreements in between testing series from their mean values based on t test to check the temporal change in frequencies and intensities of extreme events in the streamflow numbers of extreme flow events in every 50 year interval were calculated the power spectral analysis using the multi tapered method mann and lees 1996 the morlet global wavelet analysis torrence and compo 1998 and the empirical model decomposition emd huang et al 1998 were conducted to detect periodicities of the reconstructed streamflow series the wavelet and emd analyses were performed with the dplr and emd packages bunn 2008 in r respectively to analyze the association between the climatic parameters and monthly seasonal streamflow spatial and ordinary correlations were calculated between reconstructed streamflow series and regional land cru temperature and precipitation relationships between the streamflow and different climatic indices were analyzed to investigate the teleconnections between the streamflow in karnali river and large scale climatic drivers and their frequency components 3 results 3 1

asaraghat composite chronology showed similar hydro climatic responses generally showing positive correlations with streamflow r 0 69 p 0 001 precipitation r 0 46 p 0 001 and scpdsi r 0 60 p 0 001 but negative correlations with temperatures average correlation r 0 40 p 0 001 during spring early summer season fig s5 march july streamflow recorded at the chisapani gauging station was negatively

basin fig 4c d similarly march july streamflow at the asaraghat gauging station also showed significant positive correlations with regional cru precipitation and scpdsi and negative correlations with maximum and mean temperature fig s6 these results indicated that streamflow in different sections of the krb watershed is influenced by similar climatic drivers 3 3 streamflow reconstruction of karnali river based on calibration with streamflow data for the period 1962 2010 from the chisapani gauging station a linear model was developed to reconstruct march july streamflow for the karnali river basin the equation derived from the transfer function is s f chisapani 1461 05 r w i t 218 73 200 93 where sfchisapani is the reconstructed march july streamflow for chisapani gauging stations rwit is the associated tree ring width index at the t year the correlation coefficient r of the chisapani streamflow reconstruction is 0 67 p 0 001 the model explained 45 variance r2 of the actual streamflow variability and produced rigid verifications the high f stats 38 23 indicated significant linear regression relationship between the response and the predictor in the regression the sign test result 39 10 exceeded 95 confidence level in the reconstruction the product mean test pmt for the reconstruction is 2 97 which is significant at 95 level the positive re value 0 4 for streamflow reconstruction indicates predictive skill in the tree ring estimates the rmse value 204 59 is relatively smaller than the standard deviation of the actual march july streamflow 267 74 during the calibration period the durbin watson test dw 2 42 indicates a negligible autocorrelation among regression residuals in the reconstruction model these entire verification statistical tests confirmed the validity of the regression model developed for march july streamflow reconstruction fig 5 table s3 additional reconstruction for the asaraghat gauging station based on a subset of tree ring chronologies produced similar robust calibration and verification results fig s7a b and table s3 the resulting march july streamflow reconstruction covered the past four centuries from 1628 to 2015 ce and preserved annual to decadal streamflow variability with distinct pluvial and dry periods fig 6a in total 57 moderate wet and 58 dry years mean 1sd while 15 extreme dry and three extreme wet years mean 2sd were observed during the past four centuries fig 6a table s4 the three wettest years at chisapani were 1628 1886 and 2000 while the 15 driest years were 1755 1793 1813 1873 1892 1908 1921 1935 1958 1967 1985 1992 1999 2004 and 2009 fig 6a low frequency filtering 10 year smoothing spline revealed several persistent dry and wet periods over the reconstruction period fig 6a long term above average flow periods occurred during 1650 1661 1711 1718 1723 1731 1824 1831 1877 1889 1924 1931 and 1971 1981 while long term below average flow periods occurred during 1639 1649 1689 1710 1753 1769 1777 1784 1803 1823 1867 1876 1942 1959 and 1963 1970 fig 6a the percentages of extreme pluvial and low flow events over 50 year windows indicated an increasing frequency of extreme events over the past four centuries especially extreme droughts fig 7 and fig s8 spatial correlations were computed between reconstructed march july discharge at chisapani station with cru surface precipitation and temperature of the same concurrent seasons as well as their one month lags it was found that reconstructed march july mean discharge at the chisapani station was positively correlated with precipitation within the krb and adjacent regions fig 8 a the spatial correlations with one month lag season precipitation were stronger compared to the same season s relations fig 8b the streamflow reconstruction has a weak negative relationship with temperature over the west nepal region fig 8c d the power spectral analysis of reconstructed streamflow data using the multi tapered method revealed periodicities of 2 1 8 7 and 12 2 12 5 years fig 9 a and fig s9a morlet wavelet analysis and empirical model decomposition showed an increasing intensity of high frequency cycles over the recent decades fig 9b fig s9b and fig s10 s11 we analyzed the teleconnections between karnali river streamflow and indices of broader scale climate modes fig s12 and found a significant positive relationship between karnali streamflow and all indian rainfall in february and june we also found a positive relationship between the march july streamflow and the southern oscillation index soi in most of the months but significant in june and july while a negative correlation with pdo and niño 3 4 was found for the months of the same season a negative correlation was found between streamflow and the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo indices during winter and early spring although the relationship was generally weak 4 discussion 4 1 hydro climatic sensitivity of multiple tree species due to its extreme topographic complexity the central himalaya in nepal holds large thermal and moisture gradients from low to high elevations as well as east to west directions being relatively dry dhm 2017 talchabhadel et al 2019 western nepal holds several dendroclimatologically promising tree species bhandari et al 2019 cook et al 2003 gaire et al 2017 2019 2020 panthi et al 2017 sano et al 2005 thapa et al 2017 our tree ring site chronologies from the karnali river basin showed high dendroclimatological potential table 1 as indicated by the high inter series correlation rbar and expressed population signal eps speer 2010 the composite chronologies from the krb were generally positively correlated with spring and early summer season precipitation and drought index and negatively correlated with spring season temperature fig 3 and fig s5 this indicates that the growth of the selected tree species in the studied region of the krb is mainly limited by the moisture availability during spring and early summer seasons gaire et al 2017 2019 liang et al 2019 panthi et al 2017 sano et al 2005 hydrological response analysis also revealed a strong positive relationship between composite chronologies and spring to early summer streamflow fig 3 and fig s5 streamflow is the result of rainfall precipitation melt water from snow and glaciers and water from groundwater storage andermann et al 2012 bookhagen and burbank 2010 the positive relations with streamflow further confirm the moisture limitation of tree growth in the krb western nepal receives about 26 of its annual precipitation during the winter 9 and spring 17 seasons in the form of snow or rainfall dhm 2017 khatiwada et al 2016 during the spring season temperature generally increases fast and reaches its annual maximum before the onset of the summer monsoon season low rainfall during winter and spring as well as increasing demand for evaporation due to high temperatures in the late spring leads to drought stress for tree growth in this region within krb there exist dry areas including those of the trans himalayan region like dolpa where previous studies also found moisture limitation of tree growth in spring and early summer gaire et al 2019 khatiwada et al 2016 talchabhadel et al 2019 spring or spring summer season s moisture limitation of tree growth is widely observed for various coniferous species in the western part of nepal himalaya bhandari et al 2019 gaire et al 2017 2019 panthi et al 2017 sano et al 2005 central and eastern nepal liang et al 2019 and the western indian himalaya misra et al 2015 singh and yadav 2013 singh et al 2009 yadav et al 2014 yadav 2011 significant relationships of tree growth with march july precipitation and temperature could be physiologically explained cool and wet conditions of spring and early summer seasons recharge soil moisture beneficial for tree growth during the current growing season we found the highest relationship between tree growth and march july streamflow probably due to the runoff contributed by snowmelt water during spring and as well as precipitation in early summer months when the temperature was relatively high major soil types such as humic cambisols rock outcrops eutric regosols dystric regosols and gelic leptosols were found in the karnali catchment area the karnali watershed area is covered by both snow glaciers and forests and the region is much vulnerable to climate changes and sensitive to changes in precipitation and temperature that may impact the magnitude and timing of streamflow through changes in soil moisture interception loss evapotranspiration and runoff production wigmosta and leung 2002 providing us with a tree growth response to hydro climate for historical streamflow reconstruction 4 2 multi centennial streamflow reconstruction the study developed a march july streamflow reconstruction for the karnali river basin which explained 45 of the variance of the actual streamflow of chisapani gauging station record fig 6a tree growth is influenced by multiple environmental factors and physiological processes tree ring standardization was done to retain the maximum common climate signals and to remove non climatic trends from the ring width series fritts 1976 as tree rings are climate proxies unlike station based records we assume that the explained variance 45 of the model with robust calibration verification statistics is reliable for palaeo climatic reconstruction to extend the relatively short existing instrumental streamflow recorded by gauging stations furthermore it is affirmed that the explained variance 45 in our reconstruction is comparable to or even higher than other previous streamflow reconstructions nearby the study region e g 40 variance in misra et al 2015 24 9 variance in rao et al 2020 43 7 variance in shah et al 2013 37 variance in singh and yadav 2013 our reconstruction revealed annual to multi decadal fluctuations in the streamflow of the karnali river several moderate mean 1sd and extreme mean 2sd flow years were also observed in our reconstruction fig 6a and fig s7c extreme low flow years during the past decades table s4 matched with the station data based drought years 1984 1985 1992 1995 and 2004 2009 in the krb khatiwada and pandey 2019 extreme events are more frequent in the last centuries compared to previous centuries which is consistent with reports on the increasing frequency of climatic extremes in the himalayas dhm 2017 talchabhadel et al 2018 zhan et al 2017 the recent high and low flow periods follow the patterns of dry and wet periods in precipitation and drought reconstructions from the region gaire et al 2017 2019 panthi et al 2017 based on lachen chhu river flow reconstruction in eastern himalaya shah et al 2014 found extreme low streamflow along with below average during the monsoon failure east india drought of ce 1792 1796 below average streamflow during 1792 1795 was also found in our study similar to the prolonged below average discharge during ce 1572 1683 in the indus river of pakistan cook et al 2013 we also detected below average discharge in most of the time of that period with prolonged dry periods during 1640 1647 winter spring season flow records of satluj river western himalaya india revealed 50 year low and high river discharge in the 18th and 19th centuries respectively singh and yadav 2013 consistent with our results the decreasing tendency in river discharge of satluj river was recorded since the 1990s singh and yadav 2013 the low flow period 1815 1821 detected in our reconstruction fell during the cold and dry episodes in the himalaya after tambora eruptions cook et al 2003 gaire et al 2020 liang et al 2019 the decreasing tendency in river discharge noticed since the 1990s is consistent with the decreasing trend in winter spring precipitation or increasing winter spring season drought in the region gaire et al 2017 panthi et al 2017 singh and yadav 2013 4 3 possible teleconnections our study observed inter annual to decadal scale periodicities i e 2 1 8 7 and 12 2 12 5 years in the spring early summer season streamflow at the karnali river the short and inter annual periodicities of 2 to 8 years fall within the enso range bridgman and oliver 2006 while the decadal periodicities 12 2 12 5 years could be related to pacific quasi decadal oscillation wang and gillies 2013 as well as some cyclic variability in solar activity shrestha et al 2000 these quasi cyclic periodicities are related to enso forcing of local dryness wetness variations in the south asian summer monsoon dominated himalaya gaire et al 2017 2019 panthi et al 2017 yadav et al 2014 yadav 2011 the tibetan plateau and other regions chen et al 2019 zaw et al 2020 2021 similar to our observations singh and yadav 2013 observed spectral peaks at 2 3 4 6 and 8 years in a seven centuries long winter spring season flow record of satluj river western himalaya india similarly chen et al 2019 found multi decadal 16 and 34 years and inter annual 2 1 2 3 2 7 3 2 3 5 3 8 4 8 5 7 and 8 1 years cycles in a 472 year long annual streamflow reconstruction of lhasa river on the southern tibetan plateau the amo enso pdo and soi are the major climatic modes phases that influence the seasonal or annual climate variability or anomaly in the himalaya and adjacent regions krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2014 liang et al 2019 naidu et al 2020 shrestha et al 2000 this study found positive relationships between karnali streamflow and indian rainfall and soi while negative relationships with niño 3 4 and pdo prevailed shrestha et al 2000 also reported a positive relationship between all nepal annual and seasonal precipitation and soi shrestha and kostaschuk 2005 studied the impact of enso on streamflow variability in nepal and found that el niño can cause below normal streamflow in the western and the eastern region of nepal while la niña produces above normal streamflow in western nepal meanwhile the pdo also affects the decadal to multi decadal rainfall variations around the globe dong and dai 2015 during warm pdo periods the impact of el niño on the monsoon rainfall is enhanced while the impact of la niña events is reduced krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2014 moreover large volcanic eruptions can also influence the nonlinear behavior of the enso and indian monsoon dynamical systems singh et al 2020 having negative impacts on monsoon precipitation shrestha et al 2000 although amo is another major driver for multi decadal variability in monsoon rainfall in the himalaya and adjacent regions naidu et al 2020 singh et al 2009 yadav 2011 our streamflow reconstruction did not detect amo related periodicities i e multi decadal cycles the possible reasons include the climate signals of the tree ring chronologies used climatic conditions in the study region influenced by the orographic effect and water contributed by melt water from glaciers though we found periodicities related to enso and pdo with some relationships between the spring early summer season streamflow and soi pdo and enso further studies are required to expand our understanding of the teleconnection mechanisms between the streamflow in the karnali river or other river basins in the central himalaya with broader scale climate phase and modes 4 4 implications of the study the present study developed four centuries long spring to early summer season march july streamflow reconstruction for karnali river a major tributary of the ganges river the reconstructed streamflow revealed inter annual to decadal variability in the flow there are several extreme pluvial and dry years periods with increasing intensity of the extreme events during the recent century or years it is anticipated that in the future more frequent flood or drought events can occur this information has important implications for water resource managers and planners for an appropriate planning and management of water resources for agriculture irrigation and energy generation in the krb in nepal and downstream areas in india most of the existing or planned hydropower projects in the krb are based on the run off river type jha 2010 the periodic inter annual to decadal decreasing trend or extreme dry periods in the flow indicated that the energy production from these rivers could be severely affected from time to time therefore hydropower projects could think of switching towards reservoir based hydropower generation for sustainable and continuous energy production this also implies irrigation projects which could be affected by the periodic shortage of the waters especially during the dry late spring season though our reconstruction is for the spring early summer season the observed increased frequency of extreme pluvial years over time indicates the possibility of risk of frequent flooding during the summer monsoon season with adverse impacts in the diverse sectors in the basin and downstream areas therefore it is better to take precautionary or preparatory measures to cope with ongoing and anticipated extreme flood events karnali and its tributaries have been experiencing hazardous flood events in recent years almost all the precipitation above 3 000 m in elevation falls as snow during winter and spring seasons the low flow period before the onset of the summer monsoon is critical for most water resource projects we found a one month lag positive relationship between precipitation and streamflow during spring season which indicates the importance of the meltwater for the streamflow during late spring which is the relatively dry season since previous modelling studies indicated thinning of the mountain snow cover and retreating of the glaciers bolch et al 2012 immerzeel et al 2010 khatiwada et al 2016 water dependent sectors could be affected in the future the long term hydro climatic history reconstruction for the region will support planners and policymakers to devise appropriate adaptation strategies to reduce disaster risk sustainable water resources management and improve agricultural productivity not only in nepal but also in downstream areas in india 5 conclusions we present the first multi centennial spring to early summer season march july streamflow reconstruction for the karnali river in the central himalaya by using moisture sensitive tree ring width chronologies of multiple tree species this study found an increasing frequency of extreme events during the recent decades a one month lag relationship was also detected between the streamflow and precipitation during the spring or early summer season indicating the importance of the meltwater in the streamflow ultimately to agriculture and energy sector during the lean flow period karnali river flow has short term inter annual to decadal periodicities similar to frequencies of broad scale climate modes phases like enso and pdo since periodic decadal or even longer period below average streamflow was found during the past four centuries streamflow based water and energy sectors could be affected periodically which demands appropriate adaptation strategies for water sectors as the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation and drought have increased in recent decades the livelihood of the peoples relying on the water resources of the krb and downstream areas could be affected due to the ongoing and anticipated climate change therefore dynamic water resource management and use approach is required to adapt the climate change and water induced disasters funding this work was jointly funded by the national natural science foundation of china nsfc

3262,the karnali river is one of the major transboundary rivers of the nepalese central himalaya and a major tributary of the ganges river in order to investigate regional historical hydroclimate variability we compiled eleven tree ring width chronologies based on 354 exactly dated tree cores from five coniferous species for the karnali river catchment the chronologies were moisture sensitive and the composite chronology was significantly correlated with spring to early summer march july r 0 67 p 0 001 discharge at the chisapani gauging station the robust calibration r2 0 45 1962 2010 enabled us to reconstruct march july streamflow variability of karnali river basin krb over the past four centuries the streamflow reconstruction showed prolonged pluvial periods during 1650 1661 1711 1718 1723 1731 1824 1831 1877 1889 1924 1931 and 1971 1981 while prolonged low flow periods occurred during 1639 1649 1689 1710 1753 1769 1777 1784 1803 1823 1867 1876 1942 1959 and 1963 1970 our reconstructed march july streamflow series correlated positively with the seasonally averaged drought index and precipitation in the central west himalayan region and vicinities the streamflow reconstruction revealed an increasing frequency of extreme low flow and pluvial events in the central west himalayan region especially during the past century we found short 2 1 3 3 6 2 6 3 and 8 5 8 7 years to medium 12 2 12 5 years periodicities in the reconstructed streamflow series implying teleconnections with broad scale climate modes like the el niño southern oscillation enso and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo our karnali river streamflow reconstruction represents an update of regional hydroclimate variability which may serve as a useful reference for water resource management and appropriate water use policies in the context of current and future climate change keywords climate change central himalaya hydroclimate precipitation streamflow tree rings 1 introduction the himalayan mountains known as asian freshwater tower provide a wide range of ecosystem services and are the basis for the livelihoods of millions of people living in south asia immerzeel et al 2010 the central himalaya shows distinct seasonality in the precipitation distribution under the influences of the indian summer monsoon ism during summer and the westerlies during winter dhm 2017 talchabhadel et al 2018 the himalayan region is experiencing rapid warming sigdel et al 2021 and an increase in extreme climate events such as droughts and flooding gaire et al 2019 panthi et al 2017 talchabhadel et al 2018 zhan et al 2017 most of the glaciers in the central himalaya are currently thinning and retreating rapidly due to climate warming bolch et al 2012 however how this rapid climate change is affecting the water resources and hydroclimate variability in the region is still poorly understood lutz et al 2014 since climate change is severely affecting the asian freshwater towers immerzeel et al 2010 the impacts on agriculture water and energy resources sectors are anticipated to further aggravate on the other hand existing hydrological records in the himalayan region are too short for long term trend and periodicity analysis which may hinder the rigidity of projections of water resource availability in the river basins and downstream areas under ongoing climate change tree ring has been used as a valuable high resolution proxy for reconstructing hydroclimate variability at centennial to millennia scale due to their high dating accuracy and wide distribution chen et al 2019 derose et al 2015 liu et al 2020 rao et al 2020 woodhouse and lukas 2006 tree growth may vary with different environmental conditions and consequently many natural phenomena can be yearly recorded in tree rings of different species on a site and different sites in a region speer 2010 the radial growth of a tree is often influenced by climate fritts 1976 which also controls the streamflow of a river shekhar and bhattacharyya 2015 the climate variables mainly precipitation and evapotranspiration i e loss of moisture from trees and soils are the limiting factors for both moisture limited tree growth and water amount that reaches the river woodhouse and lukas 2006 although there is an indirect relationship between tree growth and streamflow both of which are strongly linked by the regional climate in view of that trees within the watershed areas provide reliable tree ring proxies to assess the long term streamflow variability of a river even trees growing far away from the river basin can capture streamflow at a certain gauging station because the atmospheric moisture that greatly affects both tree growth and river flow goes through drainage divides woodhouse and lukas 2006 accordingly tree ring data have been extensively used to reconstruct long term river discharges and their management in various water resource sectors chen et al 2019 cook et al 2013 rao et al 2020 moisture sensitive multiple species tree ring network combined with a well tested statistical method can provide reliable streamflow reconstruction cook et al 2013 despite several dendroclimatically promising tree species growing in the central himalaya there is no tree ring based river flow reconstruction to provide a long term perspective on the streamflow of central himalayan rivers so far the karnali river flowing in the western part of nepal is a transboundary river basin and a major tributary of the ganges river khatiwada and pandey 2019 sharma 1993 hydro climatic data analysis and tree ring based reconstructions from the upper catchments of karnali river basin krb have indicated an increase in temperature locally varying trends in rainfall but increasing frequency and intensity of the drought events dhm 2017 gaire et al 2017 2019 khatiwada and pandey 2019 khatiwada et al 2016 panthi et al 2017 in the northwest and far east himalaya more than 50 of the annual discharge comes from the snow that is brought by westerly winds during the winter however in the karnali basin winter precipitation discharge portion is 20 andermann et al 2012 sharma 1993 according to the vulnerability assessment siddiqui et al 2012 the krb and its watersheds are most vulnerable to climate change compared to other river basins in nepal a projection study about the future discharge in different regions of the himalaya indicated an increasing trend in annual river flows in the 21st century with a slight decrease towards the end of the 21st century in the downstream of krb mathison et al 2015 the krb is also a part of the himalayan biodiversity hotspot with nearly 14 of the basin area being under protected national parks hunting reserves and ramsar convention wetlands therefore quantitative information on the long term variability of precipitation streamflow floods and drought history is imperative for water resource management and to formulate appropriate water use policies under climate change conditions long term reconstructions of magnitude intensity and periodicity of streamflow variability at different temporal scales provide a solid basis to augment planning including preparedness in water induced disasters derose et al 2015 liu et al 2020 rao et al 2020 woodhouse and lukas 2006 cook et al 2013 reconstructed the upper indus basin streamflow in pakistan over the past five centuries using a conifer tree ring width chronology misra et al 2015 also conducted a satluj river flow reconstruction in the western indian himalaya using cedrus deodara chronology shah et al 2014 developed larix griffithiana tree ring chronology to reconstruct lachen chhu river flow in the eastern himalaya india the satluj river flow in the western himalaya india was also reconstructed by singh and yadav 2013 for the past seven centuries based on tree ring chronologies of pinus gerardiana and cedrus deodara interestingly all the studied species showed similar growth responses to hydroclimatic conditions i e negative correlation with temperature and positive correlations with precipitation and streamflow but for different seasons though there is a huge potential for dendrohydrological research in the krb region in nepal no multi centuries streamflow reconstruction is available yet this study developed a composite tree ring width chronology of five tree species based on 354 individual tree ring series from the krb this study aims 1 to reconstruct streamflow variability of the karnali river for the past four centuries using multi species tree ring proxies and 2 to explore linkages of streamflow variability in the central himalaya with broader scale climate modes the scientific questions are 1 what are the predominant hydro climatic factors limiting tree radial growth of coniferous tree species in the karnali river basin 2 can multi species tree ring composite chronologies be used as a high resolution proxy of centennial long streamflow variability in the central himalaya 3 how is the streamflow variability of the karnali river linked with broader scale climate modes it was hypothesized that 1 radial growth of the studied tree species in the krb is mainly controlled by moisture availability during the spring and early summer seasons 2 tree ring records can provide information about the past streamflow variability of the karnali river which is strongly influenced by global climatic drivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and hydro climatic conditions this study was carried out in the karnali river basin krb fig 1 which lies in western nepal 28 33 30 68 n 80 55 83 67 e and extends from dhaulagiri mountain in the east to nanda devi mountain in the west covering an area of 45 269 km2 khatiwada and pandey 2019 sharma 1993 originating from the south of mansarovar and rakshastal lakes on the tibetan plateau the karnali river is the longest river flowing in nepal khatiwada and pandey 2019 sharma 1993 the elevation of the krb varies from about 100 to 7 721 m a s l khatiwada and pandey 2019 the karnali river is a perennial and snow fed river with six major snow fed tributaries and watersheds sharma 1993 till the present study the karnali river basin has not yet undergone any human intervention e g dam reservoir and hydropower project assuming that discharge records of chisapani and asaraghat gauging stations reflect natural streamflow variability the climate of krb is mainly influenced by the indian summer monsoon ism system the extreme orography of the region and the westerlies khatiwada et al 2016 the ism and westerlies control the precipitation in the krb during summer and winter respectively dhm 2017 talchabhadel et al 2018 about 68 of the annual rainfall occurs during the ism season june to september whereas only 9 occurs in winter december to february and 17 in the pre monsoon march to may period fig s1 khatiwada et al 2016 most of the regional climate stations show decreasing trends in precipitation khatiwada et al 2016 talchabhadel et al 2018 while mean temperatures show an overall increase dhm 2017 khatiwada et al 2016 the monthly streamflow records of three gauging stations in krb revealed that the flow has a unimodal distribution with maximum flow during the summer monsoon months june to september and a peak in august fig s2 the monthly seasonal and annual average streamflow analysis indicates that the flow is slightly decreasing in most months and seasons winter djf spring mam summer jjas and on autumn in almost all studied gauging stations data not shown annual flow at chisapani is almost constant while at asaraghat it is slightly decreasing the global climate research unit data cruts4 04 harris et al 2020 covering the krb revealed an overall increase in temperatures but a slight decrease in precipitation and increasing drought conditions fig s3 2 2 tree ring data fieldwork was carried out in the dolpa mugu and jumla districts of the karnali province nepal fig 1 from the known list of dendroclimatically suitable species from the nepal himalaya thapa et al 2017 abies spectabilis cedrus deodara picea smithiana pinus roxburghii and pinus wallichiana were selected for tree core sample collection these species have been demonstrated as potential paleoclimatic proxies due to their long life span distinct annual ring boundaries fig s4 as well as strong climatic signals tree ring sampling sites are located in the remote upstream of the karnali river where forests were less disturbed by human activities i e fuelwood collection increment cores were collected using a 5 mm diameter increment borer following the commonly used dendrochronological procedure speer 2010 one or two cores per tree were taken at breast height 1 3 m of dominant or co dominant healthy and old looking trees in total more than 400 tree cores were sampled in addition existing tree ring data from the krb of the nepal himalaya were downloaded from a public repository namely international tree ring data bank itrdb https www ncdc noaa gov data access paleoclimatology data 2 3 standardization and chronology development samples were processed for ring width measurements following standard dendrochronological procedure speer 2010 ring widths were measured to the nearest 0 01 mm accuracy using a lintab5tm tree ring measurement system attached to a computer with tsap win software rinn 2013 tree ring width measurements were cross dated in tsap by curve matching and statistics such as gleichläufigkeit glk t statistics and cross dating index cdi rinn 2013 a necessary correction was done for the samples that showed poor crossdating skills mainly due to the presence of false or locally missing rings though the tree ring series collected from the public repository sites 5 7 8 and 9 were already cross dated by the data contributors bhattacharyya et al 1992 cook et al 2003 the crossdating quality was checked again to remove any errors still present to remove biological growth trends and to maximize inherent climatic signals each tree ring series was standardized using modified negative exponential detrending approaches using the dplr package in r bunn 2008 the final tree ring width chronologies were computed by calculating a biweight robust mean cook and kairiukstis 1990 chronology quality was checked using mean inter series correlation rbar and expressed population signal eps wigley et al 1984 most site chronologies are significantly correlated table s1 and the first principal component pc 1 among all site chronologies explained 47 1 of the total variance for all site chronologies table s2 in order to characterize tree growth variations in different parts of the hydrological catchment of karnali river we developed the composite ring width chronologies by applying the same detrending method used for site chronology development 2 4 hydrological data and climate growth responses monthly streamflow and climatic temperature and precipitation data within the krb were collected from the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm nepal since most of the meteorological stations data were short with missing values only data from the jumla station was used for further analysis to fill these gaps in data in many regions and also to supplement jumla station data gridded climatic data were extracted from the climate research unit cru by averaging twelve grids covering the tree ring sampling sites in the krb 28 75 29 75 n 81 25 82 75 e the self calibrated palmer s drought severity index scpdsi was used to assess spatio temporal differences in drought intensity and response of trees to drought index monthly streamflow data of the main karnali river chisapani and asaraghat gauges were collected and used to assess the hydrological response of tree growth and model development for hydrological reconstruction the data of chisapani and asaraghat gauges in the main karnali river span for the periods 1962 2010 and 1962 2006 respectively to establish relationships between tree growth and hydroclimatic variables simple pearson s correlation between site and composite chronologies and the monthly and seasonal precipitation scpdsi temperature and river discharge were calculated for their periods of overlap with station data and cru data correlations were calculated for a 15 month dendroclimatic window from the previous august to the current october using the treeclim package zang and biondi 2015 in r environment additionally we calculated the correlation for seasonal windows such as winter dec feb spring mar may summer jun sep and spring early summer mar jul 2 5 streamflow reconstruction the gauging stations asaraghat and chisapani represent the central part and the complete hydrological catchment of the karnali river basin respectively fig 1 accordingly the composite chronologies were named asaraghat composite and chisapani composite and include those chronologies that were located inside the central part of karnali catchment sites 1 9 for asaragath or in the total catchment area sites 1 11 for chisapani the composite residual chronology produced by autoregressive modelling cook and kairiukstis 1990 exhibited the highest correlations with the streamflow record and thus were used to develop the calibration model based on the growth response analysis a linear regression model was constructed to calibrate tree ring data with hydroclimate data y s treamflow β 0 β 1 x rwi t ε where y streamflow is the reconstructed streamflow m3 s 1 for each gauging station i e asaragath and chisapani x rwi t is the tree ring width index at the t year β 0 is the intercept of the regression β 1 is the slope of the regression ɛ is the standard error of the estimate the reliability of the regression model was validated with several statistical tests cook and kairiukstis 1990 such as pearson s correlation coefficient r explained variance r2 adjusted explained variance r2 adj standard error se f test and durbin watson statistics dw for detecting the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals of a regression leave one out cross validation loocv michaelsen 1987 was performed to assess the validity of the linear regression model considering several statistics such as verified correlation

actual observations interpreting that the lower rmse the more closely a model predicts the actual observations the positive value of the re indicates predictive skill in the tree ring estimates fritts 1976 cook and kairiukstis 1990 the st is a non parametric test of similarity which only accounts for the number of agreements and disagreements in the sign of departure from their mean in between observed and reconstructed series in contrast pmt accounts for both direction and magnitude of agreements in between testing series from their mean values based on t test to check the temporal change in frequencies and intensities of extreme events in the streamflow numbers of extreme flow events in every 50 year interval were calculated the power spectral analysis using the multi tapered method mann and lees 1996 the morlet global wavelet analysis torrence and compo 1998 and the empirical model decomposition emd huang et al 1998 were conducted to detect periodicities of the reconstructed streamflow series the wavelet and emd analyses were performed with the dplr and emd packages bunn 2008 in r respectively to analyze the association between the climatic parameters and monthly seasonal streamflow spatial and ordinary correlations were calculated between reconstructed streamflow series and regional land cru temperature and precipitation relationships between the streamflow and different climatic indices were analyzed to investigate the teleconnections between the streamflow in karnali river and large scale climatic drivers and their frequency components 3 results 3 1

asaraghat composite chronology showed similar hydro climatic responses generally showing positive correlations with streamflow r 0 69 p 0 001 precipitation r 0 46 p 0 001 and scpdsi r 0 60 p 0 001 but negative correlations with temperatures average correlation r 0 40 p 0 001 during spring early summer season fig s5 march july streamflow recorded at the chisapani gauging station was negatively correlated with concurrent regional cru maximum and mean temperature fig 4 a b and positively correlated with precipitation r2 0 38 p 0 001 and scpdsi r2 0 32 p 0 001 averaged over the karnali river basin fig 4c d similarly march july streamflow at the asaraghat gauging station also showed significant positive correlations with regional cru precipitation and scpdsi and negative correlations with maximum and mean temperature fig s6 these results indicated that streamflow in different sections of the krb watershed is influenced by similar climatic drivers 3 3 streamflow reconstruction of karnali river based on calibration with streamflow data for the period 1962 2010 from the chisapani gauging station a linear model was developed to reconstruct march july streamflow for the karnali river basin the equation derived from the transfer function is s f chisapani 1461 05 r w i t 218 73 200 93 where sfchisapani is the reconstructed march july streamflow for chisapani gauging stations rwit is the associated tree ring width index at the t year the correlation coefficient r of the chisapani streamflow reconstruction is 0 67 p 0 001 the model explained 45 variance r2 of the actual streamflow variability and produced rigid verifications the high f stats 38 23 indicated significant linear regression relationship between the response and the predictor in the regression the sign test result 39 10 exceeded 95 confidence level in the reconstruction the product mean test pmt for the reconstruction is 2 97 which is significant at 95 level the positive re value 0 4 for streamflow reconstruction indicates predictive skill in the tree ring estimates the rmse value 204 59 is relatively smaller than the standard deviation of the actual march july streamflow 267 74 during the calibration period the durbin watson test dw 2 42 indicates a negligible autocorrelation among regression residuals in the reconstruction model these entire verification statistical tests confirmed the validity of the regression model developed for march july streamflow reconstruction fig 5 table s3 additional reconstruction for the asaraghat gauging station based on a subset of tree ring chronologies produced similar robust calibration and verification results fig s7a b and table s3 the resulting march july streamflow reconstruction covered the past four centuries from 1628 to 2015 ce and preserved annual to decadal streamflow variability with distinct pluvial and dry periods fig 6a in total 57 moderate wet and 58 dry years mean 1sd while 15 extreme dry and three extreme wet years mean 2sd were observed during the past four centuries fig 6a table s4 the three wettest years at chisapani were 1628 1886 and 2000 while the 15 driest years were 1755 1793 1813 1873 1892 1908 1921 1935 1958 1967 1985 1992 1999 2004 and 2009 fig 6a low frequency filtering 10 year smoothing spline revealed several persistent dry and wet periods over the reconstruction period fig 6a long term above average flow periods occurred during 1650 1661 1711 1718 1723 1731 1824 1831 1877 1889 1924 1931 and 1971 1981 while long term below average flow periods occurred during 1639 1649 1689 1710 1753 1769 1777 1784 1803 1823 1867 1876 1942 1959 and 1963 1970 fig 6a the percentages of extreme pluvial and low flow events over 50 year windows indicated an increasing frequency of extreme events over the past four centuries especially extreme droughts fig 7 and fig s8 spatial correlations were computed between reconstructed march july discharge at chisapani station with cru surface precipitation and temperature of the same concurrent seasons as well as their one month lags it was found that reconstructed march july mean discharge at the chisapani station was positively correlated with precipitation within the krb and adjacent regions fig 8 a the spatial correlations with one month lag season precipitation were stronger compared to the same season s relations fig 8b the streamflow reconstruction has a weak negative relationship with temperature over the west nepal region fig 8c d the power spectral analysis of reconstructed streamflow data using the multi tapered method revealed periodicities of 2 1 8 7 and 12 2 12 5 years fig 9 a and fig s9a morlet wavelet analysis and empirical model decomposition showed an increasing intensity of high frequency cycles over the recent decades fig 9b fig s9b and fig s10 s11 we analyzed the teleconnections between karnali river streamflow and indices of broader scale climate modes fig s12 and found a significant positive relationship between karnali streamflow and all indian rainfall in february and june we also found a positive relationship between the march july streamflow and the southern oscillation index soi in most of the months but significant in june and july while a negative correlation with pdo and niño 3 4 was found for the months of the same season a negative correlation was found between streamflow and the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo indices during winter and early spring although the relationship was generally weak 4 discussion 4 1 hydro climatic sensitivity of multiple tree species due to its extreme topographic complexity the central himalaya in nepal holds large thermal and moisture gradients from low to high elevations as well as east to west directions being relatively dry dhm 2017 talchabhadel et al 2019 western nepal holds several dendroclimatologically promising tree species bhandari et al 2019 cook et al 2003 gaire et al 2017 2019 2020 panthi et al 2017 sano et al 2005 thapa et al 2017 our tree ring site chronologies from the karnali river basin showed high dendroclimatological potential table 1 as indicated by the high inter series correlation rbar and expressed population signal eps speer 2010 the composite chronologies from the krb were generally positively correlated with spring and early summer season precipitation and drought index and negatively correlated with spring season temperature fig 3 and fig s5 this indicates that the growth of the selected tree species in the studied region of the krb is mainly limited by the moisture availability during spring and early summer seasons gaire et al 2017 2019 liang et al 2019 panthi et al 2017 sano et al 2005 hydrological response analysis also revealed a strong positive relationship between composite chronologies and spring to early summer streamflow fig 3 and fig s5 streamflow is the result of rainfall precipitation melt water from snow and glaciers and water from groundwater storage andermann et al 2012 bookhagen and burbank 2010 the positive relations with streamflow further confirm the moisture limitation of tree growth in the krb western nepal receives about 26 of its annual precipitation during the winter 9 and spring 17 seasons in the form of snow or rainfall dhm 2017 khatiwada et al 2016 during the spring season temperature generally increases fast and reaches its annual maximum before the onset of the summer monsoon season low rainfall during winter and spring as well as increasing demand for evaporation due to high temperatures in the late spring leads to drought stress for tree growth in this region within krb there exist dry areas including those of the trans himalayan region like dolpa where previous studies also found moisture limitation of tree growth in spring and early summer gaire et al 2019 khatiwada et al 2016 talchabhadel et al 2019 spring or spring summer season s moisture limitation of tree growth is widely observed for various coniferous species in the western part of nepal himalaya bhandari et al 2019 gaire et al 2017 2019 panthi et al 2017 sano et al 2005 central and eastern nepal liang et al 2019 and the western indian himalaya misra et al 2015 singh and yadav 2013 singh et al 2009 yadav et al 2014 yadav 2011 significant relationships of tree growth with march july precipitation and temperature could be physiologically explained cool and wet conditions of spring and early summer seasons recharge soil moisture beneficial for tree growth during the current growing season we found the highest relationship between tree growth and march july streamflow probably due to the runoff contributed by snowmelt water during spring and as well as precipitation in early summer months when the temperature was relatively high major soil types such as humic cambisols rock outcrops eutric regosols dystric regosols and gelic leptosols were found in the karnali catchment area the karnali watershed area is covered by both snow glaciers and forests and the region is much vulnerable to climate changes and sensitive to changes in precipitation and temperature that may impact the magnitude and timing of streamflow through changes in soil moisture interception loss evapotranspiration and runoff production wigmosta and leung 2002 providing us with a tree growth response to hydro climate for historical streamflow reconstruction 4 2 multi centennial streamflow reconstruction the study developed a march july streamflow reconstruction for the karnali river basin which explained 45 of the variance of the actual streamflow of chisapani gauging station record fig 6a tree growth is influenced by multiple environmental factors and physiological processes tree ring standardization was done to retain the maximum common climate signals and to remove non climatic trends from the ring width series fritts 1976 as tree rings are climate proxies unlike station based records we assume that the explained variance 45 of the model with robust calibration verification statistics is reliable for palaeo climatic reconstruction to extend the relatively short existing instrumental streamflow recorded by gauging stations furthermore it is affirmed that the explained variance 45 in our reconstruction is comparable to or even higher than other previous streamflow reconstructions nearby the

decadal fluctuations in the streamflow of the karnali river several moderate mean 1sd and extreme mean 2sd flow years were also observed in our reconstruction fig 6a and fig s7c extreme low flow years during the past decades table s4 matched with the station data based drought years 1984 1985 1992 1995 and 2004 2009 in the krb khatiwada and pandey 2019 extreme events are more frequent in the last centuries compared to previous centuries which is consistent with reports on the increasing frequency of climatic extremes in the himalayas dhm 2017 talchabhadel et al 2018 zhan et al 2017 the recent high and low flow periods follow the patterns of dry and wet periods in precipitation and drought reconstructions from the region gaire et al 2017 2019 panthi et al 2017 based on lachen chhu river flow reconstruction in eastern himalaya shah et al 2014 found extreme low streamflow along with below average during the monsoon failure east india drought of ce 1792 1796 below average streamflow during 1792 1795 was also found in our study similar to the prolonged below average discharge during ce 1572 1683 in the indus river of pakistan cook et al 2013 we also detected below average discharge in most of the time of that period with prolonged dry periods during 1640 1647 winter spring season flow records of satluj river western himalaya india revealed 50 year low and high river discharge in the 18th and 19th centuries respectively singh and yadav 2013 consistent with our results the decreasing tendency in river discharge of satluj river was recorded since the 1990s singh and yadav 2013 the low flow period 1815 1821 detected in our reconstruction fell during the cold and dry episodes in the himalaya after tambora eruptions cook et al 2003 gaire et al 2020 liang et al 2019 the decreasing tendency in river discharge noticed since the 1990s is consistent with the decreasing trend in winter spring precipitation or increasing winter spring season drought in the region gaire et al 2017 panthi et al 2017 singh and yadav 2013 4 3 possible teleconnections our study observed inter annual to decadal scale periodicities i e 2 1 8 7 and 12 2 12 5 years in the spring early summer season streamflow at the karnali river the short and inter annual periodicities of 2 to 8 years fall within the enso range bridgman and oliver 2006 while the decadal periodicities 12 2 12 5 years could be related to pacific quasi decadal oscillation wang and gillies 2013 as well as some cyclic variability in solar activity shrestha et al 2000 these quasi cyclic periodicities are related to enso forcing of local dryness wetness variations in the south asian summer monsoon dominated himalaya gaire et al 2017 2019 panthi et al 2017 yadav et al 2014 yadav 2011 the tibetan plateau and other regions chen et al 2019 zaw et al 2020 2021 similar to our observations singh and yadav 2013 observed spectral peaks at 2 3 4 6 and 8 years in a seven centuries long winter spring season flow record of satluj river western himalaya india similarly chen et al 2019 found multi decadal 16 and 34 years and inter annual 2 1 2 3 2 7 3 2 3 5 3 8 4 8 5 7 and 8 1 years cycles in a 472 year long annual streamflow reconstruction of lhasa river on the southern tibetan plateau the amo enso pdo and soi are the major climatic modes phases that influence the seasonal or annual climate variability or anomaly in the himalaya and adjacent regions krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2014 liang et al 2019 naidu et al 2020 shrestha et al 2000 this study found positive relationships between karnali streamflow and indian rainfall and soi while negative relationships with niño 3 4 and pdo prevailed shrestha et al 2000 also reported a positive relationship between all nepal annual and seasonal precipitation and soi shrestha and kostaschuk 2005 studied the impact of enso on streamflow variability in nepal and found that el niño can cause below normal streamflow in the western and the eastern region of nepal while la niña produces above normal streamflow in western nepal meanwhile the pdo also affects the decadal to multi decadal rainfall variations around the globe dong and dai 2015 during warm pdo periods the impact of el niño on the monsoon rainfall is enhanced while the impact of la niña events is reduced krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2014 moreover large volcanic eruptions can also influence the nonlinear behavior of the enso and indian monsoon dynamical systems singh et al 2020 having negative impacts on monsoon precipitation shrestha et al 2000 although amo is another major driver for multi decadal variability in monsoon rainfall in the himalaya and adjacent regions naidu et al 2020 singh et al 2009 yadav 2011 our streamflow reconstruction did not detect amo related periodicities i e multi decadal cycles the possible reasons include the climate signals of the tree ring chronologies used climatic conditions in the study region influenced by the orographic effect and water contributed by melt water from glaciers though we found periodicities related to enso and pdo with some relationships between the spring early summer season streamflow and soi pdo and enso further studies are required to expand our understanding of the teleconnection mechanisms between the streamflow in the karnali river or other river basins in the central himalaya with broader scale climate phase and modes 4 4 implications of the study the present study developed four centuries long spring to early summer season march july streamflow reconstruction for karnali river a major tributary of the ganges river the reconstructed streamflow revealed inter annual to decadal variability in the flow there are several extreme pluvial and dry years periods with increasing intensity of the extreme events during the recent century or years it is anticipated that in the future more frequent flood or drought events can occur this information has important implications for water resource managers and planners for an appropriate planning and management of water resources for agriculture irrigation and energy generation in the krb in nepal and downstream areas in india most of the existing or planned hydropower projects in the krb are based on the run off river type jha 2010 the periodic inter annual to decadal decreasing trend or extreme dry periods in the flow indicated that the energy production from these rivers could be severely affected from time to time therefore hydropower projects could think of switching towards reservoir based hydropower generation for sustainable and continuous energy production this also implies irrigation projects which could be affected by the periodic shortage of the waters especially during the dry late spring season though our reconstruction is for the spring early summer season the observed increased frequency of extreme pluvial years over time indicates the possibility of risk of frequent flooding during the summer monsoon season with adverse impacts in the diverse sectors in the basin and downstream areas therefore it is better to take precautionary or preparatory measures to cope with ongoing and anticipated extreme flood events karnali and its tributaries have been experiencing hazardous flood events in recent years almost all the precipitation above 3 000 m in elevation falls as snow during winter and spring seasons the low flow period before the onset of the summer monsoon is critical for most water resource projects we found a one month lag positive relationship between precipitation and streamflow during spring season which indicates the importance of the meltwater for the streamflow during late spring which is the relatively dry season since previous modelling studies indicated thinning of the mountain snow cover and retreating of the glaciers bolch et al 2012 immerzeel et al 2010 khatiwada et al 2016 water dependent sectors could be affected in the future the long term hydro climatic history reconstruction for the region will support planners and policymakers to devise appropriate adaptation strategies to reduce disaster risk sustainable water resources management and improve agricultural productivity not only in nepal but also in downstream areas in india 5 conclusions we present the first multi centennial spring to early summer season march july streamflow reconstruction for the karnali river in the central himalaya by using moisture sensitive tree ring width chronologies of multiple tree species this study found an increasing frequency of extreme events during the recent decades a one month lag relationship was also detected between the streamflow and precipitation during the spring or early summer season indicating the importance of the meltwater in the streamflow ultimately to agriculture and energy sector during the lean flow period karnali river flow has short term inter annual to decadal periodicities similar to frequencies of broad scale climate modes phases like enso and pdo since periodic decadal or even longer period below average streamflow was found during the past four centuries streamflow based water and energy sectors could be affected periodically which demands appropriate adaptation strategies for water sectors as the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation and drought have increased in recent decades the livelihood of the peoples relying on the water resources of the krb and downstream areas could be affected due to the ongoing and anticipated climate change therefore dynamic water resource management and use approach is required to adapt the climate change and water induced disasters funding this work was jointly funded by the national natural science foundation of china nsfc

3263,water infiltration in soils is a fundamental hydrologic process that determines the water availability for plant roots and the rate of recharge to deep groundwater bodies when both the initial water saturation of the soil and the water infiltration rate is low the infiltration front becomes unstable resulting in gravity fingers that act as preferential flow channels preferential flow may allow for the rapid bypass of water through the evaporation zone thereby promoting deep drainage of water into the subsoil even in arid and semi arid regions where the potential evapotranspiration pet is high and the mean annual precipitation map is low here we investigate experimentally the impact of gravity fingering on deep drainage coupled with surface evaporation in a 3d porous medium we use a cylindrical vessel packed with dry glass beads and reproduce seasonal climatic patterns consisting of relatively short rainfall events alternating with periods of intense evaporation we vary the volume of rainfall events and the interval between rainfall events to replicate climate conditions we record the mass of water in the system throughout the experiment and determine the partition between evaporation and deep drainage before and after the onset of fingering we find that in semi arid conditions the fraction of water that bypasses the evaporation zone increases fourfold after gravity fingering starts this finding has potentially important implications for understanding infiltration dynamics in arid environments and ecosystems response in regions susceptible to desertification keywords infiltration gravity fingering deep drainage evaporation ecohydrology 1 introduction understanding the subsurface percolation of rainwater is of critical importance to the long term availability of water resources the interplay between climate soil moisture and vegetation determines the sustainability of the water and nutrient cycles on which biodiversity and human development depend schlesinger et al 1990 brown et al 1997 scanlon et al 2007 kéfi et al 2007 jackson et al 2002 reynolds et al 2007 richter and mobley 2009 báez and collins 2008 tietjen 2016 in

determining the availability of the water in the earth s critical zone rodriguez iturbe 2000 in the hydrologic cycle rainfall will either flow over the land as surface runoff return to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration or infiltrate deep into the ground reaching deep root systems and recharging aquifers horton 1933 hillel 1980 allison et al 1994 sophocleous 2002 we chose the term deep drainage as it seems to be the most commonly accepted term in hydrology seyfried et al 2005 eilers et al 2007 wohling et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 li et al 2019 to denote the flux of water that moves through the unsaturated zone past the root zone and may become recharge after a lag time to determine the partitioning of water the convention is to conduct a soil water balance rodriguez iturbe et al 2001 rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 small 2005 a critical but poorly understood question is how partitioning depends on the hydrodynamics of infiltrated water and soil infiltration patterns here we investigate the impact of gravity fingering a widely observed instability that takes place during infiltration in relatively dry soil hill and parlange 1972 glass et al 1989 ritsema et al 1998 this instability has been documented in the field ritsema and dekker 1994 hendrickx and flury 2001 and has been extensively characterized in quasi 2d laboratory experiments diment and watson 1985 glass et al 1989 selker et al 1992 selker et al 1992 lu et al 1994 bauters et al 1998 bauters et al 2000 yao and hendrickx 2001 sililo and tellam 2000 flekkøy et al 2002 wang et al 2004 wei et al 2014 and some 3d experiments yao and hendrickx 1996 glass et al 1990 some of the key features of fingered flow are 1 presence of saturation overshoot that is the pile up of water at the infiltration front which is understood to be a prerequisite for the fingering instability in unsaturated flows dicarlo 2004 egorov et al 2003 nieber et al 2005 dicarlo 2007 cueto felgueroso and juanes 2009 2 winner takes all behavior in which the fastest growing fingers channelize most of the flow and the growth of other incipient fingers is thereby suppressed glass et al 1989 selker et al 1992 3 robustness of the instability with respect to the heterogeneity of the medium cremer et al 2019 sililo and tellam 2000 cueto felgueroso et al 2020 4 strong dependence on the infiltration flux indicating that stable fronts are observed in dry media when the infiltration rate is either very small or approaches the saturated conductivity hendrickx and yao 1996 in general larger infiltration rates produce faster thicker fingers glass et al 1989 5 fingering is promoted when the medium is quite dry even relatively low water saturations lead to a compact downward moving wetting front lu et al 1994 bauters et al 2000 experimental work has shown that the fingering instability is expected to be more vigorous for coarse soils for two reasons importance of gravity vs capillary forces and because the soil retention curve and unsaturated conductivity are often sharper more nonlinear for sands than for clays it is unquestionable that soil heterogeneity structure and texture have a strong impact on water infiltration however the presence of heterogeneity due to soil texture including hydrophobicity can in fact exacerbate the effects of the fingering hydrodynamic instability even the presence of soil layering which could be intuitively understood as the most unfavorable configuration for the development of fingering does not prevent the formation and persistence of gravity fingers of course gravity fingering is an instance of the more general phenomenon of preferential flow allaire et al 2009 among the various potential mechanisms for preferential flow much attention has been devoted to the role of macropores that is large pores formed by soil fauna plant roots cracks and fissures and erosion pipes beven and germann 1982 while macropores can be significant drivers of soil water most of the previous work has focused almost exclusively on clayey soil types and humid conditions these are conditions of much less relevance for our proposed study which focuses on the interaction between infiltration and evapotranspiration in arid and semi arid environments in fact direct 3d imaging indicates the prevalence of macropore geometry in preferential flow for clayey soil and fingering for sandy soil heijs et al 1996 several modeling approaches have been proposed to capture the dynamics of infiltration under gravity fingering these include a phase field continuum formulation that reproduces the experimental observations above in 2d cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 cueto felgueroso and juanes 2009 cueto felgueroso et al 2020 and 3d gomez et al 2013 is endowed with an entropy function beljadid et al 2020 and is rooted on the thermodynamics of two phase flow at the pore scale cueto felgueroso and juanes 2012 despite this extensive body of knowledge on the dynamics of fingered flow in the unsaturated zone its impact on evaporation and deep drainage remains unexplored we hypothesize that gravity fingering can lead to bypassing the evaporation in the first few centimeters of soil the transition from compact infiltration to fingered flow could then exert a fundamental control on the partition between evapotranspiration and deep drainage thereby modulating long term recharge in arid and semi arid regions ecosystems hydrologic functions and their resilience to water stress and climatic change here we investigate this question by means of laboratory experiments that couple water infiltration in a fully 3d porous medium with water evaporation under experimental conditions that replicate environmentally relevant climatic rainfall and soil conditions in the field the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present a novel experimental setup which enables the study of infiltration coupled to evaporation whilst providing 3d visualisations of the flow patterns associated with deep drainage section 3 presents an analysis of the finger onset time finger morphology and accumulation rate of water in the porous medium for different climate conditions ranging from humid to semi arid in section 4 we discuss the implications of finger formation on evapotranspiration and the long term effects on water availability in the context of potential global climate shifts 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experimental setup consists of an acrylic cylindrical tube diameter of 15 cm that is packed with dry glass beads particle size d p 0 4 0 6 mm and an approximately gaussian size distribution holtzman et al 2012 to a height of 30 cm as illustrated in fig 1 the cell was vibrated by tapping on it around the sides to ensure a uniform packing the beads are boro silicate glass which is moderately wetting with a contact angle on a flat surface of 50 60 as detailed in the appendix air can escape from the bottom of the cell via a thin slit between the main cell and the bottom plate a rainmaker reproduces seasonal rainfall patterns in our design the rainmaker is a closed acrylic box 15 15 5 cm with 102 needles protruding from the base fig 1 inset although the rainmaker is a rectangular configuration the needles are fixed in a circular pattern to ensure an even distribution across the surface of the glass beads the needles have an internal diameter of 2 mm and are placed with 1 cm spacing to replicate the size and spatial distribution of rain drops villermaux and bossa 2009 a plastic tube was attached to the top of the rainmaker and was connected to a large syringe to simulate rainfall water was drawn up into the box by the syringe through the needles the rainmaker is then placed over the experimental cell precise volumes of water were manually injected over 1 min after which and during the evaporative intervals the rainmaker is removed from the experimental cell the short rain events are alternated with periods of intense sunlight provided by a heat lamp 250 w the volume of rainfall and the interval between rain events were varied the whole cell was placed on a platform which could pivot from its primary location underneath the heat lamp onto a balance the mass of the cell was recorded before the experiment began after each evaporation cycle and after each rain event our experimental setup was designed to avoid disrupting the water air interfaces the mechanism moves in one smooth motion onto and off the balance but measurements during the evaporative period were not taken as they would have interrupted the evaporative process and the movement of the cell could have unduly influenced the transport phenomena furthermore it was the objective of this study to understand and replicate the overall process long term dynamics via many repeating rain cycles as other studies have already focused on the evaporation mechanism itself lehmann et al 2008 it should also be noted that experiments were also conducted without forced evaporation in controlled laboratory conditions as a comparison to the forced evaporation case in order to provide insights into the 3d morphology of the wetting front three disks of nylon mesh with nominal openings of 0 84 mm were inserted into the bead pack during the packing process at 5 15 and 25 cm from the top of the cell the tap water used to mimic rain was dyed with allure red at a concentration of 2 4 g l this high dye concentration was selected so that the fluid created an unambiguous visible stain on the nylon mesh as it passed through at the end of the experiment the mesh disks were removed and used to reconstruct the 3d morphology of the wetting front by analyzing the fluid stains on the mesh cutouts at different depths it was possible to reconstruct the final finger morphology based on a reasonable interpolation for the regions between the mesh in fig 2 one such reconstruction is shown the dark areas represent the actual staining of the mesh by the red dyed fluid and the lighter colors show a probable structure of the finger the bottom of the cell is transparent and by visual inspection it was possible to determine when the front had reached the bottom the end of the experiment is at least 5 rain cycles after the finger reached the bottom of the cell in the field the sun is the driving force controlling pet in the laboratory we substitute this for a heat lamp the lamp selected has a constant output of 250 w and we conducted a calibration to determine that this provides a constant evaporation rate from a free water surface of 38 mm day at a distance of 30 cm this heat source and distance was used for all the experiments so the pet is fixed in our experimental system 2 2 climate and soil conditions different climate conditions can be classified by the aridity index middleton and thomas 1997 which is defined as the ratio of mean annual precipitation map to potential evapotranspiration pet that aggregates maximum evaporation and transpiration if sufficient water were available 1 β map pet table 1 outlines the thresholds of β in the classification of regions of different aridity in this study we reproduce conditions corresponding to semi arid β 0 3 dry sub humid β 0 6 and humid environments β 1 2 early works on the dynamics of gravity fingering have identified key parameters controlling the fingering process hill and parlange 1972 parlange and hill 1976 glass et al 1989 in particular they found that gravity fingering was strongly dependent on the flux ratio r s defined as the ratio of the infiltration rate r f m s to the saturated hydraulic conductivity 2 r s r f k sat where k sat ρ gk μ m s and where ρ kg m3 is the fluid density g m s2 is the gravitational acceleration μ pa s is the fluid viscosity and k m2 is the intrinsic permeability of the porous medium which we estimate using the kozeny carman kozeny 1927 carman 1937 model k d p 2 180 ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 where d p is the mean grain diameter and ϕ is the porosity the value of the permeability estimated by the kozeny carman equation is only an approximation but one that has proven to be sufficient for the type of 3d glass bead packs that we use here dalbe and juanes 2018 in the current experimental system r f plays the role of map in the field rain events are inherently episodic and the duration of a rain event can vary considerably depending on the time of year and geography of a given location especially in semi arid and arid regions snyder and tartowski 2006 in this study we model rainfall episodicity by varying the volume of a rain event v m3 and the time interval between rain events δ t s fig 2 we define the map as 3 map p δ t where p v a is the intensity of the precipitation event and a m2 is the cross sectional area of the cell to select appropriate values of δ t the experimental time must be scaled to the field the characteristic time for water to flow through a given depth of porous medium h assuming fully saturated conditions is 4 t c h ϕ k sat typical values of interest in a field setting wang et al 2007 are k sat 5 m day h 10 m and ϕ 0 45 for which t c field 0 9 days the values in our laboratory experiments are k sat 200 m day using bead size of 0 5 mm h 0 3 m and ϕ 0 4 t c exp 1 2 min therefore 1 day of field time corresponds to 1 min of experimental time we choose a fixed duration of rain events equal to 1 min and vary the time intervals between rain events δ t 10 30 90 and 180 min given δ t one can determine the value of the rainfall precipitation per event p to achieve a given value of the aridity index β table 2 the range of variables explored in our study represents what was feasible in terms of injection volume v and reasonable experiment time constraints the parameter space for our experiment is shown in fig 3 the different climate conditions arid semi arid sub dry humid and humid are shown corresponding to vertical lines of constant values of β used in our study in our study the heat lamp has a fixed output and the distance to the top of the cell was also held fixed across experiments so pet is constant 38 mm d we vary the aridity conditions by varying the average flux ratio r s and the rainfall episodicity by varying the inter event time δ t the 12 conditions investigated experimentally see table 2 are indicated with a symbol 3 results in this section we report the results of our laboratory experiments on gravity fingering in the presence of surface evaporation and without forced evaporation as a comparative case including 1 finger size and morphology 2 onset time of the fingering instability 3 amount of evaporation that takes place and 4 partition between evaporation and deep drainage 3 1 finger size and morphology the finger characteristics have been analyzed exhaustively in studies without evaporation in quasi 2d experiments diment and watson 1985 glass et al 1989 selker et al 1992 selker et al 1992 lu et al 1994 bauters et al 1998 bauters et al 2000 yao and hendrickx 2001 sililo and tellam 2000 flekkøy et al 2002 wang et al 2004 wei et al 2014 and some 3d experiments yao and hendrickx 1996 glass et al 1990 here we study the finger size in the presence of evaporation in all of the 12 cases with or without evaporation one large dominant gravity finger formed once the front becomes unstable the fastest growing finger creates a preferential channel through which most if not all of the fluid drains inhibiting the growth of subsequent fingers in a winner takes all process in fig 4 we show an example of the finger structure obtained from the stains in the nylon mesh cutouts at three different depths from the surface of the bead pack top 5 cm middle 15 cm and bottom 25 cm from the binarized image of the cross sections we determine the area of the finger at each depth in general the largest finger cross section is observed at the top and for the case with evaporation the wetting front has penetrated far enough into the cell and has come in contact with the mesh at several points resulting in a large finger size in the case with evaporation the finger size is larger for small β which indicates that the fluid front extends further into the cell because a greater area of the wetting front contacts the mesh although it was not possible to precisely quantify the depth of the wetting front within the cell we did observe from the outside of the cell that in cases without evaporation the front extended approximately 2 5 cm and with evaporation the front extended approximately 5 cm evaporation itself occurs at a sharp surface but over time the location of this front will propagate downwards into the sand pack if as in this case the evaporation rate outpaces the rate of infiltration gran et al 2011 the depth to which this front extends downwards is often referred to as the evaporative zone and our observation supports the hypothesis that the characteristic length of this zone is determined by soil properties lehmann et al 2008 shokri et al 2010 within this zone less water accumulates near the surface but over time a sufficient amount of water can propagate beyond this zone in order for a saturation overshoot at the wetting front to occur that is responsible for triggering the fingering instability dicarlo 2004 therefore the front propagates deeper into the cell over a longer period of time thus forming the larger finger structure at the top mesh location between the top and the middle slices the front has channelized into one dominant pathway at the middle location the finger area is consistently 5 cm2 as this is controlled primarily by the fluid and porous medium properties both of which are constant in our experiments however if this study were extended to different particle sizes then a trend in finger morphology would be expected accordingly we often observe that the finger is at its smallest size in the middle of the cell and that its area increases as it reaches the bottom suggesting a boundary effect fig 4 a challenging factor to account for is the potential impact of temperature on finger morphology higher temperature which would be expected in the experiments with evaporation would lead to a decrease in both viscosity and surface tension a lower viscosity implies a larger saturated conductivity and in turn a lower flux ratio r s a lower surface tension implies a smaller capillary height both of these trends would result in thinner gravity fingers glass et al 1989 wei et al 2014 beljadid et al 2020 3 2 onset time of gravity fingering after many injection cycles a gravity finger ultimately formed in each of the experiments the onset time is the time of the rain event that triggered the finger it was possible to infer the formation of a gravity finger by a color change at the surface as the fluid drained towards the bottom the top surface of the cell becomes visibly dry and pale once as the finger is formed fig 5 in addition to the color change in the view from the top and to confirm that a finger had formed the bottom of the cell is transparent so the finger could be visualized quickly reaching the bottom of the cell in fig 5 we plot the finger onset time as a function of β for the base case without forced evaporation blue symbols and with forced evaporation red symbols in both cases the onset time increases with decreasing β and the trends follow a nonlinear inverse power law relationship under humid conditions β 2 the onset time is similar for all cases 2 h however the trends between the experiments with and without evaporation diverge as β decreases and the onset time for the case with evaporation is increasingly longer compared to the case without evaporation under semi arid conditions β 0 3 the onset time is 3 times greater for the case with evaporation although further experiments are required this result suggests that at sufficiently arid conditions β 0 gravity fingers will not form indeed at extremely high aridities one expects that all of the rainfall water will evaporate before it can pile up to sufficiently high saturation that it can trigger the fingering instability a condition that is known to be necessary for gravity fingering dicarlo 2004 dicarlo 2007 3 3 evaporation at different aridity indices the mass of the cell was measured at the start of each experiment and then after each rain event and again after every evaporation period where the period of evaporation varied from 10 to 180 min in fig 6 we plot the accumulated water in the cell scaled by the cross sectional area of the cell as a function of time for the system without forced evaporation however this is not a closed system so there was some minimal evaporation to the atmosphere in the ambient laboratory conditions the solid lines indicate the theoretical accumulation assuming a closed system as β decreases the water accumulation is slower the close agreement between the experimental points and the theoretical line for each value of β indicates that indeed the water losses are minimal in the experiments without evaporation and serve as control experiments it should be noted that in the case without forced evaporation the label with the β value is merely an indication to facilitate the comparison with the corresponding experiments with forced evaporation in fig 7 we present the experiments with evaporation grouped by the value of the aridity index β the difference between experimental points and the theoretical line indicates the amount of evaporation that has taken place in the experiments with evaporation for the semi arid conditions β 0 3 and β 0 6 the rate of water accumulation in the system exhibits a dependence on rain inter event time δ t as the interval between rain events lengthens the rate of accumulation decreases indicating increased evaporation in contrast for humid conditions β 1 or β 2 the accumulation rate is independent of δ t to compare these trends more clearly we fit a straight line to the data in figs 6 and 7 before the finger forms and the slope represents the rate of accumulation of water for each case fig 8 shows the accumulation rate for the case without evaporation empty symbols r without and for cases with evaporation filled symbols r with as a function of β for β 1 the rate of change is very similar for different interval times so a single point is plotted for clarity with evaporation in general as β decreases the conditions become dryer and water accumulates in the system at an increasingly slower rate the rate of accumulation for β 0 3 is two orders of magnitude lower than for β 2 we quantify this marked disparity in the system s response by means of the evaporative fraction r defined as the ratio between the rates of mass evaporated and mass infiltrated at the surface before the finger forms 5 r r evap r infil 1 r accum r infil the evaporative fraction for different aridity indices β is shown in fig 8inset 3 4 impact of gravity fingering on evaporation and deep drainage we perform a mass balance throughout the experiment to separate the contribution of infiltrated water to evaporation and to deep drainage before and after the finger forms the time average fraction of infiltrated water that does not evaporate is shown in fig 9 left comparing these fractions before and after the onset of fingering for the different values of β and δ t in the experiments to gain further insight into the impact of gravity fingering on coupled infiltration evaporation we define the deep drainage fraction 6 r dd 1 r r accum r infil as expected r dd increases with increasing β that is as the conditions become more humid because the evaporative fraction is decreasing fig 8 for humid conditions β 1 and 2 the values of r dd before and after the finger forms are very similar indicating that fingering has in these cases a small contribution to the infiltration evaporation dynamics for sufficiently dry conditions β 0 6 and especially 0 3 however we observe a significant increase in r dd from before to after fingering more infiltration water bypasses evaporation and contributes instead to deep drainage to quantify this change in r dd as the system transitions from compact infiltration to fingered infiltration we define 7 δ dd r dd finger r dd compact r dd compact this metric allows us to synthesize the impact of gravity fingering on deep drainage for different climate conditions fig 9right illustrating that even for moderate aridity semi arid conditions gravity fingering results in a fourfold increase in deep drainage 4 discussion and conclusions we have developed a novel experimental strategy to investigate the role of gravity fingering during water infiltration in a 3d porous medium while previous studies had already indicated the prevalence of gravity fingering in the laboratory and in the field here we build on this work to include cycles of rain and periods of evaporation we find that especially in dry conditions gravity fingers exert a powerful control on evapotranspiration our experimental results show that gravity fingering enables infiltration water to bypass the evaporative zone and penetrate deep into the subsurface given that the experimental conditions were designed to reproduce climate conditions in the field these results may have significant implications for the partition between evaporation and deep drainage in water stressed ecosystems in particular we have studied the impact of the aridity index β map pet and the rain episodicity as measured by the inter event time δ t on the coupled infiltration evaporation dynamics we find that for moderately arid climates deep drainage can increase multiple fold in the presence of gravity fingering we also find that this is exacerbated when rain events are more intense and less frequent fig 9 more intense rainfall events between long periods without rainfall e g β 0 3 δ t 90 min results in less evaporation losses and more deep drainage compared to several small rainfall events with short waiting periods between rainfall events e g β 0 3 δ t 30 min these results are consistent with recent field work lehmann et al 2019 who based on lysimeter observations and a surface evaporation capacitor sec model find that deep drainage i e leakage from the capacitor is enhanced for regions with higher rainfall variability and propensity of large rainfall events it has been previously reported that an increase in precipitation variability will shift the subsurface water availability locus from the near surface to greater depth sala et al 2015 this phenomenon has been attributed to the disproportionate increase in the water accumulation at depth following large volumes of rainfall where ideas such as soil memory have been proposed to explain how soil water saturation profiles persist long after the rain event sala et al 2015 our experimental results provide a mechanistic explanation for this effect and show that the longer between rain events and the larger the volume of rainfall the greater the effect on deep drainage fig 9 albeit after a longer onset time fig 5 soil memory is furnished by flow channeling where future rainfall events have a higher probability of feeding wet soil via established gravity fingers thus allowing for faster deep percolation although our study makes some important simplifications for example we do not account for surface runoff and vegetation it highlights that the emergence of subsurface channelization of rainwater can impact water resources to a degree and on a timescale of ecosystem relevance our results therefore suggest that the subtle interplay between gravity fingering and evapotranspiration may be essential to explain the structure and resilience of water stressed ecosystems influencing their response to climate variability plain language summary the movement of water through soil is a fundamental process of the hydrologic cycle determining the partition of infiltrated water into evaporation uptake by plant roots and deep drainage into groundwater reserves here we use a novel experimental method to study coupled infiltration evaporation in a 3d porous medium reproducing field conditions of aridity and rainfall episodicity we show that evaporation is hindered and deep drainage significantly enhanced by the formation of gravity fingers preferential columnar paths that allow water to percolate quickly in subsequent rainfall events thus bypassing the evaporative zone in the soil these findings explain previously hypothesized soil memory effects in arid regions and suggest that fingered infiltration may be a critical determinant

3263,water infiltration in soils is a fundamental hydrologic process that determines the water availability for plant roots and the rate of recharge to deep groundwater bodies when both the initial water saturation of the soil and the water infiltration rate is low the infiltration front becomes unstable resulting in gravity fingers that act as preferential flow channels preferential flow may allow for the rapid bypass of water through the evaporation zone thereby promoting deep drainage of water into the subsoil even in arid and semi arid regions where the potential evapotranspiration pet is high and the mean annual precipitation map is low here we investigate experimentally the impact of gravity fingering on deep drainage coupled with surface evaporation in a 3d porous medium we use a cylindrical vessel packed with dry glass beads and reproduce seasonal climatic patterns consisting of relatively short rainfall events alternating with periods of intense evaporation we vary the volume of rainfall events and the interval between rainfall events to replicate climate conditions we record the mass of water in the system throughout the experiment and determine the partition between evaporation and deep drainage before and after the onset of fingering we find that in semi arid conditions the fraction of water that bypasses the evaporation zone increases fourfold after gravity fingering starts this finding has potentially important implications for understanding infiltration dynamics in arid environments and ecosystems response in regions susceptible to desertification keywords infiltration gravity fingering deep drainage evaporation ecohydrology 1 introduction understanding the subsurface percolation of rainwater is of critical importance to the long term availability of water resources the interplay between climate soil moisture and vegetation determines the sustainability of the water and nutrient cycles on which biodiversity and human

determining the availability of the water in the earth s critical zone rodriguez iturbe 2000 in the hydrologic cycle rainfall will either flow over the land as surface runoff return to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration or infiltrate deep into the ground reaching deep root systems and recharging aquifers horton 1933 hillel 1980 allison et al 1994 sophocleous 2002 we chose the term deep drainage as it seems to be the most commonly accepted term in hydrology seyfried et al 2005 eilers et al 2007 wohling et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 li et al 2019 to denote the flux of water that moves through the unsaturated zone past the root zone and may become recharge after a lag time to determine the partitioning of water the convention is to conduct a soil water balance rodriguez iturbe et al 2001 rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 small 2005 a critical but poorly understood question is how partitioning depends on the hydrodynamics of infiltrated water and soil infiltration patterns here we investigate the impact of gravity fingering a widely observed instability that takes place during infiltration in relatively dry soil hill and parlange 1972 glass et al 1989 ritsema et al 1998 this instability has been documented in the field ritsema and dekker 1994 hendrickx and flury 2001 and has been extensively characterized in quasi 2d laboratory experiments diment and watson 1985 glass et al 1989 selker et al 1992 selker et al 1992 lu et al 1994 bauters et al 1998 bauters et al 2000 yao and hendrickx 2001 sililo and tellam 2000 flekkøy et al 2002 wang et al 2004 wei et al 2014 and some 3d experiments yao and hendrickx 1996 glass et al 1990 some of the key features of fingered flow are 1 presence of saturation overshoot that is the pile up of water at the infiltration front which is understood to be a prerequisite for the fingering instability in unsaturated flows dicarlo 2004 egorov et al 2003 nieber et al 2005 dicarlo 2007 cueto felgueroso and juanes 2009 2 winner takes all behavior in which the fastest growing fingers channelize most of the flow and the growth of other incipient fingers is thereby suppressed glass et al 1989 selker et al 1992 3 robustness of the instability with respect to the heterogeneity of the medium cremer et al 2019 sililo and tellam 2000 cueto felgueroso et al 2020 4 strong dependence on the infiltration flux indicating that stable fronts are observed in dry media when the infiltration rate is either very small or approaches the saturated conductivity hendrickx and yao 1996 in general larger infiltration rates produce faster thicker fingers glass et al 1989 5 fingering is promoted when the medium is quite dry even relatively low water saturations lead to a compact downward moving wetting front lu et al 1994 bauters et al 2000 experimental work has shown that the fingering instability is expected to be more vigorous for coarse soils for two reasons importance of gravity vs capillary forces and because the soil retention curve and unsaturated conductivity are often sharper more nonlinear for sands than for clays it is unquestionable that soil heterogeneity structure and texture have a strong impact on water infiltration however the presence of heterogeneity due to soil texture including hydrophobicity can in fact exacerbate the effects of the fingering hydrodynamic instability even the presence of soil layering which could be intuitively understood as the most unfavorable configuration for the development of fingering does not prevent the formation and persistence of gravity fingers of course gravity fingering is an instance of the more general phenomenon of preferential flow allaire et al 2009 among the various potential mechanisms for preferential flow much attention has been devoted to the role of macropores that is large pores formed by soil fauna plant roots cracks and fissures and erosion pipes beven and germann 1982 while macropores can be significant drivers of soil water most of the previous work has focused almost exclusively on clayey soil types and humid conditions these are conditions of much less relevance for our proposed study which focuses on the interaction between infiltration and evapotranspiration in arid and semi arid environments in fact direct 3d imaging indicates the prevalence of macropore geometry in preferential flow for clayey soil and fingering for sandy soil heijs et al 1996 several modeling approaches have been proposed to capture the dynamics of infiltration under gravity fingering these include a phase field continuum formulation that reproduces the experimental observations above in 2d cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 cueto felgueroso and juanes 2009 cueto felgueroso et al 2020 and 3d gomez et al 2013 is endowed with an entropy function beljadid et al 2020 and is rooted on the thermodynamics of two phase flow at the pore scale cueto felgueroso and juanes 2012 despite this extensive body of knowledge on the dynamics of fingered flow in the unsaturated zone its impact on evaporation and deep drainage remains unexplored we hypothesize that gravity fingering can lead to bypassing the evaporation in the first few centimeters of soil the transition from compact infiltration to fingered flow could then exert a fundamental control on the partition between evapotranspiration and deep drainage thereby modulating long term recharge in arid and semi arid regions ecosystems hydrologic functions and their resilience to water stress and climatic change here we investigate this question by means of laboratory experiments that couple water infiltration in a fully 3d porous medium with water evaporation under experimental conditions that replicate environmentally relevant climatic rainfall and soil conditions in the field the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present a novel experimental setup which enables the study of infiltration coupled to evaporation whilst providing 3d visualisations of the flow patterns associated with deep drainage section 3 presents an analysis of the finger onset time finger morphology and accumulation rate of water in the porous medium for different climate conditions ranging from humid to semi arid in section 4 we discuss the implications of finger formation on evapotranspiration and the long term effects on water availability in the context of potential global climate shifts 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experimental setup consists of an acrylic cylindrical tube diameter of 15 cm that is packed with dry glass beads particle size d p 0 4 0 6 mm and an approximately gaussian size distribution holtzman et al 2012 to a height of 30 cm as illustrated in fig 1 the cell was vibrated by tapping on it around the sides to ensure a uniform packing the beads are boro silicate glass which is moderately wetting with a contact angle on a flat surface of 50 60 as detailed in the appendix air can escape from the bottom of the cell via a thin slit between the main cell and the bottom plate a rainmaker reproduces seasonal rainfall patterns in our design the rainmaker is a closed acrylic box 15 15 5 cm with 102 needles protruding from the base fig 1 inset although the rainmaker is a rectangular configuration the needles are fixed in a circular pattern to ensure an even distribution across the surface of the glass beads the needles have an internal diameter of 2 mm and are placed with 1 cm spacing to replicate the size and spatial distribution of rain drops villermaux and bossa 2009 a plastic tube was attached to the top of the rainmaker and was connected to a large syringe to simulate rainfall water was drawn up into the box by the syringe through the needles the rainmaker is then placed over the experimental cell precise volumes of water were manually injected over 1 min after which and during the evaporative intervals the rainmaker is removed from the experimental cell the short rain events are alternated with periods of intense sunlight provided by a heat lamp 250 w the volume of rainfall and the interval between rain events were varied the whole cell was placed on a platform which could pivot from its primary location underneath the heat lamp onto a balance the mass of the cell was recorded before the experiment began after each evaporation cycle and after each rain event our experimental setup was designed to avoid disrupting the water air interfaces the mechanism moves in one smooth motion onto and off the balance but measurements during the evaporative period were not taken as they would have interrupted the evaporative process and the movement of the cell could have unduly influenced the transport phenomena furthermore it was the objective of this study to understand and replicate the overall process long term dynamics via many repeating rain cycles as other studies have already focused on the evaporation mechanism itself lehmann et al 2008 it should also be noted that experiments were also conducted without forced evaporation in controlled laboratory conditions as a comparison to the forced evaporation case in order to provide insights into the 3d morphology of the wetting front three disks of nylon mesh with nominal openings of 0 84 mm were inserted into the bead pack during the packing process at 5 15 and 25 cm from the top of the cell the tap water used to mimic rain was dyed with allure red at a concentration of 2 4 g l this high dye concentration was selected so that the fluid created an unambiguous visible stain on the nylon mesh as it passed through at the end of the experiment the mesh disks were removed and used to reconstruct the 3d morphology of the wetting front by analyzing the fluid stains on the mesh cutouts at different depths it was possible to reconstruct the final finger morphology based on a reasonable interpolation for the regions between the mesh in fig 2 one such reconstruction is shown the dark areas represent the actual staining of the mesh by the red dyed fluid and the lighter colors show a probable structure of the finger the bottom of the cell is transparent and by visual inspection it was possible to determine when the front had reached the bottom the end of the experiment is at least 5 rain cycles after the finger reached the bottom of the cell in the field the sun is the driving force controlling pet in the laboratory we substitute this for a heat lamp the lamp selected has a constant output of 250 w and we conducted a calibration to determine that this provides a constant evaporation rate from a free water surface of 38 mm day at a distance of 30 cm this heat source and distance was used for all the experiments so the pet is fixed in our experimental system 2 2 climate and soil conditions different climate conditions can be classified by the aridity index middleton and thomas 1997 which is defined as the ratio of mean annual precipitation map to potential evapotranspiration pet that aggregates maximum evaporation and transpiration if sufficient water were available 1 β map pet table 1 outlines the thresholds of β in the classification of regions of different aridity in this study we reproduce conditions corresponding to semi arid β 0 3 dry sub humid β 0 6 and humid environments β 1 2 early works on the dynamics of gravity fingering have identified key parameters controlling the fingering process hill and parlange 1972 parlange and hill 1976 glass et al 1989 in particular they found that gravity fingering was strongly dependent on the flux ratio r s defined as the ratio of the infiltration rate r f m s to the saturated hydraulic conductivity 2 r s r f k sat where k sat ρ gk μ m s and where ρ kg m3 is the fluid density g m s2 is the gravitational acceleration μ pa s is the fluid viscosity and k m2 is the intrinsic permeability of the porous medium which we estimate using the kozeny carman kozeny 1927 carman 1937 model k d p 2 180 ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 where d p is the mean grain diameter and ϕ is the porosity the value of the permeability estimated by the kozeny carman equation is only an approximation but one that has proven to be sufficient for the type of 3d glass bead packs that we use here dalbe and juanes 2018 in the current experimental system r f plays the role of map in the field rain events are inherently episodic and the duration of a rain event can vary considerably depending on the time of year and geography of a given location especially in semi arid and arid regions snyder and tartowski 2006 in this study we model rainfall episodicity by varying the volume of a rain event v m3 and the time interval between rain events δ t s fig 2 we define the map as 3 map p δ t where p v a is the intensity of the precipitation event and a m2 is the cross sectional area of the cell to select appropriate values of δ t the experimental time must be scaled to the field the characteristic time for water to flow through a given depth of porous medium h assuming fully saturated conditions is 4 t c h ϕ k sat typical values of interest in a field setting wang et al 2007 are k sat 5 m day h 10 m and ϕ 0 45 for which t c field 0 9 days the values in our laboratory experiments are k sat 200 m day using bead size of 0 5 mm h 0 3 m and ϕ 0 4 t c exp 1 2 min therefore 1 day of field time corresponds to 1 min of experimental time we choose a fixed duration of rain events equal to 1 min and vary the time intervals between rain events δ t 10 30 90 and 180 min given δ t one can determine the value of the rainfall precipitation per event p to achieve a given value of the aridity index β table 2 the range of variables explored in our study represents what was feasible in terms of injection volume v and reasonable experiment time constraints the parameter space for our experiment is shown in fig 3 the different climate conditions arid semi arid sub dry humid and humid are shown corresponding to vertical lines of constant values of β used in our study in our study the heat lamp has a fixed output and the distance to the top of the cell was also held fixed across experiments so pet is constant 38 mm d we vary the aridity conditions by varying the average flux ratio r s and the rainfall episodicity by varying the inter event time δ t the 12 conditions investigated experimentally see table 2 are indicated with a symbol 3 results in this section we report the results of our laboratory experiments on gravity fingering in the presence of surface evaporation and without forced evaporation as a comparative case including 1 finger size and morphology 2 onset time of the fingering instability 3 amount of evaporation that takes place and 4 partition between evaporation and deep drainage 3 1 finger size and morphology the finger characteristics have been analyzed exhaustively in studies without evaporation in quasi 2d experiments diment and watson 1985 glass et al 1989 selker et al 1992 selker et al 1992 lu et al 1994 bauters et al 1998 bauters et al 2000 yao and hendrickx 2001 sililo and tellam 2000 flekkøy et al 2002 wang et al 2004 wei et al 2014 and some 3d experiments yao and hendrickx 1996 glass et al 1990 here we study the finger size in the presence of evaporation in all of the 12 cases with or without evaporation one large dominant gravity finger formed once the front becomes unstable the fastest growing finger creates a preferential channel through which most if not all of the fluid drains inhibiting the growth of subsequent fingers in a winner takes all process in fig 4 we show an example of the finger structure obtained from the stains in the nylon mesh cutouts at three different depths from the surface of the bead pack top 5 cm middle 15 cm and bottom 25 cm from the binarized image of the cross sections we determine the area of the finger at each depth in general the largest finger cross section is observed at the top and for the case with evaporation the wetting front has penetrated far enough into the cell and has come in contact with the mesh at several points resulting in a large finger size in the case with evaporation the finger size is larger for small β which indicates that the fluid front extends further into the cell because a greater area of the wetting front contacts the mesh although it was not possible to precisely quantify the depth of the wetting front within the cell we did observe from the outside of the cell that in cases without evaporation the front extended approximately 2 5 cm and with evaporation the front extended approximately 5 cm evaporation itself occurs at a sharp surface but over time the location of this front will propagate downwards into the sand pack if as in this case the evaporation rate outpaces the rate of infiltration gran et al 2011 the depth to which this front extends downwards is often referred to as the evaporative zone and our observation supports the hypothesis that the characteristic length of this zone is determined by soil properties lehmann et al 2008 shokri et al 2010 within this zone less water accumulates near the surface but over time a sufficient amount of water can propagate beyond this zone in order for a saturation overshoot at the wetting front to occur that is responsible for triggering the fingering instability dicarlo 2004 therefore the front propagates deeper into the cell over a longer period of time thus forming the larger finger structure at the top mesh location between the top and the middle slices the front has channelized into one dominant pathway at the middle location the finger area is consistently 5 cm2 as this is controlled primarily by the fluid and porous medium properties both of which are constant in our experiments however if this study were extended to different particle sizes then a trend in finger morphology would be expected accordingly we often observe that the finger is at its smallest size in the middle of the cell and that its area increases as it reaches the bottom suggesting a boundary effect fig 4 a challenging factor to account for is the potential impact of temperature on finger morphology higher temperature which would be expected in the experiments with evaporation would lead to a decrease in both viscosity and surface tension a lower viscosity implies a larger saturated conductivity and in turn a lower flux ratio r s a lower surface tension implies a smaller capillary height both of these trends would result in thinner gravity fingers glass et al 1989 wei et al 2014 beljadid et al 2020 3 2 onset time of gravity fingering after many injection cycles a gravity finger ultimately formed in each of the experiments the onset time is the time of the rain event that triggered the finger it was possible to infer the formation of a gravity finger by a color change at the surface as the fluid drained towards the bottom the top surface of the cell becomes visibly dry and pale once as the finger is formed fig 5 in addition to the color change in the view from the top and to confirm that a finger had formed the bottom of the cell is transparent so the finger could be visualized quickly reaching the bottom of the cell in fig 5 we plot the finger onset time as a function of β for the base case without forced evaporation blue symbols and with forced evaporation red symbols in both cases the onset time increases with decreasing β and the trends follow a nonlinear inverse power law relationship under humid conditions β 2 the onset time is similar for all cases 2 h however the trends between the experiments with and without evaporation diverge as β decreases and the onset time for the case with evaporation is increasingly longer compared to the case without evaporation under semi arid conditions β 0 3 the onset time is 3 times greater for the case with evaporation although further experiments are required this result suggests that at sufficiently arid conditions β 0 gravity fingers will not form indeed at extremely high aridities one expects that all of the rainfall water will evaporate before it can pile up to sufficiently high saturation that it can trigger the fingering instability a condition that is known to be necessary for gravity fingering dicarlo 2004 dicarlo 2007 3 3 evaporation at different aridity indices the mass of the cell was measured at the start of each experiment and then after each rain event and again after every evaporation period where the period of evaporation varied from 10 to 180 min in fig 6 we plot the accumulated water in the cell scaled by the cross sectional area of the cell as a function of time for the system without forced evaporation however this is not a closed system so there was some minimal evaporation to the atmosphere in the ambient laboratory conditions the solid lines indicate the theoretical accumulation assuming a closed system as β decreases the water accumulation is slower the close agreement between the experimental points and the theoretical line for each value of β indicates that indeed the water losses are minimal in the experiments without evaporation and serve as control experiments it should be noted that in the case without forced evaporation the label with the β value is merely an indication to facilitate the comparison with the corresponding experiments with forced evaporation in fig 7 we present the experiments with evaporation grouped by the value of the aridity index β the difference between experimental points and the theoretical line indicates the amount of evaporation that has taken place in the experiments with evaporation for the semi arid conditions β 0 3 and β 0 6 the rate of water accumulation in the system exhibits a dependence on rain inter event time δ t as the interval between rain events lengthens the rate of accumulation decreases indicating increased evaporation in contrast for humid conditions β 1 or β 2 the accumulation rate is independent of δ t to compare these trends more clearly we fit a straight line to the data in figs 6 and 7 before the finger forms and the slope represents the rate of accumulation of water for each case fig 8 shows the accumulation rate for the case without evaporation empty symbols r without and for cases with evaporation filled symbols r with as a function of β for β 1 the rate of change is very similar for different interval times so a single point is plotted for clarity with evaporation in general as β decreases the conditions become dryer and water accumulates in the system at an increasingly slower rate the rate of accumulation for β 0 3 is two orders of magnitude lower than for β 2 we quantify this marked disparity in the system s response by means of the evaporative fraction r defined as the ratio between the rates of mass evaporated and mass infiltrated at the surface before the finger forms 5 r r evap r infil 1 r accum r infil the evaporative fraction for different aridity indices β is shown in fig 8inset 3 4 impact of gravity fingering on evaporation and deep drainage we perform a mass balance throughout the experiment to separate the contribution of infiltrated water to evaporation and to deep drainage before and after the finger forms the time average fraction of infiltrated water that does not evaporate is shown in fig 9 left comparing these fractions before and after the onset of fingering for the different values of β and δ t in the experiments to gain further insight into the impact of gravity fingering on coupled infiltration evaporation we define the deep drainage fraction 6 r dd 1 r r accum r infil as expected r dd increases with increasing β that is as the conditions become more humid because the evaporative fraction is decreasing fig 8 for humid conditions β 1 and 2 the values of r dd before and after the finger forms are very similar indicating that fingering has in these cases a small contribution to the infiltration evaporation dynamics for sufficiently dry conditions β 0 6 and especially 0 3 however we observe a significant increase in r dd from before to after fingering more infiltration water bypasses evaporation and contributes instead to deep drainage to quantify this change in r dd as the system transitions from compact infiltration to fingered infiltration we define 7 δ dd r dd finger r dd compact r dd compact this metric allows us to synthesize the impact of gravity fingering on deep drainage for different climate conditions fig 9right illustrating that even for moderate aridity semi arid conditions gravity fingering results in a fourfold increase in deep drainage 4 discussion and conclusions we have developed a novel experimental strategy to investigate the role of gravity fingering during water infiltration in a 3d porous medium while previous studies had already indicated the prevalence of gravity fingering in the laboratory and in the field here we build on this work to include cycles of rain and periods of evaporation we find that especially in dry conditions gravity fingers exert a powerful control on evapotranspiration our experimental results show that gravity fingering enables infiltration water to bypass the evaporative zone and penetrate deep into the subsurface given that the experimental conditions were designed to reproduce climate conditions in the field these results may have significant implications for the partition between evaporation and deep drainage in water stressed ecosystems in particular we have studied the impact of the aridity index β map pet and the rain episodicity as measured by the inter event time δ t on the coupled infiltration evaporation dynamics we find that for moderately arid climates deep drainage can increase multiple fold in the presence of gravity fingering we also find that this is exacerbated when rain events are more intense and less frequent fig 9 more intense rainfall events between long periods without rainfall e g β 0 3 δ t 90 min results in less evaporation losses and more deep drainage compared to several small rainfall events with short waiting periods between rainfall events e g β 0 3 δ t 30 min these results are consistent with recent field work lehmann et al 2019 who based on lysimeter observations and a surface evaporation capacitor sec model find that deep drainage i e leakage from the capacitor is enhanced for regions with higher rainfall variability and propensity of large rainfall events it has been previously reported that an increase in precipitation variability will shift the subsurface water availability locus from the near surface to greater depth sala et al 2015 this phenomenon has been attributed to the disproportionate increase in the water accumulation at depth following large volumes of rainfall where ideas such as soil memory have been proposed to explain how soil water saturation profiles persist long after the rain event sala et al 2015 our experimental results provide a mechanistic explanation for this effect and show that the longer between rain events and the larger the volume of rainfall the greater the effect on deep drainage fig 9 albeit after a longer onset time fig 5 soil memory is furnished by flow channeling where future rainfall events have a higher probability of feeding wet soil via established gravity fingers thus allowing for faster deep percolation although our study makes some important simplifications for example we do not account for surface runoff and vegetation it highlights that the emergence of subsurface channelization of rainwater can impact water resources to a degree and on a timescale of ecosystem relevance our results therefore suggest that the subtle interplay between gravity fingering and evapotranspiration may be essential to explain the structure and resilience of water stressed ecosystems influencing their response to climate variability plain language summary the movement of water through soil is a fundamental process of the hydrologic cycle determining the partition of infiltrated water into evaporation uptake by plant roots and deep drainage into groundwater reserves here we use a novel experimental method to study coupled infiltration evaporation in a 3d porous medium reproducing field conditions of aridity and rainfall episodicity we show that evaporation is hindered and deep drainage significantly enhanced by the formation of gravity fingers preferential columnar paths that allow water to percolate quickly in subsequent rainfall events thus bypassing the evaporative zone in the soil these findings explain previously hypothesized soil memory effects in arid regions and suggest that fingered infiltration may be a critical determinant

3264,accurate dryness monitoring is important for formulating reasonable response measures to reduce social and economic losses caused by drought the land surface temperature lst shortwave infrared swir reflectance and vegetation index vi are popular remote sensing rs indices that can be individually used to characterize surface dryness given the interactions of these factors limitations are inevitably associated with using a single factor integrated dryness indices that combine lst or swir reflectance with the vi have thus been successively proposed and applied for dryness monitoring and soil moisture sm retrieval work however the advantages of these three indicators have not yet been combined to construct a more comprehensive dryness index in this study we integrated the lst enhanced

karthikeyan et al 2020 amani et al 2017 javed et al 2021 oikonomou et al 2019 in recent decades many parts of the world have experienced increasing numbers of droughts and extreme heatwave events koster et al 2009 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 chen et al 2019 global warming trends are expected to increase the intensity and frequency of droughts and heatwaves hao et al 2017 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 caracciolo et al 2016 sánchez et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 droughts have always been costly disasters in the continental united states conus from 1980 to 2017 economic losses caused by droughts in the united states totaled over 239 billion noaa 2016 therefore the accurate assessment of surface dryness and drought status is essential for preventing and reducing losses caused by droughts both dryness and drought are caused by a lack of water and can represent water shortage situations in particular areas at particular times but they differ slightly amani et al 2017 wei et al 2020 surface dryness is the natural deficit of soil moisture sm caused by low precipitation high land surface temperature lst and high evapotranspiration et li et al 2017 drought is a relatively complex event that is generally categorized into four types meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought zargar et al 2011 livada and assimakopoulos 2007 however all drought types occur after a period of dryness which can range from a week to a few years wilhite et al 2019 zargar et al 2011 therefore if an index is used to analyze the lack of surface sm it can be considered a dryness index if a dryness index is introduced to estimate surface dryness over a period of time it can also be regarded as a drought index wei et al 2020 amani et al 2017 satellite remote sensing rs technology provides a new method for comprehensively characterizing regional and global dryness and drought conditions in areas with limited sampling gauges rs may be the only available data source alijanian et al 2019 satellite based dryness indices are primarily based on the sm related electromagnetic radiation spectrum vegetation indices vis and lst etc feng et al 2013 zhang and jia 2013 zormand et al 2017 many satellite based dryness indices based only on a single variable have been proposed for instance kogan 1995a b developed the temperature condition index tci based only on the lst and then proposed the vegetation condition index vci based only on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi moreover the modified perpendicular dryness index mpdi ghulam et al 2007a and perpendicular dryness index pdi ghulam et al 2007b were established based only on the red and near infrared nir bands of the sm related electromagnetic radiation spectrum the modified shortwave infrared perpendicular drought index mspdi was developed based only on the shortwave infrared swir and red bands of the sm related electromagnetic radiation spectrum feng et al 2013 however in most cases the complete characterization of dryness and drought requires simultaneous information about several critical variables wang et al 2001 wardlow et al 2012 amani et al 2017 jiao et al 2016 wang et al 2020 sánchez et al 2016 by integrating the lst and ndvi researchers developed the vegetation temperature condition index vtci wang et al 2001 and the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi sandholt et al 2002 these integrated dryness indices which consider two variables outperform dryness indices based only on one variable for instance ge et al 2018 reported that the correlation between the tvdi and sm 0 10 cm is 30 higher than that between the pdi and sm for swamplands studies have found that dryness indices including more critical variables are useful for dryness assessments sánchez et al 2016 amani et al 2017 amani et al 2017 proposed a temperature vegetation soil moisture dryness index tvmdi that combined lst the sm index and the perpendicular vegetation index pvi amani et al 2017 reported that the correlation between the tvmdi and in situ sm is 20 higher than that between the tvdi and in situ sm integrated dryness indices including two or three variables outperform those considering only one variable however complex mathematical calculations and time consuming image preprocessing procedures are required for several of the popular integrated indices for instance tvmdi calculations require knowledge of the soil line equation due to differences in soil lines among different soil types inconsistencies may occur in dryness index applications amani et al 2017 for the tvdi the slope and intercept between lst and vi spaces must be determined due to significant variations in ambient atmospheric parameters over different times it is impossible to define universal slope and intercept parameters for the tvdi parameterization and readjustment are required for each individual observation date ghulam et al 2007a sandholt et al 2002 sadeghi et al 2017 which limits the application of the tvdi sadeghi et al 2017 developed the optical trapezoid model optram by replacing lst with swir reflectance to improve the tvdi the parameters of the optram are shown to remain unchanged over time and the model has broad prospects in sm retrieval and dryness monitoring applications dryness indices mostly assess a lack of sm swir reflectance the vi and lst are commonly used rs variables that can indirectly indicate the sm status at present each of these variables has been used to characterize the dryness in addition dryness indices combining lst or swir reflectance with the vi have also been developed for dryness monitoring and sm retrieval work however the integration of the advantages of these three variables to construct a more comprehensive and easy to operate dryness index has not yet been conducted in this study we developed an integrated satellite based dryness index with simple calculations called the temperature vegetation shortwave infrared reflectance dryness index tvsdi the index is based only on the euclidean distance equations of three variables lst enhanced vegetation index evi and swir reflectance the main objective of this study was to establish and assess this new dryness index in the conus 2 study area and data 2 1 study area this study was mainly conducted in the conus according to statistics from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental information ncei drought is the second most costly climate disaster in the conus www ncdc noaa gov billions moreover there are many in situ sm and meteorological monitoring sites distributed across the conus covering different topographic features land cover types and climate types these conditions provide opportunities for developing and thoroughly evaluating this new dryness index 2 2 data and processing 2 2 1 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data in this study the mod11a1 mod11a2 mod09ga and mod09a1 products were mainly used to construct the proposed dryness index the tvsdi table 1 provides detailed information about the modis products used in this study these products are provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and can be obtained from the google earth engine gee platform https developers google com earth engine datasets these modis products were first atmospherically corrected and preprocessed to account for the removal of interferences from clouds water cloud shadows and heavy aerosols then they were reprojected onto the wgs 84 geographic coordinate system in addition the nearest neighbor resampling method lillesand et al 2015 was used to resample the spatial resolution of mod09ga and mod09a1 from the original 500 to 1000 m 2 2 2 soil moisture active passive level 3 smap l3 enhanced passive ep product the smap l3 ep sm product was mainly used to demonstrate the distribution of the tvsdi in three dimensional 3 d space lst swir evi as well as to provide a spatial reference for evaluating tvsdi maps smap sm products are popular references for sm observations and drought monitoring at regional and global scales entekhabi et al 2010 smap satellites use the l band radiometer which can penetrate moderate vegetation coverage and is not affected by cloud cover day or night conditions to detect land surface 0 5 cm sm the

types in the conus http cosmos hwr arizona edu were used to evaluate the robustness and universality of tvsdi applications in various geographic regions in situ sm data are the most common reference used to evaluate satellite based dryness indices amani et al 2017 babaeian et al 2018 ghulam et al 2007a b sandholt et al 2002 the crnp uses cosmic ray neutron technology to detect the average sm value each hour within the site footprint range approximately 400 670 m in diameter stevanato et al 2019 duygu and akyurek 2019 compared to traditional methods that acquire sm values at point scales the crnp detects the average sm over a relatively large footprint range which matches well with the spatial resolution of modis i e 500 1000 m footprint however unlike the satellite observations that provide land surface information 0 5 cm the crnp acquires sm value with vertical sampling depths ranging from nearly 15 cm water saturated to approximately 70 cm extremely dry soils as described by duygu and akyurek 2019 and stevanato et al 2019 despite the depth mismatch the use of crnp is still an effective way to bridge the scale gap between large scale rs observations and ground measurements

standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 were used to evaluate the spatiotemporal consistency between the proposed tvsdi and the meteorological dryness indices many studies have used meteorological dryness indices to evaluate satellite based dryness indices schmidt et al 2020 javed et al 2021 sandeep et al 2021 the spi and spei spatial data used in this study are derived from the daily 4 km gridmet dataset spi and spei data are available at multiple time scales including 14 days 30 days 90 days 180 days 270 days 1 year 2 years and 5 years abatzoglou 2013 the spi and spei correspond to the temporal aggregate of standardized precipitation and precipitation minus the reference et respectively the gridmet dataset is provided by the university of california merced and is available at https www climatologylab org gridmet html 2 2 5 united states drought monitor usdm maps the usdm maps were used to provide a spatial reference for visual comparison with the tvsdi maps the usdm maps are commonly used to describe the extent of drought in the conus lu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 and are generated by professionals who combine several data sources such as surface flow sm precipitation temperature anomalies crops and local expert reports to determine weekly drought situations svoboda et al 2002 therefore usdm maps are mixtures of multisource data and many indicators they are not strictly quantitative products but are combinations of science and subjectivity detailed information about usdm maps can be obtained from the national drought mitigation center https drought unl edu 2 2 6 yearly modis land cover type product mcd12q1 data the mcd12q1 version 6 product was used to present the major land cover types in the conus the product was created primarily by

in which the evaluation and application of the tvsdi are the two core parts the tvsdi is thoroughly evaluated mainly from four aspects and the application part analyzes dryness wetness patterns in the conus at monthly and yearly scales using the proposed tvsdi 3 1 satellite based dryness indices 3 1 1 red nir spectral space the scatterplot of pixel values derived from satellite images with differing land coverages in the red nir reflectance space map forms a triangular area the shaded area in fig 2 which is the basis for several dryness indices a brief explanation of this triangular feature and its mathematical description is provided below when a point moves along the ad line in fig 2 the surface vegetation coverage varies from complete cover point a to fractional cover point e and then to noncovered bare soil point d point b represents wet soil while point c indicates extremely dry soil the bc line also known as the soil line is expressed as follows baret jacquemoud and hanocq 1993 1 r nir m r red i where rnir and rred are the reflectance of the nir and the red band respectively i and m are the intercept and slope of line bc respectively 3 1 2 pdi the lines parallel to line bc in fig 2 are used to construct the pdi the pdi value can be calculated by computing the vertical distance from line ed to line fl i e the length of line ef for a randomly selected point e in the red nir reflectance plane the length of line ef is positively correlated with drought intensity and negatively correlated with sm content the pdi is expressed as follows ghulam et al 2007b 2 p d i 1 m 2 1 r red m r nir 3 1 3 mpdi to minimize the vegetation effect on the sm calculation and improve the performance of the pdi ghulam et al 2007a proposed the mpdi which is expressed as follows 3 m p d i r red m r nir f v r v r e d m r v n i r 1 f v m 2 1 where rv red and rv nir are constant 0 5 and 0 05 respectively and represent the reflectance values of the red and the nir band of healthy green vegetation respectively eqs 4 and 5 can be used to obtain the ndvi rouse et al 1974 and vegetation fraction fv li 2003 4 n d v i r nir r red r nir r red 5 f v ndvi ndvi veg ndvi veg ndvi soil where ndvi soil refers to the minimum pixel value of the pure soil which is theoretically close to 0 ndvi veg is the maximum pixel value of the pure vegetation which is theoretically close to 1 3 1 4 tvdi the tvdi was developed mainly based on the lst vi triangular space fig 3 sandholt et al 2002 and its expression is as follows 6 t v d i lst lst min lst max lst min 7 lst max a b v i 8 lst min c d v i where lst min and lst max represents the minimum and maximum values of lst for a given vi and a and b are the dry edge s intercept and slope respectively and c and d are the wet edge s intercept and slope respectively 3 1 5 tvmdi amani et al 2017 developed the tvmdi by combining three indicators lst the sm index eq 9 and the pvi eq 10 9 sm r nir r red m 0 082 1 1 m 2 10 p v i r nir m r red i 1 m 2 11 t v m d i n o r m a l i z e d l s t 2 n o r m a l i z e d s m 2 3 3 n o r m a l i z e d p v i 2 where the lst sm index and pvi are normalized between 0 and 3 3 using the normalized equation eq 12 thereby placing the dryness values between 0 and 1 12 n o r m a l i z e d z i z i min z max z min z 3 3 where z is one of the three variables pvi sm or lst and zi is the ith value in z z1 z2 zn 3 1 6 tvsdi sm directly affects surface dryness vegetation status swir reflectance and lst can affect sm and thus can be indirectly used to represent dryness moreover these three variables are interrelated and can collectively reflect the sm generally when the sm is sufficient the amount of water available for vegetation growth increases vegetation grows vigorously high vi values and the leaves stomata open leading to a decrease in the surface temperature the swir reflectance decreases with increasing vegetation water and sm content which indicates a lower surface dryness risk therefore these three variables were used to construct a 3 d dryness index to construct the 3 d tvsdi we set the swir reflectance axis perpendicular to the 2d lst vi plane as shown in fig 4 we select the widely used evi huete et al 1997 eq 13 as the optimal vi since it is easy to calculate and can reduce the noise of clouds and aerosols as well as the saturation effect of dense vegetation areas jiang et al 2008 huete et al 2006 phompila et al 2015 in this 3 d space each axis represents one of the three indices the evi lst and swir reflectance and variations in any one of the three indices cause the other two indices to change to ensure that the lst evi and swir values are comparable to one another each axis is normalized between 0 and 3 3 using eq 12 after the normalization of each axis the final tvsdi values are transformed to be between 0 and 1 based on the euclidean distance theory using eq 14 13 e v i g r nir r red r nir c 1 r red c 2 r blue l where g set as 2 5 is a gain factor r blue r nir and r red are reflectance in the blue nir and red bands respectively l equal to 1 is the canopy adjustment coefficient and c1 equal to 6 and c2 equal to 7 5 are aerosol resistance correction factors in this developed 3 d space in fig 4 point d and point w are the driest and wettest points respectively for any pixel d in this space its distance to the point w the length of the d w line can be converted into a tvsdi value by eq 14 the closer pixel d is to point d the longer the d w line and the larger the tvsdi value indicating more severe drought conditions the maximum dryness value tvsdi 1 is located at point d which contains the lowest evi value 0 the highest lst 3 3 and the highest swir reflectance value 3 3 the minimum dryness value tvsdi 0 is located at point w which contains the highest evi value 3 3 the lowest lst 0 and the lowest swir reflectance value 0 14 t v s d i lst 2 swir 2 3 3 e v i 2 where the lst evi and swir reflectance are normalized using equation 12 to avoid inevitable noise we set z values at 5 and 95 of the cumulative frequency of the histogram as min z and max z respectively a comparison of eqs 11 and 13 reveals that the proposed tvsdi is analogous to the tvmdi except that the sm index and pvi are replaced by swir reflectance and evi respectively in comparison to the tvmdi lst pvi sm space the tvsdi lst evi swir space shows important improvements in simplified calculations and increased applicability first in the development of the tvmdi soil line equations are required to calculate the pvi and sm index however it is difficult and time consuming to obtain soil line equations in practice and there is no universal soil line equation that can be applied to all soil types liu et al 2008 the appropriate soil line equation must be calibrated based on the specific conditions in selected research areas moreover differences in soil lines among different study areas may cause inconsistencies in tvmdi applications these are the main reasons that soil line related vis and dryness indices are rarely adopted in practice unlike the sm index and pvi the reflectance values needed for swir and the evi calculations can be obtained directly from most satellite products without acquiring a separate soil line equation for specific study areas moreover swir reflectance has been successfully applied to detect vegetation and soil water content as well as in agricultural dryness monitoring studies babaeian et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2015 yue et al 2019 caracciolo et al 2016 in addition the evi is a widely used and easily calculated vi that can reduce cloud aerosol noise as well as the saturation effect of vegetation dense regions jiang et al 2008 huete et al 2006 phompila et al 2015 by integrating the advantages of the swir reflectance evi and lst we expect to develop a new comprehensive and universal dryness index with simple calculations 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of the tvsdi 4 1 1 tvsdi vs smap sm and three variables lst evi and swir sm is the most direct reference for representing surface dryness wetness conditions therefore the correlation between the tvsdi and sm can indicate the tvsdi s ability to monitor dryness in this section we extracted the daily smap ep sm pixel values and their corresponding tvsdi lst evi and swir pixel values derived from modis products covering the entire conus to evaluate the tvsdi performance table 2 explores the performance of the tvsdi in different seasons in 2017 the results demonstrate that the tvsdi was highly correlated with sm r values ranging from 0 625 to 0 721 p 0 01 and performed better than any single use of the lst evi or swir reflectance as discussed in section 3 1 6 these three variables lst evi and swir reflectance are all closely related to sm and can be used alone to characterize surface dryness conditions additionally they are interrelated and can collectively influence sm the results given in table 2 indicate that the proposed tvsdi which considers three variables simultaneously can better characterize the dryness status of the natural geographic environment although the performance of the tvsdi was relatively stable with absolute r values exceeding 0 625 its performance varied among different seasons this occurred mainly because the lst changes significantly with the seasons as shown in table 2 with rlst values of 0 584 and 0 057 for the summer and winter respectively the lst has the best correlation with sm in the summer season when vegetation grows vigorously and surface et is highest in contrast the correlation between lst and sm is the lowest in the winter season when the lst and vegetation coverage are both low and the effective energy involved in the et process decreases with the addition of snowfall and sm freezing the relationship between lst and sm becomes more complex pablos et al 2016 in addition the lst is strongly influenced by ambient atmospheric parameters e g near surface temperature relative humidity wind speed mallick et al 2009 sadeghi et al 2017 unlike the lst the evi and swir reflectance derived from surface reflectance do not change significantly with ambient atmospheric parameters in particular swir reflectance has a strong and stable correlation with sm in all periods therefore the proposed tvsdi essentially combines the advantages of the three variables and overcomes the limitations of dryness indices that rely excessively on lst to a certain extent e g the tvdi and tci fig 5 displays the distribution of smap sm in the tvsdi evi lst swir space the results indicate that the smap sm distribution in the 3 d space was consistent with the tvsdi design expectations given in fig 4 generally the points with higher sm values were distributed closer to point w i e the wettest point in fig 4 and they were characterized by higher evi values and lower lst and swir reflectance values indicating lower risks of dryness fig 6 shows the overall performance of the tvsdi in 2017 the results demonstrate that the tvsdi was significantly negatively correlated with smap sm r 0 75 p 0 01 the results are satisfactory especially given the complex topography climate and surface cover types of the conus moreover the results indicate that there were strong correlations between tvsdi and its three variables as well as strong interrelationships among these three variables as shown in fig 6 the correlations between the tvsdi and three variables evi lst and swir indicate that the tvsdi was significantly negatively correlated with the evi r 0 86 p 0 01 and significantly positively correlated with swir reflectance r 0 85 p 0 01 and lst r 0 32 p 0 01 in addition these three variables were strongly correlated with each other therefore when the available water for vegetation growth is sufficient vegetation grows vigorously with higher evi values the vegetation transpiration increases leading to lower lst values and the swir reflectance decreases resulting in lower tvsdi values indicating a lower risk of dryness stress for vegetation it should be mentioned that this strong interrelationship is not obvious in the winter season as illustrated and discussed in the results in table 2 in the winter season the detection of sm by the tvsdi mainly relies on the evi and swir reflectance although the tvsdi had an overall high and stable correlation with smap sm in different seasons and the tvsdi distribution in 3 d space lst evi swir basically met the design expectations some issues remain that need to be explored first the three variables lst evi and swir reflectance are not strictly linear in response to sm variations the distribution of sm in the swir evi evi lst and swir lst spaces as shown in fig 6 is more likely to form a trapezoidal or triangular shape rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 sadeghi et al 2017 in this future study we will consider developing a modified tvsdi that can more accurately reflect these nonlinear response relationships moreover we will further explore other means to improve the accuracy of the tvsdi for instance the mono window algorithm mwa sekertekin and bonafoni 2020 or deep learning method choe and yom 2020 can be introduced to improve lst inversion accuracy in addition selecting or constructing a new vi that can reduce the impacts of atmospheric aerosols and canopy backgrounds may provide more accurate results than using the evi 4 1 2 tvsdi vs other satellite based dryness indices to evaluate the tvsdi the spatiotemporal consistency between the tvsdi and six commonly used satellite based dryness indices is shown in fig 7 the six commonly used dryness indices include four agricultural dryness indices the tvmdi mpdi pdi and tvdi and two meteorological dryness indices at a 3 month scale the spi 3 and spei 3 the meteorological dryness indices at the 3 month time scale were selected because they are considered very suitable for agricultural dryness monitoring rouault and richard 2003 lu et al 2019 according to the principles of the agricultural dryness indices the higher the dryness value the drier the region when the tvsdi is positively correlated with the four agricultural dryness indices their monitoring results are consistent the higher the r value the higher the level of consistency otherwise the monitoring results are inconsistent for the meteorological dryness indices the spi and spei the monitoring results are consistent when the tvsdi is negatively correlated with these indices a statistical analysis of the spatiotemporal correlation results indicates that the tvsdi exhibited overall higher spatiotemporal consistency with these agricultural dryness indices based on fig 8 the total areas with consistency r 0 between the tvsdi and the tvmdi tvdi mpdi and pdi were 96 48 65 33 82 92 and 59 20 respectively consistent areas at the 0 05 significance level accounted for 96 84 75 38 84 82 and 76 41 of the total consistent areas respectively fig s1 in the supplementary materials in addition the tvsdi generally exhibited higher consistency r values in the range of 0 6 to 1 0 with the tvmdi mpdi and pdi in the agricultural regions such as the central and eastern conus and california regions indicating the reliability of tvsdi dryness monitoring results in agricultural regions furthermore the tvsdi had overall lower correlations with the meteorological dryness indices as shown in fig 8 r values were in the range of 0 to 0 4 for most areas these results are similar to some findings made by zormand et al 2017 and zhang et al 2017 and occur mainly because meteorological dryness depends primarily on precipitation and temperature which rarely convey information about vegetation status while satellite based dryness indices largely depend on the extent to which precipitation affects vegetation growth moazzenzadeh et al 2013 zormand et al 2017 in addition satellite based agricultural dryness observations are also affected by soil texture topography land cover and human manipulation e g irrigation and tillage 4 1 3 tvsdi performance in different climates and land cover types to evaluate the performance of the tvsdi in various geographic regions we calculated the correlation between daily in situ sm and tvsdi for 24 crnp sites which are spread across diverse climates land cover types and topographic features of the conus fig 9 table 3 provides the abbreviations for each climate type in the conus table 4 displays the climate topography and vegetation types for each crnp site as well as the correlation between in situ sm and the tvsdi the scatter plots of in situ sm and the tvsdi for each crnp site are given in fig s2 the results indicate that the tvsdi had overall strong correlations with in situ sm for most of the sites although some sites had weak correlations the temporal variations between in situ sm and tvsdi for these sites were consistent according to fig 9 among these 24 crnp sites 14 had higher r values in the range of 0 5 to 1 0 the sites with the strongest correlations were mainly located in regions with arid semiarid and continental climate types and their land cover types were dominated by single and homogeneous grasslands e g reynolds creek with an r of 0 737 shrubs e g lucky hills with an r of 0 931 and savanna e g tonzi ranch with an r of 0 843 moreover the overall performance of the tvsdi on cropland sites was relatively high and stable there were seven sites with r values between 0 5 and 0 7 among the eight cropland sites i e kendall iowa validation site bondville neb field 3 rosemount york irrigated soybean yis and york rainfed yr considering that croplands are easily disturbed by uncertainties in human operations such as irrigation and tillage these results are still satisfactory moreover the sites with the lowest r values were generally characterized by more complex topographic features and mixed land cover types for example the shale hills site is located in a relatively steep valley in the appalachian mountains for the university of michigan biological stations umbs and marshall colorado mc sites many ground instruments radars meters weather stations flux towers global positioning systems gpss etc are located within their footprint which might interfere with the accuracy of satellite data acquisition moreover the correlations between the in situ sm and tvsdi values were generally stronger than those with other existing satellite based agricultural dryness indices the tvdi pdi mpdi and tvmdi as shown in table 4 after removing the umbs mc and shale hills sites with severe ground instrument interference among the remaining 21 sites 14 showed that the tvsdi performed the best moreover table 4 indicates that the tvsdi had the strongest correlation with in situ sm r 0 557 being 45 8 higher than that with the second most accurate dryness index the tvmdi in conclusion the tvsdi is more stable and accurate for dryness monitoring than these existing agricultural dryness indices the tvdi pdi mpdi and tvmdi and could be applied to most geographic regions 4 1 4 comparison of the tvsdi smap sm and usdm maps to further evaluate the performance of tvsdi in dryness monitoring a visual comparison of the tvsdi smap ep sm and usdm maps for different months was performed from 2015 to 2021 fig 10 the usdm smap sm and tvsdi maps were composited into monthly products weighted by the number of days recorded in each month the results demonstrate that the tvsdi closely matched the smap sm maps in different periods and provided more detailed spatial information for instance the tvsdi and smap sm maps both monitored extreme and severe dryness and drought in the western and southwestern coastal areas and most of texas tvsdi 0 65 and sm 0 1 m3 m3 in july 2016 although most drought areas monitored by the usdm maps were marked with different degrees of dryness on the tvsdi maps there were differences between the overall spatial patterns of the usdm and tvsdi maps for instance the usdm map shows sporadic dry conditions in california south dakota and georgia in july 2016 fig 10 while the tvsdi map displays widespread moderate to severe dryness in the west several reasons may explain these different patterns between the tvsdi and usdm maps first usdm maps are hybrid products that combine many drought indices various sources of datasets and subjective expert opinions zhang et al 2017 usdm maps attempt to identify various droughts e g meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts and it is difficult to accurately determine the exact source of these drought patterns osman et al 2021 the experts who produce and release usdm maps are likely to be particularly concerned with the impacts of drought on croplands and pastures in contrast the tvsdi is fully quantified and not affected by subjective expert opinions and it can capture dryness and drought conditions in natural ecosystems and agricultural regions with less intensive human activities moreover there are time lags in describing surface dryness using the short term usdm data otkin et al 2014 lorenz et al 2017 these time lags occur because usdm data relies on meteorological precipitation and if an area has experienced a long period of drought several precipitation events are usually required to stimulate dormant vegetation growth 4 2 applications of the tvsdi for dryness wetness monitoring in the conus 4 2 1 monthly dryness wetness variations in the conus the application of tvsdi for dryness monitoring at monthly scales is shown in figs 11 and 12 the results demonstrate that the conus experienced the broadest range of dryness in the winter and the most severe extent of dryness in the summer as fig 12 indicates the dryness areas identified by tvsdi maps tvsdi 0 45 accounted for 82 54 85 05 85 74 and 85 06 of the total conus area in january february march and december respectively the tvsdi monitored severe and extreme dryness areas tvsdi 0 65 which amounted to 19 76 23 10 and 22 05 of the total area of the conus in june july and august respectively moreover the dryness distribution pattern indicates that the western conus and central great plains were the driest regions which are dominated by deserts and semiarid climates in particular the overall high temperature in the summer season accelerates the evaporation of water vapor which combined with the long term lack of total precipitation results in severe surface dryness to evaluate the application of tvsdi for agricultural dryness monitoring we selected 12 agricultural subregions scattered in different geographic regions in the conus for further analysis figs 13 14 the results indicate that there were obvious differences in dryness conditions among these agricultural subregions which were mainly affected by the climate and geographic location according to fig 14 among these 12 agricultural subregions the wettest agricultural subregions were p9 and p10 which are located in the humid subtropical climate region with abundant precipitation throughout the year therefore the dryness values for these subregions were generally low for each month tvsdi value 0 55 in contrast p11 and p12 were the driest agricultural subregions located in the hot semiarid steppe climate region where long term high temperatures and strong evaporation lead to a lack of available sm for vegetation growth therefore the tvsdi values for these subregions were relatively high during most months of the year tvsdi value 0 55 the dryness patterns in the p4 and p5 agricultural subregions which are located in the continental climate regions showed obvious seasonal differences for these subregions the severe surface dryness mainly occurs in the cold winter season when most of the sm is frozen and there is less available liquid water for soil and vegetation e g the tvsdi values for p4 and p5 in the winter were above 0 7 in the spring season with increasing temperatures the frozen sm melts and the dryness is relieved to some extent in the summer season these agricultural subregions experience a humid rainy season and the dryness condition is effectively alleviated 4 2 2 multiyear dryness wetness conditions in the conus the spatial distribution of the multiyear average tvsdi values in the conus from 2007 to 2020 is displayed in fig 15 a the results indicate that the average tvsdi values varied significantly among different geographic regions the southwestern conus region was the driest mainly because this region has overall low precipitation high temperatures and strong evaporation in recent years this region has experienced frequent extremely high temperature weather events due to climate change and when combined with a long term shortage of precipitation the available water resources for vegetation and soil have become even more scarce baek et al 2019 williams et al 2020 in contrast the northwestern coastal and southeastern regions were the wettest because they have annual precipitation exceeding 1000 mm and dense vegetation coverage the interannual time series trend analysis pohlert 2019 morell and fried 2009 was used to investigate the overall trends of dryness variation in the conus in recent years as shown in fig 15 b d the results indicate that about 36 29 of the conus regions have experienced a dryness trend in recent years with the dryness trend at the 0 05 significance level accounting for 9 24 of the conus regions most of the regions with dryness trends are located in the western conus especially in the southwest and northwest regions in contrast a wetness trend has been observed in 63 71 of the conus regions with the southeast and great lakes regions showing the most obvious wetness trend these dryness wetness trends observed in the tvsdi maps are similar to several findings described in recent drought reports apurv and cai 2021 su et al 2021 osman et al 2021 moreover the multi year variation trends of the spei meteorological droughts and the tvsdi agricultural dryness results are generally consistent which reflects the dependence of vegetation growth on precipitation to some extent 5 conclusions in this study three variables lst evi and swir reflectance were combined in 3 d space to develop a simple and efficient integrated satellite based dryness index called the tvsdi the index is mainly based on the interrelationships between these variables a lower sm value is usually accompanied by a lower evi value and higher lst and swir reflectance values resulting in a higher tvsdi value and indicating a higher dryness risk the evaluation of the tvsdi using smap sm confirms that the distribution of sm in this 3 d space lst swir evi closely followed the above patterns in addition the tvsdi was significantly correlated with the smap sm r 0 75 p 0 01 and this correlation was stronger than that of the smap sm and any single variable among lst evi and swir reflectance moreover the tvsdi exhibited overall high spatiotemporal consistency with six commonly used dryness indices the tvmdi tvdi mpdi pdi spei 3 and spi 3 among these dryness indices the tvsdi showed the best spatiotemporal consistency with the tvmdi and mpdi with consistent areas totaling over 92 75 and 73 10 respectively in addition compared to several commonly used agricultural dryness indices the tvmdi tvdi mpdi and pdi the tvsdi exhibited the best performance at 24 crnp sites with various climates and land cover types indicating the reliability and robustness of the tvsdi moreover the visual comparisons of tvsdi smap sm and usdm maps for different periods revealed that the tvsdi maps were not only well matched with the smap sm maps but could also provide more extensive and detailed spatial information about dryness and drought observations than the smap sm and usdm maps furthermore monthly and annual dryness monitoring as well as multiyear trend analysis were conducted by applying the tvsdi in the conus from 2007 to 2020 the results demonstrate that the conus experienced the broadest range of dryness tvsdi values 0 45 in january february march and december while the most severe extent of dryness tvsdi values 0 65 occurred in june july and august in addition multiyear dryness trend analysis results indicate that approximately 36 29 of the conus regions have experienced dryness trends in recent years with the majority of these regions in the western conus especially in the southwest and northwest regions in conclusion this study presented and evaluated an accurate and easy to apply satellite based integrated dryness index that can be used for sm retrieval and dryness monitoring in a variety of geographical regions and natural environments declaration

3264,accurate dryness monitoring is important for formulating reasonable response measures to reduce social and economic losses caused by drought the land surface temperature lst shortwave infrared swir reflectance and vegetation index vi are popular remote sensing rs indices that can be individually used to characterize surface dryness given the interactions of these factors limitations are inevitably associated with using a single factor integrated dryness indices that combine lst or swir reflectance with the vi have thus been successively proposed and applied for dryness monitoring and soil moisture sm retrieval work however the advantages of these three indicators have not yet been combined to construct a more comprehensive dryness index in this study we integrated the lst enhanced vegetation index evi and swir reflectance and developed an integrated satellite based dryness index with simple calculations called the temperature vegetation shortwave infrared reflectance dryness index tvsdi the proposed tvsdi was thoroughly assessed in the continental united states conus using the following data the soil moisture active passive smap sm six commonly used dryness indices i e temperature vegetation soil moisture dryness index tvmdi temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi modified perpendicular dryness index mpdi perpendicular dryness index pdi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardized precipitation index spi in situ sm data collected from 24 cosmic ray neutron probe crnp sites covering different climates soil types and land cover types and the united states drought monitor usdm maps the results demonstrated that the tvsdi was significantly correlated with smap sm r 0 75 p 0 01 and exhibited better performance than the use of lst evi and swir reflectance individually moreover the tvsdi and the other six commonly used dryness indices exhibited good spatiotemporal consistency all with consistency areas 60 the evaluation based on in situ sm from 24 crnp sites indicated that the tvsdi exhibited more stability and accuracy than other satellite based agricultural dryness indices tvmdi mpdi pdi and tvdi moreover the spatial patterns of tvsdi maps were not only well matched with smap sm maps but also provided more detailed spatial information tvsdi maps could capture more dryness and drought variations in natural ecosystems and areas with less intensive human activities than usdm maps furthermore the application of the tvsdi for dryness monitoring in the conus revealed that the dryness distributions differed greatly across different geographic regions at monthly and annual scales in conclusion the tvsdi was found to be a reliable and accurate satellite based dryness index keywords dryness remote sensing land surface temperature vegetation index shortwave infrared reflectance soil moisture continental united states 1 introduction many countries endure drought induced environmental economic and social problems karthikeyan et al 2020 amani et al 2017 javed et al 2021 oikonomou et al 2019 in recent decades many parts of the world have experienced increasing numbers of droughts and extreme heatwave events koster et al 2009 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 chen et al 2019 global warming trends are expected to increase the intensity and frequency of droughts and heatwaves hao et al 2017 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 caracciolo et al 2016 sánchez et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 droughts have always been costly disasters in the continental united states conus from 1980 to 2017 economic losses caused by droughts in the united states totaled over 239 billion noaa 2016 therefore the accurate assessment of surface dryness and drought status is essential for preventing and reducing losses caused by droughts both dryness and drought are caused by a lack of water and can represent water shortage situations in particular areas at particular times but they differ slightly amani et al 2017 wei et al 2020 surface dryness is the natural deficit of soil moisture sm caused by low precipitation high land surface temperature lst and high evapotranspiration et li et al 2017 drought is a relatively complex event that is generally categorized into four types meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought zargar et al 2011 livada and assimakopoulos 2007 however all drought types occur after a period of dryness which can range from a week to a few years wilhite et al 2019 zargar et al 2011 therefore if an index is used to analyze the lack of surface sm it can be considered a dryness index if a dryness index is introduced to estimate surface dryness over a period of time it can also be regarded as a drought index wei et al 2020 amani et al 2017 satellite remote sensing rs technology provides a new method for comprehensively characterizing regional and global dryness and drought conditions in areas with limited sampling gauges rs may be the only available data source alijanian et al 2019 satellite based dryness indices are primarily based on the sm related electromagnetic radiation spectrum vegetation indices vis and lst etc feng et al 2013 zhang and jia 2013 zormand et al 2017 many satellite based dryness indices based only on a single variable have been proposed for instance kogan 1995a b developed the temperature condition index tci based only on the lst and then proposed the vegetation condition index vci based only on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi moreover the modified perpendicular dryness index mpdi ghulam et al 2007a and perpendicular dryness index pdi ghulam et al 2007b were established based only on the red and near infrared nir bands of the sm related electromagnetic radiation spectrum the modified shortwave infrared perpendicular drought index mspdi was developed based only on the shortwave infrared swir and red bands of the sm related electromagnetic radiation spectrum feng et al 2013 however in most cases the complete characterization of dryness and drought requires simultaneous information about several critical variables wang et al 2001 wardlow et al 2012 amani et al 2017 jiao et al 2016 wang et al 2020 sánchez et al 2016 by integrating the lst and ndvi researchers developed the vegetation temperature condition index vtci wang et al 2001 and the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi sandholt et al 2002 these integrated dryness indices which consider two variables outperform dryness indices based only on one variable for instance ge et al 2018 reported that the correlation between the tvdi and sm 0 10 cm is 30 higher than that between the pdi and sm for swamplands studies have found that dryness indices including more critical variables are useful for dryness assessments sánchez et al 2016 amani et al 2017 amani et al 2017 proposed a temperature vegetation soil moisture dryness index tvmdi that combined lst the sm index and the perpendicular vegetation index pvi amani et al 2017 reported that the correlation between the tvmdi and in situ sm is 20 higher than that between the tvdi and in situ sm integrated dryness indices including two or three variables outperform those considering only one variable however complex mathematical calculations and time consuming image preprocessing procedures are required for several of the popular integrated indices for instance tvmdi calculations require knowledge of the soil line equation due to differences in soil lines among different soil types inconsistencies may occur in dryness index applications amani et al 2017 for the tvdi the slope and intercept between lst and vi spaces must be determined due to significant variations in ambient atmospheric parameters over different times it is impossible to define universal slope and intercept parameters for the tvdi parameterization and readjustment are required for each individual observation date ghulam et al 2007a sandholt et al 2002 sadeghi et al 2017 which limits the application of the tvdi sadeghi et al 2017 developed the optical trapezoid model optram by replacing lst with swir reflectance to improve the tvdi the parameters of the optram are shown to remain unchanged over time and the model has broad prospects in sm retrieval and dryness monitoring applications dryness indices mostly assess a lack of sm swir reflectance the vi and lst are commonly used rs variables that can indirectly indicate the sm status at present each of these variables has been used to characterize the dryness in addition dryness indices combining lst or swir reflectance with the vi have also been developed for dryness monitoring and sm retrieval work however the integration of the advantages of these three variables to construct a more comprehensive and easy to operate dryness index has not yet been conducted in this study we developed an integrated satellite based dryness index with simple calculations called the temperature vegetation shortwave infrared reflectance dryness index tvsdi the index is based only on the euclidean distance equations of three variables lst enhanced vegetation index evi and swir reflectance the main objective of this study was to establish and assess this new dryness index in the conus 2 study area and data 2 1 study area this study was mainly conducted in the conus according to statistics from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental information ncei drought is the second most costly climate disaster in the conus www ncdc noaa gov billions moreover there are many in situ sm and meteorological monitoring sites distributed across the conus covering different topographic features land cover types and climate types these conditions provide opportunities for developing and thoroughly evaluating this new dryness index 2 2 data and processing 2 2 1 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data in this study the mod11a1 mod11a2 mod09ga and mod09a1 products were mainly used to construct the proposed dryness index the tvsdi table 1 provides detailed information about the modis products used in this study these products are provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and can be obtained from the google earth engine gee platform https developers google com earth engine datasets these modis products were first atmospherically corrected and preprocessed to account for the removal of interferences from clouds water cloud shadows and heavy aerosols then they were reprojected onto the wgs 84 geographic coordinate system in addition the nearest neighbor resampling method lillesand et al 2015 was used to resample the spatial resolution of mod09ga and mod09a1 from the original 500 to 1000 m 2 2 2 soil moisture active passive level 3 smap l3 enhanced passive ep product the smap l3 ep sm product was mainly used to demonstrate the distribution of the tvsdi in three dimensional 3 d space lst swir evi as well as to provide a spatial reference for evaluating tvsdi maps smap sm products are popular references for sm observations and drought monitoring at regional and global scales entekhabi et al 2010 smap satellites use the l band radiometer which can penetrate moderate vegetation coverage and is not affected by cloud cover day or night conditions to detect land surface 0 5 cm sm the

types in the conus http cosmos hwr arizona edu were used to evaluate the robustness and universality of tvsdi applications in various geographic regions in situ sm data are the most common reference used to evaluate satellite based dryness indices amani et al 2017 babaeian et al 2018 ghulam et al 2007a b sandholt et al 2002 the crnp uses cosmic ray neutron technology to detect the average sm value each hour within the site footprint range approximately 400 670 m in diameter stevanato et al 2019 duygu and akyurek 2019 compared to traditional methods that acquire sm values at point scales the crnp detects the average sm over a relatively large footprint range which matches well with the spatial resolution of modis i e 500 1000 m footprint however unlike the satellite observations that provide land surface information 0 5 cm the crnp acquires sm value with vertical sampling depths ranging from nearly 15 cm water saturated to approximately 70 cm extremely dry soils as described by duygu and akyurek 2019 and stevanato et al 2019 despite the depth mismatch the use of crnp is still an effective way to bridge the scale gap between large scale rs observations and ground measurements babaeian et al 2018 duygu and akyurek 2019 stevanato et al 2019 2 2 4 gridded surface meteorological gridmet dryness indices the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 were used to evaluate the spatiotemporal consistency between the proposed tvsdi and the meteorological dryness indices many studies have used meteorological dryness indices to evaluate satellite based dryness indices schmidt et al 2020 javed et al 2021 sandeep et al 2021 the spi and spei spatial data used in this study are derived from the daily 4 km gridmet dataset spi and spei data are available at multiple time scales including 14 days 30 days 90 days 180 days 270 days 1 year 2 years and 5 years abatzoglou 2013 the spi and spei correspond to the temporal aggregate of standardized precipitation and precipitation minus the reference et respectively the gridmet dataset is provided by the university of california merced and is available at https www climatologylab org gridmet html 2 2 5 united states drought monitor usdm maps the usdm maps were used to provide a spatial reference for visual comparison with the tvsdi maps the usdm maps are commonly used to describe the extent of drought in the conus lu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 and are generated by professionals who combine several data sources such as surface flow sm precipitation temperature anomalies crops and local expert reports to determine weekly drought situations svoboda et al 2002 therefore usdm maps are mixtures of multisource data and many indicators they are not strictly quantitative products but are combinations of science and subjectivity detailed information about usdm maps can be obtained from the national drought mitigation center https

in which the evaluation and application of the tvsdi are the two core parts the tvsdi is thoroughly evaluated mainly from four aspects and the application part analyzes dryness wetness patterns in the conus at monthly and yearly scales using the proposed tvsdi 3 1 satellite based dryness indices 3 1 1 red nir spectral space the scatterplot of pixel values derived from satellite images with differing land coverages in the red nir reflectance space map forms a triangular area the shaded area in fig 2 which is the basis for several dryness indices a brief explanation of this triangular feature and its mathematical description is provided below when a point moves along the ad line in fig 2 the surface vegetation coverage varies from complete cover point a to fractional cover point e and then to noncovered bare soil point d point b represents wet soil while point c indicates extremely dry soil the bc line also known as the soil line is expressed as follows baret jacquemoud and hanocq 1993 1 r nir m r red i where rnir and rred are the reflectance of the nir and the red band respectively i and m are the intercept and slope of line bc respectively 3 1 2 pdi the lines parallel to line bc in fig 2 are used to construct the pdi the pdi value can be calculated by computing the vertical distance from line ed to line fl i e the length of line ef for a randomly selected point e in the red nir reflectance plane the length of line ef is positively correlated with drought intensity and negatively correlated with sm content the pdi is expressed as follows ghulam et al 2007b 2 p d i 1 m 2 1 r red m r nir 3 1 3 mpdi to minimize the vegetation effect on the sm calculation and improve the performance of the pdi ghulam et al 2007a proposed the mpdi which is expressed as follows 3 m p d i r red m r nir f v r v r e d m r v n i r 1 f v m 2 1 where rv red and rv nir are constant 0 5 and 0 05 respectively and represent the reflectance values of the red and the nir band of healthy green vegetation respectively eqs 4 and 5 can be used to obtain the ndvi rouse et al 1974 and vegetation fraction fv li 2003 4 n d v i r nir r red r nir r red 5 f v ndvi ndvi veg ndvi veg ndvi soil where ndvi soil refers to the minimum pixel value of the pure soil which is theoretically close to 0 ndvi veg is the maximum pixel value of the pure vegetation which is theoretically close to 1 3 1 4 tvdi the tvdi was developed mainly based on the lst vi triangular space fig 3 sandholt et al 2002 and its expression is as follows 6 t v d i lst lst min lst max lst min 7 lst max a b v i 8 lst min c d v i where lst min and lst max represents the minimum and maximum values of lst for a given vi and a and b are the dry edge s intercept and slope respectively and c and d are the wet edge s intercept and slope respectively 3 1 5 tvmdi amani et al 2017 developed the tvmdi by combining three indicators lst the sm index eq 9 and the pvi eq 10 9 sm r nir r red m 0 082 1 1 m 2 10 p v i r nir m r red i 1 m 2 11 t v m d i n o r m a l i z e d l s t 2 n o r m a l i z e d s m 2 3 3 n o r m a l i z e d p v i 2 where the lst sm index and pvi are normalized between 0 and 3 3 using the normalized equation eq 12 thereby placing the dryness values between 0 and 1 12 n o r m a l i z e d z i z i min z max z min z 3 3 where z is one of the three variables pvi sm or lst and zi is the ith value in z z1 z2 zn 3 1 6 tvsdi sm directly affects surface dryness vegetation status swir reflectance and lst can affect sm and thus can be indirectly used to represent dryness moreover these three variables are interrelated and can collectively reflect the sm generally when the sm is sufficient the amount of water available for vegetation growth increases vegetation grows vigorously high vi values and the leaves stomata open leading to a decrease in the surface temperature the swir reflectance decreases with increasing vegetation water and sm content which indicates a lower surface dryness risk therefore these three variables were used to construct a 3 d dryness index to construct the 3 d tvsdi we set the swir reflectance axis perpendicular to the 2d lst vi plane as shown in fig 4 we select the widely used evi huete et al 1997 eq 13 as the optimal vi since it is easy to calculate and can reduce the noise of clouds and aerosols as well as the saturation effect of dense vegetation areas jiang et al 2008 huete et al 2006 phompila et al 2015 in this 3 d space each axis represents one of the three indices the evi lst and swir reflectance and variations in any one of the three indices cause the other two indices to change to ensure that the lst evi and swir values are comparable to one another each axis is normalized between 0 and 3 3 using eq 12 after the normalization of each axis the final tvsdi values are transformed to be between 0 and 1 based on the euclidean distance theory using eq 14 13 e v i g r nir r red r nir c 1 r red c 2 r blue l where g set as 2 5 is a gain factor r blue r nir and r red are reflectance in the blue nir and red bands respectively l equal to 1 is the canopy adjustment coefficient and c1 equal to 6 and c2 equal to 7 5 are aerosol resistance correction factors in this developed 3 d space in fig 4 point d and point w are the driest and wettest points respectively for any pixel d in this space its distance to the point w the length of the d w line can be converted into a tvsdi value by eq 14 the closer pixel d is to point d the longer the d w line and the larger the tvsdi value indicating more severe drought conditions the maximum dryness value tvsdi 1 is located at point d which contains the lowest evi value 0 the highest lst 3 3 and the highest swir reflectance value 3 3 the minimum dryness value tvsdi 0 is located at point w which contains the highest evi value 3 3 the lowest lst 0 and the lowest swir reflectance value 0 14 t v s d i lst 2 swir 2 3 3 e v i 2 where the lst evi and swir reflectance are normalized using equation 12 to avoid inevitable noise we set z values at 5 and 95 of the cumulative frequency of the histogram as min z and max z respectively a comparison of eqs 11 and 13 reveals that the proposed tvsdi is analogous to the tvmdi except that the sm index and pvi are replaced by swir reflectance and evi respectively in comparison to the tvmdi lst pvi sm space the tvsdi lst evi swir space shows important improvements in simplified calculations and increased applicability first in the development of the tvmdi soil line equations are required to calculate the pvi and sm index however it is difficult and time consuming to obtain soil line equations in practice and there is no universal soil line equation that can be applied to all soil types liu et al 2008 the appropriate soil line equation must be calibrated based on the specific conditions in selected research areas moreover differences in soil lines among different study areas may cause inconsistencies in tvmdi applications these are the main reasons that soil line related vis and dryness indices are rarely adopted in practice unlike the sm index and pvi the reflectance values needed for swir and the evi calculations can be obtained directly from most satellite products without acquiring a separate soil line equation for specific study areas moreover swir reflectance has been successfully applied to detect vegetation and soil water content as well as in agricultural dryness monitoring studies babaeian et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2015 yue et al 2019 caracciolo et al 2016 in addition the evi is a widely used and easily calculated vi that can reduce cloud aerosol noise as well as the saturation effect of vegetation dense regions jiang et al 2008 huete et al 2006 phompila et al 2015 by integrating the advantages of the swir reflectance evi and lst we expect to develop a new comprehensive and universal dryness index with simple calculations 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of the tvsdi 4 1 1 tvsdi vs smap sm and three variables lst evi and swir sm is the most direct reference for representing surface dryness wetness conditions therefore the correlation between the tvsdi and sm can indicate the tvsdi s ability to monitor dryness in this section we extracted the daily smap ep sm pixel values and their corresponding tvsdi lst evi and swir pixel values derived from modis products covering the entire conus to evaluate the tvsdi performance table 2 explores the performance of the tvsdi in different seasons in 2017 the results demonstrate that the tvsdi was highly correlated with sm r values ranging from 0 625 to 0 721 p 0 01 and performed better than any single use of the lst evi or swir reflectance as discussed in section 3 1 6 these three variables lst evi and swir reflectance are all closely related to sm and can be used alone to characterize surface dryness conditions additionally they are interrelated and can collectively influence sm the results given in table 2 indicate that the proposed tvsdi which considers three variables simultaneously can better characterize the dryness status of the natural geographic environment although the performance of the tvsdi was relatively stable with absolute r values exceeding 0 625 its performance varied among different seasons this occurred mainly because the lst changes significantly with the seasons as shown in table 2 with rlst values of 0 584 and 0 057 for the summer and winter respectively the lst has the best correlation with sm in the summer season when vegetation grows vigorously and surface et is highest in contrast the correlation between lst and sm is the lowest in the winter season when the lst and vegetation coverage are both low and the effective energy involved in the et process decreases with the addition of snowfall and sm freezing the relationship between lst and sm becomes more complex pablos et al 2016 in addition the lst is strongly influenced by ambient atmospheric parameters e g near surface temperature relative humidity wind speed mallick et al 2009 sadeghi et al 2017 unlike the lst the evi and swir reflectance derived from surface reflectance do not change significantly with ambient atmospheric parameters in particular swir reflectance has a strong and stable correlation with sm in all periods therefore the proposed tvsdi essentially combines the advantages of the three variables and overcomes the limitations of dryness indices that rely excessively on lst to a certain extent e g the tvdi and tci fig 5 displays the distribution of smap sm in the tvsdi evi lst swir space the results indicate that the smap sm distribution in the 3 d space was consistent with the tvsdi design expectations given in fig 4 generally the points with higher sm values were distributed closer to point w i e the wettest point in fig 4 and they were characterized by higher evi values and lower lst and swir reflectance values indicating lower risks of dryness fig 6 shows the overall performance of the tvsdi in 2017 the results demonstrate that the tvsdi was significantly negatively correlated with smap sm r 0 75 p 0 01 the results are satisfactory especially given the complex topography climate and surface cover types of the conus moreover the results indicate that there were strong correlations between tvsdi and its three variables as well as strong interrelationships among these three variables as shown in fig 6 the correlations between the tvsdi and three variables evi lst and swir indicate that the tvsdi was significantly negatively correlated with the evi r 0 86 p 0 01 and significantly positively correlated with swir reflectance r 0 85 p 0 01 and lst r 0 32 p 0 01 in addition these three variables were strongly correlated with each other therefore when the available water for vegetation growth is sufficient vegetation grows vigorously with higher evi values the vegetation transpiration increases leading to lower lst values and the swir reflectance decreases resulting in lower tvsdi values indicating a lower risk of dryness stress for vegetation it should be mentioned that this strong interrelationship is not obvious in the winter season as illustrated and discussed in the results in table 2 in the winter season the detection of sm by the tvsdi mainly relies on the evi and swir reflectance although the tvsdi had an overall high and stable correlation with smap sm in different seasons and the tvsdi distribution in 3 d space lst evi swir basically met the design expectations some issues remain that need to be explored first the three variables lst evi and swir reflectance are not strictly linear in response to sm variations the distribution of sm in the swir evi evi lst and swir lst spaces as shown in fig 6 is more likely to form a trapezoidal or triangular shape rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 sadeghi et al 2017 in this future study we will consider developing a modified tvsdi that can more accurately reflect these nonlinear response relationships moreover we will further explore other means to improve the accuracy of the tvsdi for instance the mono window algorithm mwa sekertekin and bonafoni 2020 or deep learning method choe and yom 2020 can be introduced to improve lst inversion accuracy in addition selecting or constructing a new vi that can reduce the impacts of atmospheric aerosols and canopy backgrounds may provide more accurate results than using the evi 4 1 2 tvsdi vs other satellite based dryness indices to evaluate the tvsdi the spatiotemporal consistency between the tvsdi and six commonly used satellite based dryness indices is shown in fig 7 the six commonly used dryness indices include four agricultural dryness indices the tvmdi mpdi pdi and tvdi and two meteorological dryness indices at a 3 month scale the spi 3 and spei 3 the meteorological dryness indices at the 3 month time scale were selected because they are considered very suitable for agricultural dryness monitoring rouault and richard 2003 lu et al 2019 according to the principles of the agricultural dryness indices the higher the dryness value the drier the region when the tvsdi is positively correlated with the four agricultural dryness indices their monitoring results are consistent the higher the r value the higher the level of consistency otherwise the monitoring results are inconsistent for the meteorological dryness indices the spi and spei the monitoring results are consistent when the tvsdi is negatively correlated with these indices a statistical analysis of the spatiotemporal correlation results indicates that the tvsdi exhibited overall higher spatiotemporal consistency with these agricultural dryness indices based on fig 8 the total areas with consistency r 0 between the tvsdi and the tvmdi tvdi mpdi and pdi were 96 48 65 33 82 92 and 59 20 respectively consistent areas at the 0 05 significance level accounted for 96 84 75 38 84 82 and 76 41 of the total consistent areas respectively fig s1 in the supplementary materials in addition the tvsdi generally exhibited higher consistency r values in the range of 0 6 to 1 0 with the tvmdi mpdi and pdi in the agricultural regions such as the central and eastern conus and california regions indicating the reliability of tvsdi dryness monitoring results in agricultural regions furthermore the tvsdi had overall lower correlations with the meteorological dryness indices as shown in fig 8 r values were in the range of 0 to 0 4 for most areas these results are similar to some findings made by zormand et al 2017 and zhang et al 2017 and occur mainly because meteorological dryness depends primarily on precipitation and temperature which rarely convey information about vegetation status while satellite based dryness indices largely depend on the extent to which precipitation affects vegetation growth moazzenzadeh et al 2013 zormand et al 2017 in addition satellite based agricultural dryness observations are also affected by soil texture topography land cover and human manipulation e g irrigation and tillage 4 1 3 tvsdi performance in different climates and land cover types to evaluate the performance of the tvsdi in various geographic regions we calculated the correlation between daily in situ sm and tvsdi for 24 crnp sites which are spread across diverse climates land cover types and topographic features of the conus fig 9 table 3 provides the abbreviations for each climate type in the conus table 4 displays the climate topography and vegetation types for each crnp site as well as the correlation between in situ sm and the tvsdi the scatter plots of in situ sm and the tvsdi for each crnp site are given in fig s2 the results indicate that the tvsdi had overall strong correlations with in situ sm for most of the sites although some sites had weak correlations the temporal variations between in situ sm and tvsdi for these sites were consistent according to fig 9 among these 24 crnp sites 14 had higher r values in the range of 0 5 to 1 0 the sites with the strongest correlations were mainly located in regions with arid semiarid and continental climate types and their land cover types were dominated by single and homogeneous grasslands e g reynolds creek with an r of 0 737 shrubs e g lucky hills with an r of 0 931 and savanna e g tonzi ranch with an r of 0 843 moreover the overall performance of the tvsdi on cropland sites was relatively high and stable there were seven sites with r values between 0 5 and 0 7 among the eight cropland sites i e kendall iowa validation site bondville neb field 3 rosemount york irrigated soybean yis and york rainfed yr considering that croplands are easily disturbed by uncertainties in human operations such as irrigation and tillage these results are still satisfactory moreover the sites with the lowest r values were generally characterized by more complex topographic features and mixed land cover types for example the shale hills site is located in a relatively steep valley in the appalachian mountains for the university of michigan biological stations umbs and marshall colorado mc sites many ground instruments radars meters weather stations flux towers global positioning systems gpss etc are located within their footprint which might interfere with the accuracy of satellite data acquisition moreover the correlations between the in situ sm and tvsdi values were generally stronger than those with other existing satellite based agricultural dryness indices the tvdi pdi mpdi and tvmdi as shown in table 4 after removing the umbs mc and shale hills sites with severe ground instrument interference among the remaining 21 sites 14 showed that the tvsdi performed the best moreover table 4 indicates that the tvsdi had the strongest correlation with in situ sm r 0 557 being 45 8 higher than that with the second most accurate dryness index the tvmdi in conclusion the tvsdi is more stable and accurate for dryness monitoring than these existing agricultural dryness indices the tvdi pdi mpdi and tvmdi and could be applied to most geographic regions 4 1 4 comparison of the tvsdi smap sm and usdm maps to further evaluate the performance of tvsdi in dryness monitoring a visual comparison of the tvsdi smap ep sm and usdm maps for different months was performed from 2015 to 2021 fig 10 the usdm smap sm and tvsdi maps were composited into monthly products weighted by the number of days recorded in each month the results demonstrate that the tvsdi closely matched the smap sm maps in different periods and provided more detailed spatial information for instance the tvsdi and smap sm maps both monitored extreme and severe dryness and drought in the western and southwestern coastal areas and most of texas tvsdi 0 65 and sm 0 1 m3 m3 in july 2016 although most drought areas monitored by the usdm maps were marked with different degrees of dryness on the tvsdi maps there were differences between the overall spatial patterns of the usdm and tvsdi maps for instance the usdm map shows sporadic dry conditions in california south dakota and georgia in july 2016 fig 10 while the tvsdi map displays widespread moderate to severe dryness in the west several reasons may explain these different patterns between the tvsdi and usdm maps first usdm maps are hybrid products that combine many drought indices various sources of datasets and subjective expert opinions zhang et al 2017 usdm maps attempt to identify various droughts e g meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts and it is difficult to accurately determine the exact source of these drought patterns osman et al 2021 the experts who produce and release usdm maps are likely to be particularly concerned with the impacts of drought on croplands and pastures in contrast the tvsdi is fully quantified and not affected by subjective expert opinions and it can capture dryness and drought conditions in natural ecosystems and agricultural regions with less intensive human activities moreover there are time lags in describing surface dryness using the short term usdm data otkin et al 2014 lorenz et al 2017 these time lags occur because usdm data relies on meteorological precipitation and if an area has experienced a long period of drought several precipitation events are usually required to stimulate dormant vegetation growth 4 2 applications of the tvsdi for dryness wetness monitoring in the conus 4 2 1 monthly dryness wetness variations in the conus the application of tvsdi for dryness monitoring at monthly scales is shown in figs 11 and 12 the results demonstrate that the conus experienced the broadest range of dryness in the winter and the most severe extent of dryness in the summer as fig 12 indicates the dryness areas identified by tvsdi maps tvsdi 0 45 accounted for 82 54 85 05 85 74 and 85 06 of the total conus area in january february march and december respectively the tvsdi monitored severe and extreme dryness areas tvsdi 0 65 which amounted to 19 76 23 10 and 22 05 of the total area of the conus in june july and august respectively moreover the dryness distribution pattern indicates that the western conus and central great plains were the driest regions which are dominated by deserts and semiarid climates in particular the overall high temperature in the summer season accelerates the evaporation of water vapor which combined with the long term lack of total precipitation results in severe surface dryness to evaluate the application of tvsdi for agricultural dryness monitoring we selected 12 agricultural subregions scattered in different geographic regions in the conus for further analysis figs 13 14 the results indicate that there were obvious differences in dryness conditions among these agricultural subregions which were mainly affected by the climate and geographic location according to fig 14 among these 12 agricultural subregions the wettest agricultural subregions were p9 and p10 which are located in the humid subtropical climate region with abundant precipitation throughout the year therefore the dryness values for these subregions were generally low for each month tvsdi value 0 55 in contrast p11 and p12 were the driest agricultural subregions located in the hot semiarid steppe climate region where long term high temperatures and strong evaporation lead to a lack of available sm for vegetation growth therefore the tvsdi values for these subregions were relatively high during most months of the year tvsdi value 0 55 the dryness patterns in the p4 and p5 agricultural subregions which are located in the continental climate regions showed obvious seasonal differences for these subregions the severe surface dryness mainly occurs in the cold winter season when most of the sm is frozen and there is less available liquid water for soil and vegetation e g the tvsdi values for p4 and p5 in the winter were above 0 7 in the spring season with increasing temperatures the frozen sm melts and the dryness is relieved to some extent in the summer season these agricultural subregions experience a humid rainy season and the dryness condition is effectively alleviated 4 2 2 multiyear dryness wetness conditions in the conus the spatial distribution of the multiyear average tvsdi values in the conus from 2007 to 2020 is displayed in fig 15 a the results indicate that the average tvsdi values varied significantly among different geographic regions the southwestern conus region was the driest mainly because this region has overall low precipitation high temperatures and strong evaporation in recent years this region has experienced frequent extremely high temperature weather events due to climate change and when combined with a long term shortage of precipitation the available water resources for vegetation and soil have become even more scarce baek et al 2019 williams et al 2020 in contrast the northwestern coastal and southeastern regions were the wettest because they have annual precipitation exceeding 1000 mm and dense vegetation coverage the interannual time series trend analysis pohlert 2019 morell and fried 2009 was used to investigate the overall trends of dryness variation in the conus in recent years as shown in fig 15 b d the results indicate that about 36 29 of the conus regions have experienced a dryness trend in recent years with the dryness trend at the 0 05 significance level accounting for 9 24 of the conus regions most of the regions with dryness trends are located in the western conus especially in the southwest and northwest regions in contrast a wetness trend has been observed in 63 71 of the conus regions with the southeast and great lakes regions showing the most obvious wetness trend these dryness wetness trends observed in the tvsdi maps are similar to several findings described in recent drought reports apurv and cai 2021 su et al 2021 osman et al 2021 moreover the multi year variation trends of the spei meteorological droughts and the tvsdi agricultural dryness results are generally consistent which reflects the dependence of vegetation growth on precipitation to some extent 5 conclusions in this study three variables lst evi and swir reflectance were combined in 3 d space to develop a simple and efficient integrated satellite based dryness index called the tvsdi the index is mainly based on the interrelationships between these variables a lower sm value is usually accompanied by a lower evi value and higher lst and swir reflectance values resulting in a higher tvsdi value and indicating a higher dryness risk the evaluation of the tvsdi using smap sm confirms that the distribution of sm in this 3 d space lst swir evi closely followed the above patterns in addition the tvsdi was significantly correlated with the smap sm r 0 75 p 0 01 and this correlation was stronger than that of the smap sm and any single variable among lst evi and swir reflectance moreover the tvsdi exhibited overall high spatiotemporal consistency with six commonly used dryness indices the tvmdi tvdi mpdi pdi spei 3 and spi 3 among these dryness indices the tvsdi showed the best spatiotemporal consistency with the tvmdi and mpdi with consistent areas totaling over 92 75 and 73 10 respectively in addition compared to several commonly used agricultural dryness indices the tvmdi tvdi mpdi and pdi the tvsdi exhibited the best performance at 24 crnp sites with various climates and land cover types indicating the reliability and robustness of the tvsdi moreover the visual comparisons of tvsdi smap sm and usdm maps for different periods revealed that the tvsdi maps were not only well matched with the smap sm maps but could also provide more extensive and detailed spatial information about dryness and drought observations than the smap sm and usdm maps furthermore monthly and annual dryness monitoring as well as multiyear trend analysis were conducted by applying the tvsdi in the conus from 2007 to 2020 the results demonstrate that the conus experienced the broadest range of dryness tvsdi values 0 45 in january february march and december while the most severe extent of dryness tvsdi values 0 65 occurred in june july and august in addition multiyear dryness trend analysis results indicate that approximately 36 29 of the conus regions have experienced dryness trends in recent years with the majority of these regions in the western conus especially in the southwest and northwest regions in conclusion this study presented and evaluated an accurate and easy to apply satellite based integrated dryness index that can be used for sm retrieval and dryness monitoring in a variety of geographical regions and natural environments declaration
