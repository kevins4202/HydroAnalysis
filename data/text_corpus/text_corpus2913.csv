employed along with tio2 as photocatalyst the constant dosage of 200 mg l of tio2 photocatalyst was used in the case of combination of hc photocatalytic process 2 5 analytical methods uv spectrophotometer evolution 300 supplied by thermo scientific england was used to observe the removal of ternary dye from aqueous media with progress of degradation time the absorption spectra were scanned in the wavelength λ range of 350 750 nm the major peaks at 464 554 664 nm corresponds to mo rh b and mb dye the decolorization value δabs was calculated by eq 1 1 δ a b s a b s 0 d a b s d a b s 0 d in eq 1 absd is the average of absorbance values at the λmax a b s 0 d and absd correspond to the values before and after the all treatment processes respectively mineralization of mixed dye in aqueous media was determined using the total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu toc lcpn analyzer 3 results discussion 3 1 degradation of ternary dye by hydrodynamic cavitation inlet pressure effect the efficacy of hydrodynamic cavitation in degrading organic pollutant is very much dependent on the various operating conditions such as pressure at inlet of orifice cavitation device cavitation number orifice hole size and physicochemical properties of the liquid hence to evaluate the efficiency of hc in degradation of ternary dye experiments were performed at different operating pressures and at medium ph to optimize the cavitating device in order to get the maximum degradation to optimize the inlet pressure of the cavitating device of given orifice pressures varied from 2 to 8 bar and ph 2 maintained for all experiments fig 3 shows the uv vis absorption spectra of ternary dye treatment using hydrodynamic cavitation it was observed that the inlet pressure of 6 bar to the cavitating device shown maximum decolorization of 28 23 hence in this study the inlet pressure of 6 bar was considered as the optimum pressure for the decolorization of ternary dye optimization of the inlet pressure in hydrodynamic cavitation has been shown in fig 4 it is observed that the decolorization was increased with increasing the inlet pressure from 2 to 6 bar beyond 6 bar pressure decolorization shows the decreasing trend higher decolorization at 6 bar pressure could be due to the inlet pressure at orifice increases the flow rate of wastewater hence the number of passages are higher across the cavitating device for the same time of operation this resultant in the higher decolorization rate of ternary dyes due to increasing in the exposure time of dye molecules in the cavitation zone beyond 6 bar pressure chocked cavitation may occur and leads to the formation of vaporous cavity cloud consists of bubbles the fluid flow carried away these bubbles along the flow without collapse this phenomenon could reduce the oh radical s generation therefore the rate of decolorization reduced with further increasing of pressure beyond 6 bar rajoriya et al 23 studied the effect of inlet pressure and cavitation number on the decolorization rate of rb13 at an inlet pressure from 0 3 to 1 2 mpa using different cavitating devices almost 47 decolorization of rb13 was achieved using only hc with slit venturi as a cavitating device at an optimum inlet pressure of 0 4 mpa in this study authors have used the different cavitation devices such as slit venturi circular venturi and orifice they found that the decolorization rate of rb13 was higher in case of a slit venturi as compared to other cavitating devices whereas the 2 mm of orifice shows the 27 of decolorization of rb13 at the optimized inlet pressure of 0 4 mpa they also found that the decolorization of dye increases up to 0 4 mpa and beyond that pressure decolorization of rb13 dye decreases in case of 2 mm of the orifice throat 3 2 effect of solution ph on removal of ternary dye to observe the effect of solution ph on the removal of ternary dye using hc experiments were performed at different ph ranging from 2 to 9 all the experiments for the study of solution ph were carried at an optimized inlet pressure of 6 bar cv 0 17 fig 5 shows the decolorization of ternary dye using hc at different operating ph the obtained results depict that the decolorization of ternary dye increases from ph 2 to 3 and substantially decreased from the ph 3 to 9 decolorization of 30 56 of ternary dye was achieved at ph 3 whereas 28 23 and 8 3 of decolorization was obtained at ph 2 and 9 respectively the results clearly show that the decolorization of ternary dye was more under acidic ph of the dye solution as compared to basic ph this could be attributed to the fact the acidic ph of the dye solution is more favorable for generation of oh radicals by hc and avoids the oh radicals recombination apart from this the state of the dye molecule i e molecular or ionic state was also greatly affects the decolorization efficiency of dye the acidic ph of the ternary dye made the dye molecules remain present in its molecular state hence at acidic ph ternary dye exist in hydrophobic nature and makes the dye molecules present at the cavity water interface therefore the higher decolorization rate was observed due to generation of oh radicals is maximized whereas under basic ph condition ternary dye attained hydrophilic property thereby remaining in the bulk solution few studies reported in the literature were also observed the similar kind of results that acidic medium of organic pollutants favor the destruction in the presence of cavitation 24 28 patil et al 24 investigated the degradation of methyl parathion in the ph ranging from 2 2 to 8 2 using hydrodynamic cavitation they found that the degradation of methyl parathion was increased with increasing the ph from 2 2 to 3 and then decreases from ph 3 to 8 2 saharan et al 25 was also reported that the decolorization of acid red 88 ar 88 dye increases with a decrease in ph of the dye solution they found that the decolorization of ar 88 dye was lower at basic ph of the dye solution in the presence of hc cai et al 27 have also observed the similar kind of results in the decolorization of orange g using orifice based hc at different ph values from 2 0 to 7 0 3 3 degradation of ternary dye using the combination of hc and h2o2 the experiments using the hybrid process of hc and h2o2 were carried out at 6 bar inlet pressure and the solution ph of 3 the molar ratio of ternary dye h2o2 was varied from 1 5 to 1 50 the degradation reaction rate constant of ternary dye was determined using the following equation 2 ln c o c k t where c is the concentration of dye molecules in mol l co is the initial concentration of ternary dye at time t 0 k is the rate constant in min 1 and t is the time in min fig 6 shows the first order decolorization kinetic of ternary dye using the hybrid process of hc and h2o2 it has been found that the decolorization rate improved with an increase in the molar ratio of ternary dye h2o2 and a maximum decolorization rate of 149 536 10 3 min 1 were achieved at a molar ratio of 1 40 with almost 100 decolorization achieved in 40 min the extent of decolorization of ternary dye and decolorization rate at a different molar ratio of ternary dye h2o2 was given in table 1 the improvement in removal rate at the concentration of h2o2 up to 40 mol then the decolorization rate of ternary dye decreases with higher concentration of h2o2 beyond 40 mol the higher amount of h2o2 addition itself generates the scavenging of the generated oh radicals this could be due to the recombination of oh radicals leads to lower decolorization of ternary dye gore et al 29 also reported that the degradation of reactive orange 4 ro4 dye increased by the addition of h2o2 to the hc beyond 1 30 molar ratio of h2o2 addition they have observed that a degradation of ro4 dye decreases from this study it was also revealed that the optimum dosage of h2o2 exist to maximize the degradation rate of ternary dye in aqueous media using the hc in this study the degradation rate of 2 121 10 3 min 1 using h2o2 alone was achieved with 22 47 decolorization the degradation rate of ternary dye using hc alone was 3 04 10 3 min 1 the synergetic effect of the hybrid process hc h2o2 was evaluated based on the degradation rate constant of the individual and hybrid processes eq 3 has been used to determine the synergetic coefficient of the hc h2o2 process 3 f h c h 2 o 2 k h c h 2 o 2 k h c k h 2 o 2 the degradation rate constants obtained for individual hc individual h2o2 and hc combined with h2o2 results into the synergetic coefficient of 28 97 the synergetic coefficient of 28 97 indicated that h2o2 should be used with a combination of hc for better efficiency in terms of decolorization of mixed dye the significant synergetic effect has been observed due to the generation of additional oh radicals by the dissociation of h2o2 under the effect of hc on the other hand it also noted that the synergetic effect was observed due to the turbulence generated during hc might be decreasing the mass transfer resistance of organic pollutants this results into the efficiency of h2o2 in oxidizing the organic pollutant is high 3 4 degradation of ternary dye using the combination of hc fenton and hc and photo fenton processes the effect of fenton catalyst and hc was investigated by changing molar ratios of ferrous sulphate to h2o2 it was observed that with increasing the quantity of ferrous sulphate dosage substantially increased the degradation rate of ternary dye fig 7 illustrates the pseudo first order degradation reaction kinetics of mixed dye the degradation reaction rate constant of ternary dye using hc fenton process is reported in table 2 from the obtained results it was found that as the ratio of feso4 h2o2 increases the extent of degradation also increases the combined approach of hc fenton process shows 98 28 decolorization at the dosage of 1 30 molar ratio of feso4 when hydrodynamic cavitation and fenton process are combined to treat the ternary dye wastewater then the significant improvement in the rate constant is observed the extent of degradation of ternary dye in the hc due to the addition of fenton s reagent can be attributed to generation of more oh radicals due to the conversion of fe2 to fe3 and subsequent regeneration of ferrous ions under cavitating conditions the kinetic studies revealed that the hc fenton hc fenton and hc photo fenton processes obey the pseudo first order degradation reaction the observed rate constants is follows as standalone hc shows 3 10 3 min 1 fenton process 29 10 3 min 1 and combination of hc fenton process shows 203 10 3 min 1 the value of synergetic coefficient for hc fenton process is found as 6 285 the combination of hc with the photo fenton process was investigated 1 30 molar ratio of feso4 h2o2 for the decolorization of ternary dye the detailed results are reported in fig 8 the mixture of dye degradation shows first order kinetics details of kinetic rate constant are given in table 3 almost 98 degradation of dye mixture is observed with the combination of both the techniques hc photo fenton process individual rate constants for hc and fenton processes are 3 10 3 min 1 57 58 10 3 min 1 respectively the fenton hc process has shown the rate constant of 298 46 10 3 min 1 the synergetic coefficient for hc photo fenton process is found to be as 4 923 3 5 degradation of ternary dye with combination of hc photolytic process in the case of the hybrid process of hc photolytic process it was found that maximum decolorization rate of 11 396 10 3 min 1 with almost 74 53 decolorization in 120 min of operation from fig 9 it was found that the degradation reaction of ternary dye using hc photolytic process follows the pseudo first order kinetics the extent of decolorization and rate of decolorization of ternary dye was shown in table 4 the obtained results demonstrated that the stand alone hc process shows the decolorization rate of 3 04 10 3 min 1 while the photolytic and hc photolytic process shows the decolorization rate of 3 285 10 3 min 1 and 11 396 10 3 min 1 respectively the degradation rate constants obtained for individual hc individual photolytic process and hc combined with photolytic process results into the synergetic coefficient of 1 801 bagal et al 30 also observed that the similar kind of results in degradation of diclofenac sodium using hc combined with uv they reported that the combined hc uv process shows 65 5 degradation of diclofenac sodium and 56 toc reduction with synergetic coefficient of 1 10 the enhanced degradation of ternary dye in this study can be attributed to the improved generation of oh radicals when combined hc with uv process 3 6 degradation of ternary dye with hc photocatalytic process the performance of the hybrid system i e hc photocatalysis on the extent of decolorization of ternary dye was studied and the obtained results are depicted in fig 10 an experiment was conducted using hc photocatalysis at the 200 mg l of tio2 catalyst loading inlet pressure of 6 bar and ph 3 the reason for choosing 200 mg l of tio2 due to many of the studies 30 31 was reported that the most effective decomposition of methyle blue and rhodamine b dye was observed at 0 2 g l 200 mg l of tio2 using photocatalysis hence based on the literature in this study 200 mg l of tio2 used as optimum loading for the degradation of ternary dye it was observed that the extent of decolorization of ternary dye increased by coupling photocatalysis with hc this could be due to the generation of microjets during the hc facilitates the periodical cleaning of catalyst surface de agglomeration of catalyst and enhanced catalyst surface the obtained results show that the maximum decolorization rate of 14 35 10 3 min 1 with 82 13 decolorization in 120 min using hybrid process of hc photocatalytic process the extent of decolorization and the rate of decolorization of ternary dye was shown in table 5 it was observed that the rate constant of decolorization of ternary dye in hc alone shows 3 04 10 3 min 1 whereas the photocatalytic process and hc photocatalytic process were shown 3 755 10 3 min 1 and 14 35 10 3 min 1 respectively fig 10 depicted that degradation follows the pseudo first order kinetic for hc photocatalytic process the degradation rate constants obtained for individual hc individual photolytic process and hc combined with photolytic process results into the synergetic coefficient of 2 11 the synergetic effect has been observed might be due to the turbulence created by the hc increases the mass transfer rates as well as provides better contact between the catalyst surface and the reactants obtaining the low value of synergetic coefficient could be due to the cavitating device and uv irradiation placed at different places so that degradation occurring sequentially instead of subsequently in the combined process of hc photocatalytic process the obtained results in this study were also match with the results obtained by bagal et al 32 they found that the optimum loading of 0 2 g l tio2 in hc uv tio2 process shows the 79 4 and 64 extent of degradation and toc reduction respectively they reported that the synergistic index of hc uv tio2 showed 1 43 3 7 mineralization study mineralization is the complete oxidation of dye molecule into co2 h2o and intermediates these intermediates are expected to be aromatic compounds which also accounts for the toc of the solution in order to understand the quantitative degradation of organic carbon in the aqueous solution toc analysis has been carried out at every time interval samples aliquots were collected and carried out the toc analysis the extent of mineralization of organic pollutants in various systems such as hc alone hc combined with h2o2 fenton photo fenton photolytic photocatalytic process were studied at the optimized conditions the obtained mineralization data was shown in table 6 it was observed that 8 53 of reduction in toc were found using the hc alone the extent of mineralization of toc was increased from 8 53 to 16 95 with the addition of 1 40 dye h2o2 h2o2 at ph 3 the combination of the hc with fenton process shows the toc removal of 38 42 and further it was increases 41 28 when the hc coupled with photo fenton process the extent of toc removal was observed could be due the generation of more oh radicals when the addition of uv light to the hc fenton process lower toc removal was observed in the case of hc photolytic process and hc photocatalytic is 14 01 and 15 63 respectively 4 conclusion the treatment of ternary dye solution using hc combined with different aop s has been investigated the following important conclusions have been established for the treatment of ternary dye solution from the result it can be concluded that the degradation of three dyes in hc process depends on pin at orifice and ph of the dye solution the recommended optimum conditions for removal of ternary dye found to be 6 bar inlet pressure and ph 3 coupling of various aop s h2o2 fenton photo fenton photolytic and photocatalysis with hc has been observed to intensify the decolorization degradation of ternary dye due to the generation of turbulence and additional oh radicals the degradation rate constants obtained for individual hc individual h2o2 and hc combined with h2o2 results into the synergetic coefficient of 28 97 and 16 95 reduction in toc of the original hc fenton and hc fenton process shows the degradation rate of 3 10 3 min 1 29 10 3 min 1 and 203 10 3 min 1 respectively the synergetic coefficient of 6 28 and 38 42 of toc removal was obtained with hc fenton process individual rate constants for hc and photo fenton processes are 3 10 3 min 1 57 58 10 3 min respectively the hc photo fenton process has shown the rate constant of 298 46 10 3 min 1 the synergetic coefficient for hc photo fenton process is found to be 4 923 hc coupled with photo fenton process shows the highest toc removal of 41 28 compared to other hybrid aop s the degradation rate constants obtained for individual hc individual photolytic process and hc combined with photolytic process results into the synergetic coefficient of 1 801 and 14 01 of toc removal it was observed that the rate constant of decolorization of ternary dye in hc alone shows 3 04 10 3 min 1 whereas the photocatalytic process and hc photocatalytic process were shown 3 755 10 3 min 1 and 14 35 10 3 min 1 respectively the degradation rate constants obtained for individual hc individual photocatalytic process and hc combined with photocatalytic process results into the synergetic coefficient of 2 11 and 15 63 of reduction in toc finally it was concluded that the best combination for removal of ternary dye is hc h2o2 due to its highest synergetic effect of 28 974 complete decolorization of ternary dye can be possible with the addition of h2o2 in the hc the addition of h2o2 during hc enhances the decolorization of ternary due to production of additional oh radicals for the oxidation of dye

employed along with tio2 as photocatalyst the constant dosage of 200 mg l of tio2 photocatalyst was used in the case of combination of hc photocatalytic process 2 5 analytical methods uv spectrophotometer evolution 300 supplied by thermo scientific england was used to observe the removal of ternary dye from aqueous media with progress of degradation time the absorption spectra were scanned in the wavelength λ range of 350 750 nm the major peaks at 464 554 664 nm corresponds to mo rh b and mb dye the decolorization value δabs was calculated by eq 1 1 δ a b s a b s 0 d a b s d a b s 0 d in eq 1 absd is the average of absorbance values at the λmax a b s 0 d and absd correspond to the values before and after the all treatment processes respectively mineralization of mixed dye in aqueous media was determined using the total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu toc lcpn analyzer 3 results discussion 3 1 degradation of ternary dye by hydrodynamic cavitation inlet pressure effect the efficacy of hydrodynamic cavitation in degrading organic pollutant is very much dependent on the various operating conditions such as pressure at inlet of orifice cavitation device cavitation number orifice hole size and physicochemical properties of the liquid hence to evaluate the efficiency of hc in degradation of ternary dye experiments were performed at different operating pressures and at medium ph to optimize the cavitating device in order to get the maximum degradation to optimize the inlet pressure of the cavitating device of given orifice pressures varied from 2 to 8 bar and ph 2 maintained for all experiments fig 3 shows the uv vis absorption spectra of ternary dye treatment using hydrodynamic cavitation it was observed that the inlet pressure of 6 bar to the cavitating device shown maximum decolorization of 28 23 hence in this study the inlet pressure of 6 bar was considered as the optimum pressure for the decolorization of ternary dye optimization of the inlet pressure in hydrodynamic cavitation has been shown in fig 4 it is observed that the decolorization was increased with increasing the inlet pressure from 2 to 6 bar beyond 6 bar pressure decolorization shows the decreasing trend higher decolorization at 6 bar pressure could be due to the inlet pressure at orifice increases the flow rate of wastewater hence the number of passages are higher across the cavitating device for the same time of operation this resultant in the higher decolorization rate of ternary dyes due to increasing in the exposure time of dye molecules in the cavitation zone beyond 6 bar pressure chocked cavitation may occur and leads to the formation of vaporous cavity cloud consists of bubbles the fluid flow carried away these bubbles along the flow without collapse this phenomenon could reduce the oh radical s generation therefore the rate of decolorization reduced with further increasing of pressure beyond 6 bar rajoriya et al 23 studied the effect of inlet pressure and cavitation number on the decolorization rate of rb13 at an inlet pressure from 0 3 to 1 2 mpa using different cavitating devices almost 47 decolorization of rb13 was achieved using only hc with slit venturi as a cavitating device at an optimum inlet pressure of 0 4 mpa in this study authors have used the different cavitation devices such as slit venturi circular venturi and orifice they found that the decolorization rate of rb13 was higher in case of a slit venturi as compared to other cavitating devices whereas the 2 mm of orifice shows the 27 of decolorization of rb13 at the optimized inlet pressure of 0 4 mpa they also found that the decolorization of dye increases up to 0 4 mpa and beyond that pressure decolorization of rb13 dye decreases in case of 2 mm of the orifice throat 3 2 effect of solution ph on removal of ternary dye to observe the effect of solution ph on the removal of ternary dye using hc experiments were performed at different ph ranging from 2 to 9 all the experiments for the study of solution ph were carried at an optimized inlet pressure of 6 bar cv 0 17 fig 5 shows the decolorization of ternary dye using hc at different operating ph the obtained results depict that the decolorization of ternary dye increases from ph 2 to 3 and substantially decreased from the ph 3 to 9 decolorization of 30 56 of ternary dye was achieved at ph 3 whereas 28 23 and 8 3 of decolorization was obtained at ph 2 and 9 respectively the results clearly show that the decolorization of ternary dye was more under acidic ph of the dye solution as compared to basic ph this could be attributed to the fact the acidic ph of the dye solution is more favorable for generation of oh radicals by hc and avoids the oh radicals recombination apart from this the state of the dye molecule i e molecular or ionic state was also greatly affects the decolorization efficiency of dye the acidic ph of the ternary dye made the dye molecules remain present in its molecular state hence at acidic ph ternary dye exist in hydrophobic nature and makes the dye molecules present at the cavity water interface therefore the higher decolorization rate was observed due to generation of oh radicals is maximized whereas under basic ph condition ternary dye attained hydrophilic property thereby remaining in the bulk solution few studies reported in the literature were also observed the similar kind of results that acidic medium of organic pollutants favor the destruction in the presence of cavitation 24 28 patil et al 24 investigated the degradation of methyl parathion in the ph ranging from 2 2 to 8 2 using hydrodynamic cavitation they found that the degradation of methyl parathion was increased with increasing the ph from 2 2 to 3 and then decreases from ph 3 to 8 2 saharan et al 25 was also reported that the decolorization of acid red 88 ar 88 dye increases with a decrease in ph of the dye solution they found that the decolorization of ar 88 dye was lower at basic ph of the dye solution in the presence of hc cai et al 27 have also observed the similar kind of results in the decolorization of orange g using orifice based hc at different ph values from 2 0 to 7 0 3 3 degradation of ternary dye using the combination of hc and h2o2 the experiments using the hybrid process of hc and h2o2 were carried out at 6 bar inlet pressure and the solution ph of 3 the molar ratio of ternary dye h2o2 was varied from 1 5 to 1 50 the degradation reaction rate constant of ternary dye was determined using the following equation 2 ln c o c k t where c is the concentration of dye molecules in mol l co is the initial concentration of ternary dye at time t 0 k is the rate constant in min 1 and t is the time in min fig 6 shows the first order decolorization kinetic of ternary dye using the hybrid process of hc and h2o2 it has been found that the decolorization rate improved with an increase in the molar ratio of ternary dye h2o2 and a maximum decolorization rate of 149 536 10 3 min 1 were achieved at a molar ratio of 1 40 with almost 100 decolorization achieved in 40 min the extent of decolorization of ternary dye and decolorization rate at a different molar ratio of ternary dye h2o2 was given in table 1 the improvement in removal rate at the concentration of h2o2 up to 40 mol then the decolorization rate of ternary dye decreases with higher concentration of h2o2 beyond 40 mol the higher amount of h2o2 addition itself generates the scavenging of the generated oh radicals this could be due to the recombination of oh radicals leads to lower decolorization of ternary dye gore et al 29 also reported that the degradation of reactive orange 4 ro4 dye increased by the addition of h2o2 to the hc beyond 1 30 molar ratio of h2o2 addition they have observed that a degradation of ro4 dye decreases from this study it was also revealed that the optimum dosage of h2o2 exist to maximize the degradation rate of ternary dye in aqueous media using the hc in this study the degradation rate of 2 121 10 3 min 1 using h2o2 alone was achieved with 22 47 decolorization the degradation rate of ternary dye using hc alone was 3 04 10 3 min 1 the synergetic effect of the hybrid process hc h2o2 was evaluated based on the degradation rate constant of the individual and hybrid processes eq 3 has been used to determine the synergetic coefficient of the hc h2o2 process 3 f h c h 2 o 2 k h c h 2 o 2 k h c k h 2 o 2 the degradation rate constants obtained for individual hc individual h2o2 and hc combined with h2o2 results into the synergetic coefficient of 28 97 the synergetic coefficient of 28 97 indicated that h2o2 should be used with a combination of hc for better efficiency in terms of decolorization of mixed dye the significant synergetic effect has been observed due to the generation of additional oh radicals by the dissociation of h2o2 under the effect of hc on the other hand it also noted that the synergetic effect was observed due to the turbulence generated during hc might be decreasing the mass transfer resistance of organic pollutants this results into the efficiency of h2o2 in oxidizing the organic pollutant is high 3 4 degradation of ternary dye using the combination of hc fenton and hc and photo fenton processes the effect of fenton catalyst and hc was investigated by changing molar ratios of ferrous sulphate to h2o2 it was observed that with increasing the quantity of ferrous sulphate dosage substantially increased the degradation rate of ternary dye fig 7 illustrates the pseudo first order degradation reaction kinetics of mixed dye the degradation reaction rate constant of ternary dye using hc fenton process is reported in table 2 from the obtained results it was found that as the ratio of feso4 h2o2 increases the extent of degradation also increases the combined approach of hc fenton process shows 98 28 decolorization at the dosage of 1 30 molar ratio of feso4 when hydrodynamic cavitation and fenton process are combined to treat the ternary dye wastewater then the significant improvement in the rate constant is observed the extent of degradation of ternary dye in the hc due to the addition of fenton s reagent can be attributed to generation of more oh radicals due to the conversion of fe2 to fe3 and subsequent regeneration of ferrous ions under cavitating conditions the kinetic studies revealed that the hc fenton hc fenton and hc photo fenton processes obey the pseudo first order degradation reaction the observed rate constants is follows as standalone hc shows 3 10 3 min 1 fenton process 29 10 3 min 1 and combination of hc fenton process shows 203 10 3 min 1 the value of synergetic coefficient for hc fenton process is found as 6 285 the combination of hc with the photo fenton process was investigated 1 30 molar ratio of feso4 h2o2 for the decolorization of ternary dye the detailed results are reported in fig 8 the mixture of dye degradation shows first order kinetics details of kinetic rate constant are given in table 3 almost 98 degradation of dye mixture is observed with the combination of both the techniques hc photo fenton process individual rate constants for hc and fenton processes are 3 10 3 min 1 57 58 10 3 min 1 respectively the fenton hc process has shown the rate constant of 298 46 10 3 min 1 the synergetic coefficient for hc photo fenton process is found to be as 4 923 3 5 degradation of ternary dye with combination of hc photolytic process in the case of the hybrid process of hc photolytic process it was found that maximum decolorization rate of 11 396 10 3 min 1 with almost 74 53 decolorization in 120 min of operation from fig 9 it was found that the degradation reaction of ternary dye using hc photolytic process follows the pseudo first order kinetics the extent of decolorization and rate of decolorization of ternary dye was shown in table 4 the obtained results demonstrated that the stand alone hc process shows the decolorization rate of 3 04 10 3 min 1 while the photolytic and hc photolytic process shows the decolorization rate of 3 285 10 3 min 1 and 11 396 10 3 min 1 respectively the degradation rate constants obtained for individual hc individual photolytic process and hc combined with photolytic process results into the synergetic coefficient of 1 801 bagal et al 30 also observed that the similar kind of results in degradation of diclofenac sodium using hc combined with uv they reported that the combined hc uv process shows 65 5 degradation of diclofenac sodium and 56 toc reduction with synergetic coefficient of 1 10 the enhanced degradation of ternary dye in this study can be attributed to the improved generation of oh radicals when combined hc with uv process 3 6 degradation of ternary dye with hc photocatalytic process the performance of the hybrid system i e hc photocatalysis on the extent of decolorization of ternary dye was studied and the obtained results are depicted in fig 10 an experiment was conducted using hc photocatalysis at the 200 mg l of tio2 catalyst loading inlet pressure of 6 bar and ph 3 the reason for choosing 200 mg l of tio2 due to many of the studies 30 31 was reported that the most effective decomposition of methyle blue and rhodamine b dye was observed at 0 2 g l 200 mg l of tio2 using photocatalysis hence based on the literature in this study 200 mg l of tio2 used as optimum loading for the degradation of ternary dye it was observed that the extent of decolorization of ternary dye increased by coupling photocatalysis with hc this could be due to the generation of microjets during the hc facilitates the periodical cleaning of catalyst surface de agglomeration of catalyst and enhanced catalyst surface the obtained results show that the maximum decolorization rate of 14 35 10 3 min 1 with 82 13 decolorization in 120 min using hybrid process of hc photocatalytic process the extent of decolorization and the rate of decolorization of ternary dye was shown in table 5 it was observed that the rate constant of decolorization of ternary dye in hc alone shows 3 04 10 3 min 1 whereas the photocatalytic process and hc photocatalytic process were shown 3 755 10 3 min 1 and 14 35 10 3 min 1 respectively fig 10 depicted that degradation follows the pseudo first order kinetic for hc photocatalytic process the degradation rate constants obtained for individual hc individual photolytic process and hc combined with photolytic process results into the synergetic coefficient of 2 11 the synergetic effect has been observed might be due to the turbulence created by the hc increases the mass transfer rates as well as provides better contact between the catalyst surface and the reactants obtaining the low value of synergetic coefficient could be due to the cavitating device and uv irradiation placed at different places so that degradation occurring sequentially instead of subsequently in the combined process of hc photocatalytic process the obtained results in this study were also match with the results obtained by bagal et al 32 they found that the optimum loading of 0 2 g l tio2 in hc uv tio2 process shows the 79 4 and 64 extent of degradation and toc reduction respectively they reported that the synergistic index of hc uv tio2 showed 1 43 3 7 mineralization study mineralization is the complete oxidation of dye molecule into co2 h2o and intermediates these intermediates are expected to be aromatic compounds which also accounts for the toc of the solution in order to understand the quantitative degradation of organic carbon in the aqueous solution toc analysis has been carried out at every time interval samples aliquots were collected and carried out the toc analysis the extent of mineralization of organic pollutants in various systems such as hc alone hc combined with h2o2 fenton photo fenton photolytic photocatalytic process were studied at the optimized conditions the obtained mineralization data was shown in table 6 it was observed that 8 53 of reduction in toc were found using the hc alone the extent of mineralization of toc was increased from 8 53 to 16 95 with the addition of 1 40 dye h2o2 h2o2 at ph 3 the combination of the hc with fenton process shows the toc removal of 38 42 and further it was increases 41 28 when the hc coupled with photo fenton process the extent of toc removal was observed could be due the generation of more oh radicals when the addition of uv light to the hc fenton process lower toc removal was observed in the case of hc photolytic process and hc photocatalytic is 14 01 and 15 63 respectively 4 conclusion the treatment of ternary dye solution using hc combined with different aop s has been investigated the following important conclusions have been established for the treatment of ternary dye solution from the result it can be concluded that the degradation of three dyes in hc process depends on pin at orifice and ph of the dye solution the recommended optimum conditions for removal of ternary dye found to be 6 bar inlet pressure and ph 3 coupling of various aop s h2o2 fenton photo fenton photolytic and photocatalysis with hc has been observed to intensify the decolorization degradation of ternary dye due to the generation of turbulence and additional oh radicals the degradation rate constants obtained for individual hc individual h2o2 and hc combined with h2o2 results into the synergetic coefficient of 28 97 and 16 95 reduction in toc of the original hc fenton and hc fenton process shows the degradation rate of 3 10 3 min 1 29 10 3 min 1 and 203 10 3 min 1 respectively the synergetic coefficient of 6 28 and 38 42 of toc removal was obtained with hc fenton process individual rate constants for hc and photo fenton processes are 3 10 3 min 1 57 58 10 3 min respectively the hc photo fenton process has shown the rate constant of 298 46 10 3 min 1 the synergetic coefficient for hc photo fenton process is found to be 4 923 hc coupled with photo fenton process shows the highest toc removal of 41 28 compared to other hybrid aop s the degradation rate constants obtained for individual hc individual photolytic process and hc combined with photolytic process results into the synergetic coefficient of 1 801 and 14 01 of toc removal it was observed that the rate constant of decolorization of ternary dye in hc alone shows 3 04 10 3 min 1 whereas the photocatalytic process and hc photocatalytic process were shown 3 755 10 3 min 1 and 14 35 10 3 min 1 respectively the degradation rate constants obtained for individual hc individual photocatalytic process and hc combined with photocatalytic process results into the synergetic coefficient of 2 11 and 15 63 of reduction in toc finally it was concluded that the best combination for removal of ternary dye is hc h2o2 due to its highest synergetic effect of 28 974 complete decolorization of ternary dye can be possible with the addition of h2o2 in the hc the addition of h2o2 during hc enhances the decolorization of ternary due to production of additional oh radicals for the oxidation of dye 
14566,barium ions found in wastewaters cause incrustation on membrane separation equipment used in desalination systems in this study barium removal by precipitation is addressed considering excess sulfate addition as a means of reducing barium concentration in solution and depleting baso4 supersaturation precipitation is conducted with synthetic wastewater in semicontinuous mode for low excess sulfate an induction time of a few hours is observed as the excess sulfate is increased and or as barium sulfate seeds are added precipitation proceeds within a few minutes besides the excess sulfate improves barium ion removal due to the common ion effect residual supersaturation ratios were found to lie within the range of 1 1 3 these values were associated with a fourth order dependency of the molecular growth rate with the supersaturation ratio calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate dihydrate were found to be ineffective heterogeneous seeds to barium sulfate precipitation calcium ions were found to inhibit baso4 precipitation blocking the process at a high residual supersaturation ratio of 4 5 for a sufficiently large initial supersaturation the solution approaches equilibrium after 180 min keywords barium sulfate precipitation residual supersaturation excess sulfate addition calcium foreign ion heterogeneous seeding 1 introduction barium sulfate baso4 is found in rock formations and hence in surface groundwater and in many industrial aqueous effluents when such an effluent solution is treated aiming at water reuse barium may precipitate causing scaling most often scaling occurs in the desalination step in a membrane separation system such as reverse osmosis or reversal electrodialysis baso4 scaling jeopardizes pumps damages membranes and clogs pipelines often causing irreversible damage scaling takes place because the solution fed to membrane operations is usually supersaturated besides the supersaturation further increases within the brine compartment of the membranes because of the concomitant removal of pure water from the solution in order to minimize scaling feed solutions to membrane operations should display low barium concentration recommended feed concentration of barium for a membrane separation system may be as low as 15 μg l in seawaters 5 μg l in brackish waters or even 2 μg l if sulfuric acid is dosed to brackish waters 1 however barium concentrations found in superficial waters or wastewaters are in the order of hundreds of micrograms per liter 2 4 emphasizing the need to remove barium prior to membrane treatment it is also desirable that the feed solution supersaturation be as low as possible to reduce its scaling tendency therefore any barium removal treatment should aim at depletion of both barium concentration and supersaturation in order to remove barium ions from solution chemical softening may be applied upstream the membrane operation 2 5 6 3 7 in this process the ph is increased by base addition thereby decreasing the solubility of caco3 and inducing its precipitation barium is removed from the bulk solution together with caco3 by a sorption process such as isomorphic substitution within the caco3 crystal lattice or by adsorption 8 10 after solids separation the solution is acidified to prevent caco3 scaling this process however may be quite expensive due to alkaline and acid reactants addition and may be inefficient for feed streams with low calcium and carbonate concentrations to circumvent these problems baso4 precipitation may also be conducted without reactants and independently of the amount of calcium and carbonate in the feed solution by seeding with barite crystals as shown by bremere et al 11 and bremere et al 12 in a fixed bed reactor and by kügler et al 13 in a mixed vessel however the residual barium concentration after seeding may be still too high considering its potential to promote scaling in downstream membrane operations in order to circumvent the inconveniences of ba2 removal by softening and by seeding the addition of sulfate ions may be an attractive option due to the common ion effect the final ba2 concentration may be reduced in principle to a very low value by appropriate choice of the sulfate to barium molar ratio besides supersaturation depletion to near equilibrium is feasible as will be shown here in order to develop such a process option for processing of wastewater one has to understand the precipitation of baso4 under highly non stoichiometric conditions in the literature the sulfate to barium molar ratio is rarely higher than 10 1 boerlage et al are one of the few scholars who have analyzed the baso4 precipitation for a sulfate to barium molar ratio of 1000 1 which corresponds to conditions found in surface waters and industrial effluents they have investigated barium sulfate solubility 14 as well as nucleation and growth kinetics 15 in experiments with industrial and synthetic reverse osmosis concentrates they have concluded that long induction times associated to scale formation in reverse osmosis are due to the low kinetics of baso4 precipitation they have also found that organic matter neither prolongs the induction time nor influences baso4 solubility but it does impair crystal growth rates a high baso4 non stoichiometry has been found to lower the growth rate as calcium ions are always present in wastewaters it is useful to consider its influence on baso4 precipitation in the absence of organic additives ca2 retards the precipitation of baso4 16 according to jones et al 17 calcium concentrations up to 2 5 10 4 m delays barium sulfate formation by an ionic strength effect which increases the baso4 solubility and decreases its supersaturation above 1 25 10 3 m calcium for ba so4 in stoichiometric ratio crystallization is inhibited beyond the expected from the ionic strength effect alone in this case incorporation of calcium may occur in the crystalline structure of baso4 causing an increase of the crystal internal energy making it more soluble and unstable and or may occur on the baso4 surface poisoning the crystal growth 17 indeed barium sulfate can support up to 6 calcium substitution for barium ions in its crystal lattice grahmann cited by hennessy and graham 18 kelland 19 has also found that calcium ions inhibit the precipitation of baso4 while redfern and parker 20 have detected by atomistic simulations that caso4 overgrowth upon baso4 crystals is energetically unfavorable they have noticed deformations caused by calcium on the crystalline structure of baso4 with high effect on surface energy in general literature for barium sulfate precipitation from non stoichiometric solutions focuses on the particle size distribution the mean particle size the particle morphology 21 25 and on the precipitation kinetics 26 30 contributions dealing with barium sulfate for water treatment usually consider the percent barium removal and the barium concentration of the treated water however little attention has so far been paid to the residual supersaturation after treatment bremere et al 11 have determined the supersaturation depletion in seeded baso4 precipitation whereas metzger and kind 31 have calculated the supersaturation depletion from a computational fluid dynamics approach for baso4 precipitation in a confined impinging jet mixer to the authors knowledge no contribution has been found so far about baso4 precipitation time for conditions of high sulfate to barium ratio and presence of calcium foreign ions or barium sulfate seeds therefore these conditions which are relevant for wastewater treatment will be explored next the sulfate to barium molar ratio will vary within the molar range of 1 500 to 1 46300 the calcium concentration will vary within the range of 1 75 10 3 to 5 37 10 3 m baso4 precipitation in the presence of barium sulfate seeds and of heterogeneous particles caco3 and caso4 will be considered as well the ionic strength will be within the range of 0 003 0 313 m to mimic conditions found in wastewaters barium sulfate precipitation will be analyzed in terms of equilibrium mechanistic and kinetic considerations process performance in relation to the scaling potential of the treated water will be addressed in terms of the barium concentration and the residual supersaturation of the treated water 2 background 2 1 thermodynamics of precipitation the supersaturation ratio s represents the driving force for the precipitation process in a solution containing baso4 s may be calculated by eq 2

other components such as calcium and carbonate additional species and ion pairs are formed in such cases the speciation model in minteq 3 1 software may be conveniently applied for determination of the supersaturation ratio s 2 2 barium sulfate nucleation the primary nucleation rate b in s 1 m 3 represents the number of nuclei generated in a unit time interval per unit solvent volume 7 b k e x p

represents the interfacial free energy of formation of the cluster vm is the molecular volume and t is the temperature the primary nucleation rate b is critically dependent on the supersaturation as eqs 7 and 8 show it is a random unpredictable phenomenon with low probability at low supersaturation therefore although primary nucleation is thermodynamically feasible at any supersaturation a critical level of supersaturation is required for crystallization to occur spontaneously within a specified timescale for barium and sulfate in stoichiometric proportions in water an s of 10 2 is estimated from literature data 36 such critical level may be represented by the so called metastable limit line in the phase diagram as shown in fig 1 the region of the phase diagram located between this line and the solubility line is known as the metastable zone in this region primary nucleation is unlikely only crystal growth and sometimes secondary nucleation takes place 35 in the region above the metastable zone limit called the labile zone spontaneous primary nucleation occurs the induction time is defined as the time elapsed between the creation of supersaturation and the appearance of the new solid phase of a detectable macroscopic volume 2 3 barium sulfate crystal growth rate slightly soluble electrolytes such baso4 at low supersaturation grow primarily by a spiral growth mechanism as supersaturation increases 2d nucleation mediated growth becomes dominant for even higher values of supersaturation diffusion becomes the controlling mechanism for crystal growth 37 the relationships between the rate of linear growth glin and the supersaturation ratio s for these mechanisms are given by eqs 9 and 10 where l is the crystal size kg is the growth rate constant which is independent of s and directly related to the solubility g is growth order and b2d is the surface nucleation rate 9 g l i n d l d t k g s 1 g 10 g l i n k g s 1 2 3 s 1 3 e x p b 2 d l n s eq 9 with

represented by eq 9 considering g an effective order of the growth process usually g 2 so all growth mechanisms may be expressed by eq 9 table 1 shows the crystal growth mechanisms for the baso4 h2o system which prevail for the given ranges of s and of the surface area of seeds aseed m2 l or seeds concentration cseed mg l for relatively low values of supersaturation ratio usually s 6 van leeuwen 38 has grown baso4 by spiral growth yielding g 2 and kg 2 8 10 10 boerlage et al 15 with non stoichiometric concentrations so4 2 ba2 molar ratio of about 1000 has found g 2 but a smaller growth constant of kg 4 9 10 14 as the supersaturation ratio increases typically 4 s 32 2d nucleation mediated growth mechanism with a variety of reaction growth orders 3 g 6 have been reported for nancollas and purdie 27 and liu et al 39 however besides the supersaturation a low amount of added seeds aseed 0 430 m2 l leads to a mechanism of surface nucleation liu et al 39 have observed for s 6 18 an initial period of 5 min with fast crystal growth during this period the effective growth order g is between 3 and 4 as might be expected for a 2d nucleation mediated growth process thereafter under low supersaturation a spiral growth mechanism g 2 prevails nielsen 43 has reported a reaction order of g 4 for s up to 32 5 whereas for s 32 5 the controlling mechanism is volume diffusion for supersaturation ratios up to a limit of s 6 van leeuwen 38 has considered spiral mechanism but above this limit the mechanism changes straight to diffusion control with g 1 and kg 1 4 10 9 2 4 crystal size and solubility molecules on the surface of a crystal do not have complete and homogeneously satisfied intermolecular interactions so it can be said that they are in a state of tension considering the pressure in the crystal and in the liquid phase as p c and p f respectively when the crystal radius r decreases p c increases also rising the crystal surface energy σ sl consequently small crystals are more soluble than the large ones this effect which is significant for crystals in the submicron size range is expressed by the ostwald freundlich equation 11 x e q r x e q e x p 2 σ s l v

seeds and the slow sulfate solution feed rate are thought to prevent the solution from exceeding the metastable limit so primary nucleation is neglected b 0 secondary nucleation is also neglected as

3 and 4 the baso4 supersaturation ratio s is calculated with eq 2 using the just determined free ions concentrations and activity coefficients 4 experimental 4 1 precipitation equipment and procedure precipitation experiments were conducted in semi continuous mode initially the reactor was filled with 400 ml of a solution prepared with bacl2 2h2o nacl and in some cases cacl2 2h2o seeds of baso4 caco3 or caso4 2h2o were allowed to equilibrate with the solution in the reactor during 20 min prior to reactant addition the reaction was initiated by slowly pumping 100 ml of na2so4 aqueous solution through an inlet pipe at a flow rate of 0 83 ml s the final volume of solution was 500 ml all reagents were analytical grade the suspension was stirred at 300 r p m and the temperature was 25 c the bench scale unit comprised a cylindrical rounded bottom jacketed glass reactor with 1l volume and 10 cm diameter a thermostatic bath quimis q214s and an agitation system ika rw20 n with four 45 pitched blade impellers of 5 cm in diameter and positioned at 2 cm from the crystallizer bottom a peristaltic pump provitec dm 5900 ax d fed the sulfate solution to the reactor through a pipe with 0 3 mm in internal diameter which ended at the same depth as the stirrer blades 4 2 sampling and analysis in all experiments samples of crystallization suspensions were collected with disposable syringes 10 ml several samples were withdrawn in each experiment in order to follow the precipitation of baso4 over the reaction time the filled syringes were connected to disposable filters gvs of cellulose acetate with 25 mm in diameter and a pore size of 0 20 μm in order to wash the filter 2 ml of solution were filtered and discarded thereafter 8 ml of solution were filtered and stored in falcon tubes 15 ml each falcon tube was then acidified with three or four droplets of concentrated nitric acid 65 p a and stored at 10 c for chemical analysis the acidification procedure was considered sufficient to keep the barium in solution since the presence of solids in the samples would heavily interfere with the reproducibility of icp analysis or even prevent measurement by clogging of capillaries of the instrument which has never been observed besides in some situations the measurements matched the known initial concentrations which would not happen in case of precipitation precipitation of baso4 was followed by determining the barium concentration in solution over time quantitative analysis was made by inductively coupled plasma spectrophotometry spectroflame chemical equilibria for determination of supersaturation ratios s and solution compositions were calculated with visual minteq 3 1 software 4 3 experimental conditions semi continuous precipitation experiments were conducted with barium and sodium chloride concentrations similar to those commonly found in aqueous effluents of oil refineries sulfate concentrations intentionally exceeded commonly found values here 110 mg l is taken as a representative value in order to promote ba precipitation by the common ion effect tables 2 and 3 show the initial concentrations and the initial nominal concentrations of all ions respectively both definitions are based on process conditions after reactant addition assuming no precipitation however initial values disregard contribution from seeds dissolution whereas nominal values take seeds dissolution into account table 3 shows initial nominal ionic strength sulfate to barium and calcium to barium molar ratios in solution and initial nominal supersaturation ratios s for unseeded experiments the initial and initial nominal s coincide since there is no increase of the concentrations values by seeds dissolution for seeded experiments the initial nominal s is larger than the initial s due to seeds dissolution however the initial nominal s is equal to the actual initial s only when the induction time is longer than the time for reactants addition otherwise the initial nominal s is higher the actual value 4 4 seeds characterization in most batches baso4 seed crystals were aged in a solution containing bacl2 2h2o and nacl for 20 min prior to precipitation caco3 and caso4 2h2o seeds were added to 60 ml milli q water without agitation for seven days prior to use baso4 seeds in the reactor were suspensions of 1 or 10 g l calcite and gypsum seeds were 0 3125 g l caco3 and 2 5810 g l caso4 2h2o suspensions these suspension densities yielded the same superficial area as 1 g l of baso4 after correction for the particles size and solubility mean specific particle surfaces were estimated from images fig 2 taken with a field emission scanning electron microscope jeol jsm 7401f they were 8 33 10 11 m2 for analytical grade baso4 1 42 10 11 m2 for caco3 and 4 13 10 10 m2 for caso4 2h2o 5 experimental results 5 1 excess sulfate semi continuous barium sulfate precipitation by sulfate addition was studied the initial barium concentration varied within the range of 300 400 μg l and the background electrolyte sodium chloride concentration was 584 mg l while the sulfate concentration underwent a wide variation tables 2 and 3 experiments o n and m no seeds were present fig 3 a shows the soluble barium concentration during the precipitation reaction versus time for an initial so4 concentration of 1070 mg l corresponding to a supersaturation ratio s of 7 15 an induction time of about 1 h was observed as the barium concentration remained constant at its initial value of 400 μg l dropping thereafter fig 3 b which displays the baso4 supersaturation ratio versus time shows that even after 45 h the reaction was not complete since the supersaturation ratio s was much above the equilibrium value of 1 for an initial concentration of 9716 so4 mg l corresponding to an s value of 8 68 the barium concentration dropped within two minutes or less from 300 μg l initial nominal values of concentration and supersaturation are not shown on the graph to a steady low value of about 30 μg l which corresponds to a supersaturation ratio s of 3 it is possible that such residual supersaturation was due to the formation of small crystals of high solubility according to the gibbs thomson effect wong et al 21 have found that smaller barium sulfate crystals are obtained at larger sulfate to barium ratios they have found particle sizes of 20 μm and 3 5 μm when the sulfate to barium molar ratio was stoichiometric and 15 1 respectively in our experiments this ratio was in excess of 3826 1 so even smaller crystals were likely unfortunately given the extremely low solids concentrations it was not possible to measure the crystal size in fig 3 a vastly difference on induction time was observed for the two runs one with sulfate ion of 1070 and s of 7 15 the other with 9716 mg l and s of 8 68 the nucleation mechanism might be different in the two supersaturation ratios but a single mechanism homogeneous or heterogeneous might also explain the results given the exponential dependence of primary nucleation rate with s whatever the primary nucleation mechanism the induction time decreases with the supersaturation in order to distinguish homogeneous from heterogeneous nucleation measurements at several supersaturation values would be needed for baso4 homogeneous primary nucleation has been observed only at much larger s values s 23 6 34 so it may be assumed that here the mechanism was heterogeneous nucleation 5 2 seeding with baso4 seeded baso4 precipitation with varying seeds concentration was studied considering a small sulfate reactant addition initial concentration of 110 mg l which is representative of values commonly found in industrial effluents see experiments a b and c in table 2 as seeds were allowed to equilibrate with the solution for 20 min partial dissolution of the seeds resulted in barium and sulfate initial nominal concentrations of respectively 2073 μg l and 111 mg l in solution after the so4 reactant addition see table 3 the nacl nominal concentration was 584 mg l fig 4 a shows that for 1 g l seeds the barium concentration dropped steeply in the first 10 min of reaction and decreased slowly thereafter the initial nominal value of 2073 μg l is not given in the figure only the concentrations after 2 5 min of reaction equilibrium was not reached even after 1000s when the residual supersaturation ratio s was still 1 1 fig 4b bremere et al 11 have obtained a similar residual supersaturation ratio s 1 2 for a baso4 desupersaturation system consisting of a fixed bed reactor filled with barite seeds with a residence time of 8 min kügler et al 13 have also found that equilibrium was not approached within a monitored time of about 5 h however in our experiments with 10 g l we observed that the concentration drop was faster and that equilibrium was approached within 2 5 min seeded precipitation with various amounts of added so4 ions are considered next the so4 initial nominal concentration was in the range of 111 9718 mg l and the reaction occurred in the presence of 1 g l of baso4 seeds as before the nacl concentration was 584 mg l and barium initial nominal concentration was 2073 μg l due to partial seeds dissolution with the increase on sulfate concentration the initial drop in soluble barium concentration was faster as shown in fig 5 a a larger excess sulfate also yielded a lower final barium concentration as expected from the common ion effect as the sulfate concentration increased the supersaturation ratio s dropped faster reaching 1 1 after only 2 min of reaction for the highest sulfate addition fig 5b in all sulfate additions the residual supersaturation ratio s of 1 1 was reached after 1000 min it is possible that the final s was even lower than 1 1 since for concentration values lower than 5 μg l the icp analytical quantitative determination becomes less accurate comparison between seeded and unseeded precipitation reveals a striking difference in seeded precipitation an so4 initial nominal concentration of only 111 mg l was sufficient to bring the system close to equilibrium within 2 5 min whereas in unseeded precipitation more than 1072 mg l of so4 was needed to reach a similar desupersaturation rate 5 3 ionic strength baso4 precipitation with varying ionic strength 584 and 0 nacl mg l experiments a b and d in tables 2 and 3 is shown in fig 6 a and b the reaction occurred in the presence of 1 g l of baso4 seeds the ba initial nominal concentrations were respectively 2073 and 1386 μg l in the presence and absence of nacl electrolyte the so4 initial nominal concentration was 111 mg l the initial supersaturation for the high ionic strength case was slightly lower than for low ionic strength 7 67 and 7 78 respectively nacl electrolyte was found to cause an increase in the soluble barium concentration after precipitation fig 6a besides the solution approached equilibrium at a lower rate fig 6b therefore a high ionic strength resulted in a high baso4 solubility and possibly a slower kinetics the good reproducibility for the high ionic strength conditions experiments a and b respectively suggests that these effects are not due to methodological error a slower crystal growth at high ionic strength was confirmed by modeling see section 6 5 4 ca2 ions baso4 precipitation in the presence of varying amounts of ca2 and so4 2 ions is shown in fig 7 and tables 2 and 3 experiments f p and q thermodynamic modeling showed that gypsum is not formed in these 1 g l baso4 seeded experiments the initial nominal sulfate concentration was 1072 mg l and the nacl added was adjusted in order to fix the ionic strength with varying cacl2 addition calcium ions were found to inhibit baso4 precipitation for experiments with 70 and 215 mg l calcium the initial barium concentration dropped from their initial nominal value of 2073 μg l to the approximate value of 200 μg l within 60 min whereas in the absence of ca ions the ba nominal concentration dropped to 18 μg l within 2 min experiment f fig 7b shows the supersaturation ratio s versus time of reaction irrespective of the calcium concentration in the beginning of the reaction the supersaturation dropped rapidly from the starting nominal value s of 16 not shown in the figure it is concluded that calcium ions retard the crystal growth rate for s 5 and virtually block the rate as s approaches a value of 5 as the sulfate initial nominal concentration increased from 1072 to 2374 experiments p and r respectively in tables 2 and 3 the soluble barium concentration decreased at the same rate in the first few minutes as shown in fig 8 a this is an unexpected result given the initial supersaturation also increases with the sulfate concentration s 16 1 to 19 1 it appears that calcium more strongly hinders precipitation in larger excess sulfate possibly because of the lower barium concentration at chemical equilibrium by the common ion effect which increases the ca2 ba2 molar ratio after the first few minutes the ba nominal concentration dropped further until after 180 min of reaction a steady value of 100 μg l was reached this value was lower than the one attained from a lower so4 addition final ba 200 μg l as expected from the common ion effect fig 8b shows that the final condition corresponded to a lower residual supersaturation ratio s of 4 compared to s 5 for lower sulfate addition as the sulfate concentration was further increased from 1072 to 9718 mg l experiments q and s in tables 2 and 3 just as before the soluble barium concentration decreased at a lower pace in the first two minutes and continued to drop to a lower value fig 9 a in this case however the system approached equilibrium s 1 after a few hours fig 9b by considering the various calcium and sulfate concentrations described figs 7 9 calcium ions addition resulted in a slower removal of barium ion from solution followed by barium concentration stabilization at a residual supersaturation with respect to barium sulfate as the initial supersaturation ratio increased by increasing the sulfate concentration the residual supersaturation ratio decreased this behavior may be consequence of primary nucleation at higher supersaturation which originates an additional crystal surface area of variable surface structure providing more growth sites and reducing the impact of seed poisoning for a sufficiently large initial supersaturation the solution approached equilibrium after 180 min we hypothesize that calcium ions reduce the precipitation rate due to calcium adsorption upon barium sulfate surfaces and or incorporation into the crystal structure whereas its effects on solubility by ionic strength increase with cacl2 addition are less important jones et al 17 observed the same behavior during baso4 precipitation from stoichiometric solutions for calcium concentrations above 50 mg l 5 5 seeding with caso4 2h2o and caco3 in an attempt to reduce the cost and the environmental impact of seeding with baso4 semi continuous experiments with heterogeneous seeding were conducted tables 2 and 3 experiments k l and o gypsum caso4 2h2o was chosen because it is abundantly found as industrial construction waste and because it provides free so4 2 ions upon partial dissolution the initial concentrations were 362 μg l of barium and 584 mg l of nacl calcium and sulfate ion concentrations in solution prior to sulfate addition corresponded to the solubility of gypsum speciation modeling yielded a caso4 2h2o solubility of 1 334 10 2 m that corresponded to 533 mg l ca and 1281 mg l so4 consequently after sulfate addition of 1070 mg l the sulfate initial nominal concentration raised to 2352 mg l so4 leading to an initial nominal supersaturation ratio s of 7 32 which was somewhat higher than in the absence of gypsum seeds s 6 70 the time evolution of barium ion concentration and of baso4 supersaturation are shown respectively in fig 10 a and b for both the seeded and unseeded experiments it reveals that caso4 2h2o heterogeneous seeding did not substantially increase the rate of baso4 precipitation this result may be explained by recognizing that gypsum is not an effective surface for heterogeneous primary nucleation of baso4 a similar behavior has been found by kügler et al 13 for silica particles which were also ineffective heterogeneous seeds for barium sulfate precipitation for supersaturation values up to s of 24 5 it is also possible that the low crystal growth rate associated with calcium ions in solution may have contributed to the ineffectiveness of the gypsum seeds finally one concludes that barium ions adsorption upon gypsum surfaces which might favor barium removal is negligible isomorphic substitution of barium ions into gypsum lattice which might also favor barium removal is unlikely as the solution is only saturated with respect to gypsum caco3 particles with a calcite structure were also considered as heterogeneous seeds for baso4 precipitation since this material is readily available at low cost and has a large specific surface area due to a small particle size for these experiments the initial concentration was 330 μg l for barium 584 mg l for nacl and 1070 mg l for sulfate seeds partial dissolution took place prior to sulfate addition at equilibrium speciation modeling yielded a ph of 9 89 and 6 5 mg l ca carbonate and ph measurements in separate experiments with the same reactor not shown revealed that the modeling represents well the physics of the systems besides such experiments show that the ph and carbonate concentrations do not change throughout barium sulfate precipitation because co2 absorbed from the air in the reactor headspace is negligible fig 10 shows that upon the addition of sulfate an induction period was observed showing that calcite just like gypsum was not an effective surface for heterogeneous primary nucleation of baso4 besides soluble barium concentration decreases more slowly with time than in the absence of caco3 seeds this may be attributed either to the higher ph of 9 89 against a ph of 7 in other experiments or to the presence of 6 5 mg l ca2 hampering barium sulfate crystal growth finally one concludes that barium ions adsorption upon calcite surfaces which might favor barium removal is negligible isomorphic substitution of barium ions into calcite lattice which might also favor barium removal is unlikely as the solution is only saturated with respect to calcite 6 precipitation simulations baso4 semi continuous precipitation was simulated for various sulfate to barium ratios seed loads and ion strength values using the same conditions of the experiments a c d f and i given in table 2 only seeded experiments were considered to comply with the hypothesis of negligible primary nucleation in summary the initial volume of solution inside the reactor vsol was 400 ml the bacl2 concentration was 2 73 10 6 m in some experiments 1 25 10 2 m nacl was added additionally 0 5 or 5 g of baso4 seeds were added and allowed to partially dissolve until equilibrium which corresponded to 2073 μg l dissolved barium thereafter the total volume of suspension was gradually increased with the addition of 0 83 ml s na2so4 reactant until a final volume of 100 ml the na2so4 concentration was adjusted to yield initial nominal concentrations of 111 1072 or 9718 mg l so4 in each time interval δt of 0 6s the moments of the particle size distribution m 0 t m 1 t m 2 t and m 3 t and the components concentrations in solution c ba c so4 c na and c cl were recalculated considering the barium sulfate crystal growth rate and the speciation of barium and sulfate ions in solution for each time interval the supersaturation ratio s was determined and used to calculate the crystal growth rate a fourth order crystal growth rate g 4 was the best fit to the experimentally determined barium concentrations such a high order might be caused by impurities hampering growth however impurities in these experiments are estimated to be in concentrations of a few parts per billion or less making this hypothesis unlikely therefore one concludes that the high crystal growth order was caused by the growth mechanism of superficial 2 d nucleation as was observed elsewhere 43 27 39 the growth rate parameter kg found for 111 1072 and 9718 mg l sulfate were respectively 5 10 12 4 10 13 and 6 10 13 m s the growth parameters thus decreased one order of magnitude and then stabilized as the excess sulfate increased such decreasing value of kg with an increasing so4 ba molar ratio was first reported by boerlage et al 15 the model simulations and the experimental results are compared in fig 11 fig 11a shows the dissolved barium and fig 11b the baso4 supersaturation ratio over the reaction time the high order g 4 explains why the barium removal did not progress until chemical equilibrium for seeds concentration of 1 g l giving rise to a residual supersaturation higher than 1 1 fig 11b for all of the initial nominal sulfate concentrations the model did not fit the data appropriately for the highest sulfate addition it is hypothesized that this difference was caused by primary nucleation which was not taken into account in the model in this simulation the supersaturation ratio reached a value of 7 3 fig 11b which was the highest among all conditions investigated besides this supersaturation value might be sufficient to trigger primary nucleation as our unseeded experiments suggest in these experiments fig 3 a supersaturation ratio of 7 15 yielded a long induction time whereas an s value of 8 68 resulted in instantaneous nucleation the model simulations and the experimental results for two ionic strengths are shown in fig 12 for the higher ionic strength the concentration after 100 min precipitation time was higher which may be explained by the correspondingly higher solubility not shown a fourth order crystal growth rate was found with kg of 5 10 12 and 1 10 11 for the higher and the lower ionic strength respectively suggesting that the ionic strength also reduced the crystal growth rate precipitation kinetics for seeds concentrations of 1 and 10 g l are also shown in fig 12 a reasonable fit was found with the parameters just described for 10 g l the simulations showed a small delay when compared to the experimental results but represented well the low supersaturation s 1 02 found at later stages therefore both model and experiments showed that increasing the superficial area of the seeds is a suitable tool to rapidly approach saturation 7 conclusions barium removal from synthetic solutions of a typical industrial wastewater composition was studied by batchwise addition of excess sulfate an induction time of a few hours is observed for an initial nominal supersaturation ratio s of 7 15 or lower excess sulfate of 1072 mg l so4 or lower by increasing s to 8 7 9716 mg l so4 primary nucleation and crystal growth proceeds within a few minutes but a residual s of about 3 remains for a few hours seeding with caco3 or caso4 2h2o does not accelerate precipitation showing that these compounds do not act as heterogenous seeds for baso4 precipitation by seeding with baso4 on the contrary barium residual supersaturation is greatly reduced in a few minutes of reaction for a low seeds concentration of 1 g l a residual s of 1 1 remains for a few hours whereas for 10 g l seeds equilibrium is approached within a few minutes in seeded precipitation an so4 initial nominal concentration of only 111 mg l s of 7 7 is sufficient to bring the system close to equilibrium within 2 5 min whereas in unseeded precipitation more than 1072 mg l of so4 s of 8 7 is needed to reach a similar desupersaturation rate calcium ions retard the removal of barium ions from solution and blocks the process at a high residual s with respect to barium sulfate 4 s 5 as the initial s increases the residual s decreases for a sufficiently large initial s of 25 4 the solution approaches equilibrium after 180 min we have also found that calcium more strongly hinders the precipitation process as the excess sulfate increases in the range of 111 9718 mg l so4 2 we hypothesize that calcium ions reduce the precipitation rate due to calcium adsorption upon barium sulfate surfaces and or incorporation into the crystal structure whereas their effects on solubility are less important kinetic modeling of batchwise seeded precipitation of barium sulfate has shown that barium sulfate crystal growth is 4th order with respect to the supersaturation ratio s consistent with a 2d nucleation growth mechanism such high order explains the observed residual supersaturation ratio values higher than 1 1 the growth rate decreases with an increasing so4 ba molar ratio the ionic strength slows down the crystal growth rate and enhances the solubility of barium

14566,barium ions found in wastewaters cause incrustation on membrane separation equipment used in desalination systems in this study barium removal by precipitation is addressed considering excess sulfate addition as a means of reducing barium concentration in solution and depleting baso4 supersaturation precipitation is conducted with synthetic wastewater in semicontinuous mode for low excess sulfate an induction time of a few hours is observed as the excess sulfate is increased and or as barium sulfate seeds are added precipitation proceeds within a few minutes besides the excess sulfate improves barium ion removal due to the common ion effect residual supersaturation ratios were found to lie within the range of 1 1 3 these values were associated with a fourth order dependency of the molecular growth rate with the supersaturation ratio calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate dihydrate were found to be ineffective heterogeneous seeds to barium sulfate precipitation calcium ions were found to inhibit baso4 precipitation blocking the process at a high residual supersaturation ratio of 4 5 for a sufficiently large initial supersaturation the solution approaches equilibrium after 180 min keywords barium sulfate precipitation residual supersaturation excess sulfate addition calcium foreign ion heterogeneous seeding 1 introduction barium sulfate baso4 is found in rock formations and hence in surface groundwater and in many industrial aqueous effluents when such an effluent solution is treated aiming at water reuse barium may precipitate causing scaling most often scaling occurs in the desalination step in a membrane separation system such as reverse osmosis or reversal electrodialysis baso4 scaling jeopardizes pumps damages membranes and clogs pipelines often causing irreversible damage scaling takes place because the solution fed to membrane operations is usually supersaturated besides the supersaturation further increases within the brine compartment of the membranes because of the concomitant removal of pure water from the solution in order to minimize scaling feed solutions to membrane operations should display low barium concentration recommended feed concentration of barium for a membrane separation system may be as low as 15 μg l in seawaters 5 μg l in brackish waters or even 2 μg l if sulfuric acid is dosed to brackish waters 1 however barium concentrations found in superficial waters or wastewaters are in the order of hundreds of micrograms per liter 2 4 emphasizing the need to remove barium prior to membrane treatment it is also desirable that the feed solution supersaturation be as low as possible to reduce its scaling tendency therefore any barium removal treatment should aim at depletion of both barium concentration and supersaturation in order to remove barium ions from solution chemical softening may be applied upstream the membrane operation 2 5 6 3 7 in this process the ph is increased by base addition thereby decreasing the solubility of caco3 and inducing its precipitation barium is removed from the bulk solution together with caco3 by a sorption process such as isomorphic substitution within the caco3 crystal lattice or by adsorption 8 10 after solids separation the solution is acidified to prevent caco3 scaling this process however may be quite expensive due to alkaline and acid reactants addition and may be inefficient for feed streams with low calcium and carbonate concentrations to circumvent these problems baso4 precipitation may also be conducted without reactants and independently of the amount of calcium and carbonate in the feed solution by seeding with barite crystals as shown by bremere et al 11 and bremere et al 12 in a fixed bed reactor and by kügler et al 13 in a mixed vessel however the residual barium concentration after seeding may be still too high considering its potential to promote scaling in downstream membrane operations in order to circumvent the inconveniences of ba2 removal by softening and by seeding the addition of sulfate ions may be an attractive option due to the common ion effect the final ba2 concentration may be reduced in principle to a very low value by appropriate choice of the sulfate to barium molar ratio besides supersaturation depletion to near equilibrium is feasible as will be shown here in order to develop such a process option for processing of wastewater one has to understand the precipitation of baso4 under highly non stoichiometric conditions in the literature the sulfate to barium molar ratio is rarely higher than 10 1 boerlage et al are one of the few scholars who have analyzed the baso4 precipitation for a sulfate to barium molar ratio of 1000 1 which corresponds to conditions found in surface waters and industrial effluents they have investigated barium sulfate solubility 14 as well as nucleation and growth kinetics 15 in experiments with industrial and synthetic reverse osmosis concentrates they have concluded that long induction times associated to scale formation in reverse osmosis are due to the low kinetics of baso4 precipitation they have also found that organic matter neither prolongs the induction time nor influences baso4 solubility but it does impair crystal growth rates a high baso4 non stoichiometry has been found to lower the growth rate as calcium ions are always present in wastewaters it is useful to consider its influence on baso4 precipitation in the absence of organic additives ca2 retards the precipitation of baso4 16 according to jones et al 17 calcium concentrations up to 2 5 10 4 m delays barium sulfate formation by an ionic strength effect which increases the baso4 solubility and decreases its supersaturation above 1 25 10 3 m calcium for ba so4 in stoichiometric ratio crystallization is inhibited beyond the expected from the ionic strength effect alone in this case incorporation of calcium may occur in the crystalline structure of baso4 causing an increase of the crystal internal energy making it more soluble and unstable and or may occur on the baso4 surface poisoning the crystal growth 17 indeed barium sulfate can support up to 6 calcium substitution for barium ions in its crystal lattice grahmann cited by hennessy and graham 18 kelland 19 has also found that calcium ions inhibit the precipitation of baso4 while redfern and parker 20 have detected by atomistic simulations that caso4 overgrowth upon baso4 crystals is energetically unfavorable they have noticed deformations caused by calcium on the crystalline structure of baso4 with high effect on surface energy in general literature for barium sulfate precipitation from non stoichiometric solutions focuses on the particle size distribution the mean particle size the particle morphology 21 25 and on the precipitation kinetics 26 30 contributions dealing with barium sulfate for water treatment usually consider the percent barium removal and the barium concentration of the treated water however little attention has so far been paid to the residual supersaturation after treatment bremere et al 11 have determined the supersaturation depletion in seeded baso4 precipitation whereas metzger and kind 31 have calculated the supersaturation depletion from a computational fluid dynamics approach for baso4 precipitation in a confined impinging jet mixer to the authors knowledge no contribution has been found so far about baso4 precipitation time for conditions of high sulfate to barium ratio and presence of calcium foreign ions or barium sulfate seeds therefore these conditions which are relevant for wastewater treatment will be explored next the sulfate to barium molar ratio will vary within the molar range of 1 500 to 1 46300 the calcium concentration will vary within the range of 1 75 10 3 to 5 37 10 3 m baso4 precipitation in the presence of barium sulfate seeds and of heterogeneous particles caco3 and caso4 will be considered as well the ionic strength will be within the range of 0 003 0 313 m to mimic conditions found in wastewaters barium sulfate precipitation will be analyzed in terms of equilibrium mechanistic and kinetic considerations process performance in relation to the scaling potential of the treated water will be addressed in terms of the barium concentration and the residual supersaturation of the treated

other components such as calcium and carbonate additional species and ion pairs are formed in such cases the speciation model in minteq 3 1 software may be conveniently applied for determination of the supersaturation ratio s 2 2 barium sulfate nucleation the primary nucleation rate b in s 1 m 3 represents the number of nuclei generated in a unit time interval per unit solvent volume 7 b k e x p δ g k t where k is the nucleation rate constant and k is the boltzmann constant δg is the gibbs free energy change to form a nucleus 35 given by 8 δ g 16 π γ 3 v m 2 3 k 2 t 2 l n s 2 where γ represents the interfacial free energy of formation of the cluster vm is the molecular volume and t is the temperature the primary nucleation rate b is critically dependent on the supersaturation as eqs 7 and 8 show it is a random unpredictable phenomenon with low probability at low supersaturation therefore although primary nucleation is thermodynamically feasible at any supersaturation a critical level of supersaturation is required for crystallization to occur spontaneously within a specified timescale for barium and sulfate in stoichiometric proportions in water an s of 10 2 is estimated from literature data 36 such critical level may be represented by the so called metastable limit line in the phase diagram as shown in fig 1 the region of the phase diagram located between this line and the solubility line is known as the metastable zone in this region primary nucleation is unlikely only crystal growth and sometimes secondary nucleation takes place 35 in the region above the metastable zone limit called the labile zone spontaneous primary nucleation occurs the induction time is defined as the time elapsed between the creation of supersaturation and the appearance of the new solid phase of a detectable macroscopic volume 2 3 barium sulfate crystal growth rate slightly soluble electrolytes such baso4 at low supersaturation grow primarily by a spiral growth mechanism as supersaturation increases 2d nucleation mediated growth becomes dominant for even higher values of supersaturation diffusion becomes the controlling mechanism for crystal growth 37 the relationships between the rate of linear growth glin and the supersaturation ratio s for these mechanisms are given by eqs 9 and 10 where l is the crystal size kg is the growth rate constant which is independent of s and directly related to the solubility g is growth order and b2d is the surface nucleation rate 9 g l i n d l d t k g s 1 g 10 g l i n k g s 1 2 3 s 1 3 e x p b 2 d l n s eq 9 with g 2 represents spiral growth whereas g 1 is applicable to diffusion controlled growth eq 10 is applied to 2d nucleation mediated growth for simplicity the 2d nucleation mediated growth rate may be represented by eq 9 considering g an effective order of the growth process usually g 2 so all growth mechanisms may be expressed by eq 9 table 1 shows the crystal growth mechanisms for the baso4 h2o system which prevail for the given ranges of s and of the surface area of seeds aseed m2 l or seeds concentration cseed mg l for relatively low values of supersaturation ratio usually s 6 van leeuwen 38 has grown baso4 by spiral growth yielding g 2 and kg 2 8 10 10 boerlage et al 15 with non stoichiometric concentrations so4 2 ba2 molar ratio of about 1000 has found g 2 but a smaller growth constant of kg 4 9 10 14 as the supersaturation ratio increases typically 4 s 32 2d nucleation mediated growth mechanism with a variety of reaction growth orders 3 g 6 have been reported for nancollas and purdie 27 and liu et al 39 however besides the supersaturation a low amount of added seeds aseed 0 430 m2 l leads to a mechanism of surface nucleation liu et al 39 have observed for s 6 18 an initial period of 5 min with fast crystal growth during this period the effective growth order g is between 3 and 4 as might be expected for a 2d nucleation mediated growth process thereafter under low supersaturation a spiral growth mechanism g 2 prevails nielsen 43 has reported a reaction order of g 4 for s up to 32 5 whereas for s 32 5 the controlling mechanism is volume diffusion for supersaturation ratios up to a limit of s 6 van leeuwen 38 has considered spiral mechanism but above this limit the mechanism changes straight to diffusion control with g 1 and kg 1 4 10 9 2 4 crystal size and solubility molecules on the surface of a crystal do not have complete and homogeneously satisfied intermolecular interactions so it can be said that they are in a state of tension considering the pressure in the crystal and in the liquid phase as p c and p f respectively when the crystal radius r decreases p c increases also rising the crystal surface energy σ sl consequently small crystals are more soluble than the large ones this effect which is significant for crystals in the submicron size range is expressed by the ostwald freundlich equation 11 x e q r x e q e x p 2 σ s l v

quantity ka m 2 gives the particles surface area m 2 m 3 and the quantity kv m 3 is the volume of particles m 3 m 3 higher moments mj j 3 do not have a straightforward physical meaning the presence of seeds and the slow sulfate solution feed rate are thought to prevent the solution from exceeding the metastable limit so primary nucleation is neglected b 0 secondary nucleation is also neglected as the solids content is low and the particles are small the crystal growth rate is given by eq 9 with known kinetic parameters the supersaturation ratio s is determined from mass balances as explained

3 and 4 the baso4 supersaturation ratio s is calculated with eq 2 using the just determined free ions concentrations and activity coefficients 4 experimental 4 1 precipitation equipment and procedure precipitation experiments were conducted in semi continuous mode initially the reactor was filled with 400 ml of a solution prepared with bacl2 2h2o nacl and in some cases cacl2 2h2o seeds of baso4 caco3 or caso4 2h2o were allowed to equilibrate with the solution in the reactor during 20 min prior to reactant addition the reaction was initiated by slowly pumping 100 ml of na2so4 aqueous solution through an inlet pipe at a flow rate of 0 83 ml s the final volume of solution was 500 ml all reagents were analytical grade the suspension was stirred at 300 r p m and the temperature was 25 c the bench scale unit comprised a cylindrical rounded bottom jacketed glass reactor with 1l volume and 10 cm diameter a thermostatic bath quimis q214s and an agitation system ika rw20 n with four 45 pitched blade impellers of 5 cm in diameter and positioned at 2 cm from the crystallizer bottom a peristaltic pump provitec dm 5900 ax d fed the sulfate solution to the reactor through a pipe with 0 3 mm in internal diameter which ended at the same depth as the stirrer blades 4 2 sampling and analysis in all experiments samples of crystallization suspensions were collected with disposable syringes 10 ml several samples were withdrawn in each experiment in order to follow the precipitation of baso4 over the reaction time the filled syringes were connected to disposable filters gvs of cellulose acetate with 25 mm in diameter and a pore size of 0 20 μm in order to wash the filter 2 ml of solution were filtered and discarded thereafter 8 ml of solution were filtered and stored in falcon tubes 15 ml each falcon tube was then acidified with three or four droplets of concentrated nitric acid 65 p a and stored at 10 c for chemical analysis the acidification procedure was considered sufficient to keep the barium in solution since the presence of solids in the samples would heavily interfere with the reproducibility of icp analysis or even prevent measurement by clogging of capillaries of the instrument which has never been observed besides in some situations the measurements matched the known initial concentrations which would not happen in case of precipitation precipitation of baso4 was followed by determining the barium concentration in solution over time quantitative analysis was made by inductively coupled plasma spectrophotometry spectroflame chemical equilibria for determination of supersaturation ratios s and solution compositions were calculated with visual minteq 3 1 software 4 3 experimental conditions semi continuous precipitation experiments were conducted with barium and sodium chloride concentrations similar to those commonly found in aqueous effluents of oil refineries sulfate concentrations intentionally exceeded commonly found values here 110 mg l is taken as a representative value in order to promote ba precipitation by the common ion effect tables 2 and 3 show the initial concentrations and the initial nominal concentrations of all ions respectively both definitions are based on process conditions after reactant addition assuming no precipitation however initial values disregard contribution from seeds dissolution whereas nominal values take seeds dissolution into account table 3 shows initial nominal ionic strength sulfate to barium and calcium to barium molar ratios in solution and initial nominal supersaturation ratios s for unseeded experiments the initial and initial nominal s coincide since there is no increase of the concentrations values by seeds dissolution for seeded experiments the initial nominal s is larger than the initial s due to seeds dissolution however the initial nominal s is equal to the actual initial s only when the induction time is longer than the time for reactants addition otherwise the initial nominal s is higher the actual value 4 4 seeds characterization in most batches baso4 seed crystals were aged in a solution containing bacl2 2h2o and nacl for 20 min prior to precipitation caco3 and caso4 2h2o seeds were added to 60 ml milli q water without agitation for seven days prior to use baso4 seeds in the reactor were suspensions of 1 or 10 g l calcite and gypsum seeds were 0 3125 g l caco3 and 2 5810 g l caso4 2h2o suspensions these suspension densities yielded the same superficial area as 1 g l of baso4 after correction for the particles size and solubility mean specific particle surfaces were estimated from images fig 2 taken with a field emission scanning electron microscope jeol jsm 7401f they were 8 33 10 11 m2 for analytical grade baso4 1 42 10 11 m2 for caco3 and 4 13 10 10 m2 for caso4 2h2o 5 experimental results 5 1 excess sulfate semi continuous barium sulfate precipitation by sulfate addition was studied the initial barium concentration varied within the range of 300 400 μg l and the background electrolyte sodium chloride concentration was 584 mg l while the sulfate concentration underwent a wide variation tables 2 and 3 experiments o n and m no seeds were present fig 3 a shows the soluble barium concentration during the precipitation reaction versus time for an initial so4 concentration of 1070 mg l corresponding to a supersaturation ratio s of 7 15 an induction time of about 1 h was observed as the barium concentration remained constant at its initial value of 400 μg l dropping thereafter fig 3 b which displays the baso4 supersaturation ratio versus time shows that even after 45 h the reaction was not complete since the supersaturation ratio s was much above the equilibrium value of 1 for an initial concentration of 9716 so4 mg l corresponding to an s value of 8 68 the barium concentration dropped within two minutes or less from 300 μg l initial nominal values of concentration and supersaturation are not shown on the graph to a steady low value of about 30 μg l which corresponds to a supersaturation ratio s of 3 it is possible that such residual supersaturation was due to the formation of small crystals of high solubility according to the gibbs thomson effect wong et al 21 have found that smaller barium sulfate crystals are obtained at larger sulfate to barium ratios they have found particle sizes of 20 μm and 3 5 μm when the sulfate to barium molar ratio was stoichiometric and 15 1 respectively in our experiments this ratio was in excess of 3826 1 so even smaller crystals were likely unfortunately given the extremely low solids concentrations it was not possible to measure the crystal size in fig 3 a vastly difference on induction time was observed for the two runs one with sulfate ion of 1070 and s of 7 15 the other with 9716 mg l and s of 8 68 the nucleation mechanism might be different in the two supersaturation ratios but a single mechanism homogeneous or heterogeneous might also explain the results given the exponential dependence of primary nucleation rate with s whatever the primary nucleation mechanism the induction time decreases with the supersaturation in order to distinguish homogeneous from heterogeneous nucleation measurements at several supersaturation values would be needed for baso4 homogeneous primary nucleation has been observed only at much larger s values s 23 6 34 so it may be assumed that here the mechanism was heterogeneous nucleation 5 2 seeding with baso4 seeded baso4 precipitation with varying seeds concentration was studied considering a small sulfate reactant addition initial concentration of 110 mg l which is representative of values commonly found in industrial effluents see experiments a b and c in table 2 as seeds were allowed to equilibrate with the solution for 20 min partial dissolution of the seeds resulted in barium and sulfate initial nominal concentrations of respectively 2073 μg l and 111 mg l in solution after the so4 reactant addition see table 3 the nacl nominal concentration was 584 mg l fig 4 a shows that for 1 g l seeds the barium concentration dropped steeply in the first 10 min of reaction and decreased slowly thereafter the initial nominal value of 2073 μg l is not given in the figure only the concentrations after 2 5 min of reaction equilibrium was not reached even after 1000s when the residual supersaturation ratio s was still 1 1 fig 4b bremere et al 11 have obtained a similar residual supersaturation ratio s 1 2 for a baso4 desupersaturation system consisting of a fixed bed reactor filled with barite seeds with a residence time of 8 min kügler et al 13 have also found that equilibrium was not approached within a monitored time of about 5 h however in our experiments with 10 g l we observed that the concentration drop was faster and that equilibrium was approached within 2 5 min seeded precipitation with various amounts of added so4 ions are considered next the so4 initial nominal concentration was in the range of 111 9718 mg l and the reaction occurred in the presence of 1 g l of baso4 seeds as before the nacl concentration was 584 mg l and barium initial nominal concentration was 2073 μg l due to partial seeds dissolution with the increase on sulfate concentration the initial drop in soluble barium concentration was faster as shown in fig 5 a a larger excess sulfate also yielded a lower final barium concentration as expected from the common ion effect as the sulfate concentration increased the supersaturation ratio s dropped faster reaching 1 1 after only 2 min of reaction for the highest sulfate addition fig 5b in all sulfate additions the residual supersaturation ratio s of 1 1 was reached after 1000 min it is possible that the final s was even lower than 1 1 since for concentration values lower than 5 μg l the icp analytical quantitative determination becomes less accurate comparison between seeded and unseeded precipitation reveals a striking difference in seeded precipitation an so4 initial nominal concentration of only 111 mg l was sufficient to bring the system close to equilibrium within 2 5 min whereas in unseeded precipitation more than 1072 mg l of so4 was needed to reach a similar desupersaturation rate 5 3 ionic strength baso4 precipitation with varying ionic strength 584 and 0 nacl mg l experiments a b and d in tables 2 and 3 is shown in fig 6 a and b the reaction occurred in the presence of 1 g l of baso4 seeds the ba initial nominal concentrations were respectively 2073 and 1386 μg l in the presence and absence of nacl electrolyte the so4 initial nominal concentration was 111 mg l the initial supersaturation for the high ionic strength case was slightly lower than for low ionic strength 7 67 and 7 78 respectively nacl electrolyte was found to cause an increase in the soluble barium concentration after precipitation fig 6a besides the solution approached equilibrium at a lower rate fig 6b therefore a high ionic strength resulted in a high baso4 solubility and possibly a slower kinetics the good reproducibility for the high ionic strength conditions experiments a and b respectively suggests that these effects are not due to methodological error a slower crystal growth at high ionic strength was confirmed by modeling see section 6 5 4 ca2 ions baso4 precipitation in the presence of varying amounts of ca2 and so4 2 ions is shown in fig 7 and tables 2 and 3 experiments f p and q thermodynamic modeling showed that gypsum is not formed in these 1 g l baso4 seeded experiments the initial nominal sulfate concentration was 1072 mg l and the nacl added was adjusted in order to fix the ionic strength with varying cacl2 addition calcium ions were found to inhibit baso4 precipitation for experiments with 70 and 215 mg l calcium the initial barium concentration dropped from their initial nominal value of 2073 μg l to the approximate value of 200 μg l within 60 min whereas in the absence of ca ions the ba nominal concentration dropped to 18 μg l within 2 min experiment f fig 7b shows the supersaturation ratio s versus time of reaction irrespective of the calcium concentration in the beginning of the reaction the supersaturation dropped rapidly from the starting nominal value s of 16 not shown in the figure it is concluded that calcium ions retard the crystal growth rate for s 5 and virtually block the rate as s approaches a value of 5 as the sulfate initial nominal concentration increased from 1072 to 2374 experiments p and r respectively in tables 2 and 3 the soluble barium concentration decreased at the same rate in the first few minutes as shown in fig 8 a this is an unexpected result given the initial supersaturation also increases with the sulfate concentration s 16 1 to 19 1 it appears that calcium more strongly hinders precipitation in larger excess sulfate possibly because of the lower barium concentration at chemical equilibrium by the common ion effect which increases the ca2 ba2 molar ratio after the first few minutes the ba nominal concentration dropped further until after 180 min of reaction a steady value of 100 μg l was reached this value was lower than the one attained from a lower so4 addition final ba 200 μg l as expected from the common ion effect fig 8b shows that the final condition corresponded to a lower residual supersaturation ratio s of 4 compared to s 5 for lower sulfate addition as the sulfate concentration was further increased from 1072 to 9718 mg l experiments q and s in tables 2 and 3 just as before the soluble barium concentration decreased at a lower pace in the first two minutes and continued to drop to a lower value fig 9 a in this case however the system approached equilibrium s 1 after a few hours fig 9b by considering the various calcium and sulfate concentrations described figs 7 9 calcium ions addition resulted in a slower removal of barium ion from solution followed by barium concentration stabilization at a residual supersaturation with respect to barium sulfate as the initial supersaturation ratio increased by increasing the sulfate concentration the residual supersaturation ratio decreased this behavior may be consequence of primary nucleation at higher supersaturation which originates an additional crystal surface area of variable surface structure providing more growth sites and reducing the impact of seed poisoning for a sufficiently large initial supersaturation the solution approached equilibrium after 180 min we hypothesize that calcium ions reduce the precipitation rate due to calcium adsorption upon barium sulfate surfaces and or incorporation into the crystal structure whereas its effects on solubility by ionic strength increase with cacl2 addition are less important jones et al 17 observed the same behavior during baso4 precipitation from stoichiometric solutions for calcium concentrations above 50 mg l 5 5 seeding with caso4 2h2o and caco3 in an attempt to reduce the cost and the environmental impact of seeding with baso4 semi continuous experiments with heterogeneous seeding were conducted tables 2 and 3 experiments k l and o gypsum caso4 2h2o was chosen because it is abundantly found as industrial construction waste and because it provides free so4 2 ions upon partial dissolution the initial concentrations were 362 μg l of barium and 584 mg l of nacl calcium and sulfate ion concentrations in solution prior to sulfate addition corresponded to the solubility of gypsum speciation modeling yielded a caso4 2h2o solubility of 1 334 10 2 m that corresponded to 533 mg l ca and 1281 mg l so4 consequently after sulfate addition of 1070 mg l the sulfate initial nominal concentration raised to 2352 mg l so4 leading to an initial nominal supersaturation ratio s of 7 32 which was somewhat higher than in the absence of gypsum seeds s 6 70 the time evolution of barium ion concentration and of baso4 supersaturation are shown respectively in fig 10 a and b for both the seeded and unseeded experiments it reveals that caso4 2h2o heterogeneous seeding did not substantially increase the rate of baso4 precipitation this result may be explained by recognizing that gypsum is not an effective surface for heterogeneous primary nucleation of baso4 a similar behavior has been found by kügler et al 13 for silica particles which were also ineffective heterogeneous seeds for barium sulfate precipitation for supersaturation values up to s of 24 5 it is also possible that the low crystal growth rate associated with calcium ions in solution may have contributed to the ineffectiveness of the gypsum seeds finally one concludes that barium ions adsorption upon gypsum surfaces which might favor barium removal is negligible isomorphic substitution of barium ions into gypsum lattice which might also favor barium removal is unlikely as the solution is only saturated with respect to gypsum caco3 particles with a calcite structure were also considered as heterogeneous seeds for baso4 precipitation since this material is readily available at low cost and has a large specific surface area due to a small particle size for these experiments the initial concentration was 330 μg l for barium 584 mg l for nacl and 1070 mg l for sulfate seeds partial dissolution took place prior to sulfate addition at equilibrium speciation modeling yielded a ph of 9 89 and 6 5 mg l ca carbonate and ph measurements in separate experiments with the same reactor not shown revealed that the modeling represents well the physics of the systems besides such experiments show that the ph and carbonate concentrations do not change throughout barium sulfate precipitation because co2 absorbed from the air in the reactor headspace is negligible fig 10 shows that upon the addition of sulfate an induction period was observed showing that calcite just like gypsum was not an effective surface for heterogeneous primary nucleation of baso4 besides soluble barium concentration decreases more slowly with time than in the absence of caco3 seeds this may be attributed either to the higher ph of 9 89 against a ph of 7 in other experiments or to the presence of 6 5 mg l ca2 hampering barium sulfate crystal growth finally one concludes that barium ions adsorption upon calcite surfaces which might favor barium removal is negligible isomorphic substitution of barium ions into calcite lattice which might also favor barium removal is unlikely as the solution is only saturated with respect to calcite 6 precipitation simulations baso4 semi continuous precipitation was simulated for various sulfate to barium ratios seed loads and ion strength values using the same conditions of the experiments a c d f and i given in table 2 only seeded experiments were considered to comply with the hypothesis of negligible primary nucleation in summary the initial volume of solution inside the reactor vsol was 400 ml the bacl2 concentration was 2 73 10 6 m in some experiments 1 25 10 2 m nacl was added additionally 0 5 or 5 g of baso4 seeds were added and allowed to partially dissolve until equilibrium which corresponded to 2073 μg l dissolved barium thereafter the total volume of suspension was gradually increased with the addition of 0 83 ml s na2so4 reactant until a final volume of 100 ml the na2so4 concentration was adjusted to yield initial nominal concentrations of 111 1072 or 9718 mg l so4 in each time interval δt of 0 6s the moments of the particle size distribution m 0 t m 1 t m 2 t and m 3 t and the components concentrations in solution c ba c so4 c na and c cl were recalculated considering the barium sulfate crystal growth rate and the speciation of barium and sulfate ions in solution for each time interval the supersaturation ratio s was determined and used to calculate the crystal growth rate a fourth order crystal growth rate g 4 was the best fit to the experimentally determined barium concentrations such a high order might be caused by impurities hampering growth however impurities in these experiments are estimated to be in concentrations of a few parts per billion or less making this hypothesis unlikely therefore one concludes that the high crystal growth order was caused by the growth mechanism of superficial 2 d nucleation as was observed elsewhere 43 27 39 the growth rate parameter kg found for 111 1072 and 9718 mg l sulfate were respectively 5 10 12 4 10 13 and 6 10 13 m s the growth parameters thus decreased one order of magnitude and then stabilized as the excess sulfate increased such decreasing value of kg with an increasing so4 ba molar ratio was first reported by boerlage et al 15 the model simulations and the experimental results are compared in fig 11 fig 11a shows the dissolved barium and fig 11b the baso4 supersaturation ratio over the reaction time the high order g 4 explains why the barium removal did not progress until chemical equilibrium for seeds concentration of 1 g l giving rise to a residual supersaturation higher than 1 1 fig 11b for all of the initial nominal sulfate concentrations the model did not fit the data appropriately for the highest sulfate addition it is hypothesized that this difference was caused by primary nucleation which was not taken into account in the model in this simulation the supersaturation ratio reached a value of 7 3 fig 11b which was the highest among all conditions investigated besides this supersaturation value might be sufficient to trigger primary nucleation as our unseeded experiments suggest in these experiments fig 3 a supersaturation ratio of 7 15 yielded a long induction time whereas an s value of 8 68 resulted in instantaneous nucleation the model simulations and the experimental results for two ionic strengths are shown in fig 12 for the higher ionic strength the concentration after 100 min precipitation time was higher which may be explained by the correspondingly higher solubility not shown a fourth order crystal growth rate was found with kg of 5 10 12 and 1 10 11 for the higher and the lower ionic strength respectively suggesting that the ionic strength also reduced the crystal growth rate precipitation kinetics for seeds concentrations of 1 and 10 g l are also shown in fig 12 a reasonable fit was found with the parameters just described for 10 g l the simulations showed a small delay when compared to the experimental results but represented well the low supersaturation s 1 02 found at later stages therefore both model and experiments showed that increasing the superficial area of the seeds is a suitable tool to rapidly approach saturation 7 conclusions barium removal from synthetic solutions of a typical industrial wastewater composition was studied by batchwise addition of excess sulfate an induction time of a few hours is observed for an initial nominal supersaturation ratio s of 7 15 or lower excess sulfate of 1072 mg l so4 or lower by increasing s to 8 7 9716 mg l so4 primary nucleation and crystal growth proceeds within a few minutes but a residual s of about 3 remains for a few hours seeding with caco3 or caso4 2h2o does not accelerate precipitation showing that these compounds do not act as heterogenous seeds for baso4 precipitation by seeding with baso4 on the contrary barium residual supersaturation is greatly reduced in a few minutes of reaction for a low seeds concentration of 1 g l a residual s of 1 1 remains for a few hours whereas for 10 g l seeds equilibrium is approached within a few minutes in seeded precipitation an so4 initial nominal concentration of only 111 mg l s of 7 7 is sufficient to bring the system close to equilibrium within 2 5 min whereas in unseeded precipitation more than 1072 mg l of so4 s of 8 7 is needed to reach a similar desupersaturation rate calcium ions retard the removal of barium ions from solution and blocks the process at a high residual s with respect to barium sulfate 4 s 5 as the initial s increases the residual s decreases for a sufficiently large initial s of 25 4 the solution approaches equilibrium after 180 min we have also found that calcium more strongly hinders the precipitation process as the excess sulfate increases in the range of 111 9718 mg l so4 2 we hypothesize that calcium ions reduce the precipitation rate due to calcium adsorption upon barium sulfate surfaces and or incorporation into the crystal structure whereas their effects on solubility are less important kinetic modeling of batchwise seeded precipitation of barium sulfate has shown that barium sulfate crystal growth is 4th order with respect to the supersaturation ratio s consistent with a 2d nucleation growth mechanism such high order explains the observed residual supersaturation ratio values higher than 1 1 the growth rate decreases with an increasing so4 ba molar ratio the ionic strength slows down the crystal growth rate and enhances the solubility of barium

14567,modified biosand filters mbsf and solar pasteurizers have been used as individual drinking water treatment systems around the world the aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of a mbsf coupled with a solar pasteurizer for effective treatment systems for source water the mbsf was designed with an extra disinfection layer with zero valent iron zvi and three layers of underdrain to remove escherichia coli e coli total coliforms and turbidity a flat solar panel with a solenoid valve was used as a solar pasteurizer and an extra disinfection system to remove residual e coli and total coliforms from filtered water the pasteurizer produced an average of 4 5 l of pasteurized water per day 75 c was selected as pasteurization temperature a 96 25 reduction log 1 65 in total coliforms 98 reduction log 2 27 in e coli and 94 8 reduction in turbidity was observed in the filtered water samples after the pasteurization 100 of the e coli and 99 99 of the total coliforms reductions were observed in the filtered and the unfiltered water the turbidity level of the pasteurized unfiltered water did not meet the drinking water standards however the water quality met world health organization drinking water standards for the mbsf system coupled with the solar pasteurizer keywords e coli modified biosand filter solar heater total coliforms turbidity 1 introduction accessing to safe drinking water is a basic human need and is required to sustain the life unfortunately more than one sixth of the world population still lack access to this precious resource according to the world health organization who more than 1 5 million deaths occurred in children under five years of age due to consumption of the unclean drinking water 1 the production of adequate and safe drinking water is extremely important to decrease the mortality and morbidity biosand filters bsf have been developed for single dwellings in the developing countries and rural communities to treat the water 2 4 in bsf water passes through the sand following a layer of gravel and enters the underdrain the biological layer composed of microorganisms and particles built up on the sand breaks down organic particles and strains out particles from water physically 5 7 however modified biosand filters mbsf usually consist of additional adsorbent media or different layers of underdrain in addition to bsf the turbidity heavy metals bacteria viruses and protozoa removal by mbsfs have been reported in many studies 8 11 an iron oxide coated sand mbsf removed 99 3 of the bacteria and 90 of the turbidity 12 a melia azedarach biomass enriched bsf removed 97 9 99 9 of the iron 31 61 of the lead and 100 of escherichia coli e coli 11 a previous study showed that an mbsf with a brass disinfection layer and three layers of underdrain removed 90 11 of the total coliforms 98 2 of e coli 88 5 of the turbidity a mbsf with a zvi disinfection layer and three layers of underdrain removed 97 3 of the total coliforms 98 2 of e coli and 91 5 of the turbidity it was found that during the maturation of the biofilm on the filter the biological layer maturation time built up on the sand using a disinfection layer brass or zvi increased the percentage of e coli removal in fact according to this study the mbsf with zvi gave better total coliforms and turbidity removal 96 93 and 91 5 respectively when it was compared with the bsf 91 29 and 88 71 respectively and the mbsf with brass 90 11 and 88 5 13 another study showed that the bsf media enriched with zero valent iron zvi removed 99 of the fecal coliforms total coliforms fecal streptococci 14 although the initial removal efficiency of the pathogens can be achieved up to 99 by the bsfs residual pathogen population in the filtered water can regenerate 15 therefore the disinfection process is necessary to prevent the regeneration of the pathogens after the filtration boiling chlorination ultraviolet uv treatment membrane filtration or reverse osmosis systems can be applied as the disinfection units to inactivate enteric bacteria protozoa and viruses however those treatments are expensive and energy consuming and cause health hazards due to the formation of byproducts or can be non acceptable by the public due to the taste of the water solar pasteurization is an energy and a cost efficient alternative disinfection technology in addition it avoids formation of some harmful byproducts solar pasteurization utilizes solar radiation to heat the water to inactivate and destroy pathogenic microorganisms 16 plastic bottles solar concentrated flow through systems parabolic trough collectors and fresnel type solar collectors have been investigated as solar pasteurizers in many studies 16 20 21 24 when contaminated water was heated up to 65 c and above in the plastic bottles a complete disinfection occurred and this reduced the rate of childhood diarrhea by 10 25 in a different study a solar pasteurization process reduced 90 of the total heterotrophic bacteria and coliform and as a result the diarrhea risk was reduced by 42 5 26 a commercial solar heating system produced bacteriologically safe water in 4 h from a sample of water with 105 107 e coli ml 27 a process of uninterrupted solar radiations reduced 106 colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml to 4 cfu ml for e coli k 12 28 a borosilicate glass tube fitted with a compound parabolic collector reduced 105 and 107 cfu 100 ml to less than 1 cfu 100 ml for e coli 29 an automatized solar pasteurizer reduced 14 000 most probable number of coliforms per 100 milliliter mpn 100 ml to less than 3 mpn 100 ml for total coliforms at 55 c 60 c 65 c 70 c and 85 c and 40 mpn 100 ml 3 mpn 100 ml for e coli at 65 c 75 c and 85 c 30 a solar reactor removed 99 99 of total coliforms in 30 min 31 a flat solar collector achieved a complete removal of total coliforms and e coli and an average of 98 7 reduction of the heterotrophic bacteria at 85 c in 15 s 32 the flow through solar panels eliminated the coliform and thermotolerant coliform bacteria streptococcus faecalis e coli and salmonella typhimurium via heating a water sample to 65 c and above 21 it is a fact that solar pasteurizers cannot remove metals organic materials taste and odor salinity and turbidity 33 35 in addition the turbidity caused by suspended and colloidal matters can host pathogens and provide environment for the growth of pathogens which in turn hinder water treatment 15 36 therefore pretreatment is a necessary step before the pasteurization solar pasteurizer studies were focused on either daily water productivity of the pasteurizers or microorganism removal in the literature there are only a few studies focusing on the turbidity removal which suggested filtration before solar pasteurization soco dis system due to decreased efficiency caused by high turbidity by 10 15 17 there is no other study focusing on filters coupled with pasteurizers to produce safe drinking water effectively consequently the aim of this study is to examine the turbidity and microorganism removal performance of a mbsf coupled with a solar pasteurizer system to deliver safe water for individuals the emirate of abu dhabi uae uses who and gulf cooperation council gcc drinking water standards according to who and gcc drinking water standards for microbial parameters total coliforms e coli or thermo tolerant fecal coliform bacteria counts should be zero in a 100 ml sample 37 1 therefore e coli and total coliforms were chosen as two microbial parameters monitored in this study a filter was used as a pretreatment system to remove the turbidity e coli and total coliforms and a solar pasteurizer was used to remove residual bacteria from the filtered water the solar pasteurizer performance for the filtered and unfiltered water was tested as well 2 materials and methods 2 1 filter setup the filters were set up with a zvi extra disinfection layer and three layers of underdrain as the mbsf based on the results of the previous study the mbsf zvi gave better total coliforms and turbidity removal 96 93 and 91 5 respectively when it was compared with the bsf 91 29 and 88 71 respectively and the mbsf with brass 90 11 and 88 5 13 two acrylic flow cells with 5 08 cm inner diameter and 60 cm height coupled with end plate assembles with mesh stainless steel screens were used as laboratory scale mbsf columns at khalifa university in the environmental laboratory sand was purchased from marinara transport company and sieved with a humboldt sieve shaker sieved sand was washed and dried in an oven successive layers of 4 cm of pea gravel size 12 5 mm 4 cm of granular gravel size 3 35 mm 2 cm coarse sand size 1 18 mm 4 cm fine sand size 0 42 mm mixed with the iron particles size 0 84 mm 15 volume basis approximately 4 4 gr was added to fine sand and 36 cm fine sand were placed inside the scaled down filter columns based on the full size structure 13 as an outlet tube 0 5 cm inner diameter pvc outlet tubing was used and raised 5 cm above the height of the filter media a diffuser with approximately 2 mm of diameter holes was placed 10 cm above the filter media the standing water was maintained 3 4 cm above the filter media during the pause period the volume of the filled column was 4 62 l sand gravel water with a void space of 0 35 l the filters were filled with water before loading in order to avoid air spaces the porosity void fraction of the sand was 0 4 the filters were run intermittently twice a day with 12 h pause period with 0 4 l of water for 60 days including maturation period the initial flow rate for the column with the first charge was approximately 0 013 l min 0 38 m h which was in the prescribed range 0 16 1 1 m h 8 38 the flow rates were measured daily the water temperature was in the range of 24 26 c during the testing period 2 2 solar pasteurizer setup the prototypes were built and tested in khalifa university abu dhabi campus 24 26 52 n and 54 23 41 e the mean solar insolation rates were measured using a solar light pma2100 dual input data logging radiometer a 40 cm x 60 cm wood frame with an aluminum sheet 0 24 m2 aperture area 170 ml capacity was built as a solar pasteurizer prototype the filtered water transferred to a cold water tank coleman 7 57 l insulated jug cooler coupled with a respirator which was placed approximately 30 cm above the collector panel the filtered water was led to the upper tube connected to the cold water tank and then to a serpentine shaped copper pipe which had an inner diameter of 7 mm and a length of 4 5 m the exit pipe was connected to an automatic heat sensor valve mos fet transistor resistor circuit with a solenoid valve which receives a control signal from an arduino microcontroller along with the temperature sensors ds18b20 to dispense the water to the treated water tank the treated water tank coleman 7 57 l insulated jug cooler was placed 0 1 m below the collector panel as shown in fig 1 all circuits were powered by photovoltaic electricity the initial filtered water temperature was 26 1 c during the testing period the solenoid valve prevented water being withdrawn below the chosen temperature input pins were used to receive data from the temperature sensor then a variable temperature was initialized and it was set to the value of the current temperature of the sensor there were two functions controlling the opening of the valve openvalve and closing of the valve closevalve when applying the openvalve function arduino passed a high signal through the relay to the solenoid valve to open it and it sent a low signal to remove the voltage across the valve to close it then if function was set if variable temp which was the reading of the temperature sensor reached to 75 c call up function openvalve opened the valve and the water flowed out of the pasteurizer if temperature of the water dropped below 75 c call up function closevalve shut down the valve the data was collected at one minute intervals from 10 00 am to 4 00 pm the tubes and plates were mounted on aluminum sheets all pipes and sheets were painted black placed in a wooden box and covered with a transparent double layer polycarbonate plate wooden supports were hinged to the frame with different heights to create the different angles to utilize more sunlight it was found that 24 was the optimum slope to utilize the sunlight according to another study in the middle east the average tilt angle for solar panels nearly corresponds to the region s latitude 39 2 3 water and microbiology a wastewater sample was taken from nearby wastewater treatment plant wwtp second clarifier abu dhabi uae wastewater activated sludge was transferred to the laboratory scale aeration tank the activated sludge was fed by the feeding solution adopted from a previous study 40 every three weeks a new batch of activated sludge taken from wwtp was added to the aeration tank to maintain the microorganism population 1 l of tap water was seeded with 2 ml of the activated sludge for the experimental work total number of the total coliforms in the influent was maintained at 10571 3322 cfu 100 ml and e coli was maintained at 8418 1910 cfu 100 ml throughout the study the numbers of e coli and total coliforms in the water were determined before and after the filtration pasteurization process the influent turbidity was maintained at 7 5 nephelometric turbidity unit ntu with adding 29 mg of bentonite in 1 l of seeded water representing natural water turbidity bentonite was supplied by fisher scientific 2 4 bacterial and physicochemical analysis the method of analysis for the mbsf was adopted from the previous study 13 composite samples were collected from the filter exit pipes on a daily basis for the flow rate and turbidity tri weekly basis for e coli and weekly basis for total coliforms for 60 days the sterile containers were positioned just under the exit pipes and filled with the effluent and timed for the flow rate calculations and tested for the turbidity e coli and total coliforms the filtered water was flowed to the solar pasteurizer instantly after pasteurization took place the pasteurized water was collected in another sterile container before each analysis the samples were mixed well the samples from the pasteurizer were cooled down to room temperature 23 1 c and e coli total coliforms and turbidity tests were conducted all bacteriological tests were processed within an hour after the collection standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 9222 d membrane filtration method was used as guidelines to perform e coli and total coliforms tests 41 for culturing the bacteria emd millipore nutrient media m endo total coliform broth and emd millipore m coliblue24 broth by merck were used as media pre sterilized disposable polystyrene 9 50 mm petri dishes were used as culture dishes pall life sciences pure cellulose fiber filter pads sterile single use were used as adsorbent pads sartorius gridded sterile cellulose nitrate membrane filters 0 45 μm were used as membrane filters glass membrane filter units with 47 mm glass vacuum filter holders were supplied by emd millipore touchclave r cylindrical autoclave by lte scientific was used to autoclave all glassware filter units and forceps incucell natural convection incubator from mmm medcentre was used to incubate bacteria at 35 c for 24 h after the incubation sct micro enumer digital colony counter was used to count e coli and total coliform colonies turbidity was measured using thermo scientific eutech tn100 turbidity meter 3 results and discussion 3 1 mbsf testing 3 1 1 flow rate and turbidity e coli total coliforms reductions in mbsf the average flow rate was 0 0053 l min throughout the study the flow rate declined and head loss increased over time due to filter maturation and clogging as shown in fig 2 a 8 13 the average influent turbidity was 7 5 ntu an average of 94 8 reduction with an average of 0 42 ntu effluent turbidity which was below who drinking water quality standard 5 ntu and gcc drinking water standards 4 ntu was observed as shown in fig 2b and table 1 37 42 e coli reduction averaged log 0 54 69 from day 0 till day 20 the removal performance increased after 20 days due to maturation of the biofilm during the period between 20th day and 60th day an average of 98 log 2 28 reduction in the mbsf was observed which was very similar to the previous study with the full scale mbsf zvi 98 2 of e coli removal shown in fig 3 a 13 the average number of the initial e coli was 8418 cfu 100 ml in the influent and it was reduced to an average of 243 cfu 100 ml in the effluent which was above who and gcc standards as shown in table 2 according to who and gcc e coli must not be detectable in any 100 ml of the samples for all water directly intended for drinking purposes 37 42 another study reported that an iron oxide coated sand mbsf removed 99 3 of fecal coliform and e coli 12 according to another study an melia azedarach biomass enriched bsf removed almost 100 of e coli 11 the total coliforms reduction averaged log 0 86 71 from day 0 to day 21 the removal performance increased after the 21st day due to maturation of the biofilm an average of log 1 65 96 25 reduction in the mbsf was observed from the 21st day through the 60th day as shown in fig 3b a previous study with the full scale mbsf zvi showed 97 3 of the total coliforms removal 13 the average number of the initial total coliforms was 10571 cfu 100 ml in the influent and it was reduced to an average of 340 cfu 100 ml in the effluent which was above who and gcc limit as shown in table 2 total coliforms should be absent in the water immediately after the disinfection 37 42 another study reported that a bsf media enriched with zvi removed 99 of total coliforms and fecal coliform 14 although removal rates of bacteria in the lab scale mbsf zvi in this study and in the full scale mbsf zvi a previous study are similar some operational procedures such as residence times and hydraulic loadings employed in the full scale applications could change the performance therefore further studies can focus on the impact of operating conditions on the filtered water quality physical straining predation adsorption natural die off attachment of negatively charged pathogens to positively charged zvi surface removed e coli and total coliforms from inflow in mbsfs 43 13 although the removal of total coliforms and e coli were 96 and 98 6 respectively by mbsfs the numbers of the bacteria in the effluent were above who and gcc guidelines another study also found that although bsfs produced water which met who guidelines for the turbidity and removed 98 of e coli a high number of bacteria were found in the effluent 44 subsequently the effluent from the mbsf was treated with the solar pasteurizer for full disinfection 3 2 solar pasteurizer testing 3 2 1 solar pasteurizer performance test the testing was performed from the 5th of may till the 1st of august 2017 at different weather conditions the mean solar insolation rates were measured as 7 15 kw m2 day 25 74 mj m2 in may and 7 2 kw m2 day 25 92 mj m2 in june and 6 42 kw m2 day 23 112 mj m2 in july according to another study similar results were reported the daily average values of the global solar radiation were 25 06 mj m2 day in may 24 62 mj m2 day in june and 24 52 mj m2 day in july and monthly daily average values of the global solar radiation were 28 08 mj m2 day in may 27 36 mj m2 day in june and 25 2 mj m2 day in july in abu dhabi uae 45 the monthly average temperatures of abu dhabi were 33 c in may and 34 c in june and 36 c in july the monthly average wind speeds were 15 km h in may june july the monthly uv indexes were 9 in may and 10 in june july the monthly clearness indexes were 0 6 in may and 0 59 in june and 0 54 in july 46 47 the performance of the solar pasteurizer with fixed detention time 5 min at different uv indexes was shown in table 3 the fixed detention time gave maximum 69 c pasteurization temperature which is enough to kill 90 of the following microorganisms in one minute 55 c for worms cryptosporidium cysts of the protozoa giardia and entamoeba 60 c for the bacteria vibrio cholerae shigella sp samonella typhi enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and for rotavirus 65 c for hepatitis a virus 22 the solar pasteurizer efficiency in the removal of e coli and total coliforms from the unfiltered water at different temperatures was tested 50 c 60 c and 75 c were tested as the pasteurization temperatures based on the experimental results 75 c gave the best removal rate it averaged 99 83 for total coliforms and 100 for e coli as shown in table 4 therefore 75 c was chosen as the pasteurization temperature and the experimental work was carried out at this temperature in a different study 75 c as the outlet water temperature was suggested to provide safety margin to inactivate the microorganism such as vibrio cholera shigella dysenteriae salm typhi mycobacterium tuberculosis and bacteria that grow in water supply systems such as legionella aeromonas pseudomonas and protozoa such as giardia lamblia entamoeba histolytica cryptosporidium and most of the enteroviruses 21 another study reported that water pasteurization occurs at 72 c in a minimum of 15 s 31 total coliforms were found once out of four samples at 75 c in this study another study reported a similar finding that the presence of total coliforms in 15 out of 15 samples and the presence of e coli in 13 out of 15 samples were observed before the solar treatment after the solar pasteurization e coli was not found however in 2 out of 15 samples total coliforms were found with the removal efficiency of 97 48 uninterrupted solar radiations reduced 106 cfu ml 4 cfu ml for e coli k 12 however bacteria in a continuous flow system were not fully inactivated 28 a closed coupled solar pasteurization system achieved 99 reduction of e coli at the temperatures between 72 c and 91 c 49 table 5 shows the average daily performance of the pasteurizer with the average holding time solar insolation uv indexes and the flow rates at 75 c pasteurization temperature the holding time in the pasteurizer varied according to the time of the day the first batch of water filled the pasteurizer was at 9 00 am and the water was heated up to 75 c in 35 45 min after the recharge of the first batch of water the water temperature started with 45 2 4 c and raised up to 75 c for the next batch it was seen that the collected water from the pasteurizer was at a higher temperature than the set temperature 75 c and this caused the poor start up performance a similar finding was reported in another study 19 the system gave a total of 4 5 l of the pasteurized water per day as seen in fig 4 the maximum solar insolation gave the highest flow rate and the lowest holding time in the pasteurizer similar trends were reported in other studies as well 23 24 the system gave lower performance on the days with dust storms during the dust storms it took more time to heat the water and the targeted pasteurization temperature was not achieved according to another study the dust storms diffuse radiation and decrease the global direct solar radiation 50 3 2 2 e coli total coliforms and turbidity reductions in solar pasteurizer with the unfiltered water the pasteurizer efficiency to disinfect the unfiltered water was tested and 100 of e coli and 99 99 of total coliforms removals were observed as shown in fig 5 a and b the average number of the initial e coli in the unfiltered water was 8418 cfu 100 ml and e coli was not detected in any of the pasteurized water samples the average number of the initial total coliforms was 10571 cfu 100 ml in the unfiltered water and it was reduced to less than 1 cfu 100 ml in the effluent the two encountered problems with the unfiltered water were the turbidity in the effluent and the frequent cleaning of the pasteurizer therefore the turbidity removal testing was performed in the pasteurizer the average influent turbidity was 7 5 ntu an average of 7 32 reduction with an average of 6 96 ntu standard deviation 0 17 maximum 7 39 ntu minimum 6 325 ntu n 10 of the effluent turbidity was observed as shown in fig 5c the effluent turbidity was higher than 5 ntu acceptable turbidity value by who drinking water quality standard the results clearly showed that although the pasteurizer disinfects the water it cannot remove the turbidity and therefore it is not safe to drink the water produced in this process suspended and colloidal particles cause turbidity microorganisms like e coli and campylobacter can accumulate in these particles and when water flows they are mobilized 42 according to another study since the turbidity affected the disinfection efficiency of the soco dis system decreased by 10 15 water needs to be filtered before the treatment 17 according to another study when the turbidity of the sample was high it took longer residence time to reach a 4 log10 of the reduction in the bacterial load 31 in a different report the turbidity values remained within the maximum limit by standard averaging 4 7 0 9 after the pasteurization 48 in addition a high level of turbidity can cause frequent cleaning of the solar pasteurizer damage the valves and taps and fill the tanks and pipes 15 based on the findings and the literature it was concluded that the pasteurizer definitely needs a pretreatment to remove the turbidity 3 2 3 e coli and total coliforms reductions in solar pasteurizer with the filtered water the pasteurizer s performance to disinfect the filtered water was tested and 100 of e coli 99 99 of total coliforms removal rates were observed as shown in fig 6 a and 6b the average number of the initial e coli was 243 cfu 100 ml in the filtered water and no e coli was detected after the pasteurization the average number of the initial total coliforms was 340 cfu 100 ml in the filtered water and it was reduced to less than 1 cfu 100 ml in the effluent another study reported that an automatized solar pasteurizer reduced 14 000 mpn 100 ml to less than 3 mpn 100 ml for total coliforms at 55 c 60 c 65 c 70 c and 85 c and 40 mpn 100 ml to less than 3 mpn 100 ml for e coli at 65 c 75 c and 85 c 30 another study used a commercial solar water heating system and it was observed that a water sample with 105 107 e coli ml was converted to bacteriologically safe level in 4 h 27 this study produced higher removal rates for e coli and total coliforms after the pasteurization but further work needs to be performed to show that the microorganisms are not in the viable but non culturable vbnc state the vbnc state can be defined as pathogens survival strategy to endure harsh environmental stresses such as extreme temperature changes drying irradiation pulsed electric field starvation disinfectant exposure to chlorine sharp changes in ph and pressure according to some reports during food processing under certain conditions such as high pressure high temperature preservation disinfectant and low temperature storage the foodborne pathogens may enter the vbnc state which poses a serious threat to the human health 51 52 it was reported that e coli mycobacterium tuberculosis campylobacterspp klebsiella pneumoniae helicobacter pylori listeria monocytogenes pseudomonas aeruginosa several salmonella and shigella spp vibrio cholerae and vibrio parahaemolyticus enter the vbnc state 53 the vbnc cells are characterized by culturability loss on a conventional plate counting and regrowth ability when certain conditions are re established 53 51 52 therefore an effective detection method for bacteria in the vbnc state is utmost importance to provide the reliability of the disinfection methods 4 conclusion in this study turbidity e coli and total coliforms removals performance of an mbsf coupled with a solar pasteurizer was tested a zero valent iron as an extra disinfection layer and three layers of underdrain were used to design the mbsf to remove e coli total coliforms and turbidity the average flow rate was 0 0053 l min throughout the study then the flow rate declined and head loss increased over time due to the filter maturation based on the mbsf performance results an average of 98 removal of e coli 96 25 of total coliforms and 94 8 of turbidity removal rates were observed the turbidity in the filtered water was below who gcc acceptable level for drinking purposes although the removal of total coliforms and e coli achieved higher percent removal rate with the mbsf the number of bacteria in the effluent was above who guidelines subsequently the effluent from the mbsf was treated with the solar pasteurizer for full disinfection the flow through solar pasteurizer along with a solenoid valve was used as the water pasteurization system the pasteurizer s performance to disinfect unfiltered water at 75 c showed 100 of e coli and 99 99 of total coliforms and 7 32 of turbidity removal although the presence of e coli and total coliforms was not detected in the pasteurized water the turbidity of the pasteurized water was above who guidelines the results clearly indicated that although the pasteurizer disinfects water it cannot remove the turbidity hence a pretreatment is necessary to deliver safe water however the mbsf coupled with the pasteurizer achieved 100 removal of e coli and 99 99 removal of total coliforms and low turbidity values in the effluent which were below who limit consequently this study showed that both systems cannot be used as sole drinking water treatment systems alone although this study was a lab scale study it highlighted the benefits of a mbsf coupled with a solar pasteurizer in order to bring safe low cost clean and energy reliable water to people in need the results of this study are expected to provide a framework for the future studies focusing on the impact of operating conditions on the real scale systems the coupling of the mbsf with the solar pasteurizer will provide a reliable source of potable water not only in the individual accommodations but also in the places where a large number of people live together such as in the military and refugee camps or in the shelters during disasters acknowledgments this research was supported by khalifa university and

accessing to safe drinking water is a basic human need and is required to sustain the life unfortunately more than one sixth of the world population still lack access to this precious resource according to the world health organization who more than 1 5 million deaths occurred in children under five years of age due to consumption of the unclean drinking water 1 the production of adequate and safe drinking water is extremely important to decrease the mortality and morbidity biosand filters bsf have been developed for single dwellings in the developing countries and rural communities to treat the water 2 4 in bsf water passes through the sand following a layer of gravel and enters the underdrain the biological layer composed of microorganisms and particles built up on the sand breaks down organic particles and strains out particles from water physically 5 7 however modified biosand filters mbsf usually consist of additional adsorbent media or different layers of underdrain in addition to bsf the turbidity heavy metals bacteria viruses and protozoa removal by mbsfs have been reported in many studies 8 11 an iron oxide coated sand mbsf removed 99 3 of the bacteria and 90 of the turbidity 12 a melia azedarach biomass enriched bsf removed 97 9 99 9 of the iron 31 61 of the lead and 100 of escherichia coli e coli 11 a previous study showed that an mbsf with a brass disinfection layer and three layers of underdrain removed 90 11 of the total coliforms 98 2 of e coli 88 5 of the turbidity a mbsf with a zvi disinfection layer and three layers of underdrain removed 97 3 of the total coliforms 98 2 of e coli and 91 5 of the turbidity it was found that during the maturation of the biofilm on the filter the biological layer maturation time built up on the sand using a disinfection layer brass or zvi increased the percentage of e coli removal in fact according to this study the mbsf with zvi gave better total coliforms and turbidity removal 96 93 and 91 5 respectively when it was compared with the bsf 91 29 and 88 71 respectively and the mbsf with brass 90 11 and 88 5 13 another study showed that the bsf media enriched with zero valent iron zvi removed 99 of the fecal coliforms total coliforms fecal streptococci 14 although the initial removal efficiency of the pathogens can be achieved up to 99 by the bsfs residual pathogen population in the filtered water can regenerate 15 therefore the disinfection process is necessary to prevent the regeneration of the pathogens after the filtration boiling chlorination ultraviolet uv treatment membrane filtration or reverse osmosis systems can be applied as the disinfection units to inactivate enteric bacteria protozoa and viruses however those treatments are expensive and energy consuming and cause health hazards due to the formation of byproducts or can be non acceptable by the public due to the taste of the water solar pasteurization is an energy and a cost efficient alternative disinfection technology in addition it avoids formation of some harmful byproducts solar pasteurization utilizes solar radiation to heat the water to inactivate and destroy pathogenic microorganisms 16 plastic bottles solar concentrated flow through systems parabolic trough collectors and fresnel type solar collectors have been investigated as solar pasteurizers in many studies 16 20 21 24 when contaminated water was heated up to 65 c and above in the plastic bottles a complete disinfection occurred and this reduced the rate of childhood diarrhea by 10 25 in a different study a solar pasteurization process reduced 90 of the total heterotrophic bacteria and coliform and as a result the diarrhea risk was reduced by 42 5 26 a commercial solar heating system produced bacteriologically safe water in 4 h from a sample of water with 105 107 e coli ml 27 a process of uninterrupted solar radiations reduced 106 colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml to 4 cfu ml for e coli k 12 28 a borosilicate glass tube fitted with a compound parabolic collector reduced 105 and 107 cfu 100 ml to less than 1 cfu 100 ml for e coli 29 an automatized solar pasteurizer reduced 14 000 most probable number of coliforms per 100 milliliter mpn 100 ml to less than 3 mpn 100 ml for total coliforms at 55 c 60 c 65 c 70 c and 85 c and 40 mpn 100 ml 3 mpn 100 ml for e coli at 65 c 75 c and 85 c 30 a solar reactor removed 99 99 of total coliforms in 30 min 31 a flat solar collector achieved a complete removal of total coliforms and e coli and an average of 98 7 reduction of the heterotrophic bacteria at 85 c in 15 s 32 the flow through solar panels eliminated the coliform and thermotolerant coliform bacteria streptococcus faecalis e coli and salmonella typhimurium via heating a water sample to 65 c and above 21 it is a fact that solar pasteurizers cannot remove metals organic materials taste and odor salinity and turbidity 33 35 in addition the turbidity caused by suspended and colloidal matters can host pathogens and provide environment for the growth of pathogens which in turn hinder water treatment 15 36 therefore pretreatment is a necessary step before the pasteurization solar pasteurizer studies were focused on either daily water productivity of the pasteurizers or microorganism removal in the literature there are only a few studies focusing on the turbidity removal which suggested filtration before solar pasteurization soco dis system due to decreased efficiency caused by high turbidity by 10 15 17 there is no other study focusing on filters coupled with pasteurizers to produce safe drinking water effectively consequently the aim of this study is to examine the turbidity and microorganism removal performance of a mbsf coupled with a solar pasteurizer system to deliver safe water for individuals the emirate of abu dhabi uae uses who and gulf cooperation council gcc drinking water standards according to who and gcc drinking water standards for microbial parameters total coliforms e coli or thermo tolerant fecal coliform bacteria counts should be zero in a 100 ml sample 37 1 therefore e coli and total coliforms were chosen as two microbial parameters monitored in this study a filter was used as a pretreatment system to remove the turbidity e coli and total coliforms and a solar pasteurizer was used to remove residual bacteria from the filtered water the solar pasteurizer performance for the filtered and unfiltered water was tested as well 2 materials and methods 2 1 filter setup the filters were set up with a zvi extra disinfection layer and three layers of underdrain as the mbsf based on the results of the previous study the mbsf zvi gave better total coliforms and turbidity removal 96 93 and 91 5 respectively when it was compared with the bsf 91 29 and 88 71 respectively and the mbsf with brass 90 11 and 88 5 13 two acrylic flow cells with 5 08 cm inner diameter and 60 cm height coupled with end plate assembles with mesh stainless steel screens were used as laboratory scale mbsf columns at khalifa university in the environmental laboratory sand was purchased from marinara transport company and sieved with a humboldt sieve shaker sieved sand was washed and dried in an oven successive layers of 4 cm of pea gravel size 12 5 mm 4 cm of granular gravel size 3 35 mm 2 cm coarse sand size 1 18 mm 4 cm fine sand size 0 42 mm mixed with the iron particles size 0 84 mm 15 volume basis approximately 4 4 gr was added to fine sand and 36 cm fine sand were placed inside the scaled down filter columns based on the full size structure 13 as an outlet tube 0 5 cm inner diameter pvc outlet tubing was used and raised 5 cm above the height of the filter media a diffuser with approximately 2 mm of diameter holes was placed 10 cm above the filter media the standing water was maintained 3 4 cm above the filter media during the pause period the volume of the filled column was 4 62 l sand gravel water with a void space of 0 35 l the filters were filled with water before loading in order to avoid air spaces the porosity void fraction of the sand was 0 4 the filters were run intermittently twice a day with 12 h pause period with 0 4 l of water for 60 days including maturation period the initial flow rate for the column with the first charge was approximately 0 013 l min 0 38 m h which was in the prescribed range 0 16 1 1 m h 8 38 the flow rates were measured daily the water temperature was in the range of 24 26 c during the testing period 2 2 solar pasteurizer setup the prototypes were built and tested in khalifa university abu dhabi campus 24 26 52 n and 54 23 41 e the mean solar insolation rates were measured using a solar light pma2100 dual input data logging radiometer a 40 cm x 60 cm wood frame with an aluminum sheet 0 24 m2 aperture area 170 ml capacity was built as a solar pasteurizer prototype the filtered water transferred to a cold water tank coleman 7 57 l insulated jug cooler coupled with a respirator which was placed approximately 30 cm above the collector panel the filtered water was led to the upper tube connected to the cold water tank and then to a serpentine shaped copper pipe which had an inner diameter of 7 mm and a length of 4 5 m the exit pipe was connected to an automatic heat sensor valve mos fet transistor resistor circuit with a solenoid valve which receives a control signal from an arduino microcontroller along with the temperature sensors ds18b20 to dispense the water to the treated water tank the treated water tank coleman 7 57 l insulated jug cooler was placed 0 1 m below the collector panel as shown in fig 1 all circuits were powered by photovoltaic electricity the initial filtered water temperature was 26 1 c during the testing period the solenoid valve prevented water being withdrawn below the chosen temperature input pins were used to receive data from the temperature sensor then a variable temperature was initialized and it was set to the value of the current temperature of the sensor there were two functions controlling the opening of the valve openvalve and closing of the valve closevalve when applying the openvalve function arduino passed a high signal through the relay to the solenoid valve to open it and it sent a low signal to remove the voltage across the valve to close it then if function was set if variable temp which was the reading of the temperature sensor reached to 75 c call up function openvalve opened the valve and the water flowed out of the pasteurizer if temperature of the water dropped below 75 c call up function closevalve shut down the valve the data was collected at one minute intervals from 10 00 am to 4 00 pm the tubes and plates were mounted on aluminum sheets all pipes and sheets were painted black placed in a wooden box and covered with a transparent double layer polycarbonate plate wooden supports were hinged to the frame with different heights to create the different angles to utilize more sunlight it was found that 24 was the optimum slope to utilize the sunlight according to another study in the middle east the average tilt angle for solar panels nearly corresponds to the region s latitude 39 2 3 water and microbiology a wastewater sample was taken from nearby wastewater treatment plant wwtp second clarifier abu dhabi uae wastewater activated sludge was transferred to the laboratory scale aeration tank the activated sludge was fed by the feeding solution adopted from a previous study 40 every three weeks a new batch of activated sludge taken from wwtp was added to the aeration tank to maintain the microorganism population 1 l of tap water was seeded with 2 ml of the activated sludge for the experimental work total number of the total coliforms in the influent was maintained at 10571 3322 cfu 100 ml and e coli was maintained at 8418 1910 cfu 100 ml throughout the study the numbers of e coli and total coliforms in the water were determined before and after the filtration pasteurization process the influent turbidity was maintained at 7 5 nephelometric turbidity unit ntu with adding 29 mg of bentonite in 1 l of seeded water representing natural water turbidity bentonite was supplied by fisher scientific 2 4 bacterial and physicochemical analysis the method of analysis for the mbsf was adopted from the previous study 13 composite samples were collected from the filter exit pipes on a daily basis for the flow rate and turbidity tri weekly basis for e coli and weekly basis for total coliforms for 60 days the sterile containers were positioned just under the exit pipes and filled with the effluent and timed for the flow rate calculations and tested for the turbidity e coli and total coliforms the filtered water was flowed to the solar pasteurizer instantly after pasteurization took place the pasteurized water was collected in another sterile container before each analysis the samples were mixed well the samples from the pasteurizer were cooled down to room temperature 23 1 c and e coli total coliforms and turbidity tests were conducted all bacteriological tests were processed within an hour after the collection standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 9222 d membrane filtration method was used as guidelines to perform e coli and total coliforms tests 41 for culturing the bacteria emd millipore nutrient media m endo total coliform broth and emd millipore m coliblue24 broth by merck were used as media pre sterilized disposable polystyrene 9 50 mm petri dishes were used as culture dishes pall life sciences pure cellulose fiber filter pads sterile single use were used as adsorbent pads sartorius gridded sterile cellulose nitrate membrane filters 0 45 μm were used as membrane filters glass membrane filter units with 47 mm glass vacuum filter holders were supplied by emd millipore touchclave r cylindrical autoclave by lte scientific was used to autoclave all glassware filter units and forceps incucell natural convection incubator from mmm medcentre was used to incubate bacteria at 35 c for 24 h after the incubation sct micro enumer digital colony counter was used to count e coli and total coliform colonies turbidity was measured using thermo scientific eutech tn100 turbidity meter 3 results and discussion 3 1 mbsf testing 3 1 1 flow rate and turbidity e coli total coliforms reductions in mbsf the average flow rate was 0 0053 l min throughout the study the flow rate declined and head loss increased over time due to filter maturation and clogging as shown in fig 2 a 8 13 the average influent turbidity was 7 5 ntu an average of 94 8 reduction with an average of 0 42 ntu effluent turbidity which was below who drinking water quality standard 5 ntu and gcc drinking water standards 4 ntu was observed as shown in fig 2b and table 1 37 42 e coli reduction averaged log 0 54 69 from day 0 till day 20 the removal performance increased after 20 days due to maturation of the biofilm during the period between 20th day and 60th day an average of 98 log 2 28 reduction in the mbsf was observed which was very similar to the previous study with the full scale mbsf zvi 98 2 of e coli removal shown in fig 3 a 13 the average number of the initial e coli was 8418 cfu 100 ml in the influent and it was reduced to an average of 243 cfu 100 ml in the effluent which was above who and gcc standards as shown in table 2 according to who and gcc e coli must not be detectable in any 100 ml of the samples for all water directly intended for drinking purposes 37 42 another study reported that an iron oxide coated sand mbsf removed 99 3 of fecal coliform and e coli 12 according to another study an melia azedarach biomass enriched bsf removed almost 100 of e coli 11 the total coliforms reduction averaged log 0 86 71 from day 0 to day 21 the removal performance increased after the 21st day due to maturation of the biofilm an average of log 1 65 96 25 reduction in the mbsf was observed from the 21st day through the 60th day as shown in fig 3b a previous study with the full scale mbsf zvi showed 97 3 of the total coliforms removal 13 the average number of the initial total coliforms was 10571 cfu 100 ml in the influent and it was reduced to an average of 340 cfu 100 ml in the effluent which was above who and gcc limit as shown in table 2 total coliforms should be absent in the water immediately after the disinfection 37 42 another study reported that a bsf media enriched with zvi removed 99 of total coliforms and fecal coliform 14 although removal rates of bacteria in the lab scale mbsf zvi in this study and in the full scale mbsf zvi a previous study are similar some operational procedures such as residence times and hydraulic loadings employed in the full scale applications could change the performance therefore further studies can focus on the impact of operating conditions on the filtered water quality physical straining predation adsorption natural die off attachment of negatively charged pathogens to positively charged zvi surface removed e coli and total coliforms from inflow in mbsfs 43 13 although the removal of total coliforms and e coli were 96 and 98 6 respectively by mbsfs the numbers of the bacteria in the effluent were above who and gcc guidelines another study also found that although bsfs produced water which met who guidelines for the turbidity and removed 98 of e coli a high number of bacteria were found in the effluent 44 subsequently the effluent from the mbsf was treated with the solar pasteurizer for full disinfection 3 2 solar pasteurizer testing 3 2 1 solar pasteurizer performance test the testing was performed from the 5th of may till the 1st of august 2017 at different weather conditions the mean solar insolation rates were measured as 7 15 kw m2 day 25 74 mj m2 in may and 7 2 kw m2 day 25 92 mj m2 in june and 6 42 kw m2 day 23 112 mj m2 in july according to another study similar results were reported the daily average values of the global solar radiation were 25 06 mj m2 day in may 24 62 mj m2 day in june and 24 52 mj m2 day in july and monthly daily average values of the global solar radiation were 28 08 mj m2 day in may 27 36 mj m2 day in june and 25 2 mj m2 day in july in abu dhabi uae 45 the monthly average temperatures of abu dhabi were 33 c in may and 34 c in june and 36 c in july the monthly average wind speeds were 15 km h in may june july the monthly uv indexes were 9 in may and 10 in june july the monthly clearness indexes were 0 6 in may and 0 59 in june and 0 54 in july 46 47 the performance of the solar pasteurizer with fixed detention time 5 min at different uv indexes was shown in table 3 the fixed detention time gave maximum 69 c pasteurization temperature which is enough to kill 90 of the following microorganisms in one minute 55 c for worms cryptosporidium cysts of the protozoa giardia and entamoeba 60 c for the bacteria vibrio cholerae shigella sp samonella typhi enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and for rotavirus 65 c for hepatitis a virus 22 the solar pasteurizer efficiency in the removal of e coli and total coliforms from the unfiltered water at different temperatures was tested 50 c 60 c and 75 c were tested as the pasteurization temperatures based on the experimental results 75 c gave the best removal rate it averaged 99 83 for total coliforms and 100 for e coli as shown in table 4 therefore 75 c was chosen as the pasteurization temperature and the experimental work was carried out at this temperature in a different study 75 c as the outlet water temperature was suggested to provide safety margin to inactivate the microorganism such as vibrio cholera shigella dysenteriae salm typhi mycobacterium tuberculosis and bacteria that grow in water supply systems such as legionella aeromonas pseudomonas and protozoa such as giardia lamblia entamoeba histolytica cryptosporidium and most of the enteroviruses 21 another study reported that water pasteurization occurs at 72 c in a minimum of 15 s 31 total coliforms were found once out of four samples at 75 c in this study another study reported a similar finding that the presence of total coliforms in 15 out of 15 samples and the presence of e coli in 13 out of 15 samples were observed before the solar treatment after the solar pasteurization e coli was not found however in 2 out of 15 samples total coliforms were found with the removal efficiency of 97 48 uninterrupted solar radiations reduced 106 cfu ml 4 cfu ml for e coli k 12 however bacteria in a continuous flow system were not fully inactivated 28 a closed coupled solar pasteurization system achieved 99 reduction of e coli at the temperatures between 72 c and 91 c 49 table 5 shows the average daily performance of the pasteurizer with the average holding time solar insolation uv indexes and the flow rates at 75 c pasteurization temperature the holding time in the pasteurizer varied according to the time of the day the first batch of water filled the pasteurizer was at 9 00 am and the water was heated up to 75 c in 35 45 min after the recharge of the first batch of water the water temperature started with 45 2 4 c and raised up to 75 c for the next batch it was seen that the collected water from the pasteurizer was at a higher temperature than the set temperature 75 c and this caused the poor start up performance a similar finding was reported in another study 19 the system gave a total of 4 5 l of the pasteurized water per day as seen in fig 4 the maximum solar insolation gave the highest flow rate and the lowest holding time in the pasteurizer similar trends were reported in other studies as well 23 24 the system gave lower performance on the days with dust storms during the dust storms it took more time to heat the water and the targeted pasteurization temperature was not achieved according to another study the dust storms diffuse radiation and decrease the global direct solar radiation 50 3 2 2 e coli total coliforms and turbidity reductions in solar pasteurizer with the unfiltered water the pasteurizer efficiency to disinfect the unfiltered water was tested and 100 of e coli and 99 99 of total coliforms removals were observed as shown in fig 5 a and b the average number of the initial e coli in the unfiltered water was 8418 cfu 100 ml and e coli was not detected in any of the pasteurized water samples the average number of the initial total coliforms was 10571 cfu 100 ml in the unfiltered water and it was reduced to less than 1 cfu 100 ml in the effluent the two encountered problems with the unfiltered water were the turbidity in the effluent and the frequent cleaning of the pasteurizer therefore the turbidity removal testing was performed in the pasteurizer the average influent turbidity was 7 5 ntu an average of 7 32 reduction with an average of 6 96 ntu standard deviation 0 17 maximum 7 39 ntu minimum 6 325 ntu n 10 of the effluent turbidity was observed as shown in fig 5c the effluent turbidity was higher than 5 ntu acceptable turbidity value by who drinking water quality standard the results clearly showed that although the pasteurizer disinfects the water it cannot remove the turbidity and therefore it is not safe to drink the water produced in this process suspended and colloidal particles cause turbidity microorganisms like e coli and campylobacter can accumulate in these particles and when water flows they are mobilized 42 according to another study since the turbidity affected the disinfection efficiency of the soco dis system decreased by 10 15 water needs to be filtered before the treatment 17 according to another study when the turbidity of the sample was high it took longer residence time to reach a 4 log10 of the reduction in the bacterial load 31 in a different report the turbidity values remained within the maximum limit by standard averaging 4 7 0 9 after the pasteurization 48 in addition a high level of turbidity can cause frequent cleaning of the solar pasteurizer damage the valves and taps and fill the tanks and pipes 15 based on the findings and the literature it was concluded that the pasteurizer definitely needs a pretreatment to remove the turbidity 3 2 3 e coli and total coliforms reductions in solar pasteurizer with the filtered water the pasteurizer s performance to disinfect the filtered water was tested and 100 of e coli 99 99 of total coliforms removal rates were observed as shown in fig 6 a and 6b the average number of the initial e coli was 243 cfu 100 ml in the filtered water and no e coli was detected after the pasteurization the average number of the initial total coliforms was 340 cfu 100 ml in the filtered water and it was reduced to less than 1 cfu 100 ml in the effluent another study reported that an automatized solar pasteurizer reduced 14 000 mpn 100 ml to less than 3 mpn 100 ml for total coliforms at 55 c 60 c 65 c 70 c and 85 c and 40 mpn 100 ml to less than 3 mpn 100 ml for e coli at 65 c 75 c and 85 c 30 another study used a commercial solar water heating system and it was observed that a water sample with 105 107 e coli ml was converted to bacteriologically safe level in 4 h 27 this study produced higher removal rates for e coli and total coliforms after the pasteurization but further work needs to be performed to show that the microorganisms are not in the viable but non culturable vbnc state the vbnc state can be defined as pathogens survival strategy to endure harsh environmental stresses such as extreme temperature changes drying irradiation pulsed electric field starvation disinfectant exposure to chlorine sharp changes in ph and pressure according to some reports during food processing under certain conditions such as high pressure high temperature preservation disinfectant and low temperature storage the foodborne pathogens may enter the vbnc state which poses a serious threat to the human health 51 52 it was reported that e coli mycobacterium tuberculosis campylobacterspp klebsiella pneumoniae helicobacter pylori listeria monocytogenes pseudomonas aeruginosa several salmonella and shigella spp vibrio cholerae and vibrio parahaemolyticus enter the vbnc state 53 the vbnc cells are characterized by culturability loss on a conventional plate counting and regrowth ability when certain conditions are re established 53 51 52 therefore an effective detection method for bacteria in the vbnc state is utmost importance to provide the reliability of the disinfection methods 4 conclusion in this study turbidity e coli and total coliforms removals performance of an mbsf coupled with a solar pasteurizer was tested a zero valent iron as an extra disinfection layer and three layers of underdrain were used to design the mbsf to remove e coli total coliforms and turbidity the average flow rate was 0 0053 l min throughout the study then the flow rate declined and head loss increased over time due to the filter maturation based on the mbsf performance results an average of 98 removal of e coli 96 25 of total coliforms and 94 8 of turbidity removal rates were observed the turbidity in the filtered water was below who gcc acceptable level for drinking purposes although the removal of total coliforms and e coli achieved higher percent removal rate with the mbsf the number of bacteria in the effluent was above who guidelines subsequently the effluent from the mbsf was treated with the solar pasteurizer for full disinfection the flow through solar pasteurizer along with a solenoid valve was used as the water pasteurization system the pasteurizer s performance to disinfect unfiltered water at 75 c showed 100 of e coli and 99 99 of total coliforms and 7 32 of turbidity removal although the presence of e coli and total coliforms was not detected in the pasteurized water the turbidity of the pasteurized water was above who guidelines the results clearly indicated that although the pasteurizer disinfects water it cannot remove the turbidity hence a pretreatment is necessary to deliver safe water however the mbsf coupled with the pasteurizer achieved 100 removal of e coli and 99 99 removal of total coliforms and low turbidity values in the effluent which were below who limit consequently this study showed that both systems cannot be used as sole drinking water treatment systems alone although this study was a lab scale study it highlighted the benefits of a mbsf coupled with a solar pasteurizer in order to bring safe low cost clean and energy reliable water to people in need the results of this study are expected to provide a framework for the future studies focusing on the impact of operating conditions on the real scale systems the coupling of the mbsf with the solar pasteurizer will provide a reliable source of potable water not only in the individual accommodations but also in the places where a large number of people live together such as in the military and refugee camps or in the shelters during disasters acknowledgments this research was supported by khalifa university and

14568,bacteria play a main role in biological wastewater treatment plants wwtp herein bacterial diversity was characterized in a full scale wwtp treating petrochemical wastewater containing a wide range of hydrocarbons diversity analysis of the activated sludge was carried out using culture dependent and culture independent methods from a total of 20 bacterial species identified using 16s rrna sequence analysis brevibacillus parabrevis cloacibacterium normanense and sphingopyxis soli were described for the first time from a petrochemical wwtp the shannon diversity index as a measure of bacterial diversity showed decreases from 3 181 to 2 614 during warm and cold seasons the dominant phyla in all samples was proteobacteria comprised 63 of the total isolates overall the results showed that the diversity of bacterial communities was higher in warm months rather than cold months although volatilization has usually a significant role on the removal of volatile organics such as phenol benzene toluene and styrene from the liquid phase the presence of isolated bacterial species indicates their contribution in removal process thus further studies on the capabilities of isolated bacteria in degradation of specific pollutants will be helpful to deepen scientific understanding of biological treatment of difficult wastewaters keywords bacterial diversity 16s rrna genes petrochemical wastewater activated sludge 1 introduction petrochemical processes generate large quantity of wastewater 1 comprise of elevated amounts of chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod5 suspended solids oil and grease metal salts volatile compounds etc 2 3 activated sludge process is commonly used as a suitable treatment method to reduce organic compounds from such wastewaters 4 5 in this process microorganisms are maintained in liquid suspension by appropriate mixing methods within aeration tanks the desired microbial concentrations are provided by means of continues return of the settled sludge from secondary clarifiers to aeration tanks 6 the activated sludge contains of highly complex microbial biomass made of bacteria viruses fungi and yeasts 5 in which bacteria are dominant 7 there are some factors affecting bacterial composition including wastewater characteristics nutrient contents ph temperature dissolved oxygen etc and operational parameters solids retention times srt returned activated sludge ras food to microorganisms f m ratios mixing system plant configuration etc 4 8 9 understanding the composition of bacterial communities be present in the activated sludge can give a clear image on the effect of continuous process manipulation on contaminants removal 10 and provide important guidance in design and stable operation of wastewater treatment system 11 as a result it is necessary to understand the dynamics of the bacterial communities to monitor the operational problems develop strategies for improving process performance and high efficiency operation of biological processes occurring in wastewater treatment plants wwtps 5 12 up to now a few studies have been characterized the bacterial diversity in full scale petrochemical wastewater treatment plants pwwtp 4 13 14 most of them have been focused on lab scale systems 15 17 because of the complexity of bacterial structure in full scale wwtps implementing the lab scale results will make possible lots of inaccuracies 7 moreover to our knowledge no comprehensive investigations have been conducted so far to long term analysis the dynamic behavior of the bacterial community in activated sludge of a pwwtp on the other hand the majority of previous studies on full scale pwwtps have been conducted using culture based isolation and characterization methods 4 13 in the last two decades culture independent techniques such as the pcr based amplification of 16s ribosomal rna genes have been developed for bacterial community analysis in various environments 8 18 by applying 16s rrna extremely complex bacterial communities being in biological wwtps 19 and the association of bacterial species with process parameters have been described 8 however this technique has not been intensively applied in full scale pwwtps therefore more studies on full scale systems are needed to overcome this shortage and obtain useful knowledge about significant bacterial populations of activated sludge capable degrading specific pollutants as well as their diversity and seasonal variations thus the objectives of this work were a study on the performance of activated sludge in hydrocarbon removal b isolation and characterization of bacterial community and c estimating bacterial diversity using shannon diversity index 2 materials and

population belonging to the ith species 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of activated sludge reactor characteristics of the influent and effluent of activated sludge reactor are shown in table 1 the bod5 cod ratio in the influent varied between 0 4 0 5 during the indicating that it can be considered as readily biodegradable wastewater 6 the efficiency of activated sludge reactor was evaluated taking into account the values of some key parameters such as cod and bod5 in the influent and effluent samples the influent cod and bod5 were 345 467 and 171 190 mg l respectively which were slightly higher in summer and fall according to the results the cod and bod5 removal varied between 43 57 and 44 3 60 1 respectively at an average organic loading rate olr of 0 09 0 11 kg bod m3 d table 2 because of adjusting ph value in the primary treatment units prior to the aeration tanks the average ph value in the influent was 7 5 which is normally optimal for the biological treatment there was no significant difference in do concentrations within the bioreactor at all sampling runs do was maintained between 3 and 4 mg l using mechanical aerators it provides optimal aerobic conditions for biological activities and nitrification process inside the reactor 6 as can be seen in table 2 the mlss concentrations varied between 1551 and 1838 mg l and were always lower than the ranges stated by the plant design and literature 6 the low concentration of mlss might be explained by the composition of petrochemical wastewater which contains a variety of toxic and recalcitrant pollutants such as phenols cyanide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 16 that can affect the bacterial growth and consequently the mlss value 31 consistent with the operational parameters table 2 the hydraulic retention time hrt was around 22 h at average flow rate while the corresponding design value was 27 5 h the lower values of both hrt and mlss may severely affect the bioreactor efficiency and can lead to process instability and poor effluent quality 32 the bacterial population ranged from 5 5 106 to 1 1 107 cfu ml during the study period the same with the mlss values the higher number of cultivable bacteria were observed in august and february which may be attributed to the operation condition and composition of the influent as presence of nutrients which support the bacterial growth 3 2 analysis of bacterial community composition bacterial diversity at pwwtp was analyzed using culture dependent and culture independent methods seasonal variation of bacterial communities was investigated based on monthly recorded data collected during february may august and november 2015 the taxa observed in this study are presented in table 3 the proportion of bacteria at the phylum level shows that proteobacteria was the prevalent phylum at all sampling runs especially in may and august comprised 63 of the total isolates fig 3 similar results were reported in previous studies which found proteobacteria as the most dominant group in wwtps 33 34 proteobacteria belong to the gram negative heterotrophic bacteria and are able to degrade broad spectrum of organic contaminants and play important roles in cod nitrogen and phosphorous removal which are essential for wastewater treatment 35 the most abundant proteobacterial class was γ proteobacteria on average 40 7 of all bacteria detected with fewer bacteria belonging to β proteobacteria 14 8 and α proteobacteria 7 4 the second largest phylum was firmicutes represented by 26 of the total isolates a single representative of the phylum bacteroidetes and actinobacteria were also observed in the samples as can be seen in fig 3 no significant changes were observed in bacterial compositions in different seasons this is maybe due to the studied wastewater characteristics that are not much variable during a year based on the results the bacterial population was composed of 70 gram negative bacteria namely sphingopyxis alcaligenes neisseria schlegelella serratia pseudomonas escherichia vibrio klebsiella moraxella yersinia shigella veillonella and cloacibacterium plus with 30 gram positive bacteria including bacillus brevibacillus staphylococcus clostridium streptococcaceae and micrococcaceae the results also revealed that activated sludge system is favorable environment mostly for gram negative bacteria this is consistent with the results reported in the previous studies that found gram negative proteobacteria as the dominant and mostly occurring group in activated sludge used for treating similar petrochemical wastewater 4 15 3 3 diversity analysis shannon diversity index was used to compare seasonal variation of bacterial population diversity unidentified bacteria were not included in the index calculations as shown in table 4 the shannon s index was higher in august and lower in february and no significant difference was found between the indexes in may and november this can be explained by the slightly differences in temperatures during the seasons fang et al 36 proved that bacterial diversities and richness are positively associated with the water temperature 36 according to the calculated indexes in this study the bacterial diversity was lower than that of the conventional municipal wastewater treatment systems which was reported between 6 2 8 in the previous studies 11 37 this might be due to the recalcitrance and complexity of petrochemical wastewater 16 3 4 the most prevalent bacterial species based on the 16s rrna sequencing results among the 20 bacterial isolates the most prevalent bacterial species were pseudomonas sp sphingopyxis sp schlegelella sp bacillus sp brevibacillus sp and cloacibacterium sp additionally based on the blastn results 16s rrna genes sequences of isolates were exhibited maximum sequence similarity with the 16s rrna sequence of pseudomonas balearica sp1402t 99 sphingopyxis soli bl03t 100 schlegelella thermodepolymerans k14t 97 bacillus anthracis atcc 14578t 98 bacillus anthracis atcc 14578t 98 bacillus cereus atcc 14579t 99 brevibacillus parabrevis nbrc 12334t 98 and cloacibacterium normanense nrs1t 99 with accession codes from kx344881 to kx344889 as shown in fig 4 the isolated bacteria belonged to the phyla γ proteobacteria α proteobacteria β proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes represented mainly by genera pseudomonas sphingopyxis schlegelella bacillus brevibacillus and cloacibacterium respectively the ability of certain microorganisms to degrade aromatic compounds such as phenol benzene and toluene is documented since 1908 since then numerous studies have been carried out to find efficient microorganisms for degradation of such compounds among them bacteria of the genus pseudomonas especially p putida p fluorescens p aureofaciens p plecoglossicida and p aeruginosa besides other bacteria like bacillus cereus are often cited as benzene toluene and styrene degraders 38 41 bacillus hexabovorum was firstly introduced as a bacterium that is capable of growing aerobically in a medium containing toluene 40 according to goud et al 13 92 bacterial species have been isolated from activated sludge of a pwwtp in which the genera of pseudomonas bacillus aeromonas and azotobacter were reported as predominant groups with well growth in wastewater containing benzene butanol phenol xylene etc shokrollahzadeh et al 4 reported highly diverse bacterial groups in activated sludge of a pwwtp they found a population of bacteria consisted of pseudomonas 16 4 flavobacterium 13 5 comamonas 11 9 cytophaga 11 9 sphingomonas 10 4 acidovorax 10 4 and bacillus 7 5 similar to our findings several reports have referred to pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp as benzene and toluene degrading 13 42 43 and phenol degrading organisms 44 46 amongst the bacteria identified in our study bacillus anthracis has repeated as isolates of fbk7 9 11 and 12 bacillus anthracis was previously described as an organism capable to wastewater remediation 47 in addition pseudomonas balearica which was identified as fbk14 in our study has been mostly isolated from polluted environments many of the isolates have demonstrated capabilities to degrade hydrocarbons 48 and inorganic compounds 49 recently pseudomonas bacteria have been isolated from petrochemical wastewater and showed a high potential for growth in saline petrochemical wastewater 50 schlegellela thermodepolymerans as another isolate named fbk6 which was identified in this study previously isolated from activated sludge under aerobic and thermophilic conditions was able to metabolize poly 3 hydroxybutyrate as well as copolymers containing 3 hydroxybutyrate and 3 mercaptopropionate linked by thioester bonds 51 according to the results of another study 90 of the isolated bacterial strains from dairy wastewater and sludge samples belonged to basillus sp showing efficiencies up to 89 8 88 6 and 90 in removal of bod tss and oil and grease respectively 52 among the isolates brevibacillus parabrevisis was reported as the main isolate in oil and grease reduction about 90 brevibacillus parabrevishas also was isolated from municipal wastewater sludge as isolate capable to produce extracellular polymeric substances epss with high sludge flocculation potential 53 cloacibacterium normanense as a member of flavobacteriaceae family which are common in activated sludge generally play a significant role to decompose complex organic contaminants in aquatic habitats was isolated for the first time from municipal wastewater 54 later it was isolated from municipal wastewater sludge produced highest concentration of epss among all isolated strains 53 a year later a whole genome sequence was performed on cloacibacterium normanense recovered from untreated municipal wastewater 55 this strain has shown direct contribution to biological phosphate removal in activated sludge 54 55 on the other hand cloacibacterium sp which isolated from petrochemical wastewater has shown high ability in phenol degradation 56 since 2001 where the genus sphingopyxis was introduced for the first time 57 various species of this genus have been isolated from wwtps 58 59 and soil samples 60 in summary most of the isolated bacterial species in this study have been documented in previous studies as capable degraders of organic contaminants in various environments however this study is the first report in isolation of brevibacillus parabrevis sphingopyxis soli and cloacibacterium normanense from a pwwtp among them sphingopyxis soli showed the high occurrence in activated sludge in our all samples given the presence of these organisms in activated sludge samples they may have significant potential in the elimination of organic contaminants from such wastewaters therefore further studies concerning the capability of isolated bacteria in decomposition of specific pollutants should be performed to obtain useful knowledge in biological treatment of difficult wastewaters 3 5 performance of activated sludge system the main compounds including phenol benzene toluene and styrene were analyzed to assess the performance of bioreactor in hydrocarbons removal as presented in table 1 the concentration of phenol in the influent and effluent samples varied between 4 80 7 74 mg l and 0 015 0 120 mg l respectively phenol may be removed from wastewater via degradation and or release to the ambient air due to its nature as well as environmental factors such as liquid temperature and turbulence contrary to our initial expectations there was no significance loss of phenol during preliminary units e g equalization basin and daf system despite the high turbulence over these units this finding is in agreement with hussain et al 61 which reported no loss of phenol through volatilization using activated sludge for treating phenolic wastewater based on the results phenol removal by the activated sludge reactor varied between 98 5 99 6 highlighting that the biodegradation was the main mechanism for phenol removal this can be proven by the dominant presence of phenol and hydrocarbons degrading bacteria species such as cloacibacterium sp pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp in the activated sludge in a related study biodegradation by acclimatized activated sludge was found to be the main mechanism for phenol removal from synthetic phenolic wastewater 61 based on the results the concentration of benzene toluene and styrene in the influent samples fluctuated between 26 5 41 2 8 1 14 4 and 2 6 6 5 mg l respectively in addition the removal percentage of benzene toluene and styrene in the biological treatment process varied between 68 75 81 87 and 78 83 respectively although the significant portion of these pollutants can be removed from wastewater due to the non biodegradation mechanisms e g volatilization it seems that the bacteria presence in activated sludge have played an important role for corresponded removal the isolation of common microorganisms capable of utilizing hydrocarbons as carbon source such as pseudomonas sp bacillus sp cloacibacterium sp and sphingopyxis sp from activated sludge can confirm the role of biological processes in degradation of these compounds biodegradation and volatilization have been previously reported as the main mechanisms for the removal of benzene toluene and styrene from the wastewater 62 64 4 conclusion this study provides meaningful information into our knowledge about the bacterial community structure and the removal efficiencies of the main organic contaminants found in a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant the following conclusions can be drawn from the present study among the major genera of sphingopyxis schlegelella pseudomonas bacillus and cloacibacterium detected brevibacillus parabrevis sphingopyxis soli and cloacibacterium normanense were firstly isolated and reported from a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant this study has also described sphingopyxis soli as a dominant bacterial species while so far no data on the isolation of this from both municipal and petrochemical wastewater treatment plants had been reported in the literature diversity values given by shannon index showed that the bacterial diversity is temperature dependent and the index value was higher in warm months rather than cold months although the significant portions of benzene toluene and styrene concentrations have been removed from wastewater due to the non biodegradation mechanisms such as volatilization however the bacteria presence in activated sludge have played an important role for corresponded removal further studies on the capabilities of isolated strains in degradation of toxic and recalcitrant compounds will be helpful for developing efficient strategies in biological wastewater treatment systems compliance with ethical standards the local ethical

14568,bacteria play a main role in biological wastewater treatment plants wwtp herein bacterial diversity was characterized in a full scale wwtp treating petrochemical wastewater containing a wide range of hydrocarbons diversity analysis of the activated sludge was carried out using culture dependent and culture independent methods from a total of 20 bacterial species identified using 16s rrna sequence analysis brevibacillus parabrevis cloacibacterium normanense and sphingopyxis soli were described for the first time from a petrochemical wwtp the shannon diversity index as a measure of bacterial diversity showed decreases from 3 181 to 2 614 during warm and cold seasons the dominant phyla in all samples was proteobacteria comprised 63 of the total isolates overall the results showed that the diversity of bacterial communities was higher in warm months rather than cold months although volatilization has usually a significant role on the removal of volatile organics such as phenol benzene toluene and styrene from the liquid phase the presence of isolated bacterial species indicates their contribution in removal process thus further studies on the capabilities of isolated bacteria in degradation of specific pollutants will be helpful to deepen scientific understanding of biological treatment of difficult wastewaters keywords bacterial diversity 16s rrna genes

be present in the activated sludge can give a clear image on the effect of continuous process manipulation on contaminants removal 10 and provide important guidance in design and stable operation of wastewater treatment system 11 as a result it is necessary to understand the dynamics of the bacterial communities to monitor the operational problems develop strategies for improving process performance and high efficiency operation of biological processes occurring in wastewater treatment plants wwtps 5 12 up to now a few studies have been characterized the bacterial diversity in full scale petrochemical wastewater treatment plants pwwtp 4 13 14 most of them have been focused on lab scale systems 15 17 because of the complexity of bacterial structure in full scale wwtps implementing the lab scale results will make possible lots of inaccuracies 7 moreover to our knowledge no comprehensive investigations have been conducted so far to long term analysis the dynamic behavior of the bacterial community in activated sludge of a pwwtp on the other hand the majority of previous studies on full scale pwwtps have been conducted using culture based isolation and characterization methods 4 13 in the last two decades culture independent techniques such as the pcr based amplification of 16s ribosomal rna genes have been developed for bacterial community analysis in various environments 8 18 by applying 16s rrna extremely complex bacterial communities being in biological wwtps 19 and the association of bacterial species with process parameters have been described 8 however this technique has not been intensively applied in full scale pwwtps therefore more studies on full scale systems are needed to overcome this shortage and obtain useful knowledge about significant bacterial populations of activated sludge capable degrading specific pollutants as well as their diversity and seasonal variations thus the objectives of this work were a study on the performance of activated sludge in hydrocarbon removal b isolation and characterization of bacterial community and c estimating bacterial diversity using shannon diversity index 2 materials and

flavobacterium 13 5 comamonas 11 9 cytophaga 11 9 sphingomonas 10 4 acidovorax 10 4 and bacillus 7 5 similar to our findings several reports have referred to pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp as benzene and toluene degrading 13 42 43 and phenol degrading organisms 44 46 amongst the bacteria identified in our study bacillus anthracis has repeated as isolates of fbk7 9 11 and 12 bacillus anthracis was previously described as an organism capable to wastewater remediation 47 in addition pseudomonas balearica which was identified as fbk14 in our study has been mostly isolated from polluted environments many of the isolates have demonstrated capabilities to degrade hydrocarbons 48 and inorganic compounds 49 recently pseudomonas bacteria have been isolated from petrochemical wastewater and showed a high potential for growth in saline petrochemical wastewater 50 schlegellela thermodepolymerans as another isolate named fbk6 which was identified in this study previously isolated from activated sludge under aerobic and thermophilic conditions was able to metabolize poly 3 hydroxybutyrate as well as copolymers containing 3 hydroxybutyrate and 3 mercaptopropionate linked by thioester bonds 51 according to the results of another study 90 of the isolated bacterial strains from dairy wastewater and sludge samples belonged to basillus sp showing efficiencies up to 89 8 88 6 and 90 in removal of bod tss and oil and grease respectively 52 among the isolates brevibacillus parabrevisis was reported as the main isolate in oil and grease reduction about 90 brevibacillus parabrevishas also was isolated from municipal wastewater sludge as isolate capable to produce extracellular polymeric substances epss with high sludge flocculation potential 53 cloacibacterium normanense as a member of flavobacteriaceae family which are common in activated sludge generally play a significant role to decompose complex organic contaminants in aquatic habitats was isolated for the first time from municipal wastewater 54 later it was isolated from municipal wastewater sludge produced highest concentration of epss among all isolated strains 53 a year later a whole genome sequence was performed on cloacibacterium normanense recovered from untreated municipal wastewater 55 this strain has shown direct contribution to biological phosphate removal in activated sludge 54 55 on the other hand cloacibacterium sp which isolated from petrochemical wastewater has shown high ability in phenol degradation 56 since 2001 where the genus sphingopyxis was introduced for the first time 57 various species of this genus have been isolated from wwtps 58 59 and soil samples 60 in summary most of the isolated bacterial species in this study have been documented in previous studies as capable degraders of organic contaminants in various environments however this study is the first report in isolation of brevibacillus parabrevis sphingopyxis soli and cloacibacterium normanense from a pwwtp among them sphingopyxis soli showed the high occurrence in activated sludge in our all samples given the presence of these organisms in activated sludge samples they may have significant potential in the elimination of organic contaminants from such wastewaters therefore further studies concerning the capability of isolated bacteria in decomposition of specific pollutants should be performed to obtain useful knowledge in biological treatment of difficult wastewaters 3 5 performance of activated sludge system the main compounds including phenol benzene toluene and styrene were analyzed to assess the performance of bioreactor in hydrocarbons removal as presented in table 1 the concentration of phenol in the influent and effluent samples varied between 4 80 7 74 mg l and 0 015 0 120 mg l respectively phenol may be removed from wastewater via degradation and or release to the ambient air due to its nature as well as environmental factors such as liquid temperature and turbulence contrary to our initial expectations there was no significance loss of phenol during preliminary units e g equalization basin and daf system despite the high turbulence over these units this finding is in agreement with hussain et al 61 which reported no loss of phenol through volatilization using activated sludge for treating phenolic wastewater based on the results phenol removal by the activated sludge reactor varied between 98 5 99 6 highlighting that the biodegradation was the main mechanism for phenol removal this can be proven by the dominant presence of phenol and hydrocarbons degrading bacteria species such as cloacibacterium sp pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp in the activated sludge in a related study biodegradation by acclimatized activated sludge was found to be the main mechanism for phenol removal from synthetic phenolic wastewater 61 based on the results the concentration of benzene toluene and styrene in the influent samples fluctuated between 26 5 41 2 8 1 14 4 and 2 6 6 5 mg l respectively in addition the removal percentage of benzene toluene and styrene in the biological treatment process varied between 68 75 81 87 and 78 83 respectively although the significant portion of these pollutants can be removed from wastewater due to the non biodegradation mechanisms e g volatilization it seems that the bacteria presence in activated sludge have played an important role for corresponded removal the isolation of common microorganisms capable of utilizing hydrocarbons as carbon source such as pseudomonas sp bacillus sp cloacibacterium sp and sphingopyxis sp from activated sludge can confirm the role of biological processes in degradation of these compounds biodegradation and volatilization have been previously reported as the main mechanisms for the removal of benzene toluene and styrene from the wastewater 62 64 4 conclusion this study provides meaningful information into our knowledge about the bacterial community structure and the removal efficiencies of the main organic contaminants found in a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant the following conclusions can be drawn from the present study among the major genera of sphingopyxis schlegelella pseudomonas bacillus and cloacibacterium detected brevibacillus parabrevis sphingopyxis soli and cloacibacterium normanense were firstly isolated and reported from a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant this study has also described sphingopyxis soli as a dominant bacterial species while so far no data on the isolation of this from both municipal and petrochemical wastewater treatment plants had been reported in the literature diversity values given by shannon index showed that the bacterial diversity is temperature dependent and the index value was higher in warm months rather than cold months although the significant portions of benzene toluene and styrene concentrations have been removed from wastewater due to the non biodegradation mechanisms such as volatilization however the bacteria presence in activated sludge have played an important role for corresponded removal further studies on the capabilities of isolated strains in degradation of toxic and recalcitrant compounds will be helpful for developing efficient strategies in biological wastewater treatment systems compliance with ethical standards the local ethical

14569,we have developed bipolar membrane electrodialysis bped for simultaneous removal and recovery of boron from waste water bped is performed with a two cell electrodialysis unit composed of an anion exchange membrane aem sandwiched between two bipolar membranes bpm a semi batch type operation was performed by circulating solutions through the cells namely the removal and concentration cells the volume ratio of the reserve tanks for the feed stream to the cells was set to 4 1 removal concentratation tetrahydroxyborate ions were transported from the removal cell to the concentration cell through the aem in the ideal case the boron concentration in the concentrate should be concentrated to 5 times the initial concentration when the solutions of the same initial concentration were supplied to both cells of concentration and removal the concentrated solution was then used for second step to further concentrate the solution this concentrated solution was then used for third step and so forth the operation was continued step by step until the boron concentration was sufficiently high to easily recover boric acid the experimental results with a stack of five cells for the sodium borate solutions initial concentration 100 mg l showed that the boron concentration in the concentrate was about 4 while that in the diluate was less than 10 mg l which is below the regulatory value for waste water in japan after four steps the boron concentration in the concentrate reached close to the solubility of boric acid ca 10 000 mg l at which boron can be recovered for recycling keywords bipolar membrane electrodialysis boron recycling waste water treatment boric acid 1 introduction long term excessive intake of boron causes human health effects such as damage to the reproductive system 1 2 the world health organization recommends that the boron concentration in drinking water should be less than 2 4 mg l 3 the guideline boron concentrations in drinking and waste water have been regulated in many countries 4 5 in japan the guideline boron concentration in industrial waste water effluent is 10 mg l 6 there are several types of methods to remove boron from waste water 7 9 including membrane separation by reverse osmosis 10 11 electrodialysis 12 19 ion exchange 20 21 adsorption by solids 22 28 and hybrid processes using adsorption and membrane separation 29 32 most of the conventional methods are costly and an efficient low cost method for removal of boron from waste water needs to be developed boron and its compounds are widely used industrial raw materials for glass production ceramic engineering metal working industries 7 8 the boron resources used in japan are imported and it is desirable to recover or recycle boron from waste water for national resource security and cost reduction of the waste water treatment process in a previous study we proposed a new separation process for removal of boron from waste water based on bipolar membrane electrodialysis bped 13 bunani et al also applied the bped process for the recovery of boron 14 15 a schematic diagram of the bped system is shown in fig 1 the bped unit is composed of two bipolar membranes bpms and one anion exchange membrane aem where the aem is sandwiched between the two bpms the bpm is a laminated composite membrane that enables dissociation of water to generate and emit protons and hydroxide ions by applying an electric potential higher than 0 83 v along the membrane 13 the aem selectively transports anions the cell formed on the cathode side is the removal cell while that formed on the anode side is the concentration cell feed solutions with the same initial concentration of boron and ph are fed into both cells and circulated into the reserve tanks thus the separation process is performed as a semi batch operation the removal efficiency of boron is as high as 90 for an initial boron concentration of 100 mg l with a wide ph range of 2 3 12 0 the key function of the bpms is continuous supply of hydroxide ions to the removal cell and protons to the concentration cell the dominant form of boric acid depends on the ambient ph conditions under alkaline conditions ph pk a 9 14 the tetrahydroxyborate ion b oh 4 is dominant while under acidic condition ph 9 14 boric acid h3bo3 a non electrolyte is dominant 33 1 h3bo3 h2o h b oh 4 pk a 9 14 the boric acid supplied to the removal cell combines with hydroxide ions to form tetrahydroxyborate ions because tetrahydroxyborate ions are anions they are transported through the aem to the concentration cell where they combine with protons supplied by the other bpm located on the anode side to form boric acid a non electrolyte thus boron is continuously transported from the removal cell to the concentration cell theoretically all of the boric acid in the diluate should move to the concentrate however it would take an infinite amount of time for the concentration of boron in the removal cell to decrease to zero in contrast boron is concentrated in the concentrate when the volumes of the circulation reservoir tanks of the diluate and the concentrate are the same the concentration of boron in the concentrate would double for example the concentration of boron in the concentrate would be 200 mg l when the initial feed concentration of boron was 100 mg l this means that after the separation process the effluent with a higher concentration of boron needs to be treated if the bped process is repeated the concentration of boron in the concentrate would increase step by step finally the concentration of boron in the concentrate become close to the solubility of boric acid in this study the above concept of simultaneous removal and recovery of boric acid by multi step bped was investigated using a laboratory scale experimental apparatus there are several advantages of the bped process bped is essentially a no waste generating process and power saving compared with other separation processes because scaling up generally does not affect the performance of the bped process the obtained results can be used to investigate the feasibility of practical separation of boron from waste water 2 experimental a number of operational and environmental parameters affect the separation performance of bped in this study we investigated the effect of the volume ratio of the reservoirs on circulation of the feed solutions into the removal and concentration cells electrodialysis was performed with a laboratory scale apparatus agc engineering tokyo japan the bipolar membrane bpm used was neosepta bp 1b supplied by astom co tokyo japan the membrane thickness was 0 22 mm the anion exchange membrane aem used was selemion amv supplied by agc engineering co tokyo the membrane thickness is 0 15 mm and the resistance is 2 0 3 5 ωcm2 the ion exchange capacity is 2 0 2 3 meq g 34 the electrode solution was 0 1 m sodium sulfate solution the electrodialysis apparatus was composed of a stack of five bpm aem bpm units the effective diffusion area of the membranes in the stack was 117 5 cm2 and the gap between the membranes was 1 5 mm the total potential along the membrane stack was kept constant at 12 50 v the electrodialysis was conducted as a semi batch type operation as shown in schematically in fig 2 the feed solutions were circulated through the bped system by using two reservoir tanks one for circulation of the feed solution through the connected removal cells and the other for circulation of the feed solution through the connected concentration cells the initial boron concentration in the feed solution for the first step was set to 100 mg l by dissolving sodium borate na2b4o7 903 10h2o aq wako chemicals osaka japan in ion exchanged water the initial boron concentration for the second step was set equal to the final concentration of boron in the concentrate for first step by using sodium borate the initial boron concentration of the third step was set equal to the final concentration for the second step and so on in addition to examine the initial ph of the feed solution mixtures of boric acid and sodium borate with a set composition were used without using sodium hydroxide to adjust ph the circulation rates were 1 0 l min for the flow lines of the removal and concentration tanks the experimental conditions are summarized in table 1 the boron concentrations in the sampled solutions were analyzed by the icp aes icap6000 thermo california usa the experiments were performed at least three times for a single condition to confirm the reproducibility according to the material balance in the removal and concentration cells we obtain the following equation after one step bped 2 c 0 v 0 r 1 v 0 c f c 1 v 0 c f d 1 r 1 v 0 where c0 mg l is the initial concentration of boron in the feed cfd 1 mg l cfc 1 mg l are the final concentrations of boron in the diluate and in the concentrate respectively v0 l is the volume of the circulation tank of the concentration side and r 1 is the volume ratio of the circulation tank of the removal side to that of the concentration side the final concentration of boron in the concentration side can be given by 3 c f c 1 c 0 1 r 1 c f d 1 r 1 assuming an ideal case where the final concentration of boron in the diluate is cfd 1 0 100 removal the ideal final concentration of the concentrate is 4 c f c 1 c 0 1 r 1 when the concentrate after the 1st step of bped was used as the feed solution for the second step of bped the final concentration of boron in the concentrate for an ideal case should be given by 5 c f c 2 c 0 1 r 1 1 r 2 where r 2 is the volume ration of the circulation tank of the removal side to that of the concentration side for the second step with the step by step operation the final concentration of boron after n step bped ideal case is given by 6 c f c n c 0 k 1 n 1 r k for a special case with the same volume ratio r 1 r 2 r n r 7 c f c n c 0 1 r n to examine the effect of the volume ration on the volume ratio of the reservoir volumes for circulation of the feed solutions we examined two cases with r 4 and r 8 for both cases the volume ratio r was kept constant for each step bped note the volume of the concentrate after n steps will be v 0 1 r n 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 boron removal performance with a tank volume ratio of 4 1 fig 3 shows the changes in the concentrations of boron in the diluate and the concentrate with time for the first bped step the feed solution of sodium borate with an initial boron concentration of 100 mg l was supplied to each tank of the concentration and the removal and the initial volume ratio of the feed solution in the concentration tank to that in the removal tank was set to r 4 the boron concentration in the diluate decreases with time the boron concentration in the diluate after 60 min bped was 9 8 mg l which is below the regulation value for waste water in japan this indicates that the treated water after one bped step can be disposed of without further treatment the boron concentration in the concentrate increases with time and reaches 373 mg l after 60 min bped based on the material balance shown in eq 3 the final concentration of boron in the concentrate should be cfd 460 8 mg l by inserting c0 100 mg l and cfd 9 8 mg l the discrepancy of the final concentration of boron in the concentrate should be attributed to the absorption of boron in the aem in fact after the bped operation dissolution of absorbed boron was observed by immersing the membranes in water fig 4 shows the changes of the ph of the diluate and the concentrate during bped the ph of the diluate gradually increases from 9 2 to about 11 5 while that of the concentrate decreases from 9 2 to 8 5 since under acidic conditions ph 7 boric acid a non dissociated compound h3bo3 is the dominant species in the concentrate eq 1 while the tetrahydroxyborate ion b oh 4 is the dominant species in the diluate the alkaline condition in the diluate is achieved by hydroxide ions generated by the bpm and transported to the removal cell boric acid forms tetrahydroxyborate ions in the removal cell which are eventually transported to the concentration cell through the aem in the concentration cell tetrahydroxyborate ions should combine with protons transported from the bpm located at the anode side to form boric acid because boric acid is non ionic it would be concentrated in the concentration cell fig 5 shows the change of the current density and the current efficiency of bped with time the current density decreased at the very early stage of the bped operation and increased after 20 min the current efficiency decreases from about 90 after 10 min to about 5 after 60 min the decrease in the current efficiency is due to the decrease of the concentration of boric acid in the removal cell with time and the observed current is mostly attributed to hydroxyl ions generated from the bped the overall efficiency after 60 min which is defined as the molar ratio of boron transferred to the charge is about 27 9 fig 6 shows the changes of the concentrations of boron in the concentrate and diluate with time for the second bped step the initial concentration of boron in the feed was set to about 400 mg l by using sodium borate which corresponds to the final concentration of boron in the concentrate after the first bped step the boron concentrations after 60 min bped are 34 8 mg l in the diluate and 1535 mg l in the concentrate respectively fig 7 shows the changes of the concentrations of boron in the concentrate and diluate for the third bped step the initial concentration of boron in the feed was set to about 1500 mg l by using sodium borate which corresponds to the final concentration of boron in the concentrate after the second bped step the boron concentrations after 60 min bped are 345 mg l in the diluate and 4768 mg l in the concentrate fig 8 shows the changes of the concentrations of boron in the concentrate and in the diluate for the fourth bped step the initial concentration of boron in the feed flow was set to about 4500 mg l by using sodium borate which corresponds to the final concentration of boron in the concentrate after the third bped step the boron concentration in the concentrate after 30 min bped is 9583 mg l and that in the diluate is 1815 mg l the boron concentration in the concentrate gradually decreases with time after 40 min probably because of back diffusion from the concentration cell to the removal cell driven by the concentration difference in the two cells finally the concentration of boron in the concentrate almost reaches the solubility of boric acid 5 7 g l which is equivalent to a boron concentration of 10 112 mg l the ph values and boron concentrations in the concentrate and the diluate for each bped step are summarized in fig 9 and table 2 with increasing initial boron concentration in the feed the final ph of the diluate increases while the ph of the concentrate decreases the overall recovery ratio of boron which is the ratio of the amount of boron in the concentrate at the fourth step to that in the feed solution at the first step is about 70 the overall current efficiencies are 26 50 3 2 boron removal performance with a tank volume ratio of 8 1 when the volume ratio of the feed solution in the concentration tank to that in the removal tank was increased to r 8 concentration of boric acid accelerated as shown in figs 10 12 after the third bped step the boron concentration in the concentrate reaches about 10 000 mg l fig 12 which is almost equal to the solubility of boric acid however the boron concentration in the diluate after the first bped step is 40 mg l fig 10 which is far above the regulation value for waste water in japan in addition the power consumption for bped more rapidly increases with time with a volume ratio of 8 than with a volume ratio of 4 thus a volume ratio of 4 is more desirable than a volume ratio of 8 3 3 effects of the initial ph and composition of the feed solution the form of boric acid depends on the ambient ph condition therefore the removal and separation performances should also depend on the initial ph of the feed solution in the previous sections the feed solution was prepared with sodium borate and pure water where the initial ph is 9 20 and about half of the sodium borate borax would dissociate into tetrahydroxyborate ions to investigate the effect of dissociation of boric acid in the feed solution we tested the bped performance for mixtures of boric acid and sodium borate with various molar ratios the concentrations of boron after 60 min bped and the ph changes in the concentrate and diluate are given in table 3 when pure boric acid was used for the feed solution the boron concentrations in the concentrate and that in the diluate are almost unchanged after 60 min bped in the initial step all of the boric acid molecules in the feed solution are undissociated at the initial ph of 5 64 as shown in fig 13 hydroxide ions are provided from the bpms to the removal cell and the ph of the diluate initially slightly increases the ph then decreases up to 10 min and gradually increases after 10 min the ph of the concentrate initially decreases and then increases after 10 min the final ph values after 60 min are about 7 3 in both tanks the ph change of the boric acid solution is inhibited by the buffering effect of boric acid and the boric acid in the diluate remains almost undissociated even though hydroxide ions are provided by the bpm this is why boron is transported from the removal cell to the concentrate cell when boric acid is used as the feed with increasing initial ph the removal performance dramatically increases as shown in fig 14 from the results in this section using sodium borate or ph control of the feed solution by adding sodium hydroxide is essential for efficient removal of boron because the ph of the concentrate at each bped step is as low as ph 8 where the removal efficiency is low 4 process operation and future plan for the continuous separation process the diluate in the removal cell after bped operation should be used as the feed solution for the next bmed step however as is the present case the concentration of boron in the diluate does not necessary match the initial feed concentration required for the next bmed step in the present case for example the final concentration of boron in the diluate after the second step was 50 mg l fig 6 on the other hand the initial concentration of boron in the feed solution for the first step should be 100 mg l it is necessary to adjust the boron concentration in the diluate after the i th step to the initial concentration of the feed solution of the previous the i 1 th step for preventing the concentration discrepancy the concentrations of the solutions can be controlled by designing the operation conditions of bmed especially the operation time for real waste water treatment the effect of coexisting anions should also be considered which will be reported in a subsequent paper 5 conclusions we have proposed a new method for simultaneous removal and recovery of boron from waste water effluent based on the multi step bped method when the volume ratio of the concentrate to the diluate was 4 1 for an initial boron concentration of 100 mg l the final concentration of boron on the diluate side decreased to 9 8 mg l after 60 min which is below the regulation value for waste water in japan the boron concentration in the concentrate approached the solubility of boric acid after four bped steps the high concentration of boron in the concentrate enables recovery of boric acid from the effluent and recycling of boron is realized when the volume ratio of the concentrate tank to the removal tank was changed to 8 1 for a feed solution with a boron concentration of 100 mg l only three steps were necessary to concentrate to the solubility of boric acid however the final concentration of boron in the diluate after the first bped step was considerably higher than 10 mg l

second step with the step by step operation the final concentration of boron after n step bped ideal case is given by 6 c f c n c 0 k 1 n 1 r k for a special case with the same volume ratio r 1 r 2 r n r 7 c f c n c 0 1 r n to examine the effect of the volume ration on the volume ratio of the reservoir volumes for circulation of the feed solutions we examined two cases with r 4 and r 8 for both cases the volume ratio r was kept constant for each step bped note the volume of the concentrate after n steps will be v 0 1 r n 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 boron removal performance with a tank volume ratio of 4 1 fig 3 shows the changes in the concentrations of boron in the diluate and the concentrate with time for the first bped step the feed solution of sodium borate with an initial boron concentration of 100 mg l was supplied to each tank of the concentration and the removal and the initial volume ratio of the feed solution in the concentration tank to that in the removal tank was set to r 4 the boron concentration in the diluate decreases with time the boron concentration in the diluate after 60 min bped was 9 8 mg l which is below the regulation value for waste water in japan this indicates that the treated water after one bped step can be disposed of without further treatment the boron concentration in the concentrate increases with time and reaches 373 mg l after 60 min bped based on the material balance shown in eq 3 the final concentration of boron in the concentrate should be cfd 460 8 mg l by inserting c0 100 mg l and cfd 9 8 mg l the discrepancy of the final concentration of boron in the concentrate should be attributed to the absorption of boron in the aem in fact after the bped operation dissolution of absorbed boron was observed by immersing the membranes in water fig 4 shows the changes of the ph of the diluate and the concentrate during bped the ph of the diluate gradually increases from 9 2 to about 11 5 while that of the concentrate decreases from 9 2 to 8 5 since under acidic conditions ph 7 boric acid a non dissociated compound h3bo3 is the dominant species in the concentrate eq 1 while the tetrahydroxyborate ion b oh 4 is the dominant species in the diluate the alkaline condition in the diluate is achieved by hydroxide ions generated by the bpm and transported to the removal cell boric acid forms tetrahydroxyborate ions in the removal cell which are eventually transported to the concentration cell through the aem in the concentration cell tetrahydroxyborate ions should combine with protons transported from the bpm located at the anode side to form boric acid because boric acid is non ionic it would be concentrated in the concentration cell fig 5 shows the change of the current density and the current efficiency of bped with time the current density decreased at the very early stage of the bped operation and increased after 20 min the current efficiency decreases from about 90 after 10 min to about 5 after 60 min the decrease in the current efficiency is due to the decrease of the concentration of boric acid in the removal cell with time and the observed current is mostly attributed to hydroxyl ions generated from the bped the overall efficiency after 60 min which is defined as the molar ratio of boron transferred to the charge is about 27 9 fig 6 shows the changes of the concentrations of boron in the concentrate and diluate with time for the second bped step the initial concentration of boron in the feed was set to about 400 mg l by using sodium borate which corresponds to the final concentration of boron in the concentrate after the first bped step the boron concentrations after 60 min bped are 34 8 mg l in the diluate and 1535 mg l in the concentrate respectively fig 7 shows the changes of the concentrations of boron in the concentrate and diluate for the third bped step the initial concentration of boron in the feed was set to about 1500 mg l by using sodium borate which corresponds to the final concentration of boron in the concentrate after the second bped step the boron concentrations after 60 min bped are 345 mg l in the diluate and 4768 mg l in the concentrate fig 8 shows the changes of the concentrations of boron in the concentrate and in the diluate for the fourth bped step the initial concentration of boron in the feed flow was set to about 4500 mg l by using sodium borate which corresponds to the final concentration of boron in the concentrate after the third bped step the boron concentration in the concentrate after 30 min bped is 9583 mg l and that in the diluate is 1815 mg l the boron concentration in the concentrate gradually decreases with time after 40 min probably because of back diffusion from the concentration cell to the removal cell driven by the concentration difference in the two cells finally the concentration of boron in the concentrate almost reaches the solubility of boric acid 5 7 g l which is equivalent to a boron concentration of 10 112 mg l the ph values and boron concentrations in the concentrate and the diluate for each bped step are summarized in fig 9 and table 2 with increasing initial boron concentration in the feed the final ph of the diluate increases while the ph of the concentrate decreases the overall recovery ratio of boron which is the ratio of the amount of boron in the concentrate at the fourth step to that in the feed solution at the first step is about 70 the overall current efficiencies are 26 50 3 2 boron removal performance with a tank volume ratio of 8 1 when the volume ratio of the feed solution in the concentration tank to that in the removal tank was increased to r 8 concentration of boric acid accelerated as shown in figs 10 12 after the third bped step the boron concentration in the concentrate reaches about 10 000 mg l fig 12 which is almost equal to the solubility of boric acid however the boron concentration in the diluate after the first bped step is 40 mg l fig 10 which is far above the regulation value for waste water in japan in addition the power consumption for bped more rapidly increases with time with a volume ratio of 8 than with a volume ratio of 4 thus a volume ratio of 4 is more desirable than a volume ratio of 8 3 3 effects of the initial ph and composition of the feed solution the form of boric acid depends on the ambient ph condition therefore the removal and separation performances should also depend on the initial ph of the feed solution in the previous sections the feed solution was prepared with sodium borate and pure water where the initial ph is 9 20 and about half of the sodium borate borax would dissociate into tetrahydroxyborate ions to investigate the effect of dissociation of boric acid in the feed solution we tested the bped performance for mixtures of boric acid and sodium borate with various molar ratios the concentrations of boron after 60 min bped and the ph changes in the concentrate and diluate are given in table 3 when pure boric acid was used for the feed solution the boron concentrations in the concentrate and that in the diluate are almost unchanged after 60 min bped in the initial step all of the boric acid molecules in the feed solution are undissociated at the initial ph of 5 64 as shown in fig 13 hydroxide ions are provided from the bpms to the removal cell and the ph of the diluate initially slightly increases the ph then decreases up to 10 min and gradually increases after 10 min the ph of the concentrate initially decreases and then increases after 10 min the final ph values after 60 min are about 7 3 in both tanks the ph change of the boric acid solution is inhibited by the buffering effect of boric acid and the boric acid in the diluate remains almost undissociated even though hydroxide ions are provided by the bpm this is why boron is transported from the removal cell to the concentrate cell when boric acid is used as the feed with increasing initial ph the removal performance dramatically increases as shown in fig 14 from the results in this section using sodium borate or ph control of the feed solution by adding sodium hydroxide is essential for efficient removal of boron because the ph of the concentrate at each bped step is as low as ph 8 where the removal efficiency is low 4 process operation and future plan for the continuous separation process the diluate in the removal cell after bped operation should be used as the feed solution for the next bmed step however as is the present case the concentration of boron in the diluate does not necessary match the initial feed concentration required for the next bmed step in the present case for example the final concentration of boron in the diluate after the second step was 50 mg l fig 6 on the other hand the initial concentration of boron in the feed solution for the first step should be 100 mg l it is necessary to adjust the boron concentration in the diluate after the i th step to the initial concentration of the feed solution of the previous the i 1 th step for preventing the concentration discrepancy the concentrations of the solutions can be controlled by designing the operation conditions of bmed especially the operation time for real waste water treatment the effect of coexisting anions should also be considered which will be reported in a subsequent paper 5 conclusions we have proposed a new method for simultaneous removal and recovery of boron from waste water effluent based on the multi step bped method when the volume ratio of the concentrate to the diluate was 4 1 for an initial boron concentration of 100 mg l the final concentration of boron on the diluate side decreased to 9 8 mg l after 60 min which is below the regulation value for waste water in japan the boron concentration in the concentrate approached the solubility of boric acid after four bped steps the high concentration of boron in the concentrate enables recovery of boric acid from the effluent and recycling of boron is realized when the volume ratio of the concentrate tank to the removal tank was changed to 8 1 for a feed solution with a boron concentration of 100 mg l only three steps were necessary to concentrate to the solubility of boric acid however the final concentration of boron in the diluate after the first bped step was considerably higher than 10 mg l
