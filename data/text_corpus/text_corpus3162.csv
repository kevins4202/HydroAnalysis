15810,in order to resolve the poor antibiotics rejection and serious fouling of ultrafiltration uf membrane during municipal wastewater reclamation a novel anodic membrane defective uio 66 d uio 66 graphite polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf with high pure water flux 596 1 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 was fabricated by incorporating defective zirconium based metal organic framework d uio 66 and conductive graphite particles into pvdf matrix and applied in the coupling of electro oxidation and membrane filtration process compared to the other anodic membranes i e graphite pvdf and uio 66 graphite pvdf d uio 66 graphite pvdf possesses superior anti fouling and self cleaning abilities flux recovery 100 model foulant bovine serum albumin in both intermittent and continuous supply of electric field under current density of 0 01 ma cm2 moreover efficient antibiotics tetracycline norfloxacin tylosin and sulfamethoxazole removal 96 6 and bactericidal efficiency against e coli and s aureus 100 were achieved simultaneously without the addition of chemical reagents due to the higher electrocatalytic activity of anodic membrane for oxidation of pollutants by oh and o2 free radicals three degradation pathways of antibiotics were proposed and the self cleaning mechanism of membrane was dominated by the synergy of the partial mineralization and the reduced fouling potential of foulants after oxidation as revealed by the increase in hydrophilicity and decrease in negative charge and molecular weight the fabricated membrane also presents excellent electrochemical stability separation and self cleaning performance for treatment of municipal secondary effluent during long term filtration with low electric energy consumption which is promising in wastewater reclamation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultrafiltration membrane self cleaning electrocatalysis antibiotics water reclamation 1 introduction recently the severe global water scarcity induces the increasing occurrence of wastewater reclamation by ultrafiltration uf membrane technology due to its appealing water purification capability with relatively low energy consumption wang et al 2017 municipal wastewater recycling has drawn increasingly interests as an alternative water resource for agricultural industrial and ecological water supplement uses however uf membrane is unable to retain small molecular antibiotics that are prevalent and emerging in the municipal wastewater which will promote bacterial resistance and pose risks to human health if the filtrated water was used for reclamation oberoi et al 2019 more importantly membrane fouling is another limiting factor in practical application for water reuse the secondary effluent organic matter efom is prone to deposit on the membrane surface or inside pore and cause organic fouling and severe flux decline wang et al 2017 besides pathogenic bacteria cannot be fully retained by uf membrane and the residual bacteria can bring about potential threats to public health moreover the bacteria can adhere to the membrane and form biofilm layer on membrane under suitable conditions which evokes bio fouling fan et al 2019a in order to address above challenges innovative coupling of electro oxidation and membrane filtration has been developed by combining the advantages of oxidative degradation and membrane separation without the addition of chemical reagents it also facilitates the mass transfer of pollutants onto the active sites of membrane electrodes sun et al 2021 anodic membranes have been drawn intensive attentions in water treatment as the in situ produced reactive oxygen species ros e g oh and o2 can remove the small molecular pollutants inactivate bacteria and degrade large molecular organic foulants of membrane e g efom wei et al 2020 therefore they provide a promising candidate in municipal wastewater reclamation to achieve multifunction of antibiotics removal disinfection and membrane fouling control wang et al 2021 in recent years carbonaceous materials e g carbon nanotubes yang et al 2019 and graphene werner et al 2016 have been intensively used to fabricate electrochemical membrane due to their efficient self cleaning performance by the electrical repulsion and electro oxidation sun et al 2020 however they act as the active anode with a relatively low overpotential for the side oxygen evolution reaction oer and interact strongly with the electrogenerated ros sun et al 2021 moreover they suffer from electric corrosion hence many inactive anodes with higher oer potential have been reported to modify membrane such as sno2 and ti4o7 2 2 2 7 v almassi et al 2020 despite the efficient generation of ros the short service time of sno2 and the passivation of ti4o7 limit their application for long term membrane filtration process sun et al 2021 consequently anodic membranes with better electrocatalytic activity for ros production higher oer potential and stronger electrical corrosion resistance are required to develop for wastewater reclamation given the merits of the large specific surface areas isolated active sites and versatile catalytic activities metal organic frameworks mofs have been proven as efficient electrocatalysts and widely applied for oer cheng et al 2021 oxygen reduction reaction orr hydrogen evolution reaction her and carbon dioxide reduction xu et al 2018 however the high coordination number of metal nodes in mofs hinders the interaction between catalytic active sites and pollutants dou et al 2020 defect engineering e g missing linker defects is proved as a promising strategy and versatile platform to increase the electrocatalytic activity and conductivity of mofs since more active sites and dangling bonds are generated heidary et al 2021 up to now the defective mofs have been used as electrocatalyst for oer xue et al 2019 orr yang et al 2021 and nitrogen reduction khalil et al 2021 on the other hand mofs were widely applied to promote the anti fouling ability of membrane and hold potential to break the tradeoff between permeability and selectivity yuan and zhu 2020 among them uio 66 a highly water stable zirconium mof attracted intensive intention in fabrication of membrane and application in water treatment for antibiotics removal via size exclusion and electrostatic interaction fang et al 2020 nevertheless to the best of our knowledge no published study investigated the mofs or defective mofs based electrified membranes for wastewater treatment moreover the electrocatalytic mechanism of mofs based membrane requires an in depth investigation liu et al 2020a consequently in this study defective uio 66 d uio 66 a water stable zirconium based mof was used to fabricate uf membrane for wastewater reclamation and the graphite powder was also incorporated to enhance the conductivity of membrane the major objectives of this project are as follows 1 to systematically characterize the structure physicochemical and electrochemical properties of different anodic membranes 2 to investigate the electrocatalytic activity of different anodic membranes including removal

information text s1 all reagents were of at least analytical grade and used as received without further purification the preparation of synthetic wastewater and the sampling of municipal secondary effluent were described in text s2 among them bovine serum albumin bsa was selected as model membrane foulant because it was usually used as one of the model biopolymers which caused severe uf membrane fouling xing et al 2019 escherichia coli e coli and staphylococcus aureus s aureus were selected as the model bacteria to evaluate the bactericidal property performance of membrane ni et al 2021 the typical characteristics of municipal secondary effluent were listed in table 1 2 2 synthesis of zr mofs and anodic membranes the synthesis procedures of uio 66 d uio 66 and anodic membranes were described in text s3 which was also schematically illustrated in supplementary fig s1 the defective uio 66 was denoted as d uio 66 x where x represents the volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid 0 25 0 75 and 1 0 ml uio 66 and d uio 66 were incorporated into the casting solution containing graphite and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and the fabricated membranes were designated as uio 66 graphite pvdf x wt and d uio 66 graphite pvdf x wt respectively where x presented the loading amount of mofs notably 12 wt loading of graphite was used to increase the conductivity of membrane in this study supplementary fig s2 and graphite pvdf membrane was also fabricated for comparison purpose 2 3 analysis and characterization analysis of synthetic and municipal wastewater was described text s4

fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermogravimetric differential thermogravimetric tg dtg analysis pore size distribution and molecular weight cutoff mwco the operation methods were elaborated in text s5 the procedures for electrochemical test were summarized in text s6 including cyclic voltammetry cv linear sweep voltammetry lsv electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and the accelerated lifetime testing the electrochemically active surface area ecsa and predicted service lifetime were calculated by eqs s1 and s2 respectively lim et al 2018 2 4 electrocatalytic performance of anodic membrane in order to study the electrocatalytic performance of membrane an electro oxidation and membrane filtration combined system was designed as illustrated in fig 1 which contained a cross flow filtration sf sb hangzhou saifei china flux measurement pgc 1502 adam uk and direct current supply gh 1718 dahua instrument china units the membrane that posted on titanium mesh was acted as anode and faced the feed side while titanium mesh 40 μm was used as cathode due to the less fouling and high corrosion resistance the distance between anode and cathode was 10 mm the transmembrane pressure tmp and flow rate were 0 2 mpa and 0 22 m s respectively the electrocatalytic performances of different anodic membranes were assessed and compared for treatment of synthetic wastewater in both intermittent and continuous supply of electric field the detailed procedures were summarized in text s7 including the oxidative degradation of typical antibiotics tetracycline norfloxacin tylosin and sulfamethoxazole electrocatalytic self cleaning when using bsa as model foulant and bactericidal ability against gram negative e coli and gram positive s aureus under current densities of 0 005 0 01 and 0 015 ma cm2 the pure water flux j0 water flux jt normalized flux jn and flux loss rate jl rate antibiotics removal and the quantified bactericidal efficiency were calculated by eqs s3 s8 respectively 2 5 mechanism 2 5 1 identification of free radicals methanol 5 mm tert butyl alcohol tba 5 mm and benzoquinone 5 mm were selected as the scavengers of free radicals and added into the feed water to quench oh so4 and o2 zhang et al 2021 the removal efficiency of antibiotics and bsa were investigated without and with the addition of above three scavengers 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was employed as the trap agent and the signals of free radicals oh so4 and o2 were in situ detected by electron spin resonance epr spectrometer jes fa 200 jeol japan without and with electrical field current density 0 01 ma cm2 2 5 2 degradation pathway in order to clarify the possible degradation pathway the intermediates of tetracycline after electrocatalytic oxidation were identified by a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer lc ms 1290 infinity lc 6460 qqq ms agilent usa equipped with a quadrupole mass detector the detailed procedure and experimental parameters were described in text s8 2 5 3 membrane autopsy the membranes before and after electrocatalytic self cleaning were characterized by attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir sem and contact angle all membranes were air dried at room temperature prior to characterizations 2 6 application of municipal wastewater reclamation the long term filtration of municipal wastewater was conducted by d uio 66 graphite pvdf anodic membrane in the intermittent and continuous modes for 30 cycles and 30 days under current density of 0 01 ma cm2 respectively antibiotics removal bactericidal and self cleaning performance of membrane was determined moreover the water quality of permeate was analyzed including chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod turbidity and total suspended solids tss the corresponding energy consumption was calculated by eq s9 the membrane stability was assessed by collecting the permeate periodically and determining the zirconium concentration by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes icap 6300 thermofisher usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 zr mofs sem images in supplementary fig s3 revealed the crystalline nanoparticles of uio 66 and their shape did not change after defective engineering for d uio 66 0 25 and d uio 66 0 75 conversely they became amorphous for d uio 66 1 0 the numbers of missing linker defects per zr6 cluster were 0 48 0 84 and 0 97 for d uio 66 0 25 d uio 66 0 75 and d uio 66 1 0 according to tg analysis in supplementary fig s4a respectively furthermore supplementary fig s4b confirmed the presence of zr μ3 o 747 and 665 cm 1 and carboxylic acid 1402 and 1661 cm 1 from the ftir spectra of uio 66 with different defects fang et al 2020 the xrd patterns in supplementary fig s4c further revealed the characteristics peaks of uio 66 castarlenas et al 2017 n2 adsorption desorption isotherm supplementary fig s4d displayed that uio 66 with different defect degrees all exhibited microporous structure moreover defective uio 66 possessed more negative charges than uio 66 at ph 7 0 as revealed by the lower zeta potential supplementary fig s4e pore size distribution supplementary fig s5 and pore structure parameters table s1 showed that the specific surface area and pore size of uio 66 increased at elevated defective degrees due to the removal of organic linkers from the mofs structures to sum up the uio 66 and defective uio 66 are successfully synthesized and the excessively high defects will damage its crystalline structure therefore d uio 66 0 75 was used for fabrication of membrane and denoted as d uio 66 in the following experiments 3 1 2 membrane morphology membrane morphology of membranes was investigated using sem fig 2 illustrated that circular particles appeared for uio 66 graphite pvdf and d uio 66 graphite pvdf membranes ascribing to the incorporation of zr mofs furthermore more particles were found on membrane surface if the loading amount of d uio 66 increased from 5 to 15 wt however the pore size of membrane sharply reduced when it was up to 15 wt fig 2e which may enhance the filtration resistance in addition according to the cross sectional morphology of membrane plenty of amorphous graphite particles dispersed on pvdf membrane matrix figs s6a and s6b while circular zr mofs nanoparticles were embedded into membrane matrix figs s6c s6j which likely confirmed the successful loading of zr mofs into the membrane aghili et al 2020 3 1 3 physicochemical property of membrane atr ftir spectra fig 3 a exhibited the characteristic bands of pvdf that located at 840 877 1180 and 1401 cm 1 for pvdf membrane ding et al 2020 a new peak appeared at 1738 cm 1 for membranes with the incorporation of uio 66 and d uio 66 ascribing to the carboxyl group cooh from the organic ligand 1 4 benzenedicarboxylate the intensity of above peak became stronger with more loading of d uio 66 in membrane matrix furthermore pore size distribution was determined to clarify the effect of zr mofs nanofillers on membrane pore structure fig 3b showed all membranes had ordered pore structure with narrow pore size distribution more specific the incorporation of uio 66 and d uio 66 reduced the average pore sizes of membrane from 61 38 to 41 34 and 43 25 nm respectively notably d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane has a higher pore size than that of uio 66 graphite pvdf because the defective engineering increased the pore size of uio 66 table s1 in a similar manner fig 3c displayed that mwco of membranes reduced by incorporating zr mofs moreover the value was higher for d uio 66 graphite pvdf than uio 66 graphite pvdf thereby possessing lower filtration resistance tg dtg analysis was conducted to evaluate the thermal stability of membrane as depicted in fig 3d there were three stages in tg curve and no obvious weight loss was observed for all membranes when the temperature was lower than 360 c as a matter of fact although the total weight loss was slightly higher for zr mofs graphite pvdf membranes than graphite pvdf at 900 cdue to the degradation of organic ligand they still remained good thermal stability dtg curve fig 3d showed that there were two peaks located at 391 9 c and 426 6 cfor zr mofs graphite pvdf membrane ascribing to the decomposition of zr mofs and pvdf respectively castarlenas et al 2017 fig 3e displayed that graphite pvdf membrane has high contact angle of 100 6 due to the inherent hydrophobic nature of pvdf and graphite by comparison the incorporation of hydrophilic uio 66 and d uio 66 nanofillers markedly reduced the contact angle of membranes in particular the contact angle of d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane 69 5 was lower than that of uio 66 graphite pvdf 84 9 with the same loading of zr mofs 10 wt additionally this variation became more obvious for membranes with higher loading of d uio 66 the higher hydrophilicity of d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane was conductive to increase the permeate flux and enhance anti fouling ability of membrane al shaeli et al 2021 in summary the characterizations of anodic membranes lead us to confer that uio 66 and d uio 66 nanoparticles are successfully embedded into the membrane matrix and they endow the membrane with smaller pore size higher hydrophilicity and good thermal stability 3 1 4 electrochemical property of membrane cv loops exhibited the oxidation peaks for degradation of tetracycline and bsa by all anodic membranes fig 4 a and b respectively notably table s2 illustrated that higher current densities are recorded at the oxidation peak for d uio 66 graphite pvdf 10 wt compared to uio 66 graphite pvdf 10 wt and graphite pvdf indicating that d uio 66 imparts the membrane with better electrocatalytic activity than uio 66 zheng et al 2020 besides the current densities at the oxidation peaks enhanced with the increasing amount of d uio 66 from 5 to 10 wt but weakened when it further increased to 15 wt due to the reduced conductivity of membrane in addition ecsa of graphite pvdf uio 66 graphite pvdf and d uio 66 graphite pvdf membranes were 0 0022 0 011 and 1 8 cm2 table s3 respectively according to the cv response under a non faradaic window supplementary fig s7 and the plot of the current density differences against scan rates supplementary fig s8 hence d uio 66 graphite pvdf possessed most exposed active sites among all anodic membranes zhong et al 2021 which boosted the oxidative degradation of pollutants in addition oer potentials of anodic membranes were obtained from lsv polarization curves fig 4c as shown in table s4 d uio 66 graphite pvdf 10 wt possessed the highest oer potential 2 00 v than the other membranes as oxygen evolution is a competitive reaction for anodic oxidation the incorporation of d uio 66 in membrane will minimize oer side reaction and boost the electrocatalytic oxidation of pollutants compared to uio 66 huang et al 2020 additionally nyquist plots of eis fig 4d revealed the lowest charge transfer resistance rct of d uio 66 graphite pvdf among all membranes which was conductive to enhance the electronic interactions zou et al 2019 notably the further increase in the loading amount of d uio 66 from 10 to 15 wt caused a slight decrease in oer potential fig 4c and increase in rct fig 4d which was detrimental to electrocatalytic oxidation of pollutants therefore the loading amount of d uio 66 in membrane was 10 wt in the following sections unless otherwise stated besides chronoamperometric tests showed that d uio 66 graphite pvdf possessed the higher current for oxidation of tetracycline fig 4e and bsa fig 4f than the other membranes in the steady condition thereby favoring the oxidative degradation scialdone et al 2009 to sum up the electrochemical tests confirmed that d uio 66 with the appropriate loading amount endowed the uf membrane with superior electrocatalytic activity towards oxidative degradation of small and large organic pollutants compared to uio 66 owing to its disordered coordination of zr4 and more electrochemical active sites yan et al 2021 as a result d uio 66 graphite pvdf holds great potential to possess a dual function of antibiotics removal and membrane fouling control 3 2 permeate flux and antibiotics removal the pure water flux j0 of membrane was determined by cross flow method interestingly although the incorporation of uio 66 and d uio 66 10 wt reduced the pore size fig 3b and mwco fig 3c of membrane they increased j0 from 305 7 graphite pvdf to 504 4 and 596 1 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 fig 5 a respectively two factors caused this phenomenon 1 zr mofs increased the membrane hydrophilicity fig 3e which facilitated the transport of water through membrane 2 zr mofs possessed high porosity and provided additional water passages ma et al 2017 thereby offsetting the negative impact of the reduced membrane pore size moreover j0 of d uio 66 graphite pvdf was higher than that of uio 66 graphite pvdf due to the higher pore size and specific surface area of d uio 66 than uio 66 table s1 besides higher j0 was observed when the loading amount of d uio 66 in membrane increased from 5 to 10 while the excess loading 15 wt caused more severe pore blockage supplementary fig s6 and decreased the flux due to the aggregation of mofs similar trends were also perceived by previous literature al shaeli et al 2021 pang et al 2019 furthermore we determined the electrocatalytic activity of anodic membrane for degradation of tetracycline 15 mg l in synthetic wastewater it should be stressed that although the concentration of antibiotics was higher than that in real wastewater it can facilitate the analysis to highlight the electrocatalytic performance of membrane in addition the applied current density was 0 01 ma cm2 as the higher value 0 015 ma cm2 cannot lead to the better tetracycline removal supplementary fig s9a fig 5b showed that the removal curve consisted of two stages including an initial stage with higher removal rate 0 30 min and a second stage with slower one 30 180 min the normalized concentration c c0 of tetracycline dropped to 0 72 the first stage and still remained 0 59 mg l after oxidation for 180 min by graphite pvdf membrane which exhibited poor removal efficiency of antibiotics furthermore c c0 decreased to 0 61 and 0 30 at the first and second stages for uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane 10 wt respectively in comparison the oxidation by d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane 10 wt led to much higher tetracycline removal ratio of 96 6 c c0 0 034 due to its superior electrocatalytic activity fig 4 moreover tetracycline removal was promoted by the increase in loading amount of d uio 66 from 5 to 10 wt but reduced at excessive loading 15 wt since zr mofs possessed relatively poor conductivity liu et al 2020b and enhanced the resistivity of anodic membrane fig 4d notably in despite of the excellent tetracycline removal supplementary fig s10 showed that the mineralization ratio was 81 for d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane suggesting that antibiotics cannot be fully mineralized by anodic membrane besides all anodic membranes negligibly increased the tetracycline removal without electricity supplementary fig s11 which confirmed the negligible effect of adsorption and critical impact of electro oxidation on tetracycline removal additionally we investigated the removal kinetics of tetracycline by anodic membranes using pseudo first order model and the fitting curve was showed in fig 5c as listed in table s5 the rate constant k for removal of tetracycline by d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane 10 wt was about 2 81 times higher than that of uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane 10 wt indicating d uio 66 imparted the anodic membrane with much faster removal rate than uio 66 besides fig 5d illustrated that d uio 66 graphite pvdf anodic membrane was also effective to remove other typical antibiotics norfloxacin tylosin and sulfamethoxazole which demonstrated its excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxidative degradation of antibiotics as revealed by the electrochemical test fig 4 3 3 electrocatalytic self cleaning property electrocatalytic self cleaning property of membrane was investigated in the intermittent and continuous supply of electric field bsa was used as the model foulant and the applied current density was 0 01 ma cm2 according to the removal efficiency of bsa supplementary fig s9b for the intermittent mode membrane fouling experiment was conducted until flux declined to a certain value and electricity was applied to clean the fouled membrane for 5 min fig 6 illustrated that the normalized flux jn markedly reduced to 0 44 for graphite pvdf membrane with filtration volume of 390 ml while higher values are recorded at 0 60 and 0 69 with more permeate volumes of 550 and 2000 ml for uio 66 graphite pvdf and d uio 66 graphite pvdf anodic membranes respectively obviously the anti fouling performance of d uio 66 graphite pvdf was the best among all membranes likely owing to its higher hydrophilicity as revealed by the contact angle measurement fig 3e after electrocatalytic self cleaning jn was only recovered to 0 87 and 0 60 in the second and third cycles for graphite pvdf membrane fig 6a respectively while slightly higher values were observed at 0 89 and 0 79 for uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane fig 6b in contrast the performance of fouled d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane can be fully recovered by electricity fig 6c revealing the excellent self cleaning property notably supplementary fig s12 showed that jn could only be recovered to 0 88 and 0 62 in the second and third cycles after hydraulic cleaning without electricity respectively which confirmed the critical impact of electrocatalytic oxidation on membrane fouling control in a similar manner dramatic flux decline occurred without electricity while no flux decline was observed for d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane under electricity in continuous operation mode meanwhile the other membranes still suffered from severe flux decline under the same current density fig 6d to sum up d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane presented the outstanding electrocatalytic self cleaning property in both intermittent and continuous supply of electric field due to the superior electrocatalytic activity fig 4 the underlying mechanism would be elucidated in section 3 5 hereinafter on the other hand autopsy of d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane including atr ftir spectra supplementary fig s13a contact angle supplementary fig s13b and surface morphology supplementary fig s13c also revealed the low deposition of foulants on membrane surface and the excellent recovery of membrane property after self cleaning 3 4 bactericidal property of membrane the bactericidal property of membranes was evaluated under the current density of 0 01 ma cm2 and quantified in terms of the difference of the colony numbers between blank control and membrane filtration figs s14a s14d as depicted in supplementary fig s14e the bactericidal efficiencies of graphite pvdf membrane against e coli and s aureus were only 51 0 and 75 4 respectively while those of uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane were much higher with the values of 96 0 and 88 8 furthermore d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane possessed nearly 100 of bactericidal efficiency under electricity two mechanisms were related to the bactericidal properties of anodic membranes sun et al 2021 vecitis et al 2011 1 direct oxidation pathway electrons were transferred from bacteria to the anodic membrane and caused cell inactivation 2 indirect oxidation pathway reactive oxygen species ros e g oh and o2 that produced on the anodic membrane oxidized the proteins and lipids in cell membrane and inhibited the cell metabolism the superior bactericidal property of d uio 66 graphite pvdf anodic membrane than the others was due to the fact that it possessed higher electrocatalytic activity fig 4 and produced more ros oh and o2 as revealed by epr test hereinafter fig 7 3 5 mechanism analysis 3 5 1 identification of free radicals free radicals were identified in order to understand the mechanism of antibiotics removal self cleaning and bactericidal property of d uio 66 graphite pvdf anodic membrane firstly the effect of ros oh so4 and o2 on electrocatalytic oxidation of tetracycline was revealed by the addition of scavengers it is generally accepted that tert butyl alcohol and benzoquinone are the scavengers of oh and o2 respectively while methanol is the scavenger of both oh and so4 zhang et al 2021 fig 7a illustrated that the addition of methanol and tert butyl alcohol both markedly reduced the tetracycline removal ratio by 87 5 furthermore the addition of benzoquinone caused a sharp decline in tetracycline removal above phenomena revealed the critical effect of oh and o2 and insignificant influence of so4 on electrocatalytic oxidation of tetracycline as illustrated in fig 7b the impact of above three scavengers on bsa removal followed the quite similar trend with that of tetracycline also confirming the significant contribution of oh and o2 free radicals in membrane self cleaning performance moreover epr test was also conducted to quench free radicals using dmpo fig 7c and d illustrated that the signals of oh and o2 were quite weak for membrane without electricity while their intensity became much stronger under current density of 0 01 ma cm2 the highly reactive oh and o2 were generated on d uio 66 graphite pvdf anodic membrane which degraded antibiotics and bsa and attacked bacteria consequently this phenomenon was related to its excellent antibiotics removal self cleaning and bactericidal performance notably compared to tetracycline the membrane was not effective to remove bsa and the normalized concentration of bsa was still maintained at 0 38 after 180 min of degradation time because bsa has much larger molecular weight mw and stable peptide bond davies 2016 however the membrane performance can still be fully recovered by electrocatalytic oxidation implying that except for direct mineralization other factors contributed to the complicated self cleaning mechanism such as the physicochemical properties of foulants yin et al 2020a which will be elaborated in section 3 5 3 3 5 2 degradation pathway of antibiotics during electrocatalytic oxidation as antibiotics cannot be fully mineralized by anodic membrane it is meaningful to determine the degradation intermediates and clarify the corresponding degradation pathway in order to deeply understand the degradation mechanism eleven intermediates were identified by means of lc ms technique supplementary fig s15 and three possible pathways were proposed fig 8 according to the chemical structure and reaction sites of intermediates and the related literature wang et al 2018 in the first pathway ros attacked the double bond at c11 c12 position of tetracycline m z 445 and produced the oxidation product 1 m z 461 which was further fragmented into the intermediate 2 m z 432 by losing n ch3 2 then intermediate 3 m z 480 and intermediate 6 m z 496 were formed by the ring cleavage and oxidation of c2 c3 double bond respectively wang et al 2018 in the second pathway intermediate 4 m z 477 was generated by the reaction of ros with c2 c3 double bond in tetracycline then it was oxidized to the primary intermediates 5 m z 448 and 6 m z 496 by losing n ch3 2 and ring opening respectively as for the third pathway tetracycline was oxidized to intermediates 15 m z 416 16 m z 400 and 5 m z 448 by losing ch3 2 oh groups and attacking the c2 c3 double bond respectively lian et al 2019 obviously tetracycline was all oxidized to the primary intermediate 6 in the above three degradation pathways next when ros attacked the c10 c10a double bond the intermediate 6 m z 496 was further degraded into intermediates 7 m z 421 and 8 m z 116 afterwards the downstream intermediates 9 13 were generated via the oxidation of c6 c5a c11a c1 c2 and c3 c4 positions sequentially ultimately these degradation intermediates were further decomposed into intermediate 14 m z 118 and even transformed into co2 and h2o the degradation pathway suggested that ros preferentially attacked the double bond phenolic and amine groups with high electron density on tetracycline in summary our results elucidated the pathway of tetracycline degradation by ros and revealed the quite complex degradation mechanisms for tetracycline electrochemical oxidation on d uio 66 graphite pvdf anodic membrane 3 5 3 the physicochemical property of bsa after electrocatalytic oxidation unlike antibiotics it was quite difficult to determine the intermediate products of protein and propose the degradation pathway therefore we determined the physicochemical property of bsa after electrocatalytic oxidation by anodic membrane in order to reveal the self cleaning mechanism fig 9 a showed graphite pvdf membrane presented low mineralization ratio for bsa 12 8 while higher values were achieved at 22 7 and 49 7 for uio 66 graphite pvdf and d uio 66 graphite pvdf membranes respectively due to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity fig 4 despite that for d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane the relatively low mineralization ratio seems contradictory to the excellent recovery of membrane performance implying that the other physicochemical properties may involve into the self cleaning mechanism on the other hand d uio 66 graphite pvdf also exhibits higher uv254 removal 92 6 than the other two membranes after electrocatalytic oxidation fig 9a suggesting that ros i e oh and o2 are more prone to oxidize the aromatic and unsaturated components in bsa fan et al 2019b however uv254 alone was insufficient to reflect the fouling potential of uf membrane tian et al 2013 hence it was essential to determine the key factors influencing fouling control four fluorescent components were identified from the excitation and emission matrix eem spectra of bsa in supplementary fig s16 including the tyrosine region i tyrosine like protein region ii tryptophan region iii and tryptophan like protein region iv yin et al 2018 the electrocatalytic degradation by d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane led to a more significant reduction in fluorescent intensity of all fluorescent components than the others which was related to its better self cleaning performance additionally fluorescence regional integration fri analysis fig 9b illustrated that all anodic membranes caused a remarkable increase in percentage of region ii along with a sharp decrease for that of region iv this trend was more obvious for d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane than the others implying that ros were susceptible to degrade the tryptophan like protein component due to their rapid and selective reaction with the indole ring of tryptophan carroll et al 2017 in addition the impact of electrocatalytic degradation on the molecular weight distribution mwd of bsa was clarified and three factions were fractioned namely fraction i 100 kda fraction ii 10 100 kda and fraction iii 10 kda as shown in fig 9c for raw bsa without treatment fractions i ii and iii accounted for 75 0 13 6 and 11 4 respectively noting that the mw of bsa was approximately 67 kda yin et al 2020a however bsa was mainly composed by fraction i rather than fraction ii owing to the aggregation of bsa molecule the percentage of fraction i sharply decreased while that of fraction iii increased after membrane treatment suggesting that bsa molecule was degraded into small fractions this phenomenon was most significant for d uio 66 graphite pvdf among all anodic membranes generally the organic foulants with high mw are prone to accumulate on membrane and block membrane pore cheng et al 2018 hence the degradation of large bsa into smaller fractions will weaken the affinity of foulants with membrane which is beneficial to alleviate membrane fouling moreover as depicted in fig 9d electrocatalytic degradation of bsa by anodic membrane led to a sharp decline in the doc percentage of hydrophobic hpo fraction along with a higher ratio of hydrophilic hpi one suggesting the hydrophobicity of bsa decreased thereby electrocatalytic degradation weakened the hydrophobic attraction between membrane and bsa which favored membrane fouling mitigation yin et al 2020a notably d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane caused the highest reduction in the hydrophobicity of bsa which was related to its superior self cleaning performance apart from above characterizations zeta potential of bsa was also determined at ph 7 0 since it influenced the electrostatic interaction between foulants and membrane van geluwe et al 2011 after electrocatalytic oxidation by graphite pvdf uio 66 graphite pvdf and d uio 66 graphite pvdf membranes the zeta potential of bsa increased from 27 9 mv to 1 68 1 67 and 1 25 mv at ph 7 0 respectively fig 9e revealing the significant reduction in the negative charge density of bsa considering the anodic membrane possessed positive charge under the electric field oxidation markedly wakened the electrical attraction between membrane and foulants which facilitated the membrane fouling control liu et al 2021 in summary compared to the other anodic membranes oxidation by d uio 66 graphite pvdf caused higher mineralization ratio uv254 and fluorescent components removal of bsa moreover it changed the physicochemical properties of bsa including higher hydrophilicity lower mw and less negative charge which were responsible for its superior self cleaning performance 3 6 reclamation of municipal secondary effluent it is worth to note that the composition of real wastewater is complex and the physicochemical property of secondary effluent organic matter efom is likely different from the model foulant filloux et al 2012 therefore we explore the long term stability of d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane for reclamation of real municipal secondary effluent under current density of 0 01 ma cm2 as shown in fig 10 a membrane flux recovery still maintained at 95 4 after 30 filtration cycles with each cycle lasting for 2 h in intermittent mode the slightly inferior recovery of membrane flux for filtration of real wastewater compared to that of synthetic one fig 5 was due to the fact that the presence of ca2 and mg2 ions in real wastewater table 1 can form complexes with efom and cause more severe fouling yin et al 2020b furthermore fig 10b revealed that no flux decline was observed during membrane filtration for 30 days in continuous mode with residence time of 0 89 min obviously d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane presents excellent electrocatalytic self cleaning property for treatment of real wastewater owing to the high mineralization ratio 70 4 and uv254 removal 91 9 supplementary fig s17a and variations of physicochemical property of efom including higher zeta potential supplementary fig s17b lower hydrophobicity supplementary fig s17c and less mw supplementary fig s17d and fluorescent component s content supplementary fig s18 additionally the antibiotics removal and bactericidal property were studied in continuous mode under current density of 0 01 ma cm2 tetracycline 1 mg l was spiked into the municipal wastewater for analysis purpose it could be found that tetracycline fig 10c and live bacteria fig 10d in municipal wastewater were fully removed or killed by anodic membrane in a few minutes and the performance remained constant during long term filtration 30 days moreover bod turbidity and tss in permeate were only 1 mg l 5 ntu and 10 mg l respectively which meet the municipal wastewater recycling standard of china gb t 18920 2020 furthermore no leaching of zr mofs took place from the fabricated membrane during long term filtration 30 days since no zirconium was detected in permeate water data not shown the accelerated lifetime test supplementary fig s19 further showed that the predicted service lifetime of membrane was up to 631 8 and 12 61 years under current densities of 0 01 and 0 1 ma cm2 table s6 respectively indicating the membrane has excellent electrochemical stability besides table 2 illustrated that the energy consumptions for fouling control of d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane are only 0 457 and 0 558 w h l in intermittent and continuous modes respectively noteworthily we compared the treatment performance of different electrocatalytic membranes for antibiotics removal d uio 66 graphite pvdf presented higher antibiotics removal efficiency and permeability than the electrocatalytic membranes that reported in previous literature with low residence time and energy consumption table s7 furthermore it also displayed excellent stability self cleaning and bactericidal properties without the addition of chemical reagents which was promising in the reclamation of municipal wastewater 4 conclusion this study exhibited a promising candidate of a defective mofs based anodic membrane in electro oxidation and membrane filtration process for efficient reclamation of municipal wastewater d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane was fabricated as an anode and presented superior electrocatalytic activity than uio 66 graphite pvdf for degradation of small molecular antibiotics and macromolecular organic foulant owing to the higher electrochemically active surface area and oer potential and lower charge transfer resistance the fabricated membrane can remove the typical antibiotics by 96 6 kill nearly 100 of bacteria and the performance of fouled membrane can be fully recovered with low current density 0 01 ma cm2 in both synthetic and real municipal secondary effluent due to the oxidative degradation by oh and o2 moreover three degradation pathways of tetracycline were proposed and self cleaning mechanism was dominated by the partial mineralization and the reduced fouling potential of foulants the great potential of d uio 66 graphite pvdf anodic membrane for reclamation of municipal wastewater was also confirmed by the long term stability low energy consumption and no requirement for the additional chemical reagents declaration of competing interest none

15810,in order to resolve the poor antibiotics rejection and serious fouling of ultrafiltration uf membrane during municipal wastewater reclamation a novel anodic membrane defective uio 66 d uio 66 graphite polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf with high pure water flux 596 1 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 was fabricated by incorporating defective zirconium based metal organic framework d uio 66 and conductive graphite particles into pvdf matrix and applied in the coupling of electro oxidation and membrane filtration process compared to the other anodic membranes i e graphite pvdf and uio 66 graphite pvdf d uio 66 graphite pvdf possesses superior anti fouling and self cleaning abilities flux recovery 100 model foulant bovine serum albumin in both intermittent and continuous supply of electric field under current density of 0 01 ma cm2 moreover efficient antibiotics tetracycline norfloxacin tylosin and sulfamethoxazole removal 96 6 and bactericidal efficiency against e coli and s aureus 100 were achieved simultaneously without the addition of chemical reagents due to the higher electrocatalytic activity of anodic membrane for oxidation of pollutants by oh and o2 free radicals three degradation pathways of antibiotics were proposed and the self cleaning mechanism of membrane was dominated by the synergy of the partial mineralization and the reduced fouling potential of foulants after oxidation as revealed by the increase in hydrophilicity and decrease in negative charge and molecular weight the fabricated membrane also presents excellent electrochemical stability separation and self cleaning performance for treatment of municipal secondary effluent during long term filtration with low electric energy consumption which is promising in wastewater reclamation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultrafiltration membrane self cleaning electrocatalysis antibiotics water reclamation 1 introduction recently the severe global water scarcity induces the increasing occurrence of wastewater reclamation by ultrafiltration uf membrane technology due to its appealing water purification capability with relatively low energy consumption wang et al 2017 municipal wastewater recycling has drawn increasingly interests as an alternative water resource for agricultural industrial and ecological water supplement uses however uf membrane is unable to retain small molecular antibiotics that are prevalent and emerging in the municipal wastewater which will promote bacterial resistance and pose risks to human health if the filtrated water was used for reclamation oberoi et al 2019 more importantly membrane fouling is another limiting factor in practical application for water reuse the secondary effluent organic matter efom is prone to deposit on the membrane surface or inside pore and cause organic fouling and severe flux decline wang et al 2017 besides pathogenic bacteria cannot be fully retained by uf membrane and the residual bacteria can bring about potential threats to public health moreover the bacteria can adhere to the membrane and form biofilm layer on membrane under suitable conditions which evokes bio fouling fan et al 2019a in order to address above challenges innovative coupling of electro oxidation and membrane filtration has been developed by combining the advantages of oxidative degradation and membrane separation without the addition of chemical reagents it also facilitates the mass transfer of pollutants onto the active sites of membrane electrodes sun et al 2021 anodic membranes have been drawn intensive attentions in water treatment as the in situ produced reactive oxygen species ros e g oh and o2 can remove the small molecular pollutants inactivate bacteria and degrade large molecular organic foulants of membrane e g efom wei et al 2020 therefore they provide a promising candidate in municipal wastewater reclamation to achieve multifunction of antibiotics removal disinfection and membrane fouling control wang et al 2021 in recent years carbonaceous materials e g carbon nanotubes yang et al 2019 and graphene werner et al 2016 have been intensively used to fabricate electrochemical membrane due to their efficient self cleaning performance by the electrical repulsion and electro oxidation sun et al 2020 however they act as the active anode with a relatively low overpotential for the side oxygen evolution reaction oer and interact strongly with the electrogenerated ros sun et al 2021 moreover they suffer from electric corrosion hence many inactive anodes with higher oer potential have been reported to modify membrane such as sno2 and ti4o7 2 2 2 7 v almassi et al 2020 despite the efficient generation of ros the short service time of sno2 and the passivation of ti4o7 limit their application for long term membrane filtration process sun et al 2021 consequently anodic membranes with better electrocatalytic activity for ros production higher oer potential and stronger electrical corrosion resistance are required to develop for wastewater reclamation given the merits of the large specific surface areas isolated active sites and versatile catalytic activities metal organic frameworks mofs have been proven as efficient electrocatalysts and widely applied for oer cheng et al 2021 oxygen reduction reaction orr hydrogen evolution reaction her and carbon dioxide reduction xu et al 2018 however the high coordination number of metal nodes in mofs hinders the interaction between catalytic active sites and pollutants dou et al 2020 defect engineering e g missing linker defects is proved as a promising strategy and versatile platform to increase the electrocatalytic activity and conductivity of mofs since more active sites and dangling bonds are generated heidary et al 2021 up to now the defective mofs have been used as electrocatalyst for oer xue et al 2019 orr yang et al 2021 and nitrogen reduction khalil et al 2021 on the other hand mofs were widely applied to promote the anti fouling ability of membrane and hold potential to break the tradeoff between permeability and selectivity yuan and zhu 2020 among them uio 66 a highly water stable zirconium mof attracted intensive intention in fabrication of membrane and application in water treatment for antibiotics removal via size exclusion and electrostatic interaction fang et al 2020 nevertheless to the best of our knowledge no published study investigated the mofs or defective mofs based electrified membranes for wastewater treatment moreover the electrocatalytic mechanism of mofs based membrane requires an in depth investigation liu et al 2020a consequently in this study defective uio 66 d uio 66 a water stable zirconium based mof was used to fabricate uf membrane for wastewater reclamation and the graphite powder was also incorporated to enhance the conductivity of membrane the major objectives of this project are as follows 1 to systematically characterize the structure physicochemical and electrochemical properties of different anodic membranes 2 to investigate the electrocatalytic activity of different anodic membranes including removal of typical antibiotics bactericidal and self cleaning abilities for treatment of synthetic wastewater in both intermittent and continuous supply of electric field 3 to reveal the underlying mechanisms

reclamation of municipal secondary effluent during long term filtration 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents materials and feed water the reagents and materials were provided in the supporting information text s1 all reagents were of at least analytical grade and used as received without further purification the preparation of synthetic wastewater and the sampling of municipal secondary effluent were described in text s2 among them bovine serum albumin bsa was selected as model membrane foulant because it was usually used as one of the model biopolymers which caused severe uf membrane fouling xing et al 2019 escherichia coli e coli and staphylococcus aureus s aureus were selected as the model bacteria to evaluate the bactericidal property performance of membrane ni et al 2021 the typical characteristics of municipal secondary effluent were listed in table 1 2 2 synthesis of zr mofs and anodic membranes the synthesis procedures of uio 66 d uio 66 and anodic membranes were described in text s3 which was also schematically illustrated in supplementary fig s1 the defective uio 66 was denoted as d uio 66 x where x represents the volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid 0 25 0 75 and 1 0 ml uio 66 and d uio 66 were incorporated into the casting solution containing graphite and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and the fabricated membranes were designated as uio 66 graphite pvdf x wt and d uio 66 graphite pvdf x wt respectively where x presented the loading amount of mofs notably 12 wt loading of graphite was used to increase the conductivity of membrane in this study supplementary fig s2 and graphite pvdf membrane was also fabricated for comparison purpose 2 3 analysis and characterization analysis of synthetic and municipal wastewater was described text s4 including the composition and physicochemical property of organic matter the characterizations of zr mofs and membranes were conducted by scanning electron microscope sem x ray diffractometer xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermogravimetric differential thermogravimetric tg dtg analysis pore size distribution and molecular weight cutoff mwco the operation methods were elaborated in text s5 the procedures for electrochemical test were summarized in text s6 including cyclic voltammetry cv linear sweep voltammetry lsv electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and the accelerated lifetime testing the electrochemically active surface area ecsa and predicted service lifetime were calculated by eqs s1 and s2 respectively lim et al 2018 2 4 electrocatalytic performance of anodic membrane in order to study the electrocatalytic performance of membrane an electro oxidation and membrane filtration combined system was designed as illustrated in fig 1 which contained a cross flow filtration sf sb hangzhou saifei china flux measurement pgc 1502 adam uk and direct current supply gh 1718 dahua instrument china units the membrane that posted on titanium mesh was acted as anode and faced the feed side while titanium mesh 40 μm was used as cathode due to the less fouling and high corrosion resistance the distance between anode and cathode was 10 mm the transmembrane pressure tmp and flow rate were 0 2 mpa and 0 22 m s respectively the electrocatalytic performances of different anodic membranes were assessed and compared for treatment of synthetic wastewater in both intermittent and continuous supply of electric field the detailed procedures were summarized in text s7 including the oxidative degradation of typical antibiotics tetracycline norfloxacin tylosin and sulfamethoxazole electrocatalytic self cleaning when using bsa as model foulant and bactericidal ability against gram negative e coli and gram positive s aureus under current densities of 0 005 0

respectively 2 5 mechanism 2 5 1 identification of free radicals methanol 5 mm tert butyl alcohol tba 5 mm and benzoquinone 5 mm were selected as the scavengers of free radicals and added into the feed water to quench oh so4 and o2 zhang et al 2021 the removal efficiency of antibiotics and bsa were investigated without and with the addition of above three scavengers 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was employed as the trap agent and the signals of free radicals oh so4 and o2 were in situ detected by electron spin resonance epr spectrometer jes fa 200 jeol japan without and with electrical field current density 0 01 ma cm2 2 5 2 degradation pathway in order to clarify the possible degradation pathway the intermediates of tetracycline after electrocatalytic oxidation were identified by a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer lc ms 1290 infinity lc 6460 qqq ms agilent usa equipped with a quadrupole mass detector the detailed procedure and experimental parameters were described in text s8 2 5 3 membrane autopsy the membranes before and after electrocatalytic self cleaning were characterized by attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir sem and contact angle all membranes were air dried at room temperature prior to characterizations 2 6 application of municipal wastewater reclamation the long term filtration of municipal wastewater was conducted by d uio 66 graphite pvdf anodic membrane in the intermittent and continuous modes for 30 cycles and 30 days under current density of 0 01 ma cm2 respectively antibiotics removal bactericidal and self cleaning performance of membrane was determined moreover the water quality of permeate was analyzed including chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod turbidity and total suspended solids tss the corresponding energy consumption was calculated by eq s9 the membrane stability was assessed by collecting the permeate periodically and determining the zirconium concentration by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes icap 6300 thermofisher usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 zr mofs sem images in supplementary fig s3 revealed the crystalline nanoparticles of uio 66 and their shape did not change after defective engineering for d uio 66 0 25 and d uio 66 0 75 conversely they became amorphous for d uio 66 1 0 the numbers of missing linker defects per zr6 cluster were 0 48 0 84 and 0 97 for d uio 66 0 25 d uio 66 0 75 and d uio 66 1 0 according to tg analysis in supplementary fig s4a respectively furthermore supplementary fig s4b confirmed the presence of zr μ3 o 747 and 665 cm 1 and carboxylic acid 1402 and 1661 cm 1 from the ftir spectra of uio 66 with different defects fang et al 2020 the xrd patterns in supplementary fig s4c further revealed the characteristics peaks of uio 66 castarlenas et al 2017 n2 adsorption desorption isotherm supplementary fig s4d displayed that uio 66 with different defect degrees all exhibited microporous structure moreover defective uio 66 possessed more negative charges than uio 66 at ph 7 0 as revealed by the lower zeta potential supplementary fig s4e pore size distribution supplementary fig s5 and pore structure parameters table s1 showed that the specific surface area and pore size of uio 66 increased at elevated defective degrees due to the removal of organic linkers from the mofs structures to sum up the uio 66 and defective uio 66 are successfully synthesized and the excessively high defects will damage its crystalline structure therefore d uio 66 0 75 was used for fabrication of membrane and denoted as d uio 66 in the following experiments 3 1 2 membrane morphology membrane morphology of membranes was investigated using sem fig 2 illustrated that circular particles appeared for uio 66 graphite pvdf and d uio 66 graphite pvdf membranes ascribing to the incorporation of zr mofs furthermore more particles were found on membrane surface if the loading amount of d uio 66 increased from 5 to 15 wt however the pore size of membrane sharply reduced when it was up to 15 wt fig 2e which may enhance the filtration resistance in addition according to the cross sectional morphology of membrane plenty of amorphous graphite particles dispersed on pvdf membrane matrix figs s6a and s6b while circular zr mofs nanoparticles were embedded into membrane matrix figs s6c s6j which likely confirmed the successful loading of zr mofs into the membrane aghili et al 2020 3 1 3 physicochemical property of membrane atr ftir spectra fig 3 a exhibited the characteristic bands of pvdf that located at 840 877 1180 and 1401 cm 1 for pvdf membrane ding et al 2020 a new peak appeared at 1738 cm 1 for membranes with the incorporation of uio 66 and d uio 66 ascribing to the carboxyl group cooh from the organic ligand 1 4 benzenedicarboxylate the intensity of above peak became stronger with more loading of d uio 66 in membrane matrix furthermore pore size distribution was determined to clarify the effect of zr mofs nanofillers on membrane pore structure fig 3b showed all membranes had ordered pore structure with narrow pore size distribution more specific the incorporation of uio 66 and d uio 66 reduced the average pore sizes of membrane from 61 38 to 41 34 and 43 25 nm respectively notably d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane has a higher pore size than that of uio 66 graphite pvdf because the defective engineering increased the pore size of uio 66 table s1 in a similar manner fig 3c displayed that mwco of membranes reduced by incorporating zr mofs moreover the value was higher for d uio 66 graphite pvdf than uio 66 graphite pvdf thereby possessing lower filtration resistance tg dtg analysis was conducted to evaluate the thermal stability of membrane as depicted in fig 3d there were three stages in tg curve and no obvious weight loss was observed for all membranes when the temperature was lower than 360 c as a matter of fact although the total weight loss was slightly higher for zr mofs graphite pvdf membranes than graphite pvdf at 900 cdue to the degradation of organic ligand they still remained good thermal stability dtg curve fig 3d showed that there were two peaks located at 391 9 c and 426 6 cfor zr mofs graphite pvdf membrane ascribing to the decomposition of zr mofs and pvdf respectively castarlenas et al 2017 fig 3e displayed that graphite pvdf membrane has high contact angle of 100 6 due to the inherent hydrophobic nature of pvdf and graphite by comparison the incorporation of hydrophilic uio 66 and d uio 66 nanofillers markedly reduced the contact angle of membranes in particular the contact angle of d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane 69 5 was lower than that of uio 66 graphite pvdf 84 9 with the same loading of zr mofs 10 wt additionally this variation became more obvious for membranes with higher loading of d uio 66 the higher hydrophilicity of d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane was conductive to increase the permeate flux and enhance anti fouling ability of membrane al shaeli et al 2021 in summary the characterizations of anodic membranes lead us to confer that uio 66 and d uio 66 nanoparticles are successfully embedded into the membrane matrix and they endow the membrane with smaller pore size higher hydrophilicity and good thermal stability 3 1 4 electrochemical property of membrane cv loops exhibited the oxidation peaks for degradation of tetracycline and bsa by all anodic membranes fig 4 a and b respectively notably table s2 illustrated that higher current densities are recorded at the oxidation peak for d uio 66 graphite pvdf 10 wt compared to uio 66 graphite pvdf 10 wt and graphite pvdf indicating that d uio 66 imparts the membrane with better electrocatalytic activity than uio 66 zheng et al 2020 besides the current densities at the oxidation peaks enhanced with the increasing amount of d uio 66 from 5 to 10 wt but weakened when it further increased to 15 wt due to the reduced conductivity of membrane in addition ecsa of graphite pvdf uio 66 graphite pvdf and d uio 66 graphite pvdf membranes were 0 0022 0 011 and 1 8 cm2 table s3 respectively according to the cv response under a non faradaic window supplementary fig s7 and the plot of the current density differences against scan rates supplementary fig s8 hence d uio 66 graphite pvdf possessed most exposed active sites among all anodic membranes zhong et al 2021 which boosted the oxidative degradation of pollutants in addition oer potentials of anodic membranes were obtained from lsv polarization curves fig 4c as shown in table s4 d uio 66 graphite pvdf 10 wt possessed the highest oer potential 2 00 v than the other membranes as oxygen evolution is a competitive reaction for anodic oxidation the incorporation of d uio 66 in membrane will minimize oer side reaction and boost the electrocatalytic oxidation of pollutants compared to uio 66 huang et al 2020 additionally nyquist plots of eis fig 4d revealed the lowest charge transfer resistance rct of d uio 66 graphite pvdf among all membranes which was conductive to enhance the electronic interactions zou et al 2019 notably the further increase in the loading amount of d uio 66 from 10 to 15 wt caused a slight decrease in oer potential fig 4c and increase in rct fig 4d which was detrimental to electrocatalytic oxidation of pollutants therefore the loading amount of d uio 66 in membrane was 10 wt in the following sections unless otherwise stated besides chronoamperometric tests showed that d uio 66 graphite pvdf possessed the higher current for oxidation of tetracycline fig 4e and bsa fig 4f than the other membranes in the steady condition thereby favoring the oxidative degradation scialdone et al 2009 to sum up the electrochemical tests confirmed that d uio 66 with the appropriate loading amount endowed the uf membrane with superior electrocatalytic activity towards oxidative degradation of small and large organic pollutants compared to uio 66 owing to its disordered coordination of zr4 and more electrochemical active sites yan et al 2021 as a result d uio 66 graphite pvdf holds great potential to possess a dual function of antibiotics removal and membrane fouling control 3 2 permeate flux and antibiotics removal the pure water flux j0 of membrane was determined by cross flow method interestingly although the incorporation of uio 66 and d uio 66 10 wt reduced the pore size fig 3b and mwco fig 3c of membrane they increased j0 from 305 7 graphite pvdf to 504 4 and 596 1 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 fig 5 a respectively two factors caused this phenomenon 1 zr mofs increased the membrane hydrophilicity fig 3e which facilitated the transport of water through membrane 2 zr mofs possessed high porosity and provided additional water passages ma et al 2017 thereby offsetting the negative impact of the reduced membrane pore size moreover j0 of d uio 66 graphite pvdf was higher than that of uio 66 graphite pvdf due to the higher pore size and specific surface area of d uio 66 than uio 66 table s1 besides higher j0 was observed when the loading amount of d uio 66 in membrane increased from 5 to 10 while the excess loading 15 wt caused more severe pore blockage supplementary fig s6 and decreased the flux due to the aggregation of mofs similar trends were also perceived by previous literature al shaeli et al 2021 pang et al 2019 furthermore we determined the electrocatalytic activity of anodic membrane for degradation of tetracycline 15 mg l in synthetic wastewater it should be stressed that although the concentration of antibiotics was higher than that in real wastewater it can facilitate the analysis to highlight the electrocatalytic performance of membrane in addition the applied current density was 0 01 ma cm2 as the higher value 0 015 ma cm2 cannot lead to the better tetracycline removal supplementary fig s9a fig 5b showed that the removal curve consisted of two stages including an initial stage with higher removal rate 0 30 min and a second stage with slower one 30 180 min the normalized concentration c c0 of tetracycline dropped to 0 72 the first stage and still remained 0 59 mg l after oxidation for 180 min by graphite pvdf membrane which exhibited poor removal efficiency of antibiotics furthermore c c0 decreased to 0 61 and 0 30 at the first and second stages for uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane 10 wt respectively in comparison the oxidation by d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane 10 wt led to much higher tetracycline removal ratio of 96 6 c c0 0 034 due to its superior electrocatalytic activity fig 4 moreover tetracycline removal was promoted by the increase in loading amount of d uio 66 from 5 to 10 wt but reduced at excessive loading 15 wt since zr mofs possessed relatively poor conductivity liu et al 2020b and enhanced the resistivity of anodic membrane fig 4d notably in despite of the excellent tetracycline removal supplementary fig s10 showed that the mineralization ratio was 81 for d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane suggesting that antibiotics cannot be fully mineralized by anodic membrane besides all anodic membranes negligibly increased the tetracycline removal without electricity supplementary fig s11 which confirmed the negligible effect of adsorption and critical impact of electro oxidation on tetracycline removal additionally we investigated the removal kinetics of tetracycline by anodic membranes using pseudo first order model and the fitting curve was showed in fig 5c as listed in table s5 the rate constant k for removal of tetracycline by d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane 10 wt was about 2 81 times higher than that of uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane 10 wt indicating d uio 66 imparted the anodic membrane with much faster removal rate than uio 66 besides fig 5d illustrated that d uio 66 graphite pvdf anodic membrane was also effective to remove other typical antibiotics norfloxacin tylosin and sulfamethoxazole which demonstrated its excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxidative degradation of antibiotics as revealed by the electrochemical test fig 4 3 3 electrocatalytic self cleaning property electrocatalytic self cleaning property of membrane was investigated in the intermittent and continuous supply of electric field bsa was used as the model foulant and the applied current density was 0 01 ma cm2 according to the removal efficiency of bsa supplementary fig s9b for the intermittent mode membrane fouling experiment was conducted until flux declined to a certain value and electricity was applied to clean the fouled membrane for 5 min fig 6 illustrated that the normalized flux jn markedly reduced to 0 44 for graphite pvdf membrane with filtration volume of 390 ml while higher values are recorded at 0 60 and 0 69 with more permeate volumes of 550 and 2000 ml for uio 66 graphite pvdf and d uio 66 graphite pvdf anodic membranes respectively obviously the anti fouling performance of d uio 66 graphite pvdf was the best among all membranes likely owing to its higher hydrophilicity as revealed by the contact angle measurement fig 3e after electrocatalytic self cleaning jn was only recovered to 0 87 and 0 60 in the second and third cycles for graphite pvdf membrane fig 6a respectively while slightly higher values were observed at 0 89 and 0 79 for uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane fig 6b in contrast the performance of fouled d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane can be fully recovered by electricity fig 6c revealing the excellent self cleaning property notably supplementary fig s12 showed that jn could only be recovered to 0 88 and 0 62 in the second and third cycles after hydraulic cleaning without electricity respectively which confirmed the critical impact of electrocatalytic oxidation on membrane fouling control in a similar manner dramatic flux decline occurred without electricity while no flux decline was observed for d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane under electricity in continuous operation mode meanwhile the other membranes still suffered from severe flux decline under the same current density fig 6d to sum up d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane presented the outstanding electrocatalytic self cleaning property in both intermittent and continuous supply of electric field due to the superior electrocatalytic activity fig 4 the underlying mechanism would be elucidated in section 3 5 hereinafter on the other hand autopsy of d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane including atr ftir spectra supplementary fig s13a contact angle supplementary fig s13b and surface morphology supplementary fig s13c also revealed the low deposition of foulants on membrane surface and the excellent recovery of membrane property after self cleaning 3 4 bactericidal property of membrane the bactericidal property of membranes was evaluated under the current density of 0 01 ma cm2 and quantified in terms of the difference of the colony numbers between blank control and membrane filtration figs s14a s14d as depicted in supplementary fig s14e the bactericidal efficiencies of graphite pvdf membrane against e coli and s aureus were only 51 0 and 75 4 respectively while those of uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane were much higher with the values of 96 0 and 88 8 furthermore d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane possessed nearly 100 of bactericidal efficiency under electricity two mechanisms were related to the bactericidal properties of anodic membranes sun et al 2021 vecitis et al 2011 1 direct oxidation pathway electrons were transferred from bacteria to the anodic membrane and caused cell inactivation 2 indirect oxidation pathway reactive oxygen species ros e g oh and o2 that produced on the anodic membrane oxidized the proteins and lipids in cell membrane and inhibited the cell metabolism the superior bactericidal property of d uio 66 graphite pvdf anodic membrane than the others was due to the fact that it possessed higher electrocatalytic activity fig 4 and produced more ros oh and o2 as revealed by epr test hereinafter fig 7 3 5 mechanism analysis 3 5 1 identification of free radicals free radicals were identified in order to understand the mechanism of antibiotics removal self cleaning and bactericidal property of d uio 66 graphite pvdf anodic membrane firstly the effect of ros oh so4 and o2 on electrocatalytic oxidation of tetracycline was revealed by the addition of scavengers it is generally accepted that tert butyl alcohol and benzoquinone are the scavengers of oh and o2 respectively while methanol is the scavenger of both oh and so4 zhang et al 2021 fig 7a illustrated that the addition of methanol and tert butyl alcohol both markedly reduced the tetracycline removal ratio by 87 5 furthermore the addition of benzoquinone caused a sharp decline in tetracycline removal above phenomena revealed the critical effect of oh and o2 and insignificant influence of so4 on electrocatalytic oxidation of tetracycline as illustrated in fig 7b the impact of above three scavengers on bsa removal followed the quite similar trend with that of tetracycline also confirming the significant contribution of oh and o2 free radicals in membrane self cleaning performance moreover epr test was also conducted to quench free radicals using dmpo fig 7c and d illustrated that the signals of oh and o2 were quite weak for membrane without electricity while their intensity became much stronger under current density of 0 01 ma cm2 the highly reactive oh and o2 were generated on d uio 66 graphite pvdf anodic membrane which degraded antibiotics and bsa and attacked bacteria consequently this phenomenon was related to its excellent antibiotics removal self cleaning and bactericidal performance notably compared to tetracycline the membrane was not effective to remove bsa and the normalized concentration of bsa was still maintained at 0 38 after 180 min of degradation time because bsa has much larger molecular weight mw and stable peptide bond davies 2016 however the membrane performance can still be fully recovered by electrocatalytic oxidation implying that except for direct mineralization other factors contributed to the complicated self cleaning mechanism such as the physicochemical properties of foulants yin et al 2020a which will be elaborated in section 3 5 3 3 5 2 degradation pathway of antibiotics during electrocatalytic oxidation as antibiotics cannot be fully mineralized by anodic membrane it is meaningful to determine the degradation intermediates and clarify the corresponding degradation pathway in order to deeply understand the degradation mechanism eleven intermediates were identified by means of lc ms technique supplementary fig s15 and three possible pathways were proposed fig 8 according to the chemical structure and reaction sites of intermediates and the related literature wang et al 2018 in the first pathway ros attacked the double bond at c11 c12 position of tetracycline m z 445 and produced the oxidation product 1 m z 461 which was further fragmented into the intermediate 2 m z 432 by losing n ch3 2 then intermediate 3 m z 480 and intermediate 6 m z 496 were formed by the ring cleavage and oxidation of c2 c3 double bond respectively wang et al 2018 in the second pathway intermediate 4 m z 477 was generated by the reaction of ros with c2 c3 double bond in tetracycline then it was oxidized to the primary intermediates 5 m z 448 and 6 m z 496 by losing n ch3 2 and ring opening respectively as for the third pathway tetracycline was oxidized to intermediates 15 m z 416 16 m z 400 and 5 m z 448 by losing ch3 2 oh groups and attacking the c2 c3 double bond respectively lian et al 2019 obviously tetracycline was all oxidized to the primary intermediate 6 in the above three degradation pathways next when ros attacked the c10 c10a double bond the intermediate 6 m z 496 was further degraded into intermediates 7 m z 421 and 8 m z 116 afterwards the downstream intermediates 9 13 were generated via the oxidation of c6 c5a c11a c1 c2 and c3 c4 positions sequentially ultimately these degradation intermediates were further decomposed into intermediate 14 m z 118 and even transformed into co2 and h2o the degradation pathway suggested that ros preferentially attacked the double bond phenolic and amine groups with high electron density on tetracycline in summary our results elucidated the pathway of tetracycline degradation by ros and revealed the quite complex degradation mechanisms for tetracycline electrochemical oxidation on d uio 66 graphite pvdf anodic membrane 3 5 3 the physicochemical property of bsa after electrocatalytic oxidation unlike antibiotics it was quite difficult to determine the intermediate products of protein and propose the degradation pathway therefore we determined the physicochemical property of bsa after electrocatalytic oxidation by anodic membrane in order to reveal the self cleaning mechanism fig 9 a showed graphite pvdf membrane presented low mineralization ratio for bsa 12 8 while higher values were achieved at 22 7 and 49 7 for uio 66 graphite pvdf and d uio 66 graphite pvdf membranes respectively due to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity fig 4 despite that for d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane the relatively low mineralization ratio seems contradictory to the excellent recovery of membrane performance implying that the other physicochemical properties may involve into the self cleaning mechanism on the other hand d uio 66 graphite pvdf also exhibits higher uv254 removal 92 6 than the other two membranes after electrocatalytic oxidation fig 9a suggesting that ros i e oh and o2 are more prone to oxidize the aromatic and unsaturated components in bsa fan et al 2019b however uv254 alone was insufficient to reflect the fouling potential of uf membrane tian et al 2013 hence it was essential to determine the key factors influencing fouling control four fluorescent components were identified from the excitation and emission matrix eem spectra of bsa in supplementary fig s16 including the tyrosine region i tyrosine like protein region ii tryptophan region iii and tryptophan like protein region iv yin et al 2018 the electrocatalytic degradation by d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane led to a more significant reduction in fluorescent intensity of all fluorescent components than the others which was related to its better self cleaning performance additionally fluorescence regional integration fri analysis fig 9b illustrated that all anodic membranes caused a remarkable increase in percentage of region ii along with a sharp decrease for that of region iv this trend was more obvious for d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane than the others implying that ros were susceptible to degrade the tryptophan like protein component due to their rapid and selective reaction with the indole ring of tryptophan carroll et al 2017 in addition the impact of electrocatalytic degradation on the molecular weight distribution mwd of bsa was clarified and three factions were fractioned namely fraction i 100 kda fraction ii 10 100 kda and fraction iii 10 kda as shown in fig 9c for raw bsa without treatment fractions i ii and iii accounted for 75 0 13 6 and 11 4 respectively noting that the mw of bsa was approximately 67 kda yin et al 2020a however bsa was mainly composed by fraction i rather than fraction ii owing to the aggregation of bsa molecule the percentage of fraction i sharply decreased while that of fraction iii increased after membrane treatment suggesting that bsa molecule was degraded into small fractions this phenomenon was most significant for d uio 66 graphite pvdf among all anodic membranes generally the organic foulants with high mw are prone to accumulate on membrane and block membrane pore cheng et al 2018 hence the degradation of large bsa into smaller fractions will weaken the affinity of foulants with membrane which is beneficial to alleviate membrane fouling moreover as depicted in fig 9d electrocatalytic degradation of bsa by anodic membrane led to a sharp decline in the doc percentage of hydrophobic hpo fraction along with a higher ratio of hydrophilic hpi one suggesting the hydrophobicity of bsa decreased thereby electrocatalytic degradation weakened the hydrophobic attraction between membrane and bsa which favored membrane fouling mitigation yin et al 2020a notably d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane caused the highest reduction in the hydrophobicity of bsa which was related to its superior self cleaning performance apart from above characterizations zeta potential of bsa was also determined at ph 7 0 since it influenced the electrostatic interaction between foulants and membrane van geluwe et al 2011 after electrocatalytic oxidation by graphite pvdf uio 66 graphite pvdf and d uio 66 graphite pvdf membranes the zeta potential of bsa increased from 27 9 mv to 1 68 1 67 and 1 25 mv at ph 7 0 respectively fig 9e revealing the significant reduction in the negative charge density of bsa considering the anodic membrane possessed positive charge under the electric field oxidation markedly wakened the electrical attraction between membrane and foulants which facilitated the membrane fouling control liu et al 2021 in summary compared to the other anodic membranes oxidation by d uio 66 graphite pvdf caused higher mineralization ratio uv254 and fluorescent components removal of bsa moreover it changed the physicochemical properties of bsa including higher hydrophilicity lower mw and less negative charge which were responsible for its superior self cleaning performance 3 6 reclamation of municipal secondary effluent it is worth to note that the composition of real wastewater is complex and the physicochemical property of secondary effluent organic matter efom is likely different from the model foulant filloux et al 2012 therefore we explore the long term stability of d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane for reclamation of real municipal secondary effluent under current density of 0 01 ma cm2 as shown in fig 10 a membrane flux recovery still maintained at 95 4 after 30 filtration cycles with each cycle lasting for 2 h in intermittent mode the slightly inferior recovery of membrane flux for filtration of real wastewater compared to that of synthetic one fig 5 was due to the fact that the presence of ca2 and mg2 ions in real wastewater table 1 can form complexes with efom and cause more severe fouling yin et al 2020b furthermore fig 10b revealed that no flux decline was observed during membrane filtration for 30 days in continuous mode with residence time of 0 89 min obviously d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane presents excellent electrocatalytic self cleaning property for treatment of real wastewater owing to the high mineralization ratio 70 4 and uv254 removal 91 9 supplementary fig s17a and variations of physicochemical property of efom including higher zeta potential supplementary fig s17b lower hydrophobicity supplementary fig s17c and less mw supplementary fig s17d and fluorescent component s content supplementary fig s18 additionally the antibiotics removal and bactericidal property were studied in continuous mode under current density of 0 01 ma cm2 tetracycline 1 mg l was spiked into the municipal wastewater for analysis purpose it could be found that tetracycline fig 10c and live bacteria fig 10d in municipal wastewater were fully removed or killed by anodic membrane in a few minutes and the performance remained constant during long term filtration 30 days moreover bod turbidity and tss in permeate were only 1 mg l 5 ntu and 10 mg l respectively which meet the municipal wastewater recycling standard of china gb t 18920 2020 furthermore no leaching of zr mofs took place from the fabricated membrane during long term filtration 30 days since no zirconium was detected in permeate water data not shown the accelerated lifetime test supplementary fig s19 further showed that the predicted service lifetime of membrane was up to 631 8 and 12 61 years under current densities of 0 01 and 0 1 ma cm2 table s6 respectively indicating the membrane has excellent electrochemical stability besides table 2 illustrated that the energy consumptions for fouling control of d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane are only 0 457 and 0 558 w h l in intermittent and continuous modes respectively noteworthily we compared the treatment performance of different electrocatalytic membranes for antibiotics removal d uio 66 graphite pvdf presented higher antibiotics removal efficiency and permeability than the electrocatalytic membranes that reported in previous literature with low residence time and energy consumption table s7 furthermore it also displayed excellent stability self cleaning and bactericidal properties without the addition of chemical reagents which was promising in the reclamation of municipal wastewater 4 conclusion this study exhibited a promising candidate of a defective mofs based anodic membrane in electro oxidation and membrane filtration process for efficient reclamation of municipal wastewater d uio 66 graphite pvdf membrane was fabricated as an anode and presented superior electrocatalytic activity than uio 66 graphite pvdf for degradation of small molecular antibiotics and macromolecular organic foulant owing to the higher electrochemically active surface area and oer potential and lower charge transfer resistance the fabricated membrane can remove the typical antibiotics by 96 6 kill nearly 100 of bacteria and the performance of fouled membrane can be fully recovered with low current density 0 01 ma cm2 in both synthetic and real municipal secondary effluent due to the oxidative degradation by oh and o2 moreover three degradation pathways of tetracycline were proposed and self cleaning mechanism was dominated by the partial mineralization and the reduced fouling potential of foulants the great potential of d uio 66 graphite pvdf anodic membrane for reclamation of municipal wastewater was also confirmed by the long term stability low energy consumption and no requirement for the additional chemical reagents declaration of competing interest none

15811,co metabolism and photodegradation are two approaches for remediating trace organic compounds torcs however interactions between the two with regards to torcs degradation have not been elucidated in this study sulfadiazine sdz was chosen as a representative torc and methylocystis bryophila as a typical strain under light conditions about 80 6 of sdz was removed by m bryophila but only 7 6 or 28 9 of sdz was eliminated by either individual photodegradation or by co metabolism the sdz stimulated more extracellular organic matter eom production by m bryophila the enhanced sdz degradation was attributed to indirect photolysis caused by the excited triplet state of eom 3eom and co metabolism the uplc qtof ms analysis showed that due to co metabolism the pyrimidine ring was broken and could further be oxidized into smaller molecules under light conditions such as formic and acetic acids the sdz mineralization ratio increased from 9 9 under the co metabolic condition alone to 36 5 under co metabolism coupled with photodegradation the ames tests confirmed that the sdz degradation products by co metabolism were mutagenic however their toxicity was ameliorated by light during co metabolism in conclusion light plays a crucial role in co metabolic processes of torcs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords trace organic compounds co metabolism photodegradation mineralization mutagenicity 1 introduction trace organic compounds torcs such as synthetic antibiotics are widely present in aquatic environments bai et al 2021 applications of torcs as energy or carbon sources to support microbial growth are limited by their low concentrations parts per million or less in biological metabolism some toxic torcs such as bacteriostatic antibiotics are relatively difficult to degrade benner et al 2013 during co metabolic degradation torcs are degraded as primary growth substrates rather than energy or carbon sources co metabolic degradation has gained attention as it permits microbial degradation of torcs at low concentrations semrau et al 2010 in the presence of the non specific methane monooxygenase mmo methanotrophs can use methane as the first substrate to co metabolically degrade co existing second substrates benner et al 2015 wang et al 2019 soluble mmo smmo can oxidize alkanes with up to eight carbon atoms as well as aromatic compounds hedegaard et al 2018 semrau et al 2010 benner et al 2015 used five different methane oxidizing cultures to co metabolically degrade 18 different torcs they found that all cultures successfully degraded at least four different compounds hedegaard et al 2018 confirmed that co metabolism enhances bentazone transformation by enriching methanotrophs from a groundwater fed rapid sand filter however after co metabolism transformation products tps are in the form of 6 oh 8 oh isopropyl oh or di oh bentazone which are toxic photodegradation an important elimination process for organic compounds in natural water can occur either by direct sunlight radiation absorption direct photolysis or by reactions with transient reactive intermediates indirect photolysis such as excited triplet states of extracellular organic matter 3eom hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 tian et al 2019 due to its chemical structure sulfadiazine sdz a broad spectrum antibiotic exhibits limited biodegradation however improved biodegradation and mineralization can be obtained by coupling it to direct uv photolysis pan et al 2014 algae derived eom significantly enhances chlortetracycline indirect photolysis tian et al 2019 in shallow water bodies photosynthesis provides oxygen which is necessary for aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria s metabolism milucka et al 2015 and torcs are ubiquitously distributed in the same region zheng et al 2020 this shows that aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria can also be exposed to direct light radiation therefore light may be involved in degradation of torcs with co metabolism of aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria in this study we investigated the torcs degradation pathway during aerobic methane oxidation under light conditions in this study sdz was used as a representative torc while methylocystis bryophila was used as the type methanotroph strain we elucidated the degradation pathways and variations of sdz toxicity during photodegradation coupled with co metabolism by methanotrophs our findings provide new insights into the fate of torcs through coupled photochemical and co metabolic processes 2

that cause base pair substitutions 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 batch tests for sdz degradation table 1 shows that there were eight degradation conditions sdz l m sdz l in m sdz l m sdz m l in m sdz in m sdz ch3oh and m sdz ch3oh the concentrations of sdz in the river water generally ranked between 1 0 ng l 1 8 μg l zainab et al 2020 and in some contaminated water bodies can be pretty high even reaching the mg l range fick et al 2009 xie et al 2020 and we selected the concentration of 3 mg l of sdz 99 0 sigma aldrich st louis mo usa as the initial concentration of administration the initial methanotrophs density was 2 107 cells ml light groups were cultured in a light incubator at a light intensity of 10 000 lx photons m2 s to determine the total degradation fraction attributed to photodegradation including direct and indirect photodegradation 2 c2h2 was added to the headspace of the serum bottle as an mmo inhibitor to stop methanotroph co metabolism benner et al 2015 then the medium was supplemented with 0 1 vol vol ch3oh to support methanotroph growth without toxic effects belova et al 2011 changes in ch4 o2 and co2 contents were determined by collecting 0 5 ml of the gas

described in section 2 2 1 during the assays 1 0 ml of the filtered sample was withdrawn and injected into a brown vial for sdz content analysis 2 2 3 determination of sdz mineralization as described

growths in batch tests there were no changes in ch4 o2 or co2 contents in the sdz l group fig 1 a c indicating that light was not associated with ch4 oxidation during the early test stages 0 6 d comparable changes in ch4 o2 and co2 contents were observed in m sdz l in m sdz l m sdz and m l groups these findings imply comparable growth states of methanotrophs in the four groups in the late stage 6 14 d changes in ch4 o2 and co2 in the in m sdz l group stopped immediately and remained stable indicating that c2h2 inhibited methanotroph mmo we concluded that 3 mg l sdz did not inhibit methanotroph growth 3 2 sdz degradation in batch tests fig 2 a shows that nearly none of sdz was removed in the sdz l group indicating that sdz could not be degraded only in the presence of light a 28 9 elimination rate of sdz was noted in the m sdz group suggesting that sdz could be partially eliminated by methanotrophs methanotroph co metabolism removed 22 of bentazone a refractory organic compound with a benzene ring similar to sdz hedegaard et al 2018 the methnotrophs co metabolic removal ratio of sdz was comparable to that of bentazone within eight days the elimination rate of sdz significantly increased to 80 6 in the m sdz l group illustrating an accelerated performance of light for eliminating sdz with methanotrophic metabolism the linear correlation between ln c c0 and t was significant for substrate degradation sdz l r2 0 90 m sdz l r2 0 99 in m sdz l r2 0 97 m sdz r2 0 98 implying that sdz elimination in distinct groups exhibited pseudo first order kinetics the pseudo first order rate constant k d 1 varied in different systems sdz l k 0 009 d 1 m sdz l k 0 200 d 1 in m sdz l k 0 044 d 1 m sdz k 0 042 d 1 for instance k of the m sdz l system was 0 2 d 1 which was about 4 8 times higher than that of the m sdz system fig 2 b this finding confirms that light plays a decisive role in enhancing sdz elimination by methanotrophs when sdz was exposed to mmo inhibited methanotrophs under light conditions group in m sdz l 30 5 of the sdz was eliminated which was significantly lower than the elimination rate in the m sdz l group this shows that co metabolism by mmo plays a primary role in methanotrophs mediated sdz degradation xie et al 2020 reported 35 sulfadiazine elimination by photodegradation in an algal degradation system which was comparable to that of the inactivated group in this study and for environmental samples with lower concentrations photodegradation has been considered as the major pathway for natural attenuation of sulfonamides li et al 2018 degradation of sdz in the in m sdz l group was significantly higher than that of the sdz l group light alone indicating the vital function of indirect photolysis the ch3oh addition groups in m sdz ch3oh and m sdz ch3oh were designed to further determine the effects of mmo activities on sdz degradation with the in m sdz group being the control fig 3 since mmo was inhibited there were no changes in the in m sdz group the experimental cycle in in m sdz ch3oh and m sdz ch3oh groups was divided into pre period 0 4 days and post period 4 10 days in the pre period both groups exhibited similar changes in ch4 o2 co2 methanol and biomass thus regardless of the presence of acetylene in the presence of both methane and methanol methanotrophs preferentially used methanol the lack of methane oxidation indicates that mmo did not work in both systems in addition sdz was not degraded during the pre period in the post period the in m sdz ch3oh and m sdz ch3oh groups exhibited different trends after methanol exhaustion mmo inhibition did not change ch4 o2 co2 and biomass in the in m sdz ch3oh group methanotrophs on the other hand began to use methane for growth in the m sdz ch3oh group after methane had been exhausted 26 of sdz was eventually removed consequently sdz degradation only occurred when mmo was active 3 3 indirect sdz photodegradation as natural photosensitizers with excellent photochemical properties eom plays an important role in indirect torcs photolysis a three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem was used to evaluate interaction mechanisms between eom and sdz fig s1 the major organic substances of eom were tryptophan like proteins uv humic acid visible humic acid tryptophan and tyrosine supplementation with sdz stimulated more eom to be produced by the methanotrophs light had a significant impact on eom contents and compositions to assess structural differences in eom from the different groups ultraviolet light absorbance at 254 nm and the e2 e3 value were measured table 3 among the groups with light the highest suva254 value was in m sdz l followed by in m sdz l and m l this finding indicates that aromatic contents of the eom successively decreased xue et al 2019 in a descending order the e2 e3 values were in groups in m sdz l m sdz l and m l revealing an increase in molecular weights of eom lou and xie 2006 compared to the m sdz group the suva254 value was decreased while the e2 e3 value was increased in the m sdz l group indicating that light reduced the aromaticity and molecular weights of eom the suva254 and e2 e3 values increased after adding sdz reactive species produced by eom were affected by aromatic contents and molecular weights fig 4 shows the dominant reactive species during indirect photochemical transformation of sdz changes in sdz concentrations in the ms sdz system were not significant indicating negligible effects of eom on sdz under light deficient conditions the addition of sa inhibited sdz degradation suggesting that 3eom played an important role in photodegradation of sdz differences in sdz removal between groups ms sdz l ipa and ms sdz l were minimal indicating a minor role of oh in indirect sdz photodegradation 1o2 a selective reactive oxygen species oxidizes electron rich compounds such as phenols kellogg and fridovich 1975 1o2 plays an insignificant role in sdz degradation bai et al 2021 consequently eom promoted indirect sdz photodegradation through 3eom 3 4 sdz degradation pathways fig s2 shows the total ion chromatograms of the putative sdz degradation products generated from ms in full scan mode for the sdz l m sdz l in m sdz l and m sdz groups since the initial concentrations were too low to obtain fragmentation data from the ms ms the ms was analyzed in combination with mass shift unsaturation and nitrogen rules to determine the basic composition and chemical structure of the degradation products figs s3 and s4 we also referred to the major cleavage sites and common degradation products of sulfonamides previously reported deng et al 2016 majewsky et al 2015 tappe et al 2015 based on the identified degradation products and their formation patterns in time series the main degradation pathways were proposed in different groups sdz has two aromatic moieties such as an aniline ring and a heterocyclic ring with two n atoms which are joined through sulfonamide linkages nh so2 fig 5 the frontier electron density theory calculations confirm that the aniline moiety in sdz is the most susceptible site for attack of electrophilic oxidants or radicals shad et al 2018 the density functional theory dft calculations suggest that n4 c5 and c8 atoms on the aniline ring of the sdz molecule have a high potential to be oxidized yin et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 sdz undergoes hydroxylation of heterocyclic rings either by biodegradation or photolysis deng et al 2016 therefore transformation of the aniline nh2 group to form nitrosobenzene or nitrobenzene and hydroxylation of the benzene ring or pyrimidine ring was observed in all groups figs 5 and s5 due to stronger negative charges of the nitrogen atom nitro or hydroxy transformed products tps can be attacked by oh leading to breaking of n1 c10 bonds by direct photolysis alone m z 187 and m z 189 fig s3 the dft calculations indicated that the s2 atom in sdz was the most susceptible site to be attacked by oxidative nucleophilic species cleavage of s2 c3 bonds of tp molecules occurred via direct photolysis alone m z 108 m z 109 and m z 124 fig s3 however tps with benzene or pyrimidine rings were not oxidized and broken to form smaller molecules through direct photolysis alone the sdz degradation pathway in direct photolysis combined with indirect photolysis was similar to that of direct photolysis alone fig s5 breakage of the heterocyclic ring that occurred in m sdz and m sdz l groups was not detected in the in m sdz l group nitration of the nh2 group in the benzene ring was one of the main sdz degradation pathways in m sdz fig 5 zhou et al 2019 demonstrated that ammonia monooxygenase amo can co metabolize sdz sulfamethazine smz and sulfamethoxazole smx by hydroxylating or nitrating the nh2 group kassotaki et al 2016 also found that amo co metabolized smx to produce 4 nitro smx the sequences and functions of amo and mmo are very similar lontoh et al 2000 as a result mmo co metabolism could be to blame for the nh2 group s hydroxylation or nitration the two main tps were formed by breaking n1 c10 bonds of sulfonamide nh so2 m z 187 and m z 97 fig s4 the tps with benzene rings were further oxidized and desulfated to form smaller molecules and were eventually presented in the system as 4 aminophenol or 4 nitrophenol m z 203 m z 174 m z109 and m z 108 fig s4 however other hydroxylation products of the pyrimidine ring were not degraded further m z 97 fig s4 we postulated that more pyrimidine ring products were in the system additionally benzene or pyrimidine ring hydroxylation was another pathway in the system smmo is capable of transforming aromatic compounds through hydroxylation conversion lindner et al 2000 showed that 2 bromobiphenyl 2 chlorinated biphenyl and 2 iodobiphenyl can be converted to corresponding hydroxylation products by co metabolism of smmo the ability of smmo to convert bentazone to 6 oh bentazone 8 oh bentazone isopropyl oh bentazone and di oh bentazone was also confirmed by high resolution mass spectrometry hedegaard et al 2018 however these tps were not further oxidized after breaking the n11 c12 n13 c14 bonds of the heterocyclic ring resulting in high molecular weight products m z 231 m z 215 fig s4 in the m sdz group nitration of the nh2 group breakage of the n1 c10 bonds of sulfonamide as well as benzene or pyrimidine ring hydroxylation that occurred in the above mentioned groups during sdz degradation with co metabolism and photodegradation together fig 5 were detected in the m sdz l group since the hydroxyl group enhances the electron density of the heterocyclic ring the hydroxylated intermediate may easily undergo further radical or non radical attack to generate more stable dihydroxylated products m z 267 m z 283 fig s4 as in group m sdz cleavage of n11 c12 and n13 c14 bonds occurred because of stronger negative charges of the nitrogen atom leading to pyrimidine ring disruption m z 215 fig s4 it is consistent with the findings of deng et al 2016 the isolated and purified strain d2 and d4 were able to convert sdz through sulfonamide bond cleavage pyrimidine ring cleavage and oxidation the intermediate with an aromatic ring was further oxidized and desulfated to form smaller molecules the others were oxidized to low molecular organic acids such as formic and acetic acids m z 201 m z 187 and m z 173 fig s4 finally the sulfanilamide group was oxidized to 4 aminophenol and then to 4 nitrophenol m z 108 m z 109 fig s4 the aromatic ring was broken to generate some complex intermediates which were further mineralized in groups sdz l and in m sdz l there was no cleavage of pyrimidine rings fig s5 even though breakage of nc bonds of the heterocyclic ring occurred in the m sdz group the intermediate was not further oxidized or desulfated fig 5 when photodegradation was involved the pyrimidine ring disrupted tps transformation to smaller molecular organic products in group m sdz l leading to complete sdz degradation 3 5 the sdz mineralization ratio the sdz mineralization ratio was calculated using the net 13co2 produced in the system fig 6 during the entire experimental period no net 13co2 was produced in the sdz l group indicating that mineralization could not be achieved by direct photodegradation after 12 days 36 5 of the initially added sdz 13c6 was recovered as 13co2 in the microbial system with light while only 9 9 was recovered in the microbial system without light mineralization was 3 7 times higher in group m sdz l than in group m sdz confirming the importance of light combined with co metabolism for sdz mineralization additionally in 12 days 6 9 of the initial sdz 13c6 in group in m sdz l was mineralized to 13co2 the sdz removal ratio in the in m sdz l group was higher than that in the m sdz group while the mineralization ratio was low suggesting that sdz degradation via the co metabolic pathway was more complete 3 6 toxicity changes in sdz degradation products in all tests the number of reverse mutation colonies in the blank and dsmz medium 1409 control group were 90 120 for the ta97 strain 30 50 for the ta98 strain 100 200 for the ta100 strain and 280 320 for the ta102 strain data not shown this result complied with the quality control requirements for tester strains in the ames test and demonstrated that the medium used in this study was not mutagenic in any of the tests mutagenicity was not detected for ta98 ta100 and ta102 strains this may be attributed to bacteriostatic effects of sdz causing general toxicity death of s typhimurium gonzalez gil et al 2016 mutagenicity of the ta97 strain was detected in group m sdz mr 12 92 however there was no colony growth in groups sdz sdz l m sdz l or in m sdz l fig 7 we suspect that the tps degraded by the methanotrophs only caused positive mutagenicity in the ta97 strain while the parent compound namely sdz and tps in groups sdz l m sdz l and in m sdz l were not mutagenic 4 discussion 4 1 contribution of co metabolism to sdz degradation a non negligible sdz degradation rate of 28 was obtained in the m sdz group indicating an independent co metabolism function benner et al 2015 reported that smx a sulfonamide antibiotic can be co metabolically degraded by methanotrophs in an enriched culture methanotrophs utilize methane via a metabolic cascade comprising four enzymes mmo methanol dehydrogenase mdh formaldehyde dehydrogenase fadh and formate dehydrogenase fdh sahoo et al 2021 among them only mmo which is able to co metabolically oxidize various organic compounds is non specific mmo is a trimeric protease with metal active sites the active sites are powerful oxidizing sites which may account for mmo s broad substrate range in methanol addition experiments sdz was found to be directly associated with methane oxidation fig 3 sdz was not degraded even when other methanotroph enzymes were still active in addition to mmo implying that sdz degradation in methanotroph strains is solely due to mmo there are two mmo types particulate methane monooxygenase pmmo and smmo apart from methane pmmo oxidizes hydrocarbons with less than five carbons to their corresponding alcohols or ethylene oxide pmmo a copper containing trimer protease contains mononuclear and dinuclear cu centers based on sequence information the dinuclear cu center is a potential active site semrau et al 2010 smmo oxidizes alkanes with up to eight carbon atoms esters cyclic alkanes and aromatic compounds papadopoulou et al 2019 confirmed that dichlorophenol removal is due to smmo the active site in smmo contains a di iron center bridged by an oxygen atom fe o fe whereas the active site in pmmo utilizes copper due to differences in active site properties pmmo and smmo have different substrate oxidation ranges semrau et al 2010 in cells that can express both types copper ions play an important role in regulating the expressions of the two mmos smmo expressions occur when copper ion levels in the growth medium are 1 μm while pmmo expressions only occur when copper ion levels in the growth medium are 5 μm semrau et al 2010 the copper ion concentration in this experiment was 0 44 μm therefore in this study smmo rather than pmmo was responsible for sdz degradation by m bryophila beside other degradation function enzymes may also play a role such as cytochrome p450 rudolf et al 2017 not only was sdz degraded in the m sdz group but was also partially mineralized by co metabolism with smmo the heterocyclic ring was broken in the m sdz group compared to sdz l and in m sdz l groups without mmo co metabolism figs 5 and s5 indicating that the pyrimidine ring is a potential attack site for mmo these findings are consistent with the result that mmo co metabolism leads to dichlorprop mineralization papadopoulou et al 2019 this explains why less sdz removal was observed with more mineralization in the m sdz group relative to the in m sdz l group during the photodegradation process the tps in which the heterocyclic ring opened after co metabolism were more vulnerable to attack by reactive species this improved sdz degradation fig 2 and mineralization fig 6 in the m sdz l group compared to the in m sdz l group 4 2 light intensifies sdz co metabolism by methanotrophs the sdz degradation and mineralization rate was increased in the m sdz l group compared to the m sdz group figs 2 and 6 indicating that light intensifies sdz co metabolism the suva254 and e2 e3 results in table 3 and the 3d eem results in fig s1 indicate that eoms produced by methanotrophs under normal growth conditions differ from those produced under sdz stimulation or light irradiation conditions differences in composition and increased fluorescence intensities of eom indicate that sdz stimulated the methanotrophs to produce more extracellular secretions in groups m l and m sdz l sdz or its co metabolites can stimulate methanotrophs to produce some unique eoms that are more photosensitive which improves sdz photodegradation in group sdz l the sdz degradation rate was negligible indicating that indirect photodegradation plays a major role in sdz degradation the eom absorption spectrum arises from a continuum of coupled states undergoing intramolecular charge transfer interactions between aromatic polymers resulting in the production of 3eom oh and 1o2 mcneill and canonica 2016 the quenching experiment showed that 3eom plays a major role in sdz degradation fig 4 consistent with findings by previous studies that indirect photodegradation with 3eom is the predominant removal mechanism for sulfonamides such as sdz and smx bahnmüller et al 2014 ryan et al 2011 wang et al 2018 light radiation improved the sdz degradation ratio and changed the intermediate products which were closely related to mineralization heterocyclic ring namely the pyrimidine ring fragmentation in the m sdz group with co metabolism of mmo which is resistant to cleavage during direct photolysis is due to a lack of chromophores to absorb actinic radiation benner et al 2013 ge et al 2018 lam and mabury 2005 yang et al 2018 reported that ring opening of the heterocyclic ring particularly the six membered ring is difficult because heterocyclic ring reactivity is relatively low relative to that of the nh so2 moiety therefore a heterocyclic fracture is conducive for mineralization however after breaking the heterocyclic ring in group m sdz tps were not further degraded which resulted in low mineralization incompletely degraded sdz increased the mutagenicity risk fig 7 when photodegradation was coupled to co metabolism in the m sdz l group the heterocyclic ring was successfully destroyed further the tps were degraded into smaller molecules such as formic and acetic acids and the mineralization ratio increased from 9 9 co metabolism alone to 36 5 photodegradation coupled with co metabolism therefore in the co metabolic process photodegradation significantly promoted sdz mineralization comparisons of groups in m sdz l and m sdz revealed that the mineralization degree was not entirely proportional to toxicity sdz is a commonly used antibiotic without mutagenicity as revealed by the ames test mr 2 in all strains however the ames test showed that the intermediates produced by individual co metabolism in group m sdz were genotoxic after light exposure in group m sdz l this genotoxicity disappeared mutagenicity of the sample in group m sdz could be due to generation of toxic intermediates namely m z 97 fig 5 the tps with m z 97 were the main intermediates in group m sdz and they may exert higher toxicities towards microorganisms than parent sdz or other tps guan et al 2019 reported that compared to the parent compound tps with m z 98 of smx likely m z 97 in this study exhibit higher toxicity on daphnids and green algae in group m sdz l sdz was attacked by mmo and the pyrimidine ring opened at the same time photodegradation occurred and produced tps with low molecular weights and less toxicity such as formic and acetic acids therefore light irradiation improved sdz degradation as well as mineralization and abolished the toxic intermediates in conclusion light may play an important role in removing and detoxifying torcs such as antibiotics from the environment 5 conclusions light enhances co metabolic transformation of sdz by m bryophila compared to individual co metabolic sdz degradation the degradation ratio increased from 28 9 to 80 6 while the mineralization ratio increased from 9 9 to 36 5 with m bryophila under the light condition sdz promoted eom production by m bryophila the quenching experiment showed that during sdz photodegradation 3eom was the dominant reactive species after individual co metabolic sdz degradation the mr of the ta97 strain was 12 92 indicating that the degradation products were mutagenic however after sdz was degraded by m bryophila under light conditions mutagenicity disappeared indicating that light co metabolically promoted sdz degradation the common sdz degradation pathways with individual co metabolism or direct indirect photodegradation include i nitration and nitrosation of the aniline moiety on the benzene ring ii hydroxylation on either the benzene ring or heterocyclic ring with formation of mono or di hydroxyl sdz products iii cleavage of c n and s n bonds of sulfonamide nh so2 the pyrimidine ring was destroyed in group m sdz which was attributed to co metabolism the tps were not further oxidized by individual co metabolism but were degraded into smaller molecules such as formic and acetic acids supplementary information

15811,co metabolism and photodegradation are two approaches for remediating trace organic compounds torcs however interactions between the two with regards to torcs degradation have not been elucidated in this study sulfadiazine sdz was chosen as a representative torc and methylocystis bryophila as a typical strain under light conditions about 80 6 of sdz was removed by m bryophila but only 7 6 or 28 9 of sdz was eliminated by either individual photodegradation or by co metabolism the sdz stimulated more extracellular organic matter eom production by m bryophila the enhanced sdz degradation was attributed to indirect photolysis caused by the excited triplet state of eom 3eom and co metabolism the uplc qtof ms analysis showed that due to co metabolism the pyrimidine ring was broken and could further be oxidized into smaller molecules under light conditions such as formic and acetic acids the sdz mineralization ratio increased from 9 9 under the co metabolic condition alone to 36 5 under co metabolism coupled with photodegradation the ames tests confirmed that the sdz degradation products by co metabolism were mutagenic however their toxicity was ameliorated by light during co metabolism in conclusion light plays a crucial role in co metabolic processes of torcs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords trace organic compounds co metabolism photodegradation mineralization mutagenicity 1 introduction trace organic compounds torcs such as synthetic antibiotics are widely present in aquatic environments bai et al 2021 applications of torcs as energy or carbon sources to support microbial growth are limited by their low concentrations parts per million or less in biological metabolism some toxic torcs such as bacteriostatic antibiotics are relatively difficult to degrade benner et al 2013 during co metabolic degradation torcs are degraded as primary growth substrates rather than energy or carbon sources co metabolic degradation has gained attention as it permits microbial degradation of torcs at low concentrations semrau et al 2010 in the presence of the non specific methane monooxygenase mmo methanotrophs can use methane as the first substrate to co metabolically degrade co existing second substrates benner et al 2015 wang et al 2019 soluble mmo smmo can oxidize alkanes with up to eight carbon atoms as well as aromatic compounds hedegaard et al 2018 semrau et al 2010 benner et al 2015 used five different methane oxidizing cultures to co metabolically degrade 18 different torcs they found that all cultures successfully degraded at least four different compounds hedegaard et al 2018 confirmed that co metabolism enhances bentazone transformation by enriching methanotrophs from a groundwater fed rapid sand filter however after co metabolism transformation products tps are in the form of 6 oh 8 oh isopropyl oh or di oh bentazone which are toxic photodegradation an important elimination process for organic compounds in natural water can occur either by direct sunlight radiation absorption direct photolysis or by reactions with transient reactive intermediates indirect photolysis such as excited triplet states of extracellular organic matter 3eom hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 tian et al 2019 due to its chemical structure sulfadiazine sdz a broad spectrum antibiotic exhibits limited biodegradation however improved biodegradation and mineralization can be obtained by coupling it to direct uv photolysis pan et al 2014 algae derived eom significantly enhances chlortetracycline indirect photolysis tian et al 2019 in shallow water bodies photosynthesis provides oxygen which is necessary for aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria s metabolism milucka et al 2015 and torcs are ubiquitously distributed in the same region zheng et al 2020 this shows that aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria can also be exposed to direct light radiation therefore light may be involved in degradation of torcs with co metabolism of aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria in this study we investigated the torcs degradation pathway during aerobic methane oxidation under light conditions in this study sdz was used as a representative torc while methylocystis bryophila was used as the type methanotroph strain we elucidated the degradation pathways and variations of sdz toxicity during photodegradation coupled with co metabolism by methanotrophs our findings provide new insights into the fate of torcs through coupled photochemical and co metabolic processes 2

that cause base pair substitutions 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 batch tests for sdz degradation table 1 shows that there were eight degradation conditions sdz l m sdz l in m sdz l m sdz m l in m sdz in m sdz ch3oh and m sdz ch3oh the concentrations of sdz in the river water generally ranked between 1 0 ng l 1 8 μg l zainab et al 2020 and in some contaminated water bodies can be pretty high even reaching the mg l range fick et al 2009 xie et al 2020 and we selected the concentration of 3 mg l of sdz 99 0 sigma aldrich st louis mo usa as the initial concentration of administration the initial methanotrophs density was 2 107 cells ml light groups were cultured in a light incubator at a light intensity of 10 000 lx photons m2 s to determine the total degradation fraction attributed to

described in section 2 2 1 during the assays 1 0 ml of the filtered sample was withdrawn and injected into a brown vial for sdz content analysis 2 2 3 determination of sdz mineralization as described

o2 n2 and moisture in air 2 4 statistical analysis data are expressed as mean sd the origin software ver 2020 origin software inc northampton ma usa was used for analyses 3 results 3 1 methanotroph growths in batch tests there were no changes in ch4 o2 or co2 contents in the sdz l group fig 1 a c indicating that light was not associated with ch4 oxidation during the early test stages 0 6 d comparable changes in ch4 o2 and co2 contents were observed in m sdz l in m sdz l m sdz and m l groups these findings imply comparable growth states of methanotrophs in the four groups in the late stage 6 14 d changes in ch4 o2 and co2 in the in m sdz l group stopped immediately and remained stable indicating that c2h2 inhibited methanotroph mmo we concluded that 3 mg l sdz did not inhibit methanotroph growth 3 2 sdz degradation in batch tests fig 2 a shows that nearly none of sdz was removed in the sdz l group indicating that sdz could not be degraded only in the presence of light a 28 9 elimination rate of sdz was noted in the m sdz group suggesting that sdz could be partially eliminated by methanotrophs methanotroph co metabolism removed 22 of bentazone a refractory organic compound with a benzene ring similar to sdz hedegaard et al 2018 the methnotrophs co metabolic removal ratio of sdz was comparable to that of bentazone within eight days the elimination rate of sdz significantly increased to 80 6 in the m sdz l group illustrating an accelerated performance of light for eliminating sdz with methanotrophic metabolism the linear correlation between ln c c0 and t was significant for substrate degradation sdz l r2 0 90 m sdz l r2 0 99 in m sdz l r2 0 97 m sdz r2 0 98 implying that sdz elimination in distinct groups exhibited pseudo first order kinetics the pseudo first order rate constant k d 1 varied in different systems sdz l k 0 009 d 1 m sdz l k 0 200 d 1 in m sdz l k 0 044 d 1 m sdz k 0 042 d 1 for instance k of the m sdz l system was 0 2 d 1 which was about 4 8 times higher than that of the m sdz system fig 2 b this finding confirms that light plays a decisive role in enhancing sdz elimination by methanotrophs when sdz was exposed to mmo inhibited methanotrophs under light conditions group in m sdz l 30 5 of the sdz was eliminated which was significantly lower than the elimination rate in the m sdz l group this shows that co metabolism by mmo plays a primary role in methanotrophs mediated sdz degradation xie et al 2020 reported 35 sulfadiazine elimination by photodegradation in an algal degradation system which was comparable to that of the inactivated group in this study and for environmental samples with lower concentrations photodegradation has been considered as the major pathway for natural attenuation of sulfonamides li et al 2018 degradation of sdz in the in m sdz l group was significantly higher than that of the sdz l group light alone indicating the vital function of indirect photolysis the ch3oh addition groups in m sdz ch3oh and m sdz ch3oh were designed to further determine the effects of mmo activities on sdz degradation with the in m sdz group being the control fig 3 since mmo was inhibited there were no changes in the in m sdz group the experimental cycle in in m sdz ch3oh and m sdz ch3oh groups was divided into pre period 0 4 days and post period 4 10 days in the pre period both groups exhibited similar changes in ch4 o2 co2 methanol and biomass thus regardless of the presence of acetylene in the presence of both methane and methanol methanotrophs preferentially used methanol the lack of methane oxidation indicates that mmo did not work in both systems in addition sdz was not degraded during the pre period in the post period the in m sdz ch3oh and m sdz ch3oh groups exhibited different trends after methanol exhaustion mmo inhibition did not change ch4 o2 co2 and biomass in the in m sdz ch3oh group methanotrophs on the other hand began to use methane for growth in the m sdz ch3oh group after methane had been exhausted 26 of sdz was eventually removed consequently sdz degradation only occurred when mmo was active 3 3 indirect sdz photodegradation as natural photosensitizers with excellent photochemical properties eom plays an important role in indirect torcs photolysis a three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem was used to evaluate interaction mechanisms between eom and sdz fig s1 the major organic substances of eom were tryptophan like proteins uv humic acid visible humic acid tryptophan and tyrosine supplementation with sdz stimulated more eom to be produced by the methanotrophs light had a significant impact on eom contents and compositions to assess structural differences in eom from the different groups ultraviolet light absorbance at 254 nm and the e2 e3 value were measured table 3 among the groups with light the highest suva254 value was in m sdz l followed by in m sdz l and m l this finding indicates that aromatic contents of the eom successively decreased xue et al 2019 in a descending order the e2 e3 values were in groups in m sdz l m sdz l and m l revealing an increase in molecular weights of eom lou and xie 2006 compared to the m sdz group the suva254 value was decreased while the e2 e3 value was increased in the m sdz l group indicating that light reduced the aromaticity and molecular weights of eom the suva254 and e2 e3 values increased after adding sdz reactive species produced by eom were affected by aromatic contents and molecular weights fig 4 shows the dominant reactive species during indirect photochemical transformation of sdz changes in sdz concentrations in the ms sdz system were not significant indicating negligible effects of eom on sdz under light deficient conditions the addition of sa inhibited sdz degradation suggesting that 3eom played an important role in photodegradation of sdz differences in sdz removal between groups ms sdz l ipa and ms sdz l were minimal indicating a minor role of oh in indirect sdz photodegradation 1o2 a selective reactive oxygen species oxidizes electron rich compounds such as phenols kellogg and fridovich 1975 1o2 plays an insignificant role in sdz degradation bai et al 2021 consequently eom promoted indirect sdz photodegradation through 3eom 3 4 sdz degradation pathways fig s2 shows the total ion chromatograms of the putative sdz degradation products generated from ms in full scan mode for the sdz l m sdz l in m sdz l and m sdz groups since the initial concentrations were too low to obtain fragmentation data from the ms ms the ms was analyzed in combination with mass shift unsaturation and nitrogen rules to determine the basic composition and chemical structure of the degradation products figs s3 and s4 we also referred to the major cleavage sites and common degradation products of sulfonamides previously reported deng et al 2016 majewsky et al 2015 tappe et al 2015 based on the identified degradation products and their formation patterns in time series the main degradation pathways were proposed in different groups sdz has two aromatic moieties such as an aniline ring and a heterocyclic ring with two n atoms which are joined through sulfonamide linkages nh so2 fig 5 the frontier electron density theory calculations confirm that the aniline moiety in sdz is the most susceptible site for attack of electrophilic oxidants or radicals shad et al 2018 the density functional theory dft calculations suggest that n4 c5 and c8 atoms on the aniline ring of the sdz molecule have a high potential to be oxidized yin et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 sdz undergoes hydroxylation of heterocyclic rings either by biodegradation or photolysis deng et al 2016 therefore transformation of the aniline nh2 group to form nitrosobenzene or nitrobenzene and hydroxylation of the benzene ring or pyrimidine ring was observed in all groups figs 5 and s5 due to stronger negative charges of the nitrogen atom nitro or hydroxy transformed products tps can be attacked by oh leading to breaking of n1 c10 bonds by direct photolysis alone m z 187 and m z 189 fig s3 the dft calculations indicated that the s2 atom in sdz was the most susceptible site to be attacked by oxidative nucleophilic species cleavage of s2 c3 bonds of tp molecules occurred via direct photolysis alone m z 108 m z 109 and m z 124 fig s3 however tps with benzene or pyrimidine rings were not oxidized and broken to form smaller molecules through direct photolysis alone the sdz degradation pathway in direct photolysis combined with indirect photolysis was similar to that of direct photolysis alone fig s5 breakage of the heterocyclic ring that occurred in m sdz and m sdz l groups was not detected in the in m sdz l group nitration of the nh2 group in the benzene ring was one of the main sdz degradation pathways in m sdz fig 5 zhou et al 2019 demonstrated that ammonia monooxygenase amo can co metabolize sdz sulfamethazine smz and sulfamethoxazole smx by hydroxylating or nitrating the nh2 group kassotaki et al 2016 also found that amo co metabolized smx to produce 4 nitro smx the sequences and functions of amo and mmo are very similar lontoh et al 2000 as a result mmo co metabolism could be to blame for the nh2 group s hydroxylation or nitration the two main tps were formed by breaking n1 c10 bonds of sulfonamide nh so2 m z 187 and m z 97 fig s4 the tps with benzene rings were further oxidized and desulfated to form smaller molecules and were eventually presented in the system as 4 aminophenol or 4 nitrophenol m z 203 m z 174 m z109 and m z 108 fig s4 however other hydroxylation products of the pyrimidine ring were not degraded further m z 97 fig s4 we postulated that more pyrimidine ring products were in the system additionally benzene or pyrimidine ring hydroxylation was another pathway in the system smmo is capable of transforming aromatic compounds through hydroxylation conversion lindner et al 2000 showed that 2 bromobiphenyl 2 chlorinated biphenyl and 2 iodobiphenyl can be converted to corresponding hydroxylation products by co metabolism of smmo the ability of smmo to convert bentazone to 6 oh bentazone 8 oh bentazone isopropyl oh bentazone and di oh bentazone was also confirmed by high resolution mass spectrometry hedegaard et al 2018 however these tps were not further oxidized after breaking the n11 c12 n13 c14 bonds of the heterocyclic ring resulting in high molecular weight products m z 231 m z 215 fig s4 in the m sdz group nitration of the nh2 group breakage of the n1 c10 bonds of sulfonamide as well as benzene or pyrimidine ring hydroxylation that occurred in the above mentioned groups during sdz degradation with co metabolism and photodegradation together fig 5 were detected in the m sdz l group since the hydroxyl group enhances the electron density of the heterocyclic ring the hydroxylated intermediate may easily undergo further radical or non radical attack to generate more stable dihydroxylated products m z 267 m z 283 fig s4 as in group m sdz cleavage of n11 c12 and n13 c14 bonds occurred because of stronger negative charges of the nitrogen atom leading to pyrimidine ring disruption m z 215 fig s4 it is consistent with the findings of deng et al 2016 the isolated and purified strain d2 and d4 were able to convert sdz through sulfonamide bond cleavage pyrimidine ring cleavage and oxidation the intermediate with an aromatic ring was further oxidized and desulfated to form smaller molecules the others were oxidized to low molecular organic acids such as formic and acetic acids m z 201 m z 187 and m z 173 fig s4 finally the sulfanilamide group was oxidized to 4 aminophenol and then to 4 nitrophenol m z 108 m z 109 fig s4 the aromatic ring was broken to generate some complex intermediates which were further mineralized in groups sdz l and in m sdz l there was no cleavage of pyrimidine rings fig s5 even though breakage of nc bonds of the heterocyclic ring occurred in the m sdz group the intermediate was not further oxidized or desulfated fig 5 when photodegradation was involved the pyrimidine ring disrupted tps transformation to smaller molecular organic products in group m sdz l leading to complete sdz degradation 3 5 the sdz mineralization ratio the sdz mineralization ratio was calculated using the net 13co2 produced in the system fig 6 during the entire experimental period no net 13co2 was produced in the sdz l group indicating that mineralization could not be achieved by direct photodegradation after 12 days 36 5 of the initially added sdz 13c6 was recovered as 13co2 in the microbial system with light while only 9 9 was recovered in the microbial system without light mineralization was 3 7 times higher in group m sdz l than in group m sdz confirming the importance of light combined with co metabolism for sdz mineralization additionally in 12 days 6 9 of the initial sdz 13c6 in group in m sdz l was mineralized to 13co2 the sdz removal ratio in the in m sdz l group was higher than that in the m sdz group while the mineralization ratio was low suggesting that sdz degradation via the co metabolic pathway was more complete 3 6 toxicity changes in sdz degradation products in all tests the number of reverse mutation colonies in the blank and dsmz medium 1409 control group were 90 120 for the ta97 strain 30 50 for the ta98 strain 100 200 for the ta100 strain and 280 320 for the ta102 strain data not shown this result complied with the quality control requirements for tester strains in the ames test and demonstrated that the medium used in this study was not mutagenic in any of the tests mutagenicity was not detected for ta98 ta100 and ta102 strains this may be attributed to bacteriostatic effects of sdz causing general toxicity death of s typhimurium gonzalez gil et al 2016 mutagenicity of the ta97 strain was detected in group m sdz mr 12 92 however there was no colony growth in groups sdz sdz l m sdz l or in m sdz l fig 7 we suspect that the tps degraded by the methanotrophs only caused positive mutagenicity in the ta97 strain while the parent compound namely sdz and tps in groups sdz l m sdz l and in m sdz l were not mutagenic 4 discussion 4 1 contribution of co metabolism to sdz degradation a non negligible sdz degradation rate of 28 was obtained in the m sdz group indicating an independent co metabolism function benner et al 2015 reported that smx a sulfonamide antibiotic can be co metabolically degraded by methanotrophs in an enriched culture methanotrophs utilize methane via a metabolic cascade comprising four enzymes mmo methanol dehydrogenase mdh formaldehyde dehydrogenase fadh and formate dehydrogenase fdh sahoo et al 2021 among them only mmo which is able to co metabolically oxidize various organic compounds is non specific mmo is a trimeric protease with metal active sites the active sites are powerful oxidizing sites which may account for mmo s broad substrate range in methanol addition experiments sdz was found to be directly associated with methane oxidation fig 3 sdz was not degraded even when other methanotroph enzymes were still active in addition to mmo implying that sdz degradation in methanotroph strains is solely due to mmo there are two mmo types particulate methane monooxygenase pmmo and smmo apart from methane pmmo oxidizes hydrocarbons with less than five carbons to their corresponding alcohols or ethylene oxide pmmo a copper containing trimer protease contains mononuclear and dinuclear cu centers based on sequence information the dinuclear cu center is a potential active site semrau et al 2010 smmo oxidizes alkanes with up to eight carbon atoms esters cyclic alkanes and aromatic compounds papadopoulou et al 2019 confirmed that dichlorophenol removal is due to smmo the active site in smmo contains a di iron center bridged by an oxygen atom fe o fe whereas the active site in pmmo utilizes copper due to differences in active site properties pmmo and smmo have different substrate oxidation ranges semrau et al 2010 in cells that can express both types copper ions play an important role in regulating the expressions of the two mmos smmo expressions occur when copper ion levels in the growth medium are 1 μm while pmmo expressions only occur when copper ion levels in the growth medium are 5 μm semrau et al 2010 the copper ion concentration in this experiment was 0 44 μm therefore in this study smmo rather than pmmo was responsible for sdz degradation by m bryophila beside other degradation function enzymes may also play a role such as cytochrome p450 rudolf et al 2017 not only was sdz degraded in the m sdz group but was also partially mineralized by co metabolism with smmo the heterocyclic ring was broken in the m sdz group compared to sdz l and in m sdz l groups without mmo co metabolism figs 5 and s5 indicating that the pyrimidine ring is a potential attack site for mmo these findings are consistent with the result that mmo co metabolism leads to dichlorprop mineralization papadopoulou et al 2019 this explains why less sdz removal was observed with more mineralization in the m sdz group relative to the in m sdz l group during the photodegradation process the tps in which the heterocyclic ring opened after co metabolism were more vulnerable to attack by reactive species this improved sdz degradation fig 2 and mineralization fig 6 in the m sdz l group compared to the in m sdz l group 4 2 light intensifies sdz co metabolism by methanotrophs the sdz degradation and mineralization rate was increased in the m sdz l group compared to the m sdz group figs 2 and 6 indicating that light intensifies sdz co metabolism the suva254 and e2 e3 results in table 3 and the 3d eem results in fig s1 indicate that eoms produced by methanotrophs under normal growth conditions differ from those produced under sdz stimulation or light irradiation conditions differences in composition and increased fluorescence intensities of eom indicate that sdz stimulated the methanotrophs to produce more extracellular secretions in groups m l and m sdz l sdz or its co metabolites can stimulate methanotrophs to produce some unique eoms that are more photosensitive which improves sdz photodegradation in group sdz l the sdz degradation rate was negligible indicating that indirect photodegradation plays a major role in sdz degradation the eom absorption spectrum arises from a continuum of coupled states undergoing intramolecular charge transfer interactions between aromatic polymers resulting in the production of 3eom oh and 1o2 mcneill and canonica 2016 the quenching experiment showed that 3eom plays a major role in sdz degradation fig 4 consistent with findings by previous studies that indirect photodegradation with 3eom is the predominant removal mechanism for sulfonamides such as sdz and smx bahnmüller et al 2014 ryan et al 2011 wang et al 2018 light radiation improved the sdz degradation ratio and changed the intermediate products which were closely related to mineralization heterocyclic ring namely the pyrimidine ring fragmentation in the m sdz group with co metabolism of mmo which is resistant to cleavage during direct photolysis is due to a lack of chromophores to absorb actinic radiation benner et al 2013 ge et al 2018 lam and mabury 2005 yang et al 2018 reported that ring opening of the heterocyclic ring particularly the six membered ring is difficult because heterocyclic ring reactivity is relatively low relative to that of the nh so2 moiety therefore a heterocyclic fracture is conducive for mineralization however after breaking the heterocyclic ring in group m sdz tps were not further degraded which resulted in low mineralization incompletely degraded sdz increased the mutagenicity risk fig 7 when photodegradation was coupled to co metabolism in the m sdz l group the heterocyclic ring was successfully destroyed further the tps were degraded into smaller molecules such as formic and acetic acids and the mineralization ratio increased from 9 9 co metabolism alone to 36 5 photodegradation coupled with co metabolism therefore in the co metabolic process photodegradation significantly promoted sdz mineralization comparisons of groups in m sdz l and m sdz revealed that the mineralization degree was not entirely proportional to toxicity sdz is a commonly used antibiotic without mutagenicity as revealed by the ames test mr 2 in all strains however the ames test showed that the intermediates produced by individual co metabolism in group m sdz were genotoxic after light exposure in group m sdz l this genotoxicity disappeared mutagenicity of the sample in group m sdz could be due to generation of toxic intermediates namely m z 97 fig 5 the tps with m z 97 were the main intermediates in group m sdz and they may exert higher toxicities towards microorganisms than parent sdz or other tps guan et al 2019 reported that compared to the parent compound tps with m z 98 of smx likely m z 97 in this study exhibit higher toxicity on daphnids and green algae in group m sdz l sdz was attacked by mmo and the pyrimidine ring opened at the same time photodegradation occurred and produced tps with low molecular weights and less toxicity such as formic and acetic acids therefore light irradiation improved sdz degradation as well as mineralization and abolished the toxic intermediates in conclusion light may play an important role in removing and detoxifying torcs such as antibiotics from the environment 5 conclusions light enhances co metabolic transformation of sdz by m bryophila compared to individual co metabolic sdz degradation the degradation ratio increased from 28 9 to 80 6 while the mineralization ratio increased from 9 9 to 36 5 with m bryophila under the light condition sdz promoted eom production by m bryophila the quenching experiment showed that during sdz photodegradation 3eom was the dominant reactive species after individual co metabolic sdz degradation the mr of the ta97 strain was 12 92 indicating that the degradation products were mutagenic however after sdz was degraded by m bryophila under light conditions mutagenicity disappeared indicating that light co metabolically promoted sdz degradation the common sdz degradation pathways with individual co metabolism or direct indirect photodegradation include i nitration and nitrosation of the aniline moiety on the benzene ring ii hydroxylation on either the benzene ring or heterocyclic ring with formation of mono or di hydroxyl sdz products iii cleavage of c n and s n bonds of sulfonamide nh so2 the pyrimidine ring was destroyed in group m sdz which was attributed to co metabolism the tps were not further oxidized by individual co metabolism but were degraded into smaller molecules such as formic and acetic acids supplementary information

15812,micro nano sized plastics mps nps existing in wastewater system are the potential threats to nitrogen n biotransformation constructed wetlands cws as wastewater treatment systems are considered the important barriers preventing mps nps from entering the open water however little is known about how the accumulation of mps nps affects microbial n transformation dynamics assembly and metabolism

about the impact of mps nps accumulation on the ecological stability and treatment performance of cws cws are considered an important barrier to wastewater including rain runoff from farmland and road

when synthetic inflow was added the inlet water can be distributed through the holes on the riser wall so it can directly reach the substrate at both the bottom and top of cws simultaneously in addition as the risers were pre set also for substrate sampling we randomly chose one of the four water distributing risers each time when adding the synthetic inflow in order to avoid uneven

1 plastic particles accumulation impacted the nitrogen transformation efficiency to reveal the impact of mps nps accumulation on nitrogen transformation in cw microcosms we monitored the concentration of ammonia nh4 n and nitrate nitrite no3 n no2 n in effluent for 300 days as shown in fig 1 a and figure s2a c all cw microcosms exhibited a relatively high removal efficiency of nh4 n r nh4 67 6 12 2 in the first stage s1 r nh4 remained 66 5 9 2 and 68 7 10 6 respectively in mah and mih groups during the s2 but decreased to 52 7 9 6 and 37 6 13 3 from s3 to s4 with respect to the nano group r nh4 decreased to 31 6 9 5 in s2 and increased slightly to 39 9 6 4 in s3 and s4 fig 1 and figure s2a c in contrast the r no3 no2 kept within 66 2 99 8 in all wetland systems fig 1b and figure s2d f across the four stages overall all the mps nps groups showed a significantly adverse effect on the nh4 n transformation at medium or high concentrations p 0 001 but no significant negative effect on the no3 n no2 n transformation except for nps at high concentration for long term exposure fig 1a and figure s2 fluctuation of ph was measured for the cm microcosms during the first and last batches and was highly comparable in the high concentration treatments figure s3 which indicated that it was unlikely mps nps accumulation could have affected nitrogen removal efficiency by altering ph the divergent effect of mps nps on nh4 n and no3 n no2 n removal drove us to further question on the microbial dynamics and co occurrence patterns underlying the variation in nitrogen transformation in response to the accumulation of mps nps over time 3 2 plastic particles accumulation changed microbiota diversity microbiota structure clearly shifted in response to the accumulation of mps nps during the 300 day experiment fig 2 plastic size concentration and experimental stage all significantly affected the biofilm microbiota permanova p 0 001 table s2 while microbial community variance was explained most by exposure time r2 0 284 table s2 fig 2a and s3 followed by size r2 0 064 and concentration r2 0 054 bray curtis dissimilarity based clustering dendrogram separated the microbial communities to three main branches i ii and iii fig 2a and figure s4 reflecting the strong temporal variation in microbial community structure as mps nps accumulated this was accompanied by the decreasing chao1 richness and shannon diversity with time in the plastic treated wetlands irrespective of plastic size but not in the control wetland system figure s5a and s4b microbial communities exposed to different sizes of plastic particles appeared more distinct in medium and high concentration treatment groups according to bray curtis distance based nmds analysis fig 2b d the microbiota in the control group was most distant from those exposed to mps nps treatment of high concentration fig 2d especially with macro sized plastics in line with the significantly lower shannon diversity p 0 05 fig 2f of the mah group to summarize long term accumulation of the mps nps induced decreasing microbial richness and diversity and plastic size dependent effect was more apparent under high concentration 3 3 plastic size and concentration co regulated microbial co occurrence patterns 3 3 1 general co occurrence patterns to explore the biological processes and mechanisms through which mps nps exposure affects biofilm microbiota in cws we first used the c score analysis to measure the strength of overall species segregation in the plastic treated and control groups ju et al 2014 the microbiota exhibited an overall segregated species distribution as indicated by the significantly higher observed c scores compared with those expected by null models p 0 01 table s3 the same deterministic pattern was observed for the variances of c score cvar score that simultaneously checked the degrees of both species aggregation i e co occur more and segregation i e co occur less strongly suggesting non random microbiota assembly patterns moreover the standardized effect size ses of c score which enables cross group comparison in the strength of species segregation was remarkably higher for the control group 35 01 compared with the three high concentration 1000 μg l treatment groups regardless of size level 20 5 to 23 7 table s3 suggesting that exposure to excess mps nps led to decrease in the degree of species segregation in the wetland biofilm microbiota consistently species segregation stepwise decreased as manifested by decreasing ses of c score with increasing exposure concentration from 10 μg l 100 μg l to 1000 μg l in the nano and macro treatment groups it was noted that the mal group showed the highest ses values of both c score 92 8 and cvar score 77 0 which was also the only experimental group that showed both higher c score and higher cvar score than the control group implying exposure to low concentration 10 μg l of macro sized plastics 500 1000 μm largely promoted the strengths in the community aggregation and segregation patterns thus microbial co occurrence pattern these results together indicated that microbial co occurrence patterns especially species segregation were non random and co regulated by the size and concentration of plastic particles from microscale down to nanoscale 3 3 2 microbial co occurrence pattern enlightened by the overall nonrandom and plastic differentiated microbiota assembly patterns demonstrated in the wetland biofilms we further used co occurrence network analysis to explore the underlying microbial co occurrence patterns in all the plastic treatment groups and the control group topological analysis showed that all the wetland microbiota subnetworks not only exhibited modularity md 0 14 0 35 cluster coefficients cc 0 54 0 71 and average path lengths apl 2 83 6 16 higher than their respective erdös rényi random networks table 1 but also showed small world properties all σ 1 table 1 suggesting the role of non random microbial co occurrence patterns in the wetland microbiota assembly under exposure to plastic particles especially for the three high level treatment groups fig 3 their subnetworks contained 7618 nano 2069 micro and 6014 macro edges all of which were much higher than the subnetwork of the control group 999 edges among 262 nodes table 1 this pattern consisted with the comparative profile of the average degree in the following increasing order control 3 8 micro 5 9 macro 14 4 nano 17 2 groups reflecting mps nps introduction into the wetland systems promoted the frequency of microbial co occurrence associations further microbial co occurrence networks of the control and high level treatment groups were visually colored according to phylum a d modularity class e h and putative functionality i l of network nodes i e asvs fig 3 facilitating the linking of ecological niches of associated asvs as a proxy for species to their taxonomic and functional characteristics the significantly co occurring asvs were mostly affiliated with proteobacteria 19 2 63 4 chloroflexi 5 7 18 1 actinobacteria 0 7 35 9 firmicutes 0 8 10 1 acidobacteria 1 3 5 5 bacteroidetes 4 0 20 0 and nitrospirae 0 1 6 0 dataset s1 the frequency of co occurring asvs taxonomically assigned to proteobacteria increased from 76 in the subnetwork of the control group to 122 106 and 136 in treatment subnetworks of nah mih and mah respectively and a similar increasing trend was also found for actinobacteria firmicutes acidobacteria bacteroidetes and nitrospirae notably by 50 0 89 5 moreover the incidences of observed o and random r co occurrence between asvs showed that five groups of phyla i e actinobacteria rokubacteria nitrospirae gemmatimonadetes nitrospirae armatimonadetes proteobacteria armatimonadetes and chloroflexi armatimonadetes tended to significantly co occur more often than expected by chance i e o r ratio 2 0 and o or r 0 5 dataset s1 especially in the mah subnetworks where they showed an o r ratio of 2 56 2 42 2 42 2 56 and 2 02 respectively to visually explore ecological niches of co occurring asvs and link them to their functionality the subnetworks were topologically partitioned into 8 major modules i e discreate ecological niches each comprising a group of asvs that interconnected more frequently among themselves than with asvs in other modules fig 3e h overall the subnetworks of treatment groups were different in modularity 0 144 to 0 351 module size and module complexity fig 3f h and clearly distinct from the subnetwork of the control group fig 3e revealing mps nps exposure induced size differentiated niche patterns in cws for instance thauera and methylocystis as denitrifiers dataset s2 belonging to proteobacteria were mainly in module i and ii of the control group while in treatment groups most denitrifiers existed in modules i and iii macro and nano groups and modules iv and v micro group respectively fig 3i l microorganisms mostly belonged to planctomycetes genus blastopirellula assimilatory nitrogen reduction and proteobacteria genus desulfobulbus dissimilatory nitrogen reduction dataset s2 involved in assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrogen reduction processes were mainly gathered in module ii of all treatment groups and in module iii of the control group surprisingly anammox bacteria chloroflexi and planctomycetes at phylum level appeared in the treatment subnetworks and with highest proportion 0 72 in macro group followed by micro group 0 57 and nano group 0 23 table s4 the above results suggested that the accumulation of mps nps changed the co occurrence patterns and provided more alternative niches for nitrogen transforming microorganisms 3 4 plastic particles altered the dynamic succession of microbial community with the accumulation of mps nps dynamics of the top 51 abundant microbial genera in wetland microcosms was characterized by two types of trends decreasing cluster i and increasing cluster ii during the 300 day operation fig 4 a the average relative abundance of nitrifiers in the control nano micro and macro groups were 1 2 0 7 1 2 and 2 1 respectively fig 4c of which nitrosomonas as ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob decreased by 34 5 in nano group while nitrospira as nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob increased in the relative abundance in both mih 1 04 folds and mah 2 91 folds groups fig 4b compared with the control group these results implied that 300 day accumulation of larger sized plastics potentially benefited nitrifiers in wetland system whereas nps did the opposite meanwhile the denitrifiers accounted for 13 0 12 9 22 0 and 19 1 in the control nano micro and macro groups respectively which were about 10 fold more abundant than the nitrifiers fig 4d among them compared with the control group the relative abundance of thauera comamonas and zoogloea increased by 113 4 and 50 9 58 2 and 22 7 and 332 5 and 277 1 in mih and mah groups and slightly by 1 0 9 9 and 41 in nah group intriguingly although some denitrifiers i e denitratisoma aeromonas pseudomonas hyphomicrobium and rhodobacter decreased in relative abundance over time in all groups the decline happened clearly later when exposed to mps nps compared with the control group combined these findings indicated that mps with high concentration especially micro sized plastics may be beneficial to the growth of denitrifiers and further promote the transformation of no3 n and no2 n the relative abundance of desulfuromonas and anaerolinea as dissimilatory nitrogen reduction microorganisms showed decreasing abundance with the accumulation of mps nps especially desulfuromonas were 2 6 2 9 and 8 2 folds less abundant in the nah mih and mah groups respectively than in the control group fig 4e which might contribute to the lower nh4 n removal in the treatment wetland microcosms in addition both bradyrhizobium and mesorhizobium as nitrogen fixing microorganisms in cluster i decreased by 46 9 and 54 3 in mih and mah groups respectively but was elevated by 17 1 and 17 5 in nah group fig 4f compared with the control group which suggested that the nitrogen fixing microorganisms in cws might be gradually eliminated under exposure to mps yet nps could be beneficial to them in contrast to the abundant bacteria no significant difference in the abundance composition of archaea at phylum level was observed in nah t test p 0 27 mih t test p 0 077 and mah t test p 0 073 groups compared with the control group figure s6 interestingly nitrososphaeria as ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa showed plastic size differentiated distribution albeit comprising only 8 7 6 0 22 6 5 5 and 9 5 7 0 of the archaeal communities in mih p 0 05 mah p 0 01 and nah p 0 05 groups respectively figure s6 overall nitrososphaeria increased by 1 1 3 2 folds after 300 day exposure to mps nps which suggested that the accumulation of mps nps might promote the growth of aoa potentially beneficial to nh4 n transformation in the cws 3 5 plastic particles selected for divergence in the functional profiles of wetland microbiota microbial community functional potentials were predicted using picrust2 and the predicted profiles were compared among all groups the nearest sequenced taxon index nsti for the samples with high concentration treatment ranged from 0 110 to 0 281 table s5 which fell within the typical nsti value range 0 01 0 30 for microbiome and suggested moderate accuracies of fair function prediction langille et al 2013 as shown in fig 5 a in the second level pathways under metabolism the relative abundance of genes involved in energy metabolism kanehisa and goto 2000 decreased by 2 1 0 4 under 300 day exposure to mps nps compared with the control group the genes coding key enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism map00910 were comparatively analyzed at the third level of kegg pathway fig 5b which showed that relevant genes were the lowest in relative abundance in the mih group 0 60 followed by mah 0 72 and nah 0 67 groups all lower than the control group 0 86 p 0 05 fig 5b further examination of the key enzymatic genes identified by ec number catalyzing nitrogen removal processes showed that those genes coding enzymes ec 1 14 99 39 ec 1 7 2 6 ec 1 7 2 1 ec 1 7 2 4 ec 1 7 2 5 and ec 1 7 7 2 potentially contributing to nh4 n and no3 n no2 n removal processes were enriched in all treatment groups fig 5c specifically the denitrifying ec 1 7 2 1 ec 1 7 2 5 and ec 1 7 2 4 enzymatic genes showed a significant increase by 85 2 40 1 and 38 1 in the mih group p 0 05 fig 5c in contrast the dissimilatory nitrite reduction ec 1 7 2 2 and nitrogen fixation ec 1 18 6 1 enzymatic genes declined by 19 8 25 7 and 31 8 40 9 in mah and mih groups respectively combined these results suggested that the accumulation of mps might have a positive effect on the microbial denitrification process and adversely impact nitrogen fixation in wetland systems fig 1b and s2 4 discussion previous studies aimed to assess the response of microbial community to external contaminants were mostly limited to a vial and short term culture experiment and thus could not resolve the field patterns in this study by simulating the actual cws with prolonged operation time the succession of nitrogen transforming microbiota under the long term disturbance by mps nps accumulation underlying the responses of nitrogen transforming efficiency in cws was comprehensively disentangled during micro sized 100 nm φ 5 mm 50 100 μm and 500 1000 μm in this study plastics accumulating process whether the plastic particles themselves or they attached to the surface of original substrate becoming the carrier covered by microorganisms mps have the potential to change microbiota composition in wetland system fig 2 previous studies have reported that the surface of large sized plastic particles typically harbored microbiota with notably different composition from other environmental carriers featured by much lower microbial diversity michels et al 2018 generally the key driver in such changes of microbiota lies in the niche shift under deterministic intervention ofiteru et al 2010 mps with the large specific surface area and negative charges could be regarded as a deterministic intervention which preferentially adsorb substances with positive charges such as nh4 and k thus intensifying the deterministic intervention in our study it was likely that the abundant 20 mg l nh4 in the simulated runoff was absorbed on the surface of mps making it more conducive to the nitrifier growth in the biofilm possibly contributing to decrease in microbial diversity in wetland systems during mps accumulation nano sized φ 100 nm plastics were also reported to be capable of altering microbial community structure with different mechanisms from that of mps ma et al 2021 yang et al 2020b since the size of nps is much smaller than that of an individual microorganism they can attach to microbial cells or penetrate the cell membrane and enter the intracellular region like other metal nanoparticles tan et al 2020 yang et al 2020b nps persecute cell physiological activity in both cases and could selectively eliminate the sensitive microorganisms for example nitrifiers are generally more sensitive to environmental changes than denitrifiers avrahami et al 2003 szukics et al 2010 and are more vulnerable to the nps stress chen et al 2012 zheng et al 2011 which are consistent with our results of the suppression on nitrifiers in the nano group similarly seeley et al 2020 and yu et al 2021 by conducting sediment vial and soil pot experiments respectively found that mps nps could reduce microbial diversity and affect nitrogen transformation in addition many studies have focused on the influence of physicochemical properties of plastics on the microbial activity and the function and performance of natural and engineering systems for example the intervention mechanisms of dissolved organic matter precipitating from plastic aging and degradation were mainly attributed to the effect on microbial atp generation chen et al 2022 functional gene expression seeley et al 2020 enzymatic activity othman et al 2021 and so on therefore in the actual cw systems the mechanisms of mps nps affecting wetland microbiota and treatment performance are very complex generally it is challenging to predict how microorganisms co exist steadily over temporal gradients of environmental variables let alone the cooperative relationships within functional microbial communities under external intervention e g mps and nps ju and zhang 2015 in this study network analysis was employed to explore the co occurrence patterns of wetland microbiota and demonstrated that the accumulation of mps nps reshaped the microbial co occurrence patterns and enhanced small world properties considerably altering the microbial niches table 1 it has been reported for the sediment water interface of a coastal lagoon that bioplastic promoted a rapid and significant shift in benthic microbial diversity to a high cluster selecting for microbes that participate in plastic degradation and adapt to the intervened conditions by better cooperating with sulfate reducing microorganisms pinnell and turner 2019 similarly muthukrishnan et al 2019 found that plastic particles could reshape biofilm microbiota structure towards low cluster characteristic and promote biofouling degradation in the surrounding environment the accumulation of mps nps could impose selection pressure which promoted adaptive reconstruction of co occurrence patterns and established novel microbial interaction relationships under the new co occurrence network pattern the more intensive microbial co occurrence network provided a more convenient and effective interaction network relationships for metabolism signal exchange and electronic transport among microorganisms nemergut et al 2013 based on the reconstruction of complex co occurrence patterns the microbial community especially nitrogen transforming microorganisms in this study was more adaptable to the interference of environmental factors introduced by the long term accumulation of mps nps which was also more conducive for them to participate in the substance transformation reflected by the responses of nitrogen transforming efficiency in this study overall the accumulation of mps nps in wetland systems possibly enhanced interspecific interactions and created novel niches for nitrogen transforming microorganisms in cw biofilms under the 300 day mps nps intervention the microbiota composition in different treatment groups showed intriguing difference in succession patterns fig 4 we found that the biofilm microbiota in the control group followed a certain succession regularity which was broken by long term accumulation of mps nps fig 4a similar results were found by miao et al 2019 and wang et al 2020 that mps amendment significantly altered the microbiota succession pattern and elevated the turnover rate of community changes in the succession regularity of microbial community structure in temporal orbit reflected the resistance and elasticity to the filtrating of mps nps generally microorganisms will compete for resources during adaptation to environment which inevitably generate cooperative and competitive relations hibbing et al 2010 and the evolution of community is determined by the superiority li et al 2021 as mentioned above mps with large specific surface area can adsorb and enrich a variety of environmental substances providing a favorable habitat for certain microorganisms and nps can persecute microbial cells in both cases the long term accumulation of mps nps could enhance environmental selection pressure in wetland system magnifying intra specific and inter specific cooperation and competition and thus changed how community evolved in this study the accumulation of mps selectively retained some nitrogen transforming microorganisms i e nitrospira and nitrosomonas as nitrifiers thauera and dechloromonas as denitrification which underlined that larger sized plastic particles could play a role in the dynamic succession of nitrogen transforming microorganisms and their co occurrence with other populations in response to the accumulation of mps nps wetland biofilm microbiota showed shifted dynamic succession and co occurrence patterns which ultimately affected the microbial nitrogen transforming efficiency in this study we observed elevated relative abundance of certain nitrifiers nitrospira and nitrosomonas and denitrifiers thauera comamonas and aquabacterium with accumulation of mps and revealed by means of picrust2 analysis that functional genes related to denitrification were also significantly enriched in the mps groups however nitrification process was clearly impeded by the accumulation of mps nps and no significant variation in nitrate and nitrite transformation efficiency was observed fig 1 we speculated that the suppression on precursor reactions can mask the effect of small plastic particles on microbial denitrification efficiency isobe et al 2020 for example denitrifiers are inevitably limited by the substrate supply no3 produced by nitrifiers luizao et al 2004 by combining water chemistry monitoring microbial community profiling and functional prediction we comprehensively revealed the impact of mps nps on cws microbiota assembly and function it is worth mentioning that the functional prediction approach employed in this study based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence unlikely reflect the full spectrum of microbial functions due to its inherent limitations future efforts with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis could add to microbial genetic potential and activity insights into the ecological impact of mps nps 5 conclusion the accumulation of mps nps was demonstrated as a deterministic disturbance factor that drove the decrease in microbiota diversity and enriched certain functional microorganisms e g denitrifiers and nitrifiers in cws correlation based network analysis showed that the accumulation of mps nps had a significant impact on the microbial niche of wetland system diminished species segregation and intensified microbial co occurrence associations especially for nitrogen transforming microorganisms although the possibility could not be excluded that the decrease in nitrification efficiency can be attributed to other abiotic mechanisms the shift in microbiota composition co occurrence pattern and functioning definitely underlie the overall obstructive effect of mps nps on nitrification efficiency but not on denitrification except for long term nps accumulation our comprehensive investigation of the treatment performance and microbial mechanisms provides important insights into the ecotoxicological effects of small plastic particles in cws and how functional microbial communities cope with the long term environmental disturbance of plastic particles credit authorship contribution statement

15812,micro nano sized plastics mps nps existing in wastewater system are the potential threats to nitrogen n biotransformation constructed wetlands cws as wastewater treatment systems are considered the important barriers preventing mps nps from entering the open water however little is known about how the accumulation of mps nps affects microbial n transformation dynamics assembly and metabolism of wetland microbiota herein we constructed 12 wetland systems to address the above knowledge gaps over 300 day exposure to different sizes 3 mm 60 nm and concentrations 10 1000 μg l of mps nps the

groups without damage on the high removal efficiency of no3 n and no2 n 66 2 99 8 in all except for the nano sized plastic exposed wetlands moreover mps nps exposure induced shift in the strengths of non random species aggregation and segregation patterns co differentiated by the size and concentration of mps nps and mps nps accumulation created size differentiated alternative niches for nitrogen

the main sources of mps nps for aquatic ecosystems where constructed wetlands cws could serve as a vital blocker that traps the mps nps xia et al 2022 yang et al 2022 nevertheless little is known about the impact of mps nps accumulation on the ecological stability and treatment performance of cws cws are considered an important barrier to wastewater including rain runoff from farmland and road

the transformation of nitrogen pollutants ji et al 2022 ma et al 2018 microbial communities typically exhibit relatively stable community structure co occurrence pattern and succession rule which are the basis for functional stabilization of wetland systems sinsabaugh et al 2009 it is noted that microbiota in the biofilm covering mps structurally differs from other environmental carriers e g water

microbiota co occurrence pattern and system functioning despite the increasing concern of ecological toxicity of mps nps in cws ma et al 2021 yu et al 2022 how long term exposure to mps nps may influence the microbiota assembly and nitrogen transformation in cws remain unknown to fill the knowledge gaps we established 12 cw microcosms fed with simulated municipal wastewater by executing

when synthetic inflow was added the inlet water can be distributed through the holes on the riser wall so it can directly reach the substrate at both the bottom and top of cws simultaneously in addition as the risers were pre set also for substrate sampling we randomly chose one of the four water distributing risers each time when adding the synthetic inflow in order to avoid uneven distribution of mps nps across the cw microcosms we conducted the experiment for 300 days and collected water samples at the end of each batch from each microcosm at 20 cm depth chen et al 2014 for n

1 plastic particles accumulation impacted the nitrogen transformation efficiency to reveal the impact of mps nps accumulation on nitrogen transformation in cw microcosms we monitored the concentration of ammonia nh4 n and nitrate nitrite no3 n no2 n in effluent for 300 days as shown in fig 1 a and figure s2a c all cw microcosms exhibited a relatively high removal efficiency of nh4 n r nh4 67 6 12 2 in the first stage s1 r nh4 remained 66 5 9 2 and 68 7 10 6 respectively in mah and mih groups during the s2 but decreased to 52 7 9 6 and 37 6 13 3 from s3 to s4 with respect to the nano group r nh4 decreased to 31 6 9 5 in s2 and increased slightly to 39 9 6 4 in s3 and s4 fig 1 and figure s2a c in contrast the r no3 no2 kept within 66 2 99 8 in all wetland systems fig 1b and figure s2d f across the four stages overall all the mps nps groups showed a significantly adverse effect on the nh4 n transformation at medium or high concentrations p 0 001 but no significant negative effect on the no3 n no2 n transformation except for nps at high concentration for long term exposure fig 1a and figure s2 fluctuation of ph was measured for the cm microcosms during the first and last batches and was highly comparable in the high concentration treatments figure s3 which indicated that it was unlikely mps nps accumulation could have affected nitrogen removal efficiency by altering ph the divergent effect of mps nps on nh4 n and no3 n no2 n removal drove us to further question on the microbial dynamics and co occurrence patterns underlying the variation in nitrogen transformation in response to the accumulation of mps nps over time 3 2 plastic particles accumulation changed microbiota diversity microbiota structure clearly shifted in response to the accumulation of mps nps during the 300 day experiment fig 2 plastic size concentration and experimental stage all significantly affected the biofilm microbiota permanova p 0 001 table s2 while microbial community variance was explained most by exposure time r2 0 284 table s2 fig 2a and s3 followed by size r2 0 064 and concentration r2 0 054 bray curtis dissimilarity based clustering dendrogram separated the microbial communities to three main branches i ii and iii fig 2a and figure s4 reflecting the strong temporal variation in microbial community structure as mps nps accumulated this was accompanied by the decreasing chao1 richness and shannon diversity with time in the plastic treated wetlands irrespective of plastic size but not in the control wetland system figure s5a and s4b microbial communities exposed to different sizes of plastic particles appeared more distinct in medium and high concentration treatment groups according to bray curtis distance based nmds analysis fig 2b d the microbiota in the control group was most distant from those exposed to mps nps treatment of high concentration fig 2d especially with macro sized plastics in line with the significantly lower shannon diversity p 0 05 fig 2f of the mah group to summarize long term accumulation of the mps nps induced decreasing microbial richness and diversity and plastic size dependent effect was more apparent under high concentration 3 3 plastic size and concentration co regulated microbial co occurrence patterns 3 3 1 general co occurrence patterns to explore the biological processes and mechanisms through which mps nps exposure affects biofilm microbiota in cws we first used the c score analysis to measure the strength of overall species segregation in the plastic treated and control groups ju et al 2014 the microbiota exhibited an overall segregated species distribution as indicated by the significantly higher observed c scores compared with those expected by null models p 0 01 table s3 the same deterministic pattern was observed for the variances of c score cvar score that simultaneously checked the degrees of both species aggregation i e co occur more and segregation i e co occur less strongly suggesting non random microbiota assembly patterns moreover the standardized effect size ses of c score which enables cross group comparison in the strength of species segregation was remarkably higher for the control group 35 01 compared with the three high concentration 1000 μg l treatment groups regardless of size level 20 5 to 23 7 table s3 suggesting that exposure to excess mps nps led to decrease in the degree of species segregation in the wetland biofilm microbiota consistently species segregation stepwise decreased as manifested by decreasing ses of c score with increasing exposure concentration from 10 μg l 100 μg l to 1000 μg l in the nano and macro treatment groups it was noted that the mal group showed the highest ses values of both c score 92 8 and cvar score 77 0 which was also the only experimental group that showed both higher c score and higher cvar score than the control group implying exposure to low concentration 10 μg l of macro sized plastics 500 1000 μm largely promoted the strengths in the community aggregation and segregation patterns thus microbial co occurrence pattern these results together indicated that microbial co occurrence patterns especially species segregation were non random and co regulated by the size and concentration of plastic particles from microscale down to nanoscale 3 3 2 microbial co occurrence pattern enlightened by the overall nonrandom and plastic differentiated microbiota assembly patterns demonstrated in the wetland biofilms we further used co occurrence network analysis to explore the underlying microbial co occurrence patterns in all the plastic treatment groups and the control group topological analysis showed that all the wetland microbiota subnetworks not only exhibited modularity md 0 14 0 35 cluster coefficients cc 0 54 0 71 and average path lengths apl 2 83 6 16 higher than their respective erdös rényi random networks table 1 but also showed small world properties all σ 1 table 1 suggesting the role of non random microbial co occurrence patterns in the wetland microbiota assembly under exposure to plastic particles especially for the three high level treatment groups fig 3 their subnetworks contained 7618 nano 2069 micro and 6014 macro edges all of which were much higher than the subnetwork of the control group 999 edges among 262 nodes table 1 this pattern consisted with the comparative profile of the average degree in the following increasing order control 3 8 micro 5 9 macro 14 4 nano 17 2 groups reflecting mps nps introduction into the wetland systems promoted the frequency of microbial co occurrence associations further microbial co occurrence networks of the control and high level treatment groups were visually colored according to phylum a d modularity class e h and putative functionality i l of network nodes i e asvs fig 3 facilitating the linking of ecological niches of associated asvs as a proxy for species to their taxonomic and functional characteristics the significantly co occurring asvs were mostly affiliated with proteobacteria 19 2 63 4 chloroflexi 5 7 18 1 actinobacteria 0 7 35 9 firmicutes 0 8 10 1 acidobacteria 1 3 5 5 bacteroidetes 4 0 20 0 and nitrospirae 0 1 6 0 dataset s1 the frequency of co occurring asvs taxonomically assigned to proteobacteria increased from 76 in the subnetwork of the control group to 122 106 and 136 in treatment subnetworks of nah mih and mah respectively and a similar increasing trend was also found for actinobacteria firmicutes acidobacteria bacteroidetes and nitrospirae notably by 50 0 89 5 moreover the incidences of observed o and random r co occurrence between asvs showed that five groups of phyla i e actinobacteria rokubacteria nitrospirae gemmatimonadetes nitrospirae armatimonadetes proteobacteria armatimonadetes and chloroflexi armatimonadetes tended to significantly co occur more often than expected by chance i e o r ratio 2 0 and o or r 0 5 dataset s1 especially in the mah subnetworks where they showed an o r ratio of 2 56 2 42 2 42 2 56 and 2 02 respectively to visually explore ecological niches of co occurring asvs and link them to their functionality the subnetworks were topologically partitioned into 8 major modules i e discreate ecological niches each comprising a group of asvs that interconnected more frequently among themselves than with asvs in other modules fig 3e h overall the subnetworks of treatment groups were different in modularity 0 144 to 0 351 module size and module complexity fig 3f h and clearly distinct from the subnetwork of the control group fig 3e revealing mps nps exposure induced size differentiated niche patterns in cws for instance thauera and methylocystis as denitrifiers dataset s2 belonging to proteobacteria were mainly in module i and ii of the control group while in treatment groups most denitrifiers existed in modules i and iii macro and nano groups and modules iv and v micro group respectively fig 3i l microorganisms mostly belonged to planctomycetes genus blastopirellula assimilatory nitrogen reduction and proteobacteria genus desulfobulbus dissimilatory nitrogen reduction dataset s2 involved in assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrogen reduction processes were mainly gathered in module ii of all treatment groups and in module iii of the control group surprisingly anammox bacteria chloroflexi and planctomycetes at phylum level appeared in the treatment subnetworks and with highest proportion 0 72 in macro group followed by micro group 0 57 and nano group 0 23 table s4 the above results suggested that the accumulation of mps nps changed the co occurrence patterns and provided more alternative niches for nitrogen transforming microorganisms 3 4 plastic particles altered the dynamic succession of microbial community with the accumulation of mps nps dynamics of the top 51 abundant microbial genera in wetland microcosms was characterized by two types of trends decreasing cluster i and increasing cluster ii during the 300 day operation fig 4 a the average relative abundance of nitrifiers in the control nano micro and macro groups were 1 2 0 7 1 2 and 2 1 respectively fig 4c of which nitrosomonas as ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob decreased by 34 5 in nano group while nitrospira as nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob increased in the relative abundance in both mih 1 04 folds and mah 2 91 folds groups fig 4b compared with the control group these results implied that 300 day accumulation of larger sized plastics potentially benefited nitrifiers in wetland system whereas nps did the opposite meanwhile the denitrifiers accounted for 13 0 12 9 22 0 and 19 1 in the control nano micro and macro groups respectively which were about 10 fold more abundant than the nitrifiers fig 4d among them compared with the control group the relative abundance of thauera comamonas and zoogloea increased by 113 4 and 50 9 58 2 and 22 7 and 332 5 and 277 1 in mih and mah groups and slightly by 1 0 9 9 and 41 in nah group intriguingly although some denitrifiers i e denitratisoma aeromonas pseudomonas hyphomicrobium and rhodobacter decreased in relative abundance over time in all groups the decline happened clearly later when exposed to mps nps compared with the control group combined these findings indicated that mps with high concentration especially micro sized plastics may be beneficial to the growth of denitrifiers and further promote the transformation of no3 n and no2 n the relative abundance of desulfuromonas and anaerolinea as dissimilatory nitrogen reduction microorganisms showed decreasing abundance with the accumulation of mps nps especially desulfuromonas were 2 6 2 9 and 8 2 folds less abundant in the nah mih and mah groups respectively than in the control group fig 4e which might contribute to the lower nh4 n removal in the treatment wetland microcosms in addition both bradyrhizobium and mesorhizobium as nitrogen fixing microorganisms in cluster i decreased by 46 9 and 54 3 in mih and mah groups respectively but was elevated by 17 1 and 17 5 in nah group fig 4f compared with the control group which suggested that the nitrogen fixing microorganisms in cws might be gradually eliminated under exposure to mps yet nps could be beneficial to them in contrast to the abundant bacteria no significant difference in the abundance composition of archaea at phylum level was observed in nah t test p 0 27 mih t test p 0 077 and mah t test p 0 073 groups compared with the control group figure s6 interestingly nitrososphaeria as ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa showed plastic size differentiated distribution albeit comprising only 8 7 6 0 22 6 5 5 and 9 5 7 0 of the archaeal communities in mih p 0 05 mah p 0 01 and nah p 0 05 groups respectively figure s6 overall nitrososphaeria increased by 1 1 3 2 folds after 300 day exposure to mps nps which suggested that the accumulation of mps nps might promote the growth of aoa potentially beneficial to nh4 n transformation in the cws 3 5 plastic particles selected for divergence in the functional profiles of wetland microbiota microbial community functional potentials were predicted using picrust2 and the predicted profiles were compared among all groups the nearest sequenced taxon index nsti for the samples with high concentration treatment ranged from 0 110 to 0 281 table s5 which fell within the typical nsti value range 0 01 0 30 for microbiome and suggested moderate accuracies of fair function prediction langille et al 2013 as shown in fig 5 a in the second level pathways under metabolism the relative abundance of genes involved in energy metabolism kanehisa and goto 2000 decreased by 2 1 0 4 under 300 day exposure to mps nps compared with the control group the genes coding key enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism map00910 were comparatively analyzed at the third level of kegg pathway fig 5b which showed that relevant genes were the lowest in relative abundance in the mih group 0 60 followed by mah 0 72 and nah 0 67 groups all lower than the control group 0 86 p 0 05 fig 5b further examination of the key enzymatic genes identified by ec number catalyzing nitrogen removal processes showed that those genes coding enzymes ec 1 14 99 39 ec 1 7 2 6 ec 1 7 2 1 ec 1 7 2 4 ec 1 7 2 5 and ec 1 7 7 2 potentially contributing to nh4 n and no3 n no2 n removal processes were enriched in all treatment groups fig 5c specifically the denitrifying ec 1 7 2 1 ec 1 7 2 5 and ec 1 7 2 4 enzymatic genes showed a significant increase by 85 2 40 1 and 38 1 in the mih group p 0 05 fig 5c in contrast the dissimilatory nitrite reduction ec 1 7 2 2 and nitrogen fixation ec 1 18 6 1 enzymatic genes declined by 19 8 25 7 and 31 8 40 9 in mah and mih groups respectively combined these results suggested that the accumulation of mps might have a positive effect on the microbial denitrification process and adversely impact nitrogen fixation in wetland systems fig 1b and s2 4 discussion previous studies aimed to assess the response of microbial community to external contaminants were mostly limited to a vial and short term culture experiment and thus could not resolve the field patterns in this study by simulating the actual cws with prolonged operation time the succession of nitrogen transforming microbiota under the long term disturbance by mps nps accumulation underlying the responses of nitrogen transforming efficiency in cws was comprehensively disentangled during micro sized 100 nm φ 5 mm 50 100 μm and 500 1000 μm in this study plastics accumulating process whether the plastic particles themselves or they attached to the surface of original substrate becoming the carrier covered by microorganisms mps have the potential to change microbiota composition in wetland system fig 2 previous studies have reported that the surface of large sized plastic particles typically harbored microbiota with notably different composition from other environmental carriers featured by much lower microbial diversity michels et al 2018 generally the key driver in such changes of microbiota lies in the niche shift under deterministic intervention ofiteru et al 2010 mps with the large specific surface area and negative charges could be regarded as a deterministic intervention which preferentially adsorb substances with positive charges such as nh4 and k thus intensifying the deterministic intervention in our study it was likely that the abundant 20 mg l nh4 in the simulated runoff was absorbed on the surface of mps making it more conducive to the nitrifier growth in the biofilm possibly contributing to decrease in microbial diversity in wetland systems during mps accumulation nano sized φ 100 nm plastics were also reported to be capable of altering microbial community structure with different mechanisms from that of mps ma et al 2021 yang et al 2020b since the size of nps is much smaller than that of an individual microorganism they can attach to microbial cells or penetrate the cell membrane and enter the intracellular region like other metal nanoparticles tan et al 2020 yang et al 2020b nps persecute cell physiological activity in both cases and could selectively eliminate the sensitive microorganisms for example nitrifiers are generally more sensitive to environmental changes than denitrifiers avrahami et al 2003 szukics et al 2010 and are more vulnerable to the nps stress chen et al 2012 zheng et al 2011 which are consistent with our results of the suppression on nitrifiers in the nano group similarly seeley et al 2020 and yu et al 2021 by conducting sediment vial and soil pot experiments respectively found that mps nps could reduce microbial diversity and affect nitrogen transformation in addition many studies have focused on the influence of physicochemical properties of plastics on the microbial activity and the function and performance of natural and engineering systems for example the intervention mechanisms of dissolved organic matter precipitating from plastic aging and degradation were mainly attributed to the effect on microbial atp generation chen et al 2022 functional gene expression seeley et al 2020 enzymatic activity othman et al 2021 and so on therefore in the actual cw systems the mechanisms of mps nps affecting wetland microbiota and treatment performance are very complex generally it is challenging to predict how microorganisms co exist steadily over temporal gradients of environmental variables let alone the cooperative relationships within functional microbial communities under external intervention e g mps and nps ju and zhang 2015 in this study network analysis was employed to explore the co occurrence patterns of wetland microbiota and demonstrated that the accumulation of mps nps reshaped the microbial co occurrence patterns and enhanced small world properties considerably altering the microbial niches table 1 it has been reported for the sediment water interface of a coastal lagoon that bioplastic promoted a rapid and significant shift in benthic microbial diversity to a high cluster selecting for microbes that participate in plastic degradation and adapt to the intervened conditions by better cooperating with sulfate reducing microorganisms pinnell and turner 2019 similarly muthukrishnan et al 2019 found that plastic particles could reshape biofilm microbiota structure towards low cluster characteristic and promote biofouling degradation in the surrounding environment the accumulation of mps nps could impose selection pressure which promoted adaptive reconstruction of co occurrence patterns and established novel microbial interaction relationships under the new co occurrence network pattern the more intensive microbial co occurrence network provided a more convenient and effective interaction network relationships for metabolism signal exchange and electronic transport among microorganisms nemergut et al 2013 based on the reconstruction of complex co occurrence patterns the microbial community especially nitrogen transforming microorganisms in this study was more adaptable to the interference of environmental factors introduced by the long term accumulation of mps nps which was also more conducive for them to participate in the substance transformation reflected by the responses of nitrogen transforming efficiency in this study overall the accumulation of mps nps in wetland systems possibly enhanced interspecific interactions and created novel niches for nitrogen transforming microorganisms in cw biofilms under the 300 day mps nps intervention the microbiota composition in different treatment groups showed intriguing difference in succession patterns fig 4 we found that the biofilm microbiota in the control group followed a certain succession regularity which was broken by long term accumulation of mps nps fig 4a similar results were found by miao et al 2019 and wang et al 2020 that mps amendment significantly altered the microbiota succession pattern and elevated the turnover rate of community changes in the succession regularity of microbial community structure in temporal orbit reflected the resistance and elasticity to the filtrating of mps nps generally microorganisms will compete for resources during adaptation to environment which inevitably generate cooperative and competitive relations hibbing et al 2010 and the evolution of community is determined by the superiority li et al 2021 as mentioned above mps with large specific surface area can adsorb and enrich a variety of environmental substances providing a favorable habitat for certain microorganisms and nps can persecute microbial cells in both cases the long term accumulation of mps nps could enhance environmental selection pressure in wetland system magnifying intra specific and inter specific cooperation and competition and thus changed how community evolved in this study the accumulation of mps selectively retained some nitrogen transforming microorganisms i e nitrospira and nitrosomonas as nitrifiers thauera and dechloromonas as denitrification which underlined that larger sized plastic particles could play a role in the dynamic succession of nitrogen transforming microorganisms and their co occurrence with other populations in response to the accumulation of mps nps wetland biofilm microbiota showed shifted dynamic succession and co occurrence patterns which ultimately affected the microbial nitrogen transforming efficiency in this study we observed elevated relative abundance of certain nitrifiers nitrospira and nitrosomonas and denitrifiers thauera comamonas and aquabacterium with accumulation of mps and revealed by means of picrust2 analysis that functional genes related to denitrification were also significantly enriched in the mps groups however nitrification process was clearly impeded by the accumulation of mps nps and no significant variation in nitrate and nitrite transformation efficiency was observed fig 1 we speculated that the suppression on precursor reactions can mask the effect of small plastic particles on microbial denitrification efficiency isobe et al 2020 for example denitrifiers are inevitably limited by the substrate supply no3 produced by nitrifiers luizao et al 2004 by combining water chemistry monitoring microbial community profiling and functional prediction we comprehensively revealed the impact of mps nps on cws microbiota assembly and function it is worth mentioning that the functional prediction approach employed in this study based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence unlikely reflect the full spectrum of microbial functions due to its inherent limitations future efforts with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis could add to microbial genetic potential and activity insights into the ecological impact of mps nps 5 conclusion the accumulation of mps nps was demonstrated as a deterministic disturbance factor that drove the decrease in microbiota diversity and enriched certain functional microorganisms e g denitrifiers and nitrifiers in cws correlation based network analysis showed that the accumulation of mps nps had a significant impact on the microbial niche of wetland system diminished species segregation and intensified microbial co occurrence associations especially for nitrogen transforming microorganisms although the possibility could not be excluded that the decrease in nitrification efficiency can be attributed to other abiotic mechanisms the shift in microbiota composition co occurrence pattern and functioning definitely underlie the overall obstructive effect of mps nps on nitrification efficiency but not on denitrification except for long term nps accumulation our comprehensive investigation of the treatment performance and microbial mechanisms provides important insights into the ecotoxicological effects of small plastic particles in cws and how functional microbial communities cope with the long term environmental disturbance of plastic particles credit authorship contribution statement

15813,cd rich wastes from open pit mining can be transported into rivers which are often followed by deposition in river sediments and or further transfer into agricultural soils the lithology of bedrock exerts a huge effect on physicochemical properties e g buffering capacities metal species mineral phases etc of the river system thereby potentially impacting the cd mobility in watersheds however to date little is known about the microscopic processes e g dissolution adsorption and precipitation controlling the migration of cd from mines to varied watersheds this study therefore aims to determine the controlling factors on cd mobilization in two mining impacted watersheds with contrasting bedrock lithology using both cd and pb isotopes the pb isotope ratios of sediments and soils in both watersheds fall into a binary mixing model with two isotopically distinct sources i e mining wastes and bedrock these results indicate that mining activities are the main sources of cd in sediments and soils however the cd isotope ratios reveal different cd migration processes between the two watersheds in the siliceous watershed the δ114 110cd values of sediments decrease from 0 116 in the upper reach to 0 712 in the lower reach with a concomitant increase in cd concentration which may result from cd adsorption by goethite due to the increased ph in contrast in the calcareous watershed the cd isotope compositions of sediments 0 345 to 0 276 and the ph of river water are nearly invariable suggesting that the adsorption and release of cd in sediments are limited this may result from the strong ph buffering effect due to the presence of carbonate rocks this study highlights the different fates of cd in siliceous and calcareous watersheds and suggests that the development of cd pollution control policies must consider regional lithology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cd isotopes source tracing migration processes mining affected

wastes including acid mine drainages amd tailings slags and dusts e g wen et al 2015 it has been estimated that mining activities contribute approximately 0 01 to 3 9 tons of cd to global surface runoff each year nriagu and pacyna 1988 these mining wastes may be transported into rivers followed by deposition in sediments which serve as both sinks and sources for cd in water bodies thereby posing potential risks to water and soil securities e g liao et al 2017 consequently deciphering the mobilization of cd from mines to ambient watersheds is of significance to restrain the sources and processes of cd pollution conventional approaches to explore the migration and transformation of heavy metals in watersheds usually rely on bulk concentrations and chemical fractions e g qin et al 2021 wu et al 2020 however this traditional approach often has difficulty in accurately deciphering geochemical processes particularly at the interface between solid and liquid phases the total

shown to serve as powerful tools to trace the sources and biogeochemical processes of heavy metals in environments e g wiederhold 2015 this is primarily because compared with conventional approaches

adsorbed onto fe mn oxyhydroxides wasylenki et al 2014 yan et al 2021 and humic acid ratie et al 2021 and coprecipitated into sulfide guinoiseau et al 2018 and calcite horner et al 2011 xie et al 2021 thus the aqueous phases are in most cases enriched in heavier cd isotopes than solid phases this has been ascribed to the shorter cd o bond lengths for aqueous cd species than for most secondary minerals gao et al 2021 in contrast a recent study showed that heavy cd isotopes are preferentially incorporated into goethite by substituting lattice fe owing mostly to the enrichment of heavy cd isotopes in cd hydroxides yan et al 2021 moreover a few studies have also investigated the behavior of cd in watersheds e g yang et al 2019 wen et al 2015 for example yang et al 2019 observed that rivers draining sulfide mining areas have higher δ114 110cd values than mine tailings and ore minerals and explained this by the rapid dissolution of ore tailings however it is expected that some differences in cd isotope fractionation may exist in watersheds due to diverse microscopic geochemical processes that can mobilize cd the lithology of bedrock can also be an important factor impacting the mobilization of cd in both river and soil systems in particular rivers draining siliceous and calcareous rocks are often characterized by different physicochemical properties e g qin et al 2021 yang et al 2019 for example it has been suggested that in carbonate dominated regions the coexistence of dissolved co2 with carbonate minerals can result in high and stable ph in river waters e g sherlock et al 1995 this alkaline environment is conducive to the adsorption of cd onto secondary minerals or precipitation of cd rich carbonates in sediments e g wu et al 2020 which thus restricts the migration of cd in rivers in contrast this restriction usually does not work in regions dominantly covered with siliceous rocks due to their limited buffering capacity sherlock et al 1995 however few studies have focused on how geochemical processes including dissolution adsorption and precipitation may affect the mobility and isotope fractionation of cd from mines to varied watersheds in this study we collected and studied samples from two watersheds affected by mining activities one of them was developed in a basin with siliceous bedrock dabaoshan and the other was developed in a basin with calcareous bedrock niujiaotang in south china river water sediment soil and mining waste including amd amd precipitate tailings and mining dust were systematically sampled for cd isotope analyses given that pb isotopes are not fractionated during biogeochemical processes e g cheng and hu 2010 the pb isotope ratios were also measured here for source tracing our work aims to identify the source of cd in rivers and soil and to investigate and compare factors controlling the behavior of cd from mines to ambient watersheds our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cd behavior in mining affected watersheds with different lithologies and eventually to improved strategies for cd pollution control 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection dabaoshan dbs is located in guangdong province southern china 113 43 13 e 24 31 36 n and is characterized by subtropical latosol and influenced by a subtropical monsoon climate the bedrock under the soil is mostly sandstone which is mainly composed of quartz 84 wt muscovite 4 wt and phengite 12 wt liu et al 2020 the dbs mine is a large scale polymetallic sulfide deposit with main ore minerals of pyrite chalcopyrite pyrrhotite sphalerite and galena ye et al 2014 after being smashed by crushers ores were separated from rocks by flotation due to 60 years of mining activity a large quantity of amd and amd precipitates including both ore rock particles and hydrogenous minerals precipitated out of amd are stored in the liwu dam and then discharged into the hengshi hs river fig 1 a river water

amount of dust was generated during ore smashing and the flotation effluent was directly discharged into the fanjia fj river details for sampling and treatment prior to chemical analyses were elaborated in xia et al 2020 because the mining duration in this region 20 years is shorter than that in the dbs mine the mining affected scale is relatively small and sampling was conducted within 3 km along the fj river from the mining area briefly river water sediment and soil samples were collected from six sampling sites along the fj river fig 1b two background soils were collected from the

concentrations ranging from 1936 to 3394 mg kg 1 and the sulfide ore has pb concentrations of 2666 mg kg 1 table s5 the 206pb 207pb ratios of the sediment and topsoil range between 1 1863 and 1 1900 and between 1 1863 and 1 1899 respectively which are slightly higher than those of the sulfide ore 1 1860 and amd precipitate 1 1861 to 1 1863 a higher 206pb 207pb ratio is found in the bedrock sample 1 2523 table s5 4 3 cd and pb concentrations and isotope compositions of samples from njt the cd concentrations of the sulfide ore mine tailings and mining dust from njt are 1025 mg kg 1 316 mg kg 1 and 387 mg kg 1 respectively the river water has a low cd concentration even below the detection limit 0 06 μg l 1 for our instrument the cd concentration of the sediment varies from 4 14 to 100 mg kg

dust fig 2b the δ114 110cd value of the topsoil ranges from 0 519 to 0 267 and is slightly lower than that of the sediment fig 2b the background soil has a low δ114 110cd value ranging from 0 524 to 0

our selective leaching experiments show that cd in the sediment and topsoil from dbs is largely concentrated in the exchangeable fraction 33 73 for the sediment and 23 55 for the topsoil fig s2a s2b while cd in the sediment and topsoil from njt is generally associated with carbonates 57 77 for sediments and 19 63 for topsoils fig s2c s2d 5 discussion 5 1 pb isotope tracing because radiogenic pb isotopes are not fractionated during biogeochemical processes e g cheng and hu 2010 pb isotope ratios can provide accurate information about pollution sources the pb isotope ratios of most sediments and topsoils from the dbs watershed fall on a binary mixing line with two isotopically distinct endmembers i e ore rocks and background soil fig 3 b some samples of amd precipitates sediments and topsoils are close to ore samples indicating that they are strongly influenced by pb pollution from the ore compared with the bulk silicate bedrock in this area 208pb 206pb 2 0768 206pb 207pb 1 2523 even the background soil 208pb 206pb 2 0843 206pb 207pb 1 1928 might have been polluted by ore rocks however amd some sediments topsoils and bulk silicate bedrock are not on the mixing line fig 3a these deviations from the mixing line which are larger than the analytical uncertainty 2sd 0 00008 for 208pb 206pb and 0 00004 for 206pb 207pb suggest the presence of other pb sources indeed sediments bedrocks and topsoils at dbs consist of serval minerals that have different affinities to th and u e g riffel et al 2016 basak and martin 2013 and some differences in mineral mode exist among these samples table s3 thus the deviations can be understood if the silicate bedrock is non homogeneous and leaching the portion of silicates having higher 208pb 206pb and low 206pb 207pb values would make the pb isotope ratio of the residual soil sitting below the mixing line correspondingly amd that leaches through silicates in addition to ore rocks would have a higher 208pb 206pb ratio than ore rocks and sit above the mixing line moreover sediment samples dc 6 and dc 12 fall above and below the mixing line respectively fig 3b which is also consistent with the non homogeneity of sediments table s3 topsoil samples ds 6 and ds 12 fall above the mixing line which may be affected by the input of amd chen et al 2018 qu et al 2017 or heterogeneous mineral composition in soils kong et al 2018 wen et al 2020 fig 3b amd precipitates and ore rocks are on the mixing line and have similar pb isotope ratios indicating that the majority of pb in the amd precipitates is not from amd but from residual ore our measured pb isotope ratio of the fertilizer has extreme values 208pb 206pb 1 9612 and 206pb 207pb 1 2472 and lies below the mixing line thus its effect is much smaller than the pollution from ore rocks for some sediments and topsoils from the njt their pb isotope ratios sit on the mixing line of sulfide ore rock and background soil fig 3c mining dust and sulfide ore rocks have similar pb isotope signatures but mining dust may pollute ambient environments more easily however some topsoils river sediments mine tailings and bedrock have pb isotopes lying below the mixing line fig 3c this occurs because the bedrock is largely composed of carbonates which contain more u than th and contribute to lower 208pb 206pb ratios than silicate rocks basak and martin 2013 wen et al 2020 the background soil contains a tiny fraction of carbonate however some topsoils and river sediments contain significant amounts of dolomite and the mine tailings are a mixture of dolomite and sphalerite table s4 thus the pb isotope ratios of all studied samples can be explained by the mixing of sulfide ore rocks the silicate fraction of ambient rocks i e background soil and the carbonate fraction of the ambient rock i e bedrock the mine tailing can be considered as a mixture of bedrock and mining dust fig 3d again the extreme pb isotope ratio of the fertilizer suggests its limited contribution fig 3b 5 2 sources of cd in sediment and soil since both cd and pb are chalcophile elements with similar geochemical properties cd is usually accompanied by pb in sulfide polluted media e g huang et al 2020 he et al 2019 indeed in the present study the concentrations of cd and pb in topsoils show a significant positive correlation in both watersheds fig 4 a b suggesting similar sources of cd and pb in topsoils however cd and pb concentrations in sediments are decoupled fig 4a b especially in dbs implying that cd and pb behave differently in these samples cd isotopes can be used to investigate the origin of the difference given the evident difference in the cd isotope composition among the sulfide ore rock mining waste and background soil fig 4c d the cd isotope compositions of the sediment and soil samples may also reflect mixing processes of various sources for most topsoil and some sediment samples from dbs binary mixing relationships can be found in both δ114 110cd 1 cd i e inverse concentration and δ114 110cd 206pb 207pb diagrams where amd precipitates and background soil are defined as the two end members fig 4c d this is consistent with the conclusion drawn based on pb isotopes discussed in section 5 1 moreover sediment samples close to the mining area including dc 5 dc 6 and dc 8 have cd isotope compositions 0 183 to 0 116 similar to that of the amd precipitate 0 186 to 0 030 suggesting that amd precipitates are also the main cd source to river sediments however this mixing relationship cannot be used to explain the differences in δ114 110cd values among the sulfide ore rock amd and amd precipitates and δ114 110cd values of some sediments located in the lower reach e g dc 11 and dc 13 which may be related to the post depositional processes in the river system discussed in section 5 3 and section 5 4 in comparison the cd and pb isotope ratios appear to show slightly different mixing endmembers for sediments and topsoils from njt fig 4e f in the δ114 110cd 1 cd plot fig 4e and δ114 110cd 206pb 207pb diagram fig 4f sediments and topsoils can be circumscribed by three end members mining dust mine tailing and background soil this agrees with the tracing result from the 206pb 207pb 208pb 206pb diagram fig 3c d however sulfide has a distinctly different δ114 110cd value from that of mine tailings or mining dust which could originate from cd isotope fractionation during leaching processes discussed in section 5 3 moreover the difference 0 320 between the δ114 110cd value of sulfide ore from dbs and that from njt is likely caused by the difference in mineral composition if carbonate and sulfide minerals are characterized by different cd isotope signals the sulfide ores in njt contain a large amount of carbonate 85 2 wt while those in dbs mainly consist of sulfide minerals e g pyrite 5 3 cd isotope fractionation in mining wastes previous studies have shown that cd isotopes can be highly fractionated due to leaching zhang et al 2016 adsorption onto minerals yan et al 2021 wasylenki et al 2014 and coprecipitation into minerals yan et al 2021 although this fractionation could complicate the source determination using only cd isotopes it can help to elucidate geochemical processes that pb isotopes are not able to detect in dbs the amd precipitate and sulfide ore have similar pb isotope ratios but the δ114 110cd value of the amd precipitate is significantly lower than that of the sulfide ore δ114 110cdore amd precipitate 0 241 to 0 397 similarly the δ114 110cd value of the mining dust from the njt is significantly lower than that of the sulfide ore δ114 110cdore mining dust 0 170 although mining dust and sulfide ore have similar pb isotope ratios because the original sulfide ore rocks were washed first after being mined these discrepancies between the δ114 110cd values of amd precipitate mining dust and ores can be explained by the leaching of cd the leaching experiment conducted by zhang et al 2016 showed that isotopically heavy cd is preferentially released into liquid phases additionally the cd concentration of amd precipitate and mining dust is much lower than that of sulfide ore table s5 s6 these results suggest that ore washing may lead to a significant removal of cd in ores and therefore the enrichment of light cd isotopes in ore residues the δ114 110cd values of amd 0 077 to 0 131 in dbs are lower than those of sulfide ores 0 211 0 042 this observation contrasts with the result of the leaching experiment that heavy cd is preferentially released into the aqueous solution zhang et al 2016 this observation is also inconsistent with the cd adsorption on fe oxyhydr oxides based on xrd the amd precipitate contains a significant amount of fe oxyhydr oxides e g goethite table s3 amd is a sulfuric acid rich solution with ph 2 5 table s5 boily et al 2005 found that little dissolved cd could be adsorbed by goethite at ph 5 0 so cd adsorption onto fe oxyhydr oxides could be limited in the tailings dam even if adsorption occurs lighter cd isotopes are preferentially adsorbed onto solid phases yan et al 2021 thereby elevating the δ114 110cd value of amd rather than decreasing it alternatively the dissolved cd in the amd may migrate into the amd precipitates through coprecipitation with fe oxyhydr oxides which widely exist in an amd pool e g chen et al 2018 it is suggested that cd incorporation into goethite by substitution for lattice fe prefers heavy cd isotopes due to the release and reprecipitation of isotopically heavy cd during the transformation of ferrihydrite to goethite yan et al 2021 therefore isotopically heavy cd in amd may preferentially coprecipitate with fe oxyhydr oxides resulting in light isotope enrichment in amd fig 4c the other plausible explanation which is also consistent with the pb isotope results of amd is that leachates from both ore rocks and silicates contribute to amd the pb isotope ratios of amd suggest that amd receives the contribution of both ore rocks and silicates which pulled amd slightly above the mixing line fig 3b discussed in section 5 1 because silicate rocks have lower δ114 110cd values e g δ114 110cdbedrock 0 265 0 008 the leachate from leaching silicates would have a δ114 110cd value higher than silicates but lower than ore rocks moreover the pb isotope ratio of the mine tailings suggests that both sulfide ore and carbonate bedrock have a significant contribution to the mine tailing in the njt while the δ114 110cd value of mine tailings is significantly lower than that of the ore δ114 110cdore tailing 0 324 and bedrock δ114 110cdbedrock tailing 0 200 leaching of sulfide ore rock therefore is necessary to explain the lower δ114 110cdmine tailing similar to mine dust in njt or amd precipitates in dbs besides heavy cd isotopes are preferentially leached out from limestone imseng et al 2018 which may lead to the cd isotope composition of mine tailings being lower than that of bedrock overall both processes are required to explain the cd and pb isotope ratios of mine tailings in the njt 5 4 cd isotope fractionation in the rivers the cd isotope compositions of sediments show distinctly different variations between the two watersheds fig 2 in dbs the river sediments 0 183 to 0 116 and water 0 175 0 010 from the first 10 km of the hs river have cd isotope compositions similar to those of amd precipitates average δ114 110cd of 0 098 0 105 2sd and amd average δ114 110cd of 0 109 0 037 2sd respectively fig 2a these results appear to suggest that the mining waste after being discharged from the tailings dam is transported along the hs river followed by deposition in sediments it is worth noting that the cd concentration of sediments gradually increases during the first 10 km of the hs river fig s1 the slope rate of the riverbed declines in this stretch of the hs river which leads to the high level of settling of mining waste particles chen et al 2018 after 10 km from the mining site the cd isotope compositions of sediments in the hs river decrease fig 2a while the pb isotope ratios of sediments vary only slightly table s5 these observations indicate that the adsorption and or coprecipitation of cd onto into sediments most likely goethite based on xrd table s3 may occur during cd transportation in rivers which may fractionate cd isotopes yan et al 2021 suggested that the coprecipitation of cd into fe oxyhydr oxides preferentially takes up isotopically heavy cd which contrasts with the decreased δ114 110cd of sediments from the upper to lower reach fig 2a this implies that the possible coprecipitation of goethite has limited effects on cd isotope fractionation instead it is more likely that these changes in δ114 110cd of sediments originate primarily from the enhanced adsorption of cd onto goethite as the ph value of river water increases due to dilution and silicate buffering effects yang et al 2019 a pioneering study has shown that cd adsorption on fe oxyhydr oxides prefers light cd isotopes and that the adsorption capacity increases dramatically as the ph increases from 6 0 to 8 0 yan et al 2021 as such some cd may be adsorbed onto fe oxyhydr oxides in sediments due to the increased river ph 6 4 to 8 1 fig s3a previous studies have shown that the adsorbed cd is mainly transformed into the exchangeable form fan et al 2007 and this cd fraction often enriches light isotopes zhong et al 2021 therefore the positive correlation between the river ph and the amount of exchangeable cd in sediments proves that the increased ph causes more adsorbed cd which thus results in the decreased δ114 110cd value of sediments along the hs river fig 5 a in contrast the cd isotope compositions of sediments in the njt are nearly invariable along the fj river fig 2b which is likely caused by the low dissolution rate of carbonates in an alkaline environment high and stable ph values are observed in fj river water which may be the result of the powerful acid buffering potential of calcareous rocks fig s3b e g raymond et al 2009 c a x m g 1 x c o 3 2 2 h 2 h c o 3 1 x m g x 2 x c a 2 carbonates may neutralize acid from mine drainage and produce bicarbonate to maintain the high ph of river water which has also been observed in other carbonate dominated watersheds e g mayo et al 2000 qin et al 2021 alkaline conditions can inhibit the dissolution of carbonates pokrovsky et al 1999 the dominant fraction of sediments from njt according to the selective sequential extraction result fig s3d however a high ph may enhance the adsorption and or precipitation of dissolved cd e g wu et al 2020 which can produce cd isotope fractionation e g wasylenki et al 2014 yan et al 2021 the river water shows extremely low cd concentrations which are even below the detection limit table s6 suggesting that most dissolved cd has been adsorbed or precipitated before being discharged into rivers as a result river water may only contribute little dissolved cd to sediments and consequently may have a limited effect on the cd isotope composition of sediment 6 conclusions and implications based on the cd isotope compositions of river water sediments soils bedrock and mining wastes developed in siliceous dbs and calcareous njt basins this study unravels the mechanisms controlling cd mobility and cd isotope fractionation from the mine to ambient watersheds our results show that mining activities are the main supplier of cd in river soil systems around both mining areas whereas the extent and level of cd pollution are very different in dbs the decrease in δ114 110cd in sediments indicates the enhanced adsorption of cd by fe oxides in the river due to the elevated ph in the njt watershed the invariable δ114 110cd values of sediments suggest that the adsorption and release of cd in sediments are limited because of the high and stable ph caused by the carbonate buffer in this way to limit cd migration developing different policies in siliceous and calcareous watersheds is crucial for a siliceous watershed it is necessary to restrain the release of adsorbed cd in sediments by increasing the river ph through limestone or hydrated lime luo et al 2020 in a calcareous watershed the acidity produced by sulfide mineral oxidation can be partially or completely offset by carbonate rock resulting in neutral or weakly alkaline mine water sherlock et al 1995 therefore natural geochemical processes for acid neutralization and precipitation adsorption of metals may be an economical way to prevent amd in a calcareous watershed in addition this study also shows the different cd isotope fractionation mechanisms in the two watersheds therefore the influence of lithology needs to be taken into account and interpreted with caution before using the cd isotope tool for tracing pollution for example combining pb isotopes may improve the accuracy of source tracing in a complex area declaration of

15813,cd rich wastes from open pit mining can be transported into rivers which are often followed by deposition in river sediments and or further transfer into agricultural soils the lithology of bedrock exerts a huge effect on physicochemical properties e g buffering capacities metal species mineral phases etc of the river system thereby potentially impacting the cd mobility in watersheds however to date little is known about the microscopic processes e g dissolution adsorption and precipitation controlling the migration of cd from mines to varied watersheds this study therefore aims to determine the controlling factors on cd mobilization in two mining impacted watersheds with contrasting bedrock lithology using both cd and pb isotopes the pb isotope ratios of sediments and soils in both watersheds fall into a binary mixing model with two isotopically distinct sources i e mining wastes and bedrock these results indicate that mining activities are the main sources of cd in sediments and soils however the cd isotope ratios reveal different cd migration processes between the two watersheds in the siliceous watershed the δ114 110cd values of sediments decrease from 0 116 in the upper reach to 0 712 in the lower reach with a concomitant increase in cd concentration which may result from cd adsorption by goethite due to the increased ph in contrast in the calcareous watershed the cd isotope compositions of sediments 0 345 to 0 276 and the ph of river water are nearly invariable suggesting that the adsorption and release of cd in sediments are limited this may result from the strong ph buffering effect due to the presence of carbonate rocks this study highlights the different fates of cd in siliceous and calcareous watersheds and suggests that the development of cd pollution control policies must consider regional lithology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cd isotopes source tracing migration processes mining affected watersheds lithology 1 introduction cadmium cd is a toxic metal that severely threatens water quality and food security e g qu et al 2017 mining activity may also generate a large amount of cd rich wastes including acid mine drainages amd tailings slags and dusts e g wen et al 2015 it has been estimated that mining activities contribute approximately 0 01 to 3 9 tons of cd to global surface runoff each year nriagu and pacyna 1988 these mining wastes may be transported into rivers followed by deposition in sediments which serve as both sinks and sources for cd in water bodies thereby posing potential risks to water and soil securities e g liao et al 2017 consequently deciphering the mobilization of cd from mines to ambient watersheds is of significance to restrain the sources and processes of cd pollution conventional approaches to explore the migration and transformation of heavy metals in watersheds usually rely on bulk concentrations and chemical fractions e g qin et al 2021 wu et al 2020 however this traditional approach often has difficulty in accurately deciphering geochemical processes particularly at the interface between solid and liquid phases the total concentration of a metal can often be affected not only by migration processes but also by the dilution effect e g qin et al 2021 selective sequential extraction is inefficient for some specific and selective species of heavy metals such as those associated with well crystallized fe oxyhydroxides e g yin et al 2016 with the rapid development of analytic techniques metal stable isotopes have been shown to serve as powerful tools to trace the sources and biogeochemical processes of heavy metals in environments e g wiederhold 2015 this is primarily because compared with conventional approaches metal stable isotope ratios are hard to change during dilution processes and can exactly reveal the sources and or biogeochemical processes of metals previous studies have indicated that geochemical processes including dissolution adsorption precipitation and biological processes can produce pronounced cd isotope fractionations e g horner et al 2011 wasylenki et al 2014 yan et al 2021 yang et al 2021 the cd isotope signature e g δ114 110cd therefore can be used as a tracer of cd during the leaching of pb zn ore rocks in the lab zhang et al 2016 showed that leachates are enriched in isotopically heavy cd compared with ores with cd isotope fractionation δ114 110cdore leachate ranging from 0 4 to 0 5 in addition laboratory studies indicate that light cd isotopes are preferentially adsorbed onto fe mn oxyhydroxides wasylenki et al 2014 yan et al 2021 and humic acid ratie et al 2021 and coprecipitated into sulfide guinoiseau et al 2018 and calcite horner et al 2011 xie et al 2021 thus the aqueous phases are in most cases enriched in heavier cd isotopes than solid phases this has been ascribed to the shorter cd o bond lengths for aqueous cd species than for most secondary minerals gao et al 2021 in contrast a recent study showed that heavy cd isotopes are preferentially incorporated into goethite by substituting lattice fe owing mostly to the enrichment of heavy cd isotopes in cd hydroxides yan et al 2021 moreover a few studies have also investigated the behavior of cd in watersheds e g yang et al 2019 wen et al 2015 for example yang et al 2019 observed that rivers draining sulfide mining areas have higher δ114 110cd values than mine tailings and ore minerals and explained this by the rapid dissolution of ore tailings however it is expected that some differences in cd isotope fractionation may exist in watersheds due to diverse microscopic geochemical processes that can mobilize cd the lithology of bedrock can also be an important factor impacting the mobilization of cd in both river and soil systems in particular rivers draining siliceous and calcareous rocks are often characterized by different physicochemical properties e g qin et al 2021 yang et al 2019 for example it has been suggested that in carbonate dominated regions the coexistence of dissolved co2 with carbonate minerals can result in high and stable ph in river waters e g sherlock et al 1995 this alkaline environment is conducive to the adsorption of cd onto secondary minerals or precipitation of cd rich carbonates in sediments e g wu et al 2020 which thus restricts the migration of cd in rivers in contrast this restriction usually does not work in regions dominantly covered with siliceous rocks due to their limited buffering capacity sherlock et al 1995 however few studies have focused on how geochemical processes including dissolution adsorption and precipitation may affect the mobility and isotope fractionation of cd from mines to varied watersheds in this study we collected and studied samples from two watersheds affected by mining activities one of them was developed in a basin with siliceous bedrock dabaoshan and the other was developed in a basin with calcareous bedrock niujiaotang in south china river water sediment soil and mining waste including amd amd precipitate tailings and mining dust were systematically sampled for cd isotope analyses given that pb isotopes are not fractionated during biogeochemical processes e g cheng and hu 2010 the pb isotope ratios were also measured here for source tracing our work aims to identify the source of cd in rivers and soil and to investigate and compare factors controlling the behavior of cd from mines to ambient watersheds our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cd behavior in mining affected watersheds with different lithologies and eventually to improved strategies for cd pollution control 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection dabaoshan dbs is located in guangdong province southern china 113 43 13 e 24 31 36 n and is characterized by subtropical latosol and influenced by a subtropical monsoon climate the bedrock under the soil is mostly sandstone which is mainly composed of quartz 84 wt muscovite 4 wt and phengite 12 wt liu et al 2020 the dbs mine is a large scale polymetallic sulfide deposit with main ore minerals of pyrite chalcopyrite pyrrhotite sphalerite and galena ye et al 2014 after being smashed by crushers ores were separated from rocks by flotation due to 60 years of mining activity a large quantity of amd and amd precipitates including both ore rock particles and hydrogenous minerals precipitated out of amd are stored in the liwu dam and then discharged into the hengshi hs river fig 1 a river water sediment and soil samples were collected from nine sampling sites which are distributed along the 20 km stretches of the hs river from the tailings dam liu et al 2020 for comparison a deep soil sample

small town in guizhou province southern china 107 39 20 e 26 13 54 n and is influenced by the subtropical monsoonal climate the area is characterized by a typical karst landform with dolostone as the dominant bedrock xia et al 2020 the njt mine is a pb zn sulfide deposit with main ore minerals of sphalerite and galena zhang et al 2018 ores were also separated from rocks through flotation a large amount of dust was generated during ore smashing and the flotation effluent was directly discharged into the fanjia fj river details for sampling and treatment prior to chemical analyses were elaborated in xia et al 2020 because the mining duration in this region 20 years is shorter than that in the dbs mine the mining affected scale is relatively small and sampling was conducted within 3 km along the fj river from the mining area briefly river water sediment and soil samples were collected from six sampling sites along the fj river fig 1b two background soils were collected from the deep layer 80 cm in the lower reach of the fj river sulfide ore tailings mining dust bedrock and fertilizer were collected for comparison measurements of river ph were carried out in the field by a

1979 was conducted to investigate cd association in sediments and soils from njt given the large amount of fe hydro oxides present in sediments and soils from dbs a modified tessier method was employed to effectively extract cd bound to well crystallized fe hydro oxides yin et al 2016 the steps of the procedure are presented in tables s1 and s2 the cd concentrations of all extracted

cd concentration of sulfide ore is 3 76 mg kg 1 which is higher than that of amd precipitates 1 12 to 3 56 mg kg 1 compared with the sediment the topsoil has a relatively lower cd concentration varying from 0 24 to 2 59 mg kg 1 table s5 the δ114 110cd value of the amd precipitate varies from 0 186 to 0 030 which is lower than those of amd 0 077 to 0 131 and sulfide ore 0 211 0 042 the river water has a δ114 110cd value ranging from 0 175 to 0 309 which is higher than that of the sediment 0 712 to 0 116 and topsoil 0 366 to 0 167 the δ114 110cd value of the sediment from the upper reach dc 5 6 and 8 ranges from 0 116 to 0 183 which is higher than that from the lower reach dc 11 and 13 0 682 to 0 712 but closer to the δ114 110cd value of the amd precipitate 0 186 to 0 030 fig 2 a similarly the topsoil in the upper reach has a higher δ114 110cd value ds 6 8 9 and 11 0 251 to 0 167 than that in the lower reach ds 12 and 14 0 366 to 0 252 fig 2a the pb concentrations of river

concentrations ranging from 1936 to 3394 mg kg 1 and the sulfide ore has pb concentrations of 2666 mg kg 1 table s5 the 206pb 207pb ratios of the sediment and topsoil range between 1 1863 and 1 1900 and between 1 1863 and 1 1899 respectively which are slightly higher than those of the sulfide ore 1 1860 and amd precipitate 1 1861 to 1 1863 a higher 206pb 207pb ratio is found in the bedrock sample 1 2523 table s5 4 3 cd and pb concentrations and isotope compositions of samples from njt the cd concentrations of the sulfide ore mine tailings and mining dust from njt are 1025 mg kg 1 316 mg kg 1 and 387 mg kg 1 respectively the river water has a low cd concentration even below the detection limit 0 06 μg l 1 for our instrument the cd concentration of the sediment varies from 4 14 to 100 mg kg 1 which is slightly higher than that of the topsoil between 4 31 and 58 4 mg kg 1 in addition the background soil has a cd concentration of 3 58 to 4 19 mg kg 1 in particular the cd concentration of the calcareous bedrock 52 9 mg kg 1 is much higher than that of the siliceous bedrock from the dbs 0 11 mg kg 1 table s6 the δ114 110cd values of the mine tailings sulfide ore and mining dust are 0 435 0 068 0 111 0 022 and 0 281 0 025 respectively table s6 the sediment has a small range of δ114 110cd values between 0 345 and 0 276 which generally fall between those of mine tailing and mining dust fig 2b the δ114 110cd value of the topsoil ranges from 0 519 to 0 267 and is slightly lower than that of the sediment fig 2b the background soil has a low δ114 110cd value ranging from 0 524 to 0

our selective leaching experiments show that cd in the sediment and topsoil from dbs is largely concentrated in the exchangeable fraction 33 73 for the sediment and 23 55 for the topsoil fig s2a s2b while cd in the sediment and topsoil from njt is generally associated with carbonates 57 77 for sediments and 19 63 for topsoils fig s2c s2d 5 discussion 5 1 pb isotope tracing because radiogenic pb isotopes are not fractionated during biogeochemical processes e g cheng and hu 2010 pb isotope ratios can provide accurate information about pollution sources the pb isotope ratios of most sediments and topsoils from the dbs watershed fall on a binary mixing line with two isotopically distinct endmembers i e ore rocks and background soil fig 3 b some samples of amd precipitates sediments and topsoils are close to ore samples indicating that they are strongly influenced by pb pollution from the ore compared with the bulk silicate bedrock in this area 208pb 206pb 2 0768 206pb 207pb 1 2523 even the background soil 208pb 206pb 2 0843 206pb 207pb 1 1928 might have been polluted by ore rocks however amd some sediments topsoils and bulk silicate bedrock are not on the mixing line fig 3a these deviations from the mixing line which are larger than the analytical uncertainty 2sd 0 00008 for 208pb 206pb and 0 00004 for 206pb 207pb suggest the presence of other pb sources indeed sediments bedrocks and topsoils at dbs consist of serval minerals that have different affinities to th and u e g riffel et al 2016 basak and martin 2013 and some differences in mineral mode exist among these samples table s3 thus the deviations can be understood if the silicate bedrock is non homogeneous and leaching the portion of silicates having higher 208pb 206pb and low 206pb 207pb values would make the pb isotope ratio of the residual soil sitting below the mixing line correspondingly amd that leaches through silicates in addition to ore rocks would have a higher 208pb 206pb ratio than ore rocks and sit above the mixing line moreover sediment samples dc 6 and dc 12 fall above and below the mixing line respectively fig 3b which is also consistent with the non homogeneity of sediments table s3 topsoil samples ds 6 and ds 12 fall above the mixing line which may be affected by the input of amd chen et al 2018 qu et al 2017 or heterogeneous mineral composition in soils kong et al 2018 wen et al 2020 fig 3b amd precipitates and ore rocks are on the mixing line and have similar pb isotope ratios indicating that the majority of pb in the amd precipitates is not from amd but from residual ore our measured pb isotope ratio of the fertilizer has extreme values 208pb 206pb 1 9612 and 206pb 207pb 1 2472 and lies below the mixing line thus its effect is much smaller than the pollution from ore rocks for some sediments and topsoils from the njt their pb isotope ratios sit on the mixing line of sulfide ore rock and background soil fig 3c mining dust and sulfide ore rocks have similar pb isotope signatures but mining dust may pollute ambient environments more easily however some topsoils river sediments mine tailings and bedrock have pb isotopes lying below the mixing line fig 3c this occurs because the bedrock is largely composed of carbonates which contain more u than th and contribute to lower 208pb 206pb ratios than silicate rocks basak and martin 2013 wen et al 2020 the background soil contains a tiny fraction of carbonate however some topsoils and river sediments contain significant amounts of dolomite and the mine tailings are a mixture of dolomite and sphalerite table s4 thus the pb isotope ratios of all studied samples can be explained by the mixing of sulfide ore rocks the silicate fraction of ambient rocks i e background soil and the carbonate fraction of the ambient rock i e bedrock the mine tailing can be considered as a mixture of bedrock and mining dust fig 3d again the extreme pb isotope ratio of the fertilizer suggests its limited contribution fig 3b 5 2 sources of cd in sediment and soil since both cd and pb are chalcophile elements with similar geochemical properties cd is usually accompanied by pb in sulfide polluted media e g huang et al 2020 he et al 2019 indeed in the present study the concentrations of cd and pb in topsoils show a significant positive correlation in both watersheds fig 4 a b suggesting similar sources of cd and pb in topsoils however cd and pb concentrations in sediments are decoupled fig 4a b especially in dbs implying that cd and pb behave differently in these samples cd isotopes can be used to investigate the origin of the difference given the evident difference in the cd isotope composition among the sulfide ore rock mining waste and background soil fig 4c d the cd isotope compositions of the sediment and soil samples may also reflect mixing processes of various sources for most topsoil and some sediment samples from dbs binary mixing relationships can be found in both δ114 110cd 1 cd i e inverse concentration and δ114 110cd 206pb 207pb diagrams where amd precipitates and background soil are defined as the two end members fig 4c d this is consistent with the conclusion drawn based on pb isotopes discussed in section 5 1 moreover sediment samples close to the mining area including dc 5 dc 6 and dc 8 have cd isotope compositions 0 183 to 0 116 similar to that of the amd precipitate 0 186 to 0 030 suggesting that amd precipitates are also the main cd source to river sediments however this mixing relationship cannot be used to explain the differences in δ114 110cd values among the sulfide ore rock amd and amd precipitates and δ114 110cd values of some sediments located in the lower reach e g dc 11 and dc 13 which may be related to the post depositional processes in the river system discussed in section 5 3 and section 5 4 in comparison the cd and pb isotope ratios appear to show slightly different mixing endmembers for sediments and topsoils from njt fig 4e f in the δ114 110cd 1 cd plot fig 4e and δ114 110cd 206pb 207pb diagram fig 4f sediments and topsoils can be circumscribed by three end members mining dust mine tailing and background soil this agrees with the tracing result from the 206pb 207pb 208pb 206pb diagram fig 3c d however sulfide has a distinctly different δ114 110cd value from that of mine tailings or mining dust which could originate from cd isotope fractionation during leaching processes discussed in section 5 3 moreover the difference 0 320 between the δ114 110cd value of sulfide ore from dbs and that from njt is likely caused by the difference in mineral composition if carbonate and sulfide minerals are characterized by different cd isotope signals the sulfide ores in njt contain a large amount of carbonate 85 2 wt while those in dbs mainly consist of sulfide minerals e g pyrite 5 3 cd isotope fractionation in mining wastes previous studies have shown that cd isotopes can be highly fractionated due to leaching zhang et al 2016 adsorption onto minerals yan et al 2021 wasylenki et al 2014 and coprecipitation into minerals yan et al 2021 although this fractionation could complicate the source determination using only cd isotopes it can help to elucidate geochemical processes that pb isotopes are not able to detect in dbs the amd precipitate and sulfide ore have similar pb isotope ratios but the δ114 110cd value of the amd precipitate is significantly lower than that of the sulfide ore δ114 110cdore amd precipitate 0 241 to 0 397 similarly the δ114 110cd value of the mining dust from the njt is significantly lower than that of the sulfide ore δ114 110cdore mining dust 0 170 although mining dust and sulfide ore have similar pb isotope ratios because the original sulfide ore rocks were washed first after being mined these discrepancies between the δ114 110cd values of amd precipitate mining dust and ores can be explained by the leaching of cd the leaching experiment conducted by zhang et al 2016 showed that isotopically heavy cd is preferentially released into liquid phases additionally the cd concentration of amd precipitate and mining dust is much lower than that of sulfide ore table s5 s6 these results suggest that ore washing may lead to a significant removal of cd in ores and therefore the enrichment of light cd isotopes in ore residues the δ114 110cd values of amd 0 077 to 0 131 in dbs are lower than those of sulfide ores 0 211 0 042 this observation contrasts with the result of the leaching experiment that heavy cd is preferentially released into the aqueous solution zhang et al 2016 this observation is also inconsistent with the cd adsorption on fe oxyhydr oxides based on xrd the amd precipitate contains a significant amount of fe oxyhydr oxides e g goethite table s3 amd is a sulfuric acid rich solution with ph 2 5 table s5 boily et al 2005 found that little dissolved cd could be adsorbed by goethite at ph 5 0 so cd adsorption onto fe oxyhydr oxides could be limited in the tailings dam even if adsorption occurs lighter cd isotopes are preferentially adsorbed onto solid phases yan et al 2021 thereby elevating the δ114 110cd value of amd rather than decreasing it alternatively the dissolved cd in the amd may migrate into the amd precipitates through coprecipitation with fe oxyhydr oxides which widely exist in an amd pool e g chen et al 2018 it is suggested that cd incorporation into goethite by substitution for lattice fe prefers heavy cd isotopes due to the release and reprecipitation of isotopically heavy cd during the transformation of ferrihydrite to goethite yan et al 2021 therefore isotopically heavy cd in amd may preferentially coprecipitate with fe oxyhydr oxides resulting in light isotope enrichment in amd fig 4c the other plausible explanation which is also consistent with the pb isotope results of amd is that leachates from both ore rocks and silicates contribute to amd the pb isotope ratios of amd suggest that amd receives the contribution of both ore rocks and silicates which pulled amd slightly above the mixing line fig 3b discussed in section 5 1 because silicate rocks have lower δ114 110cd values e g δ114 110cdbedrock 0 265 0 008 the leachate from leaching silicates would have a δ114 110cd value higher than silicates but lower than ore rocks moreover the pb isotope ratio of the mine tailings suggests that both sulfide ore and carbonate bedrock have a significant contribution to the mine tailing in the njt while the δ114 110cd value of mine tailings is significantly lower than that of the ore δ114 110cdore tailing 0 324 and bedrock δ114 110cdbedrock tailing 0 200 leaching of sulfide ore rock therefore is necessary to explain the lower δ114 110cdmine tailing similar to mine dust in njt or amd precipitates in dbs besides heavy cd isotopes are preferentially leached out from limestone imseng et al 2018 which may lead to the cd isotope composition of mine tailings being lower than that of bedrock overall both processes are required to explain the cd and pb isotope ratios of mine tailings in the njt 5 4 cd isotope fractionation in the rivers the cd isotope compositions of sediments show distinctly different variations between the two watersheds fig 2 in dbs the river sediments 0 183 to 0 116 and water 0 175 0 010 from the first 10 km of the hs river have cd isotope compositions similar to those of amd precipitates average δ114 110cd of 0 098 0 105 2sd and amd average δ114 110cd of 0 109 0 037 2sd respectively fig 2a these results appear to suggest that the mining waste after being discharged from the tailings dam is transported along the hs river followed by deposition in sediments it is worth noting that the cd concentration of sediments gradually increases during the first 10 km of the hs river fig s1 the slope rate of the riverbed declines in this stretch of the hs river which leads to the high level of settling of mining waste particles chen et al 2018 after 10 km from the mining site the cd isotope compositions of sediments in the hs river decrease fig 2a while the pb isotope ratios of sediments vary only slightly table s5 these observations indicate that the adsorption and or coprecipitation of cd onto into sediments most likely goethite based on xrd table s3 may occur during cd transportation in rivers which may fractionate cd isotopes yan et al 2021 suggested that the coprecipitation of cd into fe oxyhydr oxides preferentially takes up isotopically heavy cd which contrasts with the decreased δ114 110cd of sediments from the upper to lower reach fig 2a this implies that the possible coprecipitation of goethite has limited effects on cd isotope fractionation instead it is more likely that these changes in δ114 110cd of sediments originate primarily from the enhanced adsorption of cd onto goethite as the ph value of river water increases due to dilution and silicate buffering effects yang et al 2019 a pioneering study has shown that cd adsorption on fe oxyhydr oxides prefers light cd isotopes and that the adsorption capacity increases dramatically as the ph increases from 6 0 to 8 0 yan et al 2021 as such some cd may be adsorbed onto fe oxyhydr oxides in sediments due to the increased river ph 6 4 to 8 1 fig s3a previous studies have shown that the adsorbed cd is mainly transformed into the exchangeable form fan et al 2007 and this cd fraction often enriches light isotopes zhong et al 2021 therefore the positive correlation between the river ph and the amount of exchangeable cd in sediments proves that the increased ph causes more adsorbed cd which thus results in the decreased δ114 110cd value of sediments along the hs river fig 5 a in contrast the cd isotope compositions of sediments in the njt are nearly invariable along the fj river fig 2b which is likely caused by the low dissolution rate of carbonates in an alkaline environment high and stable ph values are observed in fj river water which may be the result of the powerful acid buffering potential of calcareous rocks fig s3b e g raymond et al 2009 c a x m g 1 x c o 3 2 2 h 2 h c o 3 1 x m g x 2 x c a 2 carbonates may neutralize acid from mine drainage and produce bicarbonate to maintain the high ph of river water which has also been observed in other carbonate dominated watersheds e g mayo et al 2000 qin et al 2021 alkaline conditions can inhibit the dissolution of carbonates pokrovsky et al 1999 the dominant fraction of sediments from njt according to the selective sequential extraction result fig s3d however a high ph may enhance the adsorption and or precipitation of dissolved cd e g wu et al 2020 which can produce cd isotope fractionation e g wasylenki et al 2014 yan et al 2021 the river water shows extremely low cd concentrations which are even below the detection limit table s6 suggesting that most dissolved cd has been adsorbed or precipitated before being discharged into rivers as a result river water may only contribute little dissolved cd to sediments and consequently may have a limited effect on the cd isotope composition of sediment 6 conclusions and implications based on the cd isotope compositions of river water sediments soils bedrock and mining wastes developed in siliceous dbs and calcareous njt basins this study unravels the mechanisms controlling cd mobility and cd isotope fractionation from the mine to ambient watersheds our results show that mining activities are the main supplier of cd in river soil systems around both mining areas whereas the extent and level of cd pollution are very different in dbs the decrease in δ114 110cd in sediments indicates the enhanced adsorption of cd by fe oxides in the river due to the elevated ph in the njt watershed the invariable δ114 110cd values of sediments suggest that the adsorption and release of cd in sediments are limited because of the high and stable ph caused by the carbonate buffer in this way to limit cd migration developing different policies in siliceous and calcareous watersheds is crucial for a siliceous watershed it is necessary to restrain the release of adsorbed cd in sediments by increasing the river ph through limestone or hydrated lime luo et al 2020 in a calcareous watershed the acidity produced by sulfide mineral oxidation can be partially or completely offset by carbonate rock resulting in neutral or weakly alkaline mine water sherlock et al 1995 therefore natural geochemical processes for acid neutralization and precipitation adsorption of metals may be an economical way to prevent amd in a calcareous watershed in addition this study also shows the different cd isotope fractionation mechanisms in the two watersheds therefore the influence of lithology needs to be taken into account and interpreted with caution before using the cd isotope tool for tracing pollution for example combining pb isotopes may improve the accuracy of source tracing in a complex area declaration of

15814,the three dimensional 3d carbon coated nickel foam was utilized as current collector in a flow electrode capacitive deionization cf fcdi device to strengthen the charge transfer ability of fcdi device achieving distinguished desalination efficiency for real seawater utilizing 30 ppi carbon coated nickel foam as current collector with 12 5 wt ac content at 1 2 v to treat 3 5 g l 1 nacl solution the cf fcdi achieved 99 8 of salt removal efficiency sre 3 29 µmol cm 2 min 1 of average salt removal rate asrr and 97 0 of charge efficiency ce surpassing most desalination performances in previous reports compared with the titanium mesh tm fcdi and graphite plate gp fcdi current collector the three dimensional electric field and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations demonstrated that 3d foam current collector has obvious stronger competitiveness its intrinsic 3d interconnected open pore structure as flow channel and 3d electric field could not only enlarge the charge contact area between the current collector and flow electrode but also eliminate the restriction of 0 75 mm effective charging range within the carbon slurry in traditional serpentine flow channels finally the excellent desalination performance of cf fcdi device was also verified by treating simulated seawater real seawater samples from yellow sea and south china sea with a high sre of 99 9 99 8 and 99 9 respectively this work introduced a new strategy for enhancing charge transfer ability and overall desalination efficiency of fcdi device by utilizing a novel 3d foam structured current collector for real seawater desalination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flow electrode capacitive deionization current collector three dimensional foam seawater desalination 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi as an emerging desalination technology taking advantage of energy efficient cost effective and environment friendliness has gained extensive attention in the field of water treatment dahiya and mishra 2020 fang et al 2018 jeon et al 2014 ma et al 2016 porada et al 2013 tang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 however the limited usage of active materials and finite surface area of static electrodes is causing a low adsorption capacity and discontinuous process of cdi cai et al 2020 especially the intermittent process for ion adsorption and desorption as the result of electrode regeneration restricted the development and scaling up application of cdi technology cai et al 2020 chang et al 2019 cho et al 2019 to address these issues jeon et al 2013 developed flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi by replacing the static electrodes with flow electrodes since the flow electrode possessed with several orders of magnitude active materials compared with static electrode the desalination efficiency was improved drastically luo et al 2021 ma et al 2019a under short circuited closed cycle scc operation the flow electrodes could be regenerated continuously via the neutralization of charged carbon particles in a single recirculation reservoir he et al 2018 ma et al 2018 2019a 2019b zhang et al 2019 by continuously replenishing new or regenerating flow electrodes into the electrode chamber fcdi exhibited high desalination efficiency and the possibility of continuous operation ma et al 2019c yang et al 2021 nevertheless three main limitations for fcdi still existed such as charge leakage high electronic resistance and power losses owing to the discontinuity conductive contact between activate materials within a flow electrode slurry luo et al 2021 ma et al 2016 the charge transfer ability in fcdi is of paramount importance to mitigate electronic resistance and charge leakage which could significantly influence the desalination performance of fcdi device thus a series of studies were aimed to enhance the charge transfer ability and reduce the liquid solid interface contact resistance by adding the conductive addictive increasing active material content or optimizing the architecture of fcdi devices cai et al 2020 choo et al 2019 liang et al 2017 xu et al 2021 thereinto the optimization of fcdi cell structure is an alternative strategy to ameliorate the charge transfer ability in fcdi cell structure the current collector is actually a crucial point while often neglected that works functionally in current transfer and charge distribution to the flow electrode directing the flow of carbon slurry and providing structural support to the chamber separators zhang et al 2021 traditionally the most commonly employed current collectors in fcdi devices are graphite based plates with serpentine channels carved on the surface and these plates were served as both the charge conductor and flow channel for the flow electrodes however the high proportion of electrolyte and the inconsecutive intrinsic properties of the conductive network in flow electrodes gives rise to a lower charge transfer ability in comparison with typical statical electrodes which seriously hinders the desalination performance of fcdi device besides traditional serpentine flow channel limits the effective contact area between current collector and carbon slurry also has a negative impact on charge transfer ability therefore the titanium mesh membrane assembly fcdi cell tm fcdi with high desalination performance was reported to decrease charge transfer distance by yang et al 2019 comparing with graphite plate based fcdi device gp fcdi the tm fcdi achieved higher average salt removal rate 0 54 μmol cm 2 min 1 and charge efficiency over 80 under 10 wt ac content exhibiting a great desalination performance in tm fcdi the charge resistance was decreased by two dimensional 2d titanium mesh current collector due to a closer charge transfer distance than those of graphite plates dahiya and mishra 2020 he et al 2021 tang and zhou 2020 yang et al 2019 yet there are still some defects and issues hidden behind this strategy i the restricted contact area between the 2d planar current collector titanium mesh or graphite plate and flow electrodes still hinders the rapid charge migration to the carbon particles only a few carbon particles within 0 75 mm distance from the surface of 2d current collectors could be charged effectively as the result of the imbalance in electrical and ionic conductivities yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 ii there is still considerable hydraulic resistance to the flow of carbon slurry in 2d planar flow channel iii the traditional 2d planar flow channel model restricts the active amount of flow electrode in electrode chambers which severely suppresses the desalination performance of fcdi three dimensional 3d electric field would be an effective solution to amplify charge transfer ability of fcdi device for saline water treatment in comparison to conventional 2d planar current collector the 3d current collector as a completely aperiodic 3d sponge configuration can increase the surface to body ratio of the electrode chambers which would greatly improve the charge transfer area and electric field distribution in principle in order to achieve equal transfer length scales or area the areal footprint of 2d planar current collector would require a 330 increase to maintain equal cell volume of 3d current collector long et al 2004 zhang et al 2013 besides the potential distribution of flow electrode in 3d current collector is relatively uniformed accelerating the charge transportation after overcoming the shortage of 2d planar current collector 3d current collector could significantly promote the desalination performance of fcdi due to the super high charge transfer area and strengthened electric field distribution which has not been reported yet herein the 3d carbon coated nickel foam cf fcdi was proposed to replace titanium mesh and graphite plate gp fcdi severing as a novel current collector for the improvement of charge transfer ability and electric field distribution in fcdi device firstly the desalting tests were carried out to investigate the distinct desalination performance of cf fcdi tm fcdi and gp fcdi devices the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was conducted to further compare the charge resistance and capacitance resistance towards three kinds of current collectors subsequently the three dimensional electric field and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations were carried out to simulate the electric field and flow velocity field of carbon slurry in 2d titanium mesh and 3d foam models with different pore sizes furthermore the impact of different pore size in 3d foam current collectors on desalination performance of fcdi device was studied systematically meanwhile the influence of activated carbon ac content on desalination performance of fcdi device was evaluated under batch mode finally the long term desalination was conducted in simulated seawater 40 g l 1 and real seawater yellow sea and south china sea to verify the superior desalination capability of cf fcdi device 2 methods and materials 2 1 the construction of fcdi devices with different current collectors the fcdi devices with different current collectors graphite plate titanium meshes or carbon coated nickel foam were constructed in this work as illustrated in fig 1 the 3d carbon coated nickel foam current collector was inserted outward side of ion exchange membranes iems 0 16 mm in thickness including a pair of anion exchange membrane aem agu astom japan and cation exchange membrane cem cgu astom japan in cf fcdi device the carbon slurry as flow electrode could flow through the 3d foam current collector to be charged for electrosorption the integral rectangular parallelepiped cavity 62 mm 55 mm 5 mm carved in graphite plate for the flow channel of carbon slurry the total contact area between iems and carbon slurry was 3410 mm2 in fig 1 c to avoid streaming or seeping the spacer chamber was optimized by allowing the brine water to flow through directly rather than passing through the electrode plates and iems zhang et al 2022 to study the impact of pore size on desalination performance of cf fcdi the different pore sizes of 3d foam current collectors were chosen as 20 ppi 25 ppi 30 ppi 35 ppi and 40 ppi respectively the pore size parameter of different 3d foam current collectors was displayed in table s1 for tm fcdi the titanium mesh as 2d current collector was placed the outward side of iem the perspex sheet carved with serpentine flow channel was arranged the outward side of titanium mesh severing as flow electrode chamber fig 1 b in gp fcdi the graphite plate carved with serpentine flow channel as 2d current collector at the same position fig 1 a the traditional serpentine channels of tm fcdi and gp fcdi devices were carved as 3 mm in width and 1 mm in depth respectively the total contact area between iems and carbon slurry were both 1324 mm2 in tm fcdi and gp fcdi devices 2 2 desalination experiments in this work the desalting tests were performed in 50 ml of 3 5 g l 1 nacl solution with a stable flow rate of 30 ml min 1 under batch mode for 1 h the 60 g carbon slurry severing as flow electrode were cycled at the flow rate of 30 ml min 1 the carbon slurry was composed of activated carbon ac yec 8a yihuan carbon fuzhou and deionized water the carbon slurry was stirred over 24 h to obtain a homogeneous dispersion state moreover the impact of different ac content on desalination performance was also investigated in which the ac content of carbon slurry were set as 5 wt 7 5 wt 10 wt and 12 5 wt respectively finally the long term desalination process was carried in 50 ml simulated seawater 40 7 g l 1 table s4 and real seawater samples yellow sea and south china sea tables s5 and s6 at 1 2 v applied voltage under batch mode the conductivity of saline water was monitored by conductivity meter ddsj 308a leici china to further evaluate the desalination performance of fcdi device the salt removal efficiency sre charge efficiency ce average salt removal rate asrr μmol cm 2 min 1 and energy normalized removed salt enrs μmol j 1 were calculated by eqs 1 3 as follows chang

electrochemical workstation chi 660e ch instrument inc shanghai china under an open circuit voltage with an amplitude of 5 mv the range of scan frequency in eis plot was set from 104 to 10 2 hz meanwhile the carbon slurry and saline water were cycled constantly in fcdi device during the eis measurement additionally the electrochemically active surface areas of 3d foam current collector and 2d planar current collector were measured via a three electrode system with working electrode 3d foam current collector or titanium mesh counter electrode pt net and reference electrode ag agcl cyclic voltammetry cv measurements were applied at 10 50 mv s 1 of scan rates in 3 5 g l 1 nacl solution the potential window was extended from 0 3 to 1 3 v vs ag agcl 2 4 the 3d electric field and cfd simulations the 3d electric field and cfd simulations were performed to analyze the distinct charge transfer ability of 2d planar current collector titanium mesh and graphite plate and different pore sized 3d foam current collectors in the 3d electric field simulation the system model followed the law of conservation of charge and set the potential of the unit boundary surface to zero in the cfd simulation the change of carbon slurry density was so small ρ ρ 1 the reynolds coefficient was less than 2100 and the mach number was so small for single phase flow system the carbon slurry was regarded as laminar state and non compressible flow therefore the navier stokes equations n s equations were used to compute the flow state of carbon slurry in electrode chambers moreover the boundary surface of flow channel was set as non slip interface in the boundary condition setting indicating that the velocity of carbon slurry near the boundary surface of current collector is zero in the inlet the boundary condition was set as normal flow velocity boundary condition at 1 67 mm s 1 in the outlet however the pressure field boundary condition was applied 3 results and discussion 3 1 desalination performance of fcdi devices the current collector is a bridge between the external circuit and the flow electrode in fcdi system that determines the desalination performance of fcdi device by influencing the charge transfer ability in cf fcdi the 3d current collector adopts the intrinsic 3d interconnected open pore structure of nickel foam as flow channels replaying the traditional 2d serpentine flow channels which could enlarge the throughput of flow electrode greatly more importantly the charge transfer rate would be facilitated as a result of higher specific surface area and shorter charge transfer distance in 3d foam current collector than those of 2d planar current collector leading to low ohmic resistance thus the 3d foam structured current collector not only possesses an expanded charge transfer area but also eliminates the restriction of flow channels towards carbon slurry which could significantly improve the desalination performance of fcdi device to prevent the ion dissolution of nickel foam a layer of activated carbon was sprayed on the surface of nickel foam current collector in cf fcdi device fig s2 besides the conductivity of nickel foam and carbon coated foam current collectors were measured by digital multimeter in table s2 the resistance of carbon coating foam was 27 ω which is larger than that of exposed nickel foam 18 ω demonstrating the existence of interface resistance 9 ω between the carbon coating layer and nickel foam fig 2 a illustrates the change in desalination efficiency c c0 of saline water and the equilibrium current in the electrosorption process it is clearly presented that the desalination efficiency of cf fcdi was 0 4 during 60 min running time exhibiting the excellent desalination performance comparing with gp fcdi and tm fcdi in terms of equilibrium current the equilibrium current of cf fcdi outclassed the others which benefited from the magnifying charge transfer area of 3d foam structured current collector through a comparative analysis the sre of cf fcdi 45 8 was clearly superior to those of tm fcdi 22 2 and gp fcdi 14 1 under the same condition fig 2 b which is 2 06 and 3 27 times that of tm fcdi and gp fcdi moreover the ce 77 6 in cf fcdi was significantly higher than those of 74 9 in tm fcdi and 62 61 in gp fcdi besides the internal pressures of cf fcdi device and conventional flow channel fcdi device were listed in table s7 it is significant that the internal pressure 1 30 kpa of conventional flow channel fcdi device tm fcdi and gp fcdi is higher than that of cf fcdi due to the smaller electrode chamber 3 mm in depth of flow channel fcdi and 5 mm in depth of cf fcdi resulting in a higher pumping energy consumption of conventional flow channel fcdi device in order to explore the influence of the carbon coating in nickel foam current collector on the desalination performance of the fcdi device the exposed nickel foam was used as current collector nf fcdi to perform a control experiment the optical images sem images and eds mapping of 30 ppi carbon coated foam current collector after 0 h 1 h and 12 h desalination tests were exhibited in fig s3 the fig s3a1 a3 show that there is no obvious variation in optical images of the 30 ppi foam current collectors after 0 h 1 h and 12 h operation the sem images fig s3b1 b3 display that the thickness of carbon coating layer on the 3d foam current collector is around 28 μm and there is no change in thickness after long term desalination indicating a great stability of carbon coating foam current collector meanwhile the eds mapping fig s3c1 c3 further confirmed the formation of carbon coating layer with 28 μm thickness without significant variations in carbon coating layer moreover fig s4 displayed the distinct desalination performance between the cf fcdi and nf fcdi as observed the conductivity of nacl solution in nf fcdi was increased slightly at the preliminary stage of desalination process signifying the nickel ions dissolution phenomenon from the exposed nickel foam it is obvious that the concentration of nickel ions dissolution in the nf fcdi is much higher than that in cf fcdi fig s4c more seriously the concentration of nickel ions dissolution in nf fcdi increased dramatically over running time interestingly after spraying with a layer of activated carbon the conductivity of nacl solution was constantly declined in the whole period of electrosorption process according to the icp oes measurement the nickel ions dissolution was negligible in the saline water it indicated that nickel ions dissolution of the exposed nickel foam was obviously eliminated by coating activated carbon layer moreover the carbon layer on the nickel foam could also increase the affinity with the electrolyte containing carbon particles as the electrode materials comparing to 24 9 of sre and 64 3 of ce of nf fcdi the desalination performance of cf fcdi was improved drastically 45 8 of sre and 77 6 of ce as a result the affinity of activated carbon layer on 3d foam structured current collector surface was conductive to reduce the liquid solid interface resistance between the carbon slurry and current collector contributing the excellent desalination performance of cf fcdi device 3 2 electrochemical analysis in 3d foam current collector the charge percolation pathway was increased significantly improving the charge transfer ability of fcdi device eis measurements were carried out to compare the charge transfer resistances of tm fcdi and cf fcdi devices in fig 3 a the nyquist plot showed that the arc radius of cf fcdi is much smaller than that of tm fcdi revealing the superiority of 3d foam structured current collector over 2d titanium mesh in charge transfer ability the contact resistance of cf fcdi was 1 28 ω which is much smaller than 8 56 ω of tm fcdi further demonstrating the obvious advantage of 3d foam structured current collector over 2d titanium mesh in charge transfer ability moreover the bode plots involve the high frequency area of ohmic resistance middle frequency area of capacitance resistance and low frequency area of charge resistance linnartz et al 2017 yang et al 2019 as shown in fig 3 b the values of cf fcdi and tm fcdi were similar in high frequency area of bode plots indicating no obvious difference of ohmic resistance in saline water nevertheless it cannot be ignored that the ohm value of cf fcdi was lower than that of tm fcdi in low frequency area it revealed that the contact resistance is smaller than that of tm fcdi as the result of expanded charge transfer area by 3d foam structured current collector the ohm value of cf fcdi was less than that of tm fcdi in middle frequency area demonstrating a lower capacitance resistance and a higher capacitance owing to the amplified electrochemically active surface areas of 3d foam structured current collector furthermore the nf fcdi and gp fcdi were also measured in eis plots to investigate the total resistance of exposed 3d nickel foam and 2d graphite plate current collectors as observed in fig s5 there was a capacitance resistance controlled by faradaic reaction due to the nickel ions dissolution from nickel foam linnartz et al 2017 comparing with cf fcdi owing to the absence of activated carbon layer the affinity between the exposed nickel foam and flow electrode was decreased significantly the ohmic resistance and contact resistance were increased to 7 33 ω and 4 21 ω respectively table s8 in gp fcdi however the graphite plate possessed the highest ohmic resistance and contact resistance seriously limiting the charge migration in fcdi overall the cf fcdi device exhibited the significantly superior in charge transfer ability without nickel ion dissolution moreover the electrochemically active surface areas of 3d foam current collector and 2d planar titanium mesh were investigated for further understanding the enhancement of charge transfer ability the electrochemically active surface areas of different current collectors were evaluated by calculating the double layer capacitance cdl based on cv tests in a non faradaic region fig 3 c and d significantly the 3d foam current collector showed an enlarged cdl 31 0 mf cm 2 than titanium mesh 21 3 mf cm 2 in fig 3 e and f indicating an enhanced electrochemical surface area ecsa it could be attributed to that the extended charge transfer area of 3d foam current collector increases the exposure of active sites on the surface of current collector for improving charge percolation and thus facilitates the charge transfer ability of fcdi device fig 4 vividly illustrated the charge transfer pathway of 3d cf fcdi and 2d tm fcdi as illustrated in fig 4 a the carbon slurry was charged by receiving the electrons transportation from the current collector subsequently the charged carbon slurry in electrode chamber of tm fcdi served as flow electrode to adsorb saline ions under the applied electric field however only few charges including the ions and electrons in a narrow charge transfer range within 0 75 mm near the titanium mesh 0 20 mm in width could be absorbed to form the adsorption layer beyond this range the voltage attenuation increased and the desalination efficiency dropped sharply as illustrated in fig 4 b nevertheless the adsorption layer was enlarged in cf fcdi due to the magnifying charge transfer area since the 3d foam current collector possesses the 3d interconnected open pore structure with expanded surface area and high pore volume the electrode chamber can be divided into abundant mass transfer channels which effectively boost the capabilities of electrosorption and charge transportation the electrons can be transferred to the more ac particles in the electrode chamber within the effective charge transfer area from the surface of 3d foam current collector attaining a magnified adsorption layer thereinto the 3d foam current collector is able to achieve large areal adsorption capacities without making sacrifices in electric field intensity that may result from the slow interfacial kinetics correspond with a small electrode surface to body ratio and high ohmic resistance correspond with long charge transfer distance long et al 2004 3 3 3d electric field and cfd simulations in a previous report yang et al designed a titanium mesh as a current collector to enhance the desalination performance by decreasing the charge transfer distance however the charge transfer process only occurs in a narrow area within 0 75 mm distance near the titanium mesh severely limiting the charge transfer yang et al 2019 therefore the 3d foam current collector was introduced to enlarge charge transfer area for further improving the desalination performance of fcdi device in three dimensional electric field simulation the surface of current collector was set to 1 2 v and boundary surface of model units was set to ground 0 v fig 5 illustrated the difference of 3d electric field between 2d structured planar current collector and 3d foam structured current collector model units in 3d electric field simulation we defined the 0 8 1 2 v region as the charge transfer area in fig 5 a the region closing to the 2d planar structured current collector changed from red to cyan color obviously it displayed that the electric field intensity decreased rapidly from the surface of 2d planar current collector the red and yellow color regions were so small and the charge transfer area was so narrow in 2d planar structured current collector indicating that the electrons could only be transferred from the 2d planar current collector to a small quantity of ac particles in the flow channel fig 5 a and c the space far from the 2d planar current collector was considered to be an invalid region where the carbon slurry cannot be fully charged and the electron migration was limited however the 3d foam structured current collector exhibited the superiority in the large charge transfer area the strengthened 3d electric field was illustrated in fig 5 b displaying the expanded red and yellow color regions in the surrounding area of 3d foam current collector meanwhile the charge transfer area of the 3d foam current collector 11 5 was significantly larger than that of 2d planar current collector 8 99 which could enable more ac particles to be charged effectively and improve charge transfer ability and desalination performance of cf fcdi fig 5 d moreover the 3d foam current collector with the intrinsic 3d interconnected open pore structure divided the flow electrode chamber into many mass transfer channels in which the carbon slurry as the flow electrode was charged in the mass transfer channels to absorb the salt ions therefore the three dimensional electric field and flow field in the pores of 3d foam current collector would affect the potential distribution and mass transfer rate of carbon slurry which influence the charge transfer and flow state of carbon slurry especially the pore size of 3d foam current collector is a key factor that influence the 3d electric field and flow field in the pores theoretically the 3d electric field is strengthened but the flow field became worse with the decrease of pore size with decreasing pore size the amount of carbon slurry in the mass transfer channels was decreased causing a negative effect on the desalination capacity of fcdi device therefore it is necessary to find an appropriate pore size with the suitable 3d electric field and flow field for equilibrating the charge transfer and fluidity of carbon slurry in 3d foam current collector fig 6 shows the 3d electric field and cfd simulations of different pore sized 3d foam current collectors the invalid region including the volume of 3d foam current collector and sedimentary region was defined ranging from 0 ml min 1 to 10 ml min 1 0 mm s 1 0 55 mm s 1 with extremely low adsorption current carmona orbezo and dryfe 2021 as displayed in fig 6 a3 d3 the potential distribution in the pores of 3d foam current collector was improved significantly with the decrease of pore size comparing with the potential value in the color bar it can be seen that the potential value in the smaller pore is significantly enhanced therefore as the decrease of pore size the charge transfer ability of the carbon slurry in the 3d foam current collector was improved due to the enlarged charge transfer area meanwhile the proportion of charge transfer area raised from 11 5 to 43 4 with the decrease of pore size in 3d foam models fig 6 a4 d4 in which more ac particles could be charged to improve the desalination performance of fcdi device when the pore size was less than 1 70 mm 30 ppi the charge transfer area filled the entire open pores indicating that the ac particles in the foam pores could be charged effectively similarly the flow field that affected the mass transfer rate of mass transfer channels also plays an important role in cfd simulation the carbon slurry was set up to flow from bottom to the top and the initial velocity of carbon slurry was set at 30 ml min 1 1 67 mm s 1 in fig 6 a5 d5 it is worth noting that there are more low flow velocity regions in the vicinity of the 3d foam current collector with the decrease of pore size resulting in a seriously sedimentation of carbon slurry around the frame of 3d foam current collector as shown in fig 6 a6 d6 the proportion of invalid regions raised from 5 56 to 8 95 with the decrease of pore size in 3d foam models obviously there were more low velocity region in the vicinity of 3d foam current collector with deceasing pore size which could cause a negative impact on mass transfer rate of carbon slurry therefore under the condition that the effective charge potential filled the interconnected open pore structure of 3d foam current collector the invalid regions should be as little as possible it is obvious that 30 ppi pore sized foam current collector has few invalid regions with the full filled charge transfer area in the open pores thus the 30 ppi 1 70 nm could be the appropriate pore size of 3d foam current collector in cf fcdi device according to 3d electric field and cfd simulations 3 4 optimization by altering pore size of 3d foam current collector fig 7 shows the desalination performance of cf fcdi devices with different pore sized 3d foam current collectors notably when the pore size was larger than 1 70 mm 30 ppi the desalination efficiency c c0 was improved and the sre and ce increased due to the strengthened 3d electric field while the pore size was smaller than 1 70 mm 30 ppi the sedimentation of carbon slurry became a serious problem resulting in a decrease of ce and sre and an attenuation of desalination efficiency in fcdi due to the increased invalid region thereinto the sre and ce of 30 ppi pore sized 3d foam current collector were 90 2 and 85 4 respectively which is superior than the other pore sized 3d foam current collectors furthermore the internal pressure of brine in spacer was 1 30 kpa generally the flow resistance of flow electrode in electrode chamber was higher with smaller open pore due to the obstruction of 3d foam flow channels in table s7 the internal pressure of flow electrode in fcdi devices increased from 0 70 kpa to 0 95 kpa with the decrease of pore size in 3d foam current collector it was interesting that the ecpump fe and ecpump b of different pore sized foam current collector in fig 7 c exhibit the inverse relationship to sre and ce in fig 7 b the ecpump b corresponding with 20 ppi 25 ppi 30 ppi 35 ppi and 40 ppi were displayed in table s9 when the pore size was larger than 30 ppi 1 70 mm the ecpump fe and ecpump b became lower with the decrease of pore size due to the enhanced adsorption capacity of 3d foam current collector when the pore size was smaller than 30 ppi 1 70 mm nevertheless the ecpump fe and ecpump b became higher with the decrease of pore size due to the weakened adsorption capacity of foam current collector the ecpump fe and ecpump b at 30 ppi foam current collector was the lowest due to the highest desalination capacity indicating a great pumping energy efficiency similarly the ecelectric displayed the same law to ecpump fe and ecpump b in fig 7 d it showed that the ecelectric of 30 ppi foam current collector is the lowest 0 602 kwh kg 1 due to the enhanced charge transfer and larger ecsa table s9 thereby the ectotal of 30 ppi foam current collector was the lowest 0 611 kwh kg 1 demonstrating an excellent energy efficiency 3 5 optimization of desalination performance by altering ac content of flow electrode the ac content of flow electrode is an essential factor in desalination performance of fcdi device which can induce the charge transfer by form the charge percolation network presser et al 2012 thus the impact of different ac content 5 wt 7 5 wt 10 wt and 12 5 wt on desalination performance was investigated under short circuited closed cycle scc with batch mode fig 8 shows the desalination performance of different ac content in carbon slurry towards 3 5 g l 1 nacl solution for 1 h desalination in fig 8 a as increasing the ac content the desalination performance of cf fcdi device gradually improved and reached the highest desalination efficiency when the ac content was 12 5 wt similarly the sre increased significantly as rising ac content owing to the formation of charge percolation network in flow electrode fig 8 b as a result the cf fcdi exhibited 3 29 μmol cm 2 min 1 of asrr with 99 8 of sre and 97 0 of ce at 12 5 wt ac content which surpassed most previous reports table s11 it demonstrated that the increase of ac content could prevent charge leakage and cause high charge efficiency ma et al 2018 hence the 30 ppi pore sized 3d foam current collector with 12 5 wt ac content possessed the highest asrr sre and ce exhibiting excellent desalination performance 3 7 real seawater desalination fcdi technology is an emerging strategy for seawater desalination to alleviate freshwater crisis to investigate real seawater desalination performance of cf fcdi the long term desalting tests was carried out in 50 ml simulated seawater real seawater samples from yellow sea and south china sea under scc mode with batch mode for 24 h and 12 h running time respectively the composition of simulated seawater was listed in table s4 before electrosorption process the physical adsorption was performed for 2 h fig 9 presents the conductivity change of seawater samples at 1 2 v applied voltage as illustrated in fig 9 a the sre was achieved at 99 9 and the enrs was 5 73 μmol j 1 in the simulated seawater desalination for 18 h signifying the excellent desalination performance of cf fcdi significantly the asrr and ce were maintained at 0 64 μmol cm 2 min 1 and 88 0 during electrosorption besides the conductivity of saline water declined lineally until the salt ions were mostly removed meanwhile the equilibrium current has dropped off a cliff indicating the pseudo infinite desalination capacity of the cf fcdi device for further seawater desalination afterwards the sem images and eds mappings fig s3 displayed that there is no obvious change in carbon coating layer fig 9 c and d show time dependent conductivity changes of real seawater samples from yellow sea and south china sea in cf fcdi device in fig 9 b the sre of real seawater samples from yellow sea and south china sea were 99 8 and 99 9 respectively demonstrating the applicability of cf fcdi in the real seawater desalination moreover the charge efficiency average salt removal rate and enrs were calculated in table s10 it was remarkable that the charge efficiency of yellow seawater and south china seawater samples are 95 4 and 95 1 respectively indicating a great charge transfer ability of cf fcdi in real seawater desalination furthermore the average salt removal rate enrs corresponding with yellow seawater and south china seawater samples were 0 57 μmol cm 2 min 1 10 2 μmol j 1 and 1 03 μmol cm 2 min 1 9 60 μmol j 1 respectively unraveling the excellent desalination performance of cf fcdi device 4 conclusions in summary the 3d carbon coated nickel foam current collector with appropriate pore size was designed to improve the charge transfer ability of fcdi for real seawater desalinization on the basis of completely discarding the traditional carbon slurry flow channel the 3d foam current collector expanded the charge transfer area between the current collector and carbon slurry as a consequence the desalination performance of 3d foam current collector was facilitated significantly comparing with 2d planar current collector with 20 ppi 3d foam current collector and 5 wt carbon loading the sre of cf fcdi was 2 06 and 3 27 times higher than that of tm fcdi and gp fcdi respectively the electrochemical measurements displayed that the charge transfer resistance was reduced obviously in cf fcdi in comparison with tm fcdi and gp fcdi besides the electrochemically active surface of 3d foam current collector was enlarged to 31 0 mf cm2 which is 1 5 times larger than that of 2d planar current collector titanium mesh in 3d electric field simulation the charge transfer area was expanded by utilizing 3d foam structured current collector to accelerate the charge transportation of fcdi comparing the titanium mesh with narrow charging range between current collector and flow electrode moreover the pore size was adjusted to ensure the fully effective charge transfer area in pores and few invalid regions the cf fcdi with 30 ppi pore sized foam current collector at 12 5 wt ac content achieved 99 8 of sre 3 29 µmol cm 2 min 1 of asrr and 97 0 of ce surpassing most desalination performances in previous reports finally the long term desalination of simulated seawater was performed over 24 h which achieved 88 0 of ce 0 64 μmol cm 2 min 1 of asrr and 5 73 μmol j 1 of enrs owing to the enlarged charge transfer area of 3d foam current collector furthermore the real seawater samples from yellow sea and south china sea were successfully desalinated with 99 8 and 99 9 of sre respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial

15814,the three dimensional 3d carbon coated nickel foam was utilized as current collector in a flow electrode capacitive deionization cf fcdi device to strengthen the charge transfer ability of fcdi device achieving distinguished desalination efficiency for real seawater utilizing 30 ppi carbon coated nickel foam as current collector with 12 5 wt ac content at 1 2 v to treat 3 5 g l 1 nacl solution the cf fcdi achieved 99 8 of salt removal efficiency sre 3 29 µmol cm 2 min 1 of average salt removal rate asrr and 97 0 of charge efficiency ce surpassing most desalination performances in previous reports compared with the titanium mesh tm fcdi and graphite plate gp fcdi current collector the three dimensional electric field and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations demonstrated that 3d foam current collector has obvious stronger competitiveness its intrinsic 3d interconnected open pore structure as flow channel and 3d electric field could not only enlarge the charge contact area between the current collector and flow electrode but also eliminate the restriction of 0 75 mm effective charging range within the carbon slurry in traditional serpentine flow channels finally the excellent desalination performance of cf fcdi device was also verified by treating simulated seawater real seawater samples from yellow sea and south china sea with a high sre of 99 9 99 8 and 99 9 respectively this work introduced a new strategy for enhancing charge transfer ability and overall desalination efficiency of fcdi device by utilizing a novel 3d foam structured current collector for real seawater desalination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flow electrode capacitive deionization current collector three dimensional foam seawater desalination 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi as an emerging desalination technology taking advantage of energy efficient cost effective and environment friendliness has gained extensive attention in the field of water treatment dahiya and mishra 2020 fang et al 2018 jeon et al 2014 ma et al 2016 porada et al 2013 tang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 however the limited usage of active materials and finite surface area of static electrodes is causing a low adsorption capacity and discontinuous process of cdi cai et al 2020 especially the intermittent process for ion adsorption and desorption as the result of electrode regeneration restricted the development and scaling up application of cdi technology cai et al 2020 chang et al 2019 cho et al 2019 to address these issues jeon et al 2013 developed flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi by replacing the static electrodes with flow electrodes since the flow electrode possessed with several orders of magnitude active materials compared with static electrode the desalination efficiency was improved drastically luo et al 2021 ma et al 2019a under short circuited closed cycle scc operation the flow electrodes could be regenerated continuously via the neutralization of charged carbon particles in a single recirculation reservoir he et al 2018 ma et al 2018 2019a 2019b zhang et al 2019 by continuously replenishing new or regenerating flow electrodes into the electrode chamber fcdi exhibited high desalination efficiency and the possibility of continuous operation ma et al 2019c yang et al 2021 nevertheless three main limitations for fcdi still existed such as charge leakage high electronic resistance and power losses owing to the discontinuity conductive contact between activate materials within a flow electrode slurry luo et al 2021 ma et al 2016 the charge transfer ability in fcdi is of paramount importance to mitigate electronic resistance and charge leakage which could significantly influence the desalination performance of fcdi device thus a series of studies were aimed to enhance the charge transfer ability and reduce the liquid solid interface contact resistance by adding the conductive addictive increasing active material content or optimizing the architecture of fcdi devices cai et al 2020 choo et al 2019 liang et al 2017 xu et al 2021 thereinto the optimization of fcdi cell structure is an alternative strategy to ameliorate the charge transfer ability in fcdi cell structure the current collector is actually a crucial point while often neglected that works functionally in current transfer and charge distribution to the flow electrode directing the flow of carbon slurry and providing structural support to the chamber separators zhang et al 2021 traditionally the most commonly employed current collectors in fcdi devices are graphite based plates with serpentine channels carved on the surface and these plates were served as both the charge conductor and flow channel for the flow electrodes however the high proportion of electrolyte and the inconsecutive intrinsic properties of the conductive network in flow electrodes gives rise to a lower charge transfer ability in comparison with typical statical electrodes which seriously hinders the desalination performance of fcdi device besides traditional serpentine flow channel limits the effective contact area between current collector and carbon slurry also has a negative impact on charge transfer ability therefore the titanium mesh membrane assembly fcdi cell tm fcdi with high desalination performance was reported to decrease charge transfer distance by yang et al 2019 comparing with graphite plate based fcdi device gp fcdi the tm fcdi achieved higher average salt removal rate 0 54 μmol cm 2 min 1 and charge efficiency over 80 under 10 wt ac content exhibiting a great desalination performance in tm fcdi the charge resistance was decreased by two dimensional 2d titanium mesh current collector due to a closer charge transfer distance than those of graphite plates dahiya and mishra 2020 he et al 2021 tang and zhou 2020 yang et al 2019 yet there are still some defects and issues hidden behind this strategy i the restricted contact area between the 2d planar current collector titanium mesh or graphite plate and flow electrodes still hinders the rapid charge migration to the carbon particles only a few carbon particles within 0 75 mm distance from the surface of 2d current collectors could be charged effectively as the result of the imbalance in electrical and ionic conductivities yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 ii there is still considerable hydraulic resistance to the flow of carbon slurry in 2d planar flow channel iii the traditional 2d planar flow channel model restricts the active amount of flow electrode in electrode chambers which severely suppresses the desalination performance of fcdi three dimensional 3d electric field would be an effective solution to amplify charge transfer ability of fcdi device for saline water treatment in comparison to conventional 2d planar current collector the 3d current collector as a completely aperiodic 3d sponge configuration can increase the surface to body ratio of the electrode chambers which would greatly improve the charge transfer area and electric field distribution in principle in order to achieve equal transfer length scales or area the areal footprint of 2d planar current collector would require a 330 increase to maintain equal cell volume of 3d current collector long et al 2004 zhang et al 2013 besides the potential distribution of flow electrode in 3d current collector is relatively uniformed accelerating the charge transportation after overcoming the shortage of 2d planar current collector 3d current collector could significantly promote the desalination performance of fcdi due to the super high charge transfer area and strengthened electric field distribution which has not been reported yet herein the 3d carbon coated nickel foam cf fcdi was proposed to replace titanium mesh and graphite plate gp fcdi severing as a novel current collector for the improvement of charge transfer ability and electric field distribution in fcdi device firstly the desalting tests were carried out to investigate the distinct desalination performance of cf fcdi tm fcdi and gp fcdi devices the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was conducted to further compare the charge resistance and capacitance resistance towards three kinds of current collectors subsequently the three dimensional electric field and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations were carried out to simulate the electric field and flow velocity field of carbon slurry in 2d titanium mesh and 3d foam models with different pore sizes furthermore the impact of different pore size in 3d foam current collectors on desalination performance of fcdi device was studied systematically meanwhile the influence of activated carbon ac content on desalination performance of fcdi device was evaluated under batch mode finally the long term desalination was conducted in simulated seawater 40 g l 1 and real seawater yellow sea and south china sea to verify the superior desalination capability of cf fcdi device 2 methods and materials 2 1 the construction of fcdi devices with different current collectors the fcdi devices with different current collectors graphite plate titanium meshes or carbon coated nickel foam were constructed in this work as illustrated in fig 1 the 3d carbon coated nickel foam current collector was inserted outward side of ion exchange membranes iems 0 16 mm in thickness including a pair of anion exchange membrane aem agu astom japan and cation exchange membrane cem cgu astom japan in cf fcdi device the carbon slurry as flow electrode could flow through the 3d foam current collector to be charged for electrosorption the integral rectangular parallelepiped cavity 62 mm 55 mm 5 mm carved in graphite plate for the flow channel of carbon slurry the total contact area between iems and carbon slurry was 3410 mm2 in fig 1 c to avoid streaming or seeping the spacer chamber was optimized by allowing the brine water to flow through directly rather than passing through the electrode plates and iems zhang et al 2022 to study the impact of pore size on desalination performance of cf fcdi the different pore sizes of 3d foam current collectors were chosen as 20 ppi 25 ppi 30 ppi 35 ppi and 40 ppi respectively the pore size parameter of different 3d foam current collectors was displayed in table s1 for tm fcdi the titanium mesh as 2d current collector was placed the outward side of iem the perspex sheet carved with serpentine flow channel was arranged the outward side of titanium mesh severing as flow electrode chamber fig 1 b in gp fcdi the graphite plate carved with serpentine flow channel as 2d current collector at the same position fig 1 a the traditional serpentine channels of tm fcdi and gp fcdi devices were carved as 3 mm in width and 1 mm in depth respectively the total contact area between iems and carbon slurry were both 1324 mm2 in tm fcdi and gp fcdi devices 2 2 desalination experiments in this work the desalting tests were performed in 50 ml of 3 5 g l 1 nacl solution with a stable flow rate of 30 ml min 1 under batch mode for 1 h the 60 g carbon slurry severing as flow electrode were cycled at the flow rate of 30 ml min 1 the carbon slurry was composed of activated carbon ac yec 8a yihuan carbon fuzhou and deionized water the carbon slurry was stirred over 24 h to obtain a homogeneous dispersion state moreover the impact of different ac content on desalination performance was also investigated in which the ac content of carbon slurry were set as 5 wt 7 5 wt 10 wt and 12 5 wt respectively finally the long term desalination process was carried in 50 ml simulated seawater 40 7 g l 1 table s4 and real seawater samples yellow sea and south china sea tables s5

electrochemical workstation chi 660e ch instrument inc shanghai china under an open circuit voltage with an amplitude of 5 mv the range of scan frequency in eis plot was set from 104 to 10 2 hz meanwhile the carbon slurry and saline water were cycled constantly in fcdi device during the eis measurement additionally the electrochemically active surface areas of 3d foam current collector and 2d planar current collector were measured via a three electrode system with working electrode 3d foam current collector or titanium mesh counter electrode pt net and reference electrode ag agcl cyclic voltammetry cv measurements were applied at 10 50 mv s 1 of scan rates in 3 5 g l 1 nacl solution the potential window was extended from 0 3 to 1 3 v vs ag agcl 2 4 the 3d electric field and cfd simulations the 3d electric field and cfd simulations were performed to analyze the distinct charge transfer ability of 2d planar current collector titanium mesh and graphite plate and different pore sized 3d foam current collectors in the 3d electric field simulation the system model followed the law of conservation of charge and set the potential of the unit boundary surface to zero in the cfd simulation the change of carbon slurry density was so small ρ ρ 1 the reynolds coefficient was less than 2100 and the mach number was so small for single phase flow system the carbon slurry was regarded as laminar state and non compressible flow therefore the navier stokes equations n s equations were used to compute the flow state of carbon slurry in electrode chambers moreover the boundary surface of flow channel was set as non slip interface in the boundary condition setting indicating that the velocity of carbon slurry near the boundary surface of current collector is zero in the inlet the boundary condition was set as normal flow velocity boundary condition at 1 67 mm s 1 in the outlet however the pressure field boundary condition was applied 3 results and discussion 3 1 desalination performance of fcdi devices the current collector is a bridge between the external circuit and the flow electrode in fcdi system that determines the desalination performance of fcdi device by influencing the charge transfer ability in cf fcdi the 3d current collector adopts the intrinsic 3d interconnected open pore structure of nickel foam as flow channels replaying the traditional 2d serpentine flow channels which could enlarge the throughput of flow electrode greatly more importantly the charge transfer rate would be facilitated as a result of higher specific surface area and shorter charge transfer distance in 3d foam current collector than those of 2d planar current collector leading to low ohmic resistance thus the 3d foam structured current collector not only possesses an expanded charge transfer area but also eliminates the restriction of flow channels towards carbon slurry which could significantly improve the desalination performance of fcdi device to prevent the ion dissolution of nickel foam a layer of activated carbon was sprayed on the surface of nickel foam current collector in cf fcdi device fig s2 besides the conductivity of nickel foam and carbon coated foam current collectors were measured by digital multimeter in table s2 the resistance of carbon coating foam was 27 ω which is larger than that of exposed nickel foam 18 ω demonstrating the existence of interface resistance 9 ω between the carbon coating layer and nickel foam fig 2 a illustrates the change in desalination efficiency c c0 of saline water and the equilibrium current in the electrosorption process it is clearly presented that the desalination efficiency of cf fcdi was 0 4 during 60 min running time exhibiting the excellent desalination performance comparing with gp fcdi and tm fcdi in terms of equilibrium current the equilibrium current of cf fcdi outclassed the others which benefited from the magnifying charge transfer area of 3d foam structured current collector through a comparative analysis the sre of cf fcdi 45 8 was clearly superior to those of tm fcdi 22 2 and gp fcdi 14 1 under the same condition fig 2 b which is 2 06 and 3 27 times that of tm fcdi and gp fcdi moreover the ce 77 6 in cf fcdi was significantly higher than those of 74 9 in tm fcdi and 62 61 in gp fcdi besides the internal pressures of cf fcdi device and conventional flow channel fcdi device were listed in table s7 it is significant that the internal pressure 1 30 kpa of conventional flow channel fcdi device tm fcdi and gp fcdi is higher than that of cf fcdi due to the smaller electrode chamber 3 mm in depth of flow channel fcdi and 5 mm in depth of cf fcdi resulting in a higher pumping energy consumption of conventional flow channel fcdi device in order to explore the influence of the carbon coating in nickel foam current collector on the desalination performance of the fcdi device the exposed nickel foam was used as current collector nf fcdi to perform a control experiment the optical images sem images and eds mapping of 30 ppi carbon coated foam current collector after 0 h 1 h and 12 h desalination tests were exhibited in fig s3 the fig s3a1 a3 show that there is no obvious variation in optical images of the 30 ppi foam current collectors after 0 h 1 h and 12 h operation the sem images fig s3b1 b3 display that the thickness of carbon coating layer on the 3d foam current collector is around 28 μm and there is no change in thickness after long term desalination indicating a great stability of carbon coating foam current collector meanwhile the eds mapping fig s3c1 c3 further confirmed the formation of carbon coating layer with 28 μm thickness without significant variations in carbon coating layer moreover fig s4 displayed the distinct desalination performance between the cf fcdi and nf fcdi as observed the conductivity of nacl solution in nf fcdi was increased slightly at the preliminary stage of desalination process signifying the nickel ions dissolution phenomenon from the exposed nickel foam it is obvious that the concentration of nickel ions dissolution in the nf fcdi is much higher than that in cf fcdi fig s4c more seriously the concentration of nickel ions dissolution in nf fcdi increased dramatically over running time interestingly after spraying with a layer of activated carbon the conductivity of nacl solution was constantly declined in the whole period of electrosorption process according to the icp oes measurement the nickel ions dissolution was negligible in the saline water it indicated that nickel ions dissolution of the exposed nickel foam was obviously eliminated by coating activated carbon layer moreover the carbon layer on the nickel foam could also increase the affinity with the electrolyte containing carbon particles as the electrode materials comparing to 24 9 of sre and 64 3 of ce of nf fcdi the desalination performance of cf fcdi was improved drastically 45 8 of sre and 77 6 of ce as a result the affinity of activated carbon layer on 3d foam structured current collector surface was conductive to reduce the liquid solid interface resistance between the carbon slurry and current collector contributing the excellent desalination performance of cf fcdi device 3 2 electrochemical analysis in 3d foam current collector the charge percolation pathway was increased significantly improving the charge transfer ability of fcdi device eis measurements were carried out to compare the charge transfer resistances of tm fcdi and cf fcdi devices in fig 3 a the nyquist plot showed that the arc radius of cf fcdi is much smaller than that of tm fcdi revealing the superiority of 3d foam structured current collector over 2d titanium mesh in charge transfer ability the contact resistance of cf fcdi was 1 28 ω which is much smaller than 8 56 ω of tm fcdi further demonstrating the obvious advantage of 3d foam structured current collector over 2d titanium mesh in charge transfer ability moreover the bode plots involve the high frequency area of ohmic resistance middle frequency area of capacitance resistance and low frequency area of charge resistance linnartz et al 2017 yang et al 2019 as shown in fig 3 b the values of cf fcdi and tm fcdi were similar in high frequency area of bode plots indicating no obvious difference of ohmic resistance in saline water nevertheless it cannot be ignored that the ohm value of cf fcdi was lower than that of tm fcdi in low frequency area it revealed that the contact resistance is smaller than that of tm fcdi as the result of expanded charge transfer area by 3d foam structured current collector the ohm value of cf fcdi was less than that of tm fcdi in middle frequency area demonstrating a lower capacitance resistance and a higher capacitance owing to the amplified electrochemically active surface areas of 3d foam structured current collector furthermore the nf fcdi and gp fcdi were also measured in eis plots to investigate the total resistance of exposed 3d nickel foam and 2d graphite plate current collectors as observed in fig s5 there was a capacitance resistance controlled by faradaic reaction due to the nickel ions dissolution from nickel foam linnartz et al 2017 comparing with cf fcdi owing to the absence of activated carbon layer the affinity between the exposed nickel foam and flow electrode was decreased significantly the ohmic resistance and contact resistance were increased to 7 33 ω and 4 21 ω respectively table s8 in gp fcdi however the graphite plate possessed the highest ohmic resistance and contact resistance seriously limiting the charge migration in fcdi overall the cf fcdi device exhibited the significantly superior in charge transfer ability without nickel ion dissolution moreover the electrochemically active surface areas of 3d foam current collector and 2d planar titanium mesh were investigated for further understanding the enhancement of charge transfer ability the electrochemically active surface areas of different current collectors were evaluated by calculating the double layer capacitance cdl based on cv tests in a non faradaic region fig 3 c and d significantly the 3d foam current collector showed an enlarged cdl 31 0 mf cm 2 than titanium mesh 21 3 mf cm 2 in fig 3 e and f indicating an enhanced electrochemical surface area ecsa it could be attributed to that the extended charge transfer area of 3d foam current collector increases the exposure of active sites on the surface of current collector for improving charge percolation and thus facilitates the charge transfer ability of fcdi device fig 4 vividly illustrated the charge transfer pathway of 3d cf fcdi and 2d tm fcdi as illustrated in fig 4 a the carbon slurry was charged by receiving the electrons transportation from the current collector subsequently the charged carbon slurry in electrode chamber of tm fcdi served as flow electrode to adsorb saline ions under the applied electric field however only few charges including the ions and electrons in a narrow charge transfer range within 0 75 mm near the titanium mesh 0 20 mm in width could be absorbed to form the adsorption layer beyond this range the voltage attenuation increased and the desalination efficiency dropped sharply as illustrated in fig 4 b nevertheless the adsorption layer was enlarged in cf fcdi due to the magnifying charge transfer area since the 3d foam current collector possesses the 3d interconnected open pore structure with expanded surface area and high pore volume the electrode chamber can be divided into abundant mass transfer channels which effectively boost the capabilities of electrosorption and charge transportation the electrons can be transferred to the more ac particles in the electrode chamber within the effective charge transfer area from the surface of 3d foam current collector attaining a magnified adsorption layer thereinto the 3d foam current collector is able to achieve large areal adsorption capacities without making sacrifices in electric field intensity that may result from the slow interfacial kinetics correspond with a small electrode surface to body ratio and high ohmic resistance correspond with long charge transfer distance long et al 2004 3 3 3d electric field and cfd simulations in a previous report yang et al designed a titanium mesh as a current collector to enhance the desalination performance by decreasing the charge transfer distance however the charge transfer process only occurs in a narrow area within 0 75 mm distance near the titanium mesh severely limiting the charge transfer yang et al 2019 therefore the 3d foam current collector was introduced to enlarge charge transfer area for further improving the desalination performance of fcdi device in three dimensional electric field simulation the surface of current collector was set to 1 2 v and boundary surface of model units was set to ground 0 v fig 5 illustrated the difference of 3d electric field between 2d structured planar current collector and 3d foam structured current collector model units in 3d electric field simulation we defined the 0 8 1 2 v region as the charge transfer area in fig 5 a the region closing to the 2d planar structured current collector changed from red to cyan color obviously it displayed that the electric field intensity decreased rapidly from the surface of 2d planar current collector the red and yellow color regions were so small and the charge transfer area was so narrow in 2d planar structured current collector indicating that the electrons could only be transferred from the 2d planar current collector to a small quantity of ac particles in the flow channel fig 5 a and c the space far from the 2d planar current collector was considered to be an invalid region where the carbon slurry cannot be fully charged and the electron migration was limited however the 3d foam structured current collector exhibited the superiority in the large charge transfer area the strengthened 3d electric field was illustrated in fig 5 b displaying the expanded red and yellow color regions in the surrounding area of 3d foam current collector meanwhile the charge transfer area of the 3d foam current collector 11 5 was significantly larger than that of 2d planar current collector 8 99 which could enable more ac particles to be charged effectively and improve charge transfer ability and desalination performance of cf fcdi fig 5 d moreover the 3d foam current collector with the intrinsic 3d interconnected open pore structure divided the flow electrode chamber into many mass transfer channels in which the carbon slurry as the flow electrode was charged in the mass transfer channels to absorb the salt ions therefore the three dimensional electric field and flow field in the pores of 3d foam current collector would affect the potential distribution and mass transfer rate of carbon slurry which influence the charge transfer and flow state of carbon slurry especially the pore size of 3d foam current collector is a key factor that influence the 3d electric field and flow field in the pores theoretically the 3d electric field is strengthened but the flow field became worse with the decrease of pore size with decreasing pore size the amount of carbon slurry in the mass transfer channels was decreased causing a negative effect on the desalination capacity of fcdi device therefore it is necessary to find an appropriate pore size with the suitable 3d electric field and flow field for equilibrating the charge transfer and fluidity of carbon slurry in 3d foam current collector fig 6 shows the 3d electric field and cfd simulations of different pore sized 3d foam current collectors the invalid region including the volume of 3d foam current collector and sedimentary region was defined ranging from 0 ml min 1 to 10 ml min 1 0 mm s 1 0 55 mm s 1 with extremely low adsorption current carmona orbezo and dryfe 2021 as displayed in fig 6 a3 d3 the potential distribution in the pores of 3d foam current collector was improved significantly with the decrease of pore size comparing with the potential value in the color bar it can be seen that the potential value in the smaller pore is significantly enhanced therefore as the decrease of pore size the charge transfer ability of the carbon slurry in the 3d foam current collector was improved due to the enlarged charge transfer area meanwhile the proportion of charge transfer area raised from 11 5 to 43 4 with the decrease of pore size in 3d foam models fig 6 a4 d4 in which more ac particles could be charged to improve the desalination performance of fcdi device when the pore size was less than 1 70 mm 30 ppi the charge transfer area filled the entire open pores indicating that the ac particles in the foam pores could be charged effectively similarly the flow field that affected the mass transfer rate of mass transfer channels also plays an important role in cfd simulation the carbon slurry was set up to flow from bottom to the top and the initial velocity of carbon slurry was set at 30 ml min 1 1 67 mm s 1 in fig 6 a5 d5 it is worth noting that there are more low flow velocity regions in the vicinity of the 3d foam current collector with the decrease of pore size resulting in a seriously sedimentation of carbon slurry around the frame of 3d foam current collector as shown in fig 6 a6 d6 the proportion of invalid regions raised from 5 56 to 8 95 with the decrease of pore size in 3d foam models obviously there were more low velocity region in the vicinity of 3d foam current collector with deceasing pore size which could cause a negative impact on mass transfer rate of carbon slurry therefore under the condition that the effective charge potential filled the interconnected open pore structure of 3d foam current collector the invalid regions should be as little as possible it is obvious that 30 ppi pore sized foam current collector has few invalid regions with the full filled charge transfer area in the open pores thus the 30 ppi 1 70 nm could be the appropriate pore size of 3d foam current collector in cf fcdi device according to 3d electric field and cfd simulations 3 4 optimization by altering pore size of 3d foam current collector fig 7 shows the desalination performance of cf fcdi devices with different pore sized 3d foam current collectors notably when the pore size was larger than 1 70 mm 30 ppi the desalination efficiency c c0 was improved and the sre and ce increased due to the strengthened 3d electric field while the pore size was smaller than 1 70 mm 30 ppi the sedimentation of carbon slurry became a serious problem resulting in a decrease of ce and sre and an attenuation of desalination efficiency in fcdi due to the increased invalid region thereinto the sre and ce of 30 ppi pore sized 3d foam current collector were 90 2 and 85 4 respectively which is superior than the other pore sized 3d foam current collectors furthermore the internal pressure of brine in spacer was 1 30 kpa generally the flow resistance of flow electrode in electrode chamber was higher with smaller open pore due to the obstruction of 3d foam flow channels in table s7 the internal pressure of flow electrode in fcdi devices increased from 0 70 kpa to 0 95 kpa with the decrease of pore size in 3d foam current collector it was interesting that the ecpump fe and ecpump b of different pore sized foam current collector in fig 7 c exhibit the inverse relationship to sre and ce in fig 7 b the ecpump b corresponding with 20 ppi 25 ppi 30 ppi 35 ppi and 40 ppi were displayed in table s9 when the pore size was larger than 30 ppi 1 70 mm the ecpump fe and ecpump b became lower with the decrease of pore size due to the enhanced adsorption capacity of 3d foam current collector when the pore size was smaller than 30 ppi 1 70 mm nevertheless the ecpump fe and ecpump b became higher with the decrease of pore size due to the weakened adsorption capacity of foam current collector the ecpump fe and ecpump b at 30 ppi foam current collector was the lowest due to the highest desalination capacity indicating a great pumping energy efficiency similarly the ecelectric displayed the same law to ecpump fe and ecpump b in fig 7 d it showed that the ecelectric of 30 ppi foam current collector is the lowest 0 602 kwh kg 1 due to the enhanced charge transfer and larger ecsa table s9 thereby the ectotal of 30 ppi foam current collector was the lowest 0 611 kwh kg 1 demonstrating an excellent energy efficiency 3 5 optimization of desalination performance by altering ac content of flow electrode the ac content of flow electrode is an essential factor in desalination performance of fcdi device which can induce the charge transfer by form the charge percolation network presser et al 2012 thus the impact of different ac content 5 wt 7 5 wt 10 wt and 12 5 wt on desalination performance was investigated under short circuited closed cycle scc with batch mode fig 8 shows the desalination performance of different ac content in carbon slurry towards 3 5 g l 1 nacl solution for 1 h desalination in fig 8 a as increasing the ac content the desalination performance of cf fcdi device gradually improved and reached the highest desalination efficiency when the ac content was 12 5 wt similarly the sre increased significantly as rising ac content owing to the formation of charge percolation network in flow electrode fig 8 b as a result the cf fcdi exhibited 3 29 μmol cm 2 min 1 of asrr with 99 8 of sre and 97 0 of ce at 12 5 wt ac content which surpassed most previous reports table s11 it demonstrated that the increase of ac content could prevent charge leakage and cause high charge efficiency ma et al 2018 hence the 30 ppi pore sized 3d foam current collector with 12 5 wt ac content possessed the highest asrr sre and ce exhibiting excellent desalination performance 3 7 real seawater desalination fcdi technology is an emerging strategy for seawater desalination to alleviate freshwater crisis to investigate real seawater desalination performance of cf fcdi the long term desalting tests was carried out in 50 ml simulated seawater real seawater samples from yellow sea and south china sea under scc mode with batch mode for 24 h and 12 h running time respectively the composition of simulated seawater was listed in table s4 before electrosorption process the physical adsorption was performed for 2 h fig 9 presents the conductivity change of seawater samples at 1 2 v applied voltage as illustrated in fig 9 a the sre was achieved at 99 9 and the enrs was 5 73 μmol j 1 in the simulated seawater desalination for 18 h signifying the excellent desalination performance of cf fcdi significantly the asrr and ce were maintained at 0 64 μmol cm 2 min 1 and 88 0 during electrosorption besides the conductivity of saline water declined lineally until the salt ions were mostly removed meanwhile the equilibrium current has dropped off a cliff indicating the pseudo infinite desalination capacity of the cf fcdi device for further seawater desalination afterwards the sem images and eds mappings fig s3 displayed that there is no obvious change in carbon coating layer fig 9 c and d show time dependent conductivity changes of real seawater samples from yellow sea and south china sea in cf fcdi device in fig 9 b the sre of real seawater samples from yellow sea and south china sea were 99 8 and 99 9 respectively demonstrating the applicability of cf fcdi in the real seawater desalination moreover the charge efficiency average salt removal rate and enrs were calculated in table s10 it was remarkable that the charge efficiency of yellow seawater and south china seawater samples are 95 4 and 95 1 respectively indicating a great charge transfer ability of cf fcdi in real seawater desalination furthermore the average salt removal rate enrs corresponding with yellow seawater and south china seawater samples were 0 57 μmol cm 2 min 1 10 2 μmol j 1 and 1 03 μmol cm 2 min 1 9 60 μmol j 1 respectively unraveling the excellent desalination performance of cf fcdi device 4 conclusions in summary the 3d carbon coated nickel foam current collector with appropriate pore size was designed to improve the charge transfer ability of fcdi for real seawater desalinization on the basis of completely discarding the traditional carbon slurry flow channel the 3d foam current collector expanded the charge transfer area between the current collector and carbon slurry as a consequence the desalination performance of 3d foam current collector was facilitated significantly comparing with 2d planar current collector with 20 ppi 3d foam current collector and 5 wt carbon loading the sre of cf fcdi was 2 06 and 3 27 times higher than that of tm fcdi and gp fcdi respectively the electrochemical measurements displayed that the charge transfer resistance was reduced obviously in cf fcdi in comparison with tm fcdi and gp fcdi besides the electrochemically active surface of 3d foam current collector was enlarged to 31 0 mf cm2 which is 1 5 times larger than that of 2d planar current collector titanium mesh in 3d electric field simulation the charge transfer area was expanded by utilizing 3d foam structured current collector to accelerate the charge transportation of fcdi comparing the titanium mesh with narrow charging range between current collector and flow electrode moreover the pore size was adjusted to ensure the fully effective charge transfer area in pores and few invalid regions the cf fcdi with 30 ppi pore sized foam current collector at 12 5 wt ac content achieved 99 8 of sre 3 29 µmol cm 2 min 1 of asrr and 97 0 of ce surpassing most desalination performances in previous reports finally the long term desalination of simulated seawater was performed over 24 h which achieved 88 0 of ce 0 64 μmol cm 2 min 1 of asrr and 5 73 μmol j 1 of enrs owing to the enlarged charge transfer area of 3d foam current collector furthermore the real seawater samples from yellow sea and south china sea were successfully desalinated with 99 8 and 99 9 of sre respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial
