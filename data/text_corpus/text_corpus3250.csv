16250,with a growing consciousness of the importance of nature stewardship researchers are focusing their efforts on utilizing renewable energy particularly solar energy to address environmental concerns in this context photocatalysis has long been viewed as one of the most promising cleaning methods hence we have prepared a sunlight active phytol assisted zno tio2 nanocomposite pztn for photocatalytic bacterial deactivation and dye degradation process the pztn photocatalysis effectively deactivated the bacterial pathogens as well as malachite green dye within 240 min under direct sunlight moreover this will be the first complete study on safety level assessment of photocatalytically remediated water through toxicity studies the obtained results evidenced that photocatalytically deactivated bacteria and mg dye showed to have no toxic effects signifying that the pztn photocatalyzed water seems to be extremely safe for the environment as a result of this research we suggest that the pztn could be a promising sunlight active photocatalyst for environmental water treatment on the other hand biofouling is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the marine environment bacteria are the first organisms to foul surfaces and produce biofilms on man made submerged materials interestingly pztn coated pvc plastic films effectively disallowed biofilms on their surface this part of this research suggests that pztn coated pvc plastics are the best alternative for biofouling management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sunlight active photocatalyst bacterial deactivation dye degradation toxicity assessment anti biofouling activity 1 introduction presence of pathogenic bacteria and toxic dye pollutants in water bodies are the most serious health issues around the globe for humans as well as aquatic creatures younis et al 2021 in aquaculture industries the bacterial infection has been known to cause devastating impacts on aquatic cultivars which leads to severe economic loss and bothers the growth and sustainability of aquaculture defoirdt et al 2007 the abrupt outbreak of diseases in aquaculture is majorly caused by vibrio species such as vibrio harveyi v parahaemolyticus v vulnificus v alginolyticus v campbellii v anguillarum and other species santhakumari et al 2017 notably v harveyi is a ubiquitous gram negative pathogen that frequently found in seawater and being as a natural inhabitant of the gastrointestinal tract of aquatic animals hence it has related with large scale outbreaks in larval and juvenile penaeids and fish salini et al 2019 till date antibiotics have been applied to indulge the bacterial infections in aquaculture however the wide and frequent use of antibiotics has resulted in causing drug resistance in bacterial strains which leads to not showing effective bacterial control in aquaculture pérez sánchez et al 2018 malachite green mg a toxic cationic triphenylmethane dye has been used as a topical antiseptic to treat protozoan fungal and bacterial infections in aquaculture srivastava et al 2004 however it is always present in the wastewater and will become a highly lethal compound due to their acute and chronic toxicity hashimoto et al 2011 in addition mg has broadly been used as a disinfectant food additive anthelmintic and as a dyeing agent for the textile industry notably mg is able to cause irreversible damages in the liver kidney and intestine in aquatic animals culp et al 1996 the us food and drug administration fda agency has banned the use of mg in aquaculture industries hence this dye has been forbidden in many countries however it has illegitimately been used in some countries because of its high efficiency with low cost zhu et al 2016 in mammalian cells it acts as a respiratory enzyme poison and causes tumors in the lungs breast and ovaries stammati et al 2005 on another hand biofouling seems to be a major ecological dilemma for submerged man made objects in aquaculture significantly improving biofouling and corrosion possibly affecting the flotation of polyethylene plastics bera et al 2018 biofouling a regular and progressive settlement of microorganisms and invertebrates in submerged surfaces kim et al 2021 in aquaculture systems biofouling species decrease water flow and promote biodeposition on plastic pipes jeong et al 2021 there are multiple phases to this process as well as distinct types of fouling organisms in the very first stage bacteria fungus and diatoms build biofilms next smooth foulers such as sponges bryozoans and macroalgae arrive and finally difficult foulers such as barnacles mussels and calcified tubular echinoderms establish in the structure baker et al 1998 during the biofouling development bacterial survival attachment multiplication and recruitment on material surfaces have a strong influence li et al 2020 contemporary anti fouling technologies hinder the biofouling process through releasing large volumes of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere chen et al 2019 as a result biofouling control prioritises biocompatible strategy with excellent inhibitory effectiveness without any negative impacts to the environment chen et al 2021 in recent years metal oxide photocatalysts have become known as a promising material for a wide range of applications in environmental remediation abidi et al 2019 paul et al 2010 mirzaei et al 2018 metal oxide photocatalysts have great attention in the field of photocatalysis which can generate reactive oxygen species ros thereby productively eradicate the environmental pollutants in the water samples under light irradiation kusiak nejman et al 2019 titanium dioxide tio2 is well known and nearly every one known photocatalyst for environmental applications because of their photo stability low cost and non toxicity ye et al 2017 dong et al 2015 however the weak utilization of solar energy and the short diffusion length of photogenerated exciton are limiting the rate of a photocatalytic performance of tio2 under sunlight due to its wide bandgap xiao et al 2021 therefore modulating the bandgap absorption to the visible region is needed for practical application under direct sunlight in this regard the application of bandgap narrowed coupled semiconductors in the photocatalytic process is regarded as an alternative approach to enhance the activity of photocatalysts by inhibiting the recombination of electron hole pairs huang et al 2021 in previous our group has reported a bandgap narrowed carbon dots coated tio2 nanocomposite dctn for photocatalytic bacterial deactivation under direct sunlight alexpandi et al 2020 in this study a bandgap narrowed sunlight active zno tio2 nanocomposite pztn was prepared using phytol as a capping agent through hydrothermal method phytol an acyclic diterpene alcohol mainly present in the part of chlorophyll in plants largely used as a precursor for the manufacture of vitamin e islam et al 2018 superior hydrophobic nature of phytol deliberated its utilization as a biosurfactant prabha et al 2019 in the present study the decreased bandgap of pztn resulted in enhanced photocatalytic activity under direct sunlight hence the photocatalytic bacterial disinfection efficacy and dye degradation potential of pztn were assessed for environmental application in addition the toxicity level of photocatalytically remediated water was evaluated using in vivo toxicity study with histopathological analysis furthermore the pztn was coated with pvc polymer to construct an antibiofim plastic film for biofouling management in water environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of phytol assisted zno tio2 nanocomposite pztn all the chemicals

xps and uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy uv drs 2 2 photocatalytic bacterial deactivation of pztn under sunlight all the photocatalytic experiments for bacterial deactivation and dye degradation were carried out in the sunlight between 10 am to 2 pm throughout the months of april to june with a light intensity of 968 61 w m2 as measured by a photometer all the photocatalytic experiments were performed at science campus alagappa university india 10 0926 n 78 7866 e the photocatalytic bacterial deactivation efficacy of prepared pztn was assessed using vibrio harveyi mtcc

rpm for 10 min and washed twice with pbs then the cell pellets were resuspended in 100 ml saline water in a glass beaker after that 50 mg of pztn was added to the bacterial suspension and kept in the dark condition for 10 min finally the experimental setup was exposed to direct sunlight as shown in fig s1 every 60 min 100 µl of the experimental water was taken and spread on lb agar plates to count the bacterial density christensen et al 2003 the photocatalytic generation of ros in water under sunlight was confirmed through 2 3 bis 2 methoxy 4 nitro 5 sulfophenyl 5 carboxanilide 2h tetrazolium xtt and terephthalic acid ta method alexpandi et al 2020 for the environmental sample the natural seawater was collected from the coastal area of central marine fisheries research institute mandapam india 9 161740 n 79 132167 e and allowed to the photocatalytic water disinfection under sunlight exposure in this experiment 100 ml of collected seawater was kept in the dark condition for 10 min in

dataset 2 3 assessing the safety level of photocatalytically inactivated bacteria the toxicity of the photocatalytically inactivated bacteria was determined using survival assay and histopathological analysis with tomato clownfish as described in the background dataset 2 4 photocatalytic dye degradation of pztn under sunlight the photocatalytic dye degradation efficacy of pztn was estimated using malachite green as the model dye pollutant in the experiment 50 mg of prepared pztn was dispersed in 100 ml of an mg aqueous solution 100 mg l prior to sunlight irradiation the reaction mixture was placed in the dark for 30 min to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and dye during the photodegradation process under sunlight a 3 ml sample was taken from the reaction mixture at 30 min intervals and centrifuged to remove the photocatalysts then the reduction of mg was determined by observing the change in the density at od655nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer chowdhury et al 2014 2 5 assessing the cytotoxicity of photodecomposed mg dye after the dye degradation by pztn photocatalysis further to confirm the complete inactivation of mg dye as well as the non toxic nature of photocatalytically degraded dye toxicity studies such as acute toxicity assay cardiotoxicity assessment ros detection apoptosis detection and histopathology analysis were performed with zebrafish model as given in the background dataset 2 6 synthesis of pztn coated pvc plastic for anti biofouling application further the pztn was coated on polyvinyl chloride pvc polymer to form an antibiofilm plastic film for anti biofouling application in the preparation 1 g of pvc was dissolved in 10 ml of n methyl 2 pyrrolidone under stirring overnight then 0 1 g of prepared pztn was gently added to the pvc solution under stirring the resultant pvc pztn mixture was spread on a petri plate and dried for 48 h at 50 c after the prepared pztn pvc films were characterized using fe sem and ft ir analysis and allowed to assess their anti biofouling activity using in vitro studies the radius of the prepared film s circle was 4 cm and the circle s area was 50 cm2 2 7 antibiofilm activity of pztn pvc against fouling bacteria for anti biofouling studies the prepared pztn pvc films were cutted into 1 1 cm sized pieces and subjected to biofilm assay with reference strains v harveyi mtcc 7771 v campbellii atcc baa 1116 v parahaemolyticus atcc 17 802 v alginolyticus v vulnificus mtcc 1145 and isolated biofouling strains v parahaemolyticus accession number mk100431 bacillus kochii mk100427 marinobacter salsuginis mk100392 and staphylococcus xylosus mk100439 the biofilms were formed on the pvc and pztn pvc for 48 h at 30 c in 24 well mtp supplemented with 1 ml of sterile lb broth after incubation the planktonic cells were discarded and adhering biofilm cells were gently rinsed with distilled water then the biofilm cells were stained with 0 2 crystal violet and suspended in 1 ml of 20 glacial acetic acid further the intensity was measured at od570nm using uv vis spectroscopy abirami et al 2020 to validate the anti biofilm potential of pztn pvc films microscopic analyses such as light microscopic and fluorescence microscope analysis were performed with 0 2 crystal violet and 0 1 acridine orange staining respectively durgadevi et al 2019 2 8 statistical analysis all the experiments were performed in triplicates the values were expressed as a mean standard deviation the statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics 23 spss ltd hong kong software package a dunnett s anova test and student t test were used to compare treated groups and control 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural characterization of phytol assisted zno tio2 nanocomposite pztn in fig 1 a the fe sem image showed the sphere shaped structure of the prepared pztn the hr tem image also revealed that the shape of the prepared nanostructure was spherical as shown in fig 1b the resulting spherical morphology in hr tem analysis was quite similar to the shape observed through fe sem analysis further the lattice spacing of the 0 264 nm of 002 plane and 0 351 nm of 101 plane revealed the existence of zno and tio2 in the prepared pztn photocatalyst mukhopadhyay et al 2016 the obtained he tem coupled saed analysis evidently demonstrated the doping of zno with tio2 in addition eds analysis was performed to determine the actual loading of zno on the surface of tio2 the obtained edx spectrum showed four peaks which were identified as carbon 7 84 oxygen 43 62 zinc 21 52 and titanium 27 02 confirming the doping of zno with tio2 in the prepared nanocomposite fig s2 in fig 1c fig s3 the xrd spectrum showed the reflections at 27 4 36 1 39 1 41 2 44 1 54 4 56 6 63 1 64 1 and 69 8 2θ were subjected to the 101 112 105 211 and 215 crystallographic planes of rutile tio2 whereas the reflections at 27 4 36 1 39 1 41 2 44 1 54 4 56 6 63 1 64 1 and 69 8 2θ were subjected to the 100 002 101 102 110 103 200 112 and 201 planes of hexagonal zno the obtained xrd result undoubtedly demonstrated the successful doping of zno on the tio2 in the nanocomposite in fig s4 the ft ir spectrum reveals that the characteristic peaks at 3424 cm 1 2919 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 indicate the presence of oh c h and c o groups respectively the absorption bands showing around 509 cm 1 and 430 cm 1 are responsible for the stretching of zn o and ti o respectively the absorption at 1440 cm 1 represents the combination of ti o c and zn o c vibrations notably the absorption around 891 cm 1 represents the formation of zn o ti stretching in the prepared nanocomposite salavati niasari et al 2016 mofokeng et al 2017 in fig 1e the high resolution c1s xps spectrum shows that the binding energies of zn 2p1 2 and zn 2p3 2 are 1025 1 ev and 1047 2 ev revealing the occurrence of zn2 in the pztn in fig 1f the o1s spectrum reveals that the most intense peak at 529 5 ev denotes ti o zn o bonds and other peaks at 531 6 ev and 534 5 ev were allocated to c oh c o c and zn o ti bonds respectively pérez gonzález et al 2021 in fig 6g the ti 2p high resolution spectrum shows that two peaks at 458 0 and 463 1 ev of the binding energies of ti2p 3 2 and ti2p 1 2 indicate the presence of tio2 in the prepared nanocomposite bharti et al 2016 the high resolution c1s spectrum shows two peaks at 284 2 ev and 288 0 ev fig 6h which are responsible for the c c c h and coo bonds respectively alexpandi et al 2020 overall the xps and ft ir data proposed that the strong interaction between zno and tio2 is formed through the development of zn o ti bonds during nanocomposite synthesis by the assistance of phytol 3 2 reduced bandgap for improved photocatalytic activity the main goal of this study is to enhance the photocatalytic performance of tio2 by narrowing the bandgap and enhancing the visible light absorption since the light absorption of the photocatalyst influences the photocatalytic performance wang et al 2014 the uv drs analysis was performed to verify the aptitude of visible light absorption of pztn under sunlight the uv drs spectra demonstrate that the pure tio2 and zno did not show absorption edge in the region between 400 and 800 nm on the other hand the pztn displayed a higher and extending absorbance in the visible light region fig s5 therefore the prepared pztn is expected to exhibit a superior photocatalytic performance under sunlight further it is understood that the photocatalysis process is the direct absorption of photons with the aid of bandgap of the nanomaterials to produce electron hole pairs zheng et al 2015 naimi joubani et al 2015 in general the electron excited from the valence band to the conduction band is initiated by light absorption with energy equal to or greater than the band gap liao et al 2004 in the present study the bandgap of pztn was calculated to be 2 84 ev which indicates that pztn has a narrowed bandgap than pure tio2 3 2 ev and zno 3 16 ev fig s6 the nanomaterials with the bandgap energy 3 1 ev can only be activated by uv light which seems unattainable to be activated by visible light the prepared pztn has a lower bandgap than that of pure tio2 and zno the narrowed bandgap energy could be attributed to the formation of new energy levels in sub bands by defects such as oxygen vacancies within the prohibited band of tio2 and zno fig s7 which would decrease the bandgap of the pztn sun et al 2015 it is known that the size of photocatalysts within nanoscale regime might results in a blue shift in the absorption wavelength and higher band gap energy owing to quantum confinement effect xi et al 2010 as seen in pure tio2 3 2 ev and zno 3 16 ev on the other hand the phenomenon is reverse that the smaller size of pztn results in a red shift in the absorption wavelength which narrows the bandgap and enlarges the absorption range sun et al 2015 resulting in improved photocatalytic activity under sunlight further the higher charge carrier separation prolongs the lifetime of the hole electron pair which promoting the formation of ros resulting in a better photocatalytic performance under sunlight liao et al 2004 zheng et al 2015 upadhyay et al 2019 3 3 improved ros production in water under sunlight the prepared pztn exhibit increased visible light absorption due to its narrowed bandgap resulting in an improved photocatalytic activity under sunlight the improved production of reactive oxygen species ros by pztn photocatalyst was proved by the xtt and terephthalic acid method in the xtt assay the produced o2 radicals convert the yellow xtt dye into an orange coloured compound called formazan the intensity of coloured formazan is represents the amount of o2 radicals in the sample agbe et al 2019 accordingly the assay result revealed that the o2 generation in pztn is superior compared to pure tio2 and zno under sunlight fig s8 on the other hand ta responds with oh radicals to produce a fluorescent product 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid hta which emits fluorescence at 420 nm gonzalez et al 2018 the intensity of hta is denotes the amount of oh radicals the assay result showed a higher fluorescence intensity of hta which denotes the improved production of oh radicals in pztn photocatalysis under sunlight fig s9 3 4 photocatalytic bacterial deactivation under sunlight the photocatalytic bacterial elimination of pztn under sunlight was assessed using v harveyi as a model bacterium the results show that in the condition of pztn photocatalyst time dependent bacterial eradication was obtained during sunlight irradiation fig s10 the findings showed that the total mortality of v harveyi cells was seen after 240 min in the presence of the pztn photocatalyst but no significant bacterial reduction was observed in the presence of tio2 as well as zno under sunlight furthermore under dark circumstances the pztn tio2 and zno treated samples had no antibacterial effect which revealed that the photocatalytic activity is responsible for the bacterial eradication instead of the antibacterial activity interestingly the prepared pztn effectively eradicated the bacterial pollutants in the natural seawater in fig s11 the results indicate that the pztn photocatalysis exhibited a successful bacterial killing of natural seawater within 240 min under sunlight our previous report revealed that carbon dots tio2 nanocomposite effectively killed the bacterial load in the natural seawater within 240 min under sunlight alexpandi et al 2020 3 5 mode of bacterial deactivation of pztn photocatalysis the fundamental processes of tio2 based photocatalytic bacterial inactivation are well understood in a word photoinduced free radicals create oxidative stress which destroys membranes and cellular components eventually leading to bacterial mortality dalrymple et al 2010 as a consequence photocatalytic bacterial deactivation is profoundly associated with the induction of oxidative stress ros in fig 2 b the result reveals that the ros intensity in photocatalyzed cells was significantly augmented than that of normal cells at the start of the process following that the strength of ros steadily found to decrease which implies the bacterial killing of v harveyi with increasing exposure time subsequently the cell viability of v harveyi during pztn photocatalysis was assessed through alamarblue assay the fluorescence intensity of reduced alamarblue a pink coloured fluorescent product with the level of fluorescence related to the amount of live cells selvaraj et al 2019 the reduction of the fluorescence intensity reveals the time dependent loss of bacterial viability fig 2c which confirmed the bacterial death of v harveyi during pztn photocatalysis under sunlight further fe sem analysis was performed to examine the morphological characteristics in order to truly comprehend the damaging consequences of ros induced antibacterial effects in v harveyi in the control samples fe sem analysis exhibited unbroken cells with normal morphology whereas the broken cells with noticeable alterations such as membrane damage caused by developing pits and holes in their cell membrane were obtained in the photocatalyzed cells fig 2d overall the obtained fe sem data concluded that the bactericidal action of pztn photocatalysis was accomplished via ros dependent severe injury of cell membrane and cellular components of v harveyi 3 6 assessment of safety level of photocatalyzed bacteria using tomato clownfish 3 6 1 toxicity assessment with survival assay several studies have discovered that when chemical disinfectants interact with natural organic matter in water toxic disinfection byproducts are produced making the aquatic environment more hazardous wang et al 2021a therefore it is necessary to assess the toxicity of disinfected water to minimize harmful consequences in the present study we have assessed the toxicity of photocatalyzed v harveyi cells through in vivo studies with tomato clownfish amphiprion frenatus a species of marine fish in fig 3 a the survival assay revealed that non photocatalyzed normal v harveyi infected fish were died completely within 48 h but photocatalyzed v harveyi infected fish showed no significant mortality indicating that v harveyi was successfully disinfected with sunlight using pztn photocatalysis moreover the physical observation illustrates that the infected fish exhibit a variety of gross clinical signs such as discolored skin inflammation or hemorrhaging of the skin lethargy weight loss loss of appetite and cloudy eyes but photocatalyzed bacteria infected fish appear to be unaffected by the infection of v harveyi fig 3b 3 6 2 histopathology analysis with infected organs histopathology an essential resource for health diagnosis and screening as it identifies changes in cells and tissues affected by infections it is known that the gill is the first organ by which pathogens come into contact with fish it is more vulnerable to damage than other tissues fonseca et al 2016 as demonstrated in fig 4 a v harveyi has caused considerable pathological alterations such as lamellar fusion congested branchial blood vessels multifocal fusions of secondary lamella and damaged erythrocytes in the gills of infected fish on the other hand the photocatalyzed v harveyi did not cause any injurious effect on the gills and seems to be a normal fish with natural gill anatomy in fig 4b the histology of intestines showed the gross abnormalities such as necrosis of lamina propria collapsed tunica mucosa hyperplasia of goblet cells severe infiltration of lymphocytes damages in internal as well as external muscular layer in the v harveyi infected fish as expected the photocatalyzed cells treated intestines have normal structure similar to untreated control similarly the v harveyii infected kidney also showed the highest levels of histopathological changes such as collapsed proximal or distal tubulus expanded and abnormal bowman s space and necrosis of hematopoietic tissues fig 4c the kidneys treated with photocatalyzed cells exhibit normal structure identical to the untreated control this is the first study to show that photocatalytically disinfected bacteria do not pose a major risk to aquatic organisms upon photocatalytic bacterial deactivation 3 7 photocatalytic mg dye degradation of pztn under sunlight the photocatalytic activity of pztn under sunlight was assessed using the degradation of malachite green mg as a model dye pollutant dye degradation was directly proportional to the time of sunlight exposure in a blank trial without photocatalyst 3 of photolysis self degradation of mg was observed whereas complete dye degradation was noticed in the presence of pztn photocatalyst under sunlight for 240 min fig 5 a in addition the photocatalytic performance of pztn was superior to pure zno and tio2 under sunlight when the photocatalysts are exposed to sunlight excitation of the valence electron produces photoelectrons which can generate free radicals that degrade dye pollutants in water pei et al 2013 in fig s12 the schematic diagram representing the possible mechanism for degradation process of mg dye by pztn photocatalyst under sunlight irradiation once the pztn exposed to sunlight the photocatalytic reaction induced by excitation of the valence electron and produces photoelectrons which can generate free radicals oh and o2 that degrades the mg dye in water 3 8 gc ms analysis of degradation by products some degradation by products may become more toxic than the parental compound eslami et al 2020 pereira et al 2014 hence gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis was used to detect if any by products were produced during the photodegradation of mg under pztn photocatalysis fig s13 the gc ms spectrum revealed that there are no peaks detected in the photodegraded mg sample which suggests that no harmful by products were produced during pztn photocatalysis mediated dye degradation process the outcome of gc ms analysis evidently confirmed that the pztn photocatalysis did not produce any degradation by products 3 9 toxicity evaluation of mg dye and photodegraded mg dye pmg using zebrafish 3 9 1 non acute toxic nature of photodegraded mg dye in order to determine the toxicity of photocatalytically degraded mg dye pmg the survival assay was performed using zebrafish as a model system in common mg dye can cause irreversible damage to several organs including the liver kidney and intestine of aquatic animals in mammalian cells it can act as a respiratory enzyme poison and cause tumors in the lungs breasts and ovaries culp et al 1996 the toxicity results reveal that mg dye caused total death of zebrafish within 6 h whereas the pmg did not show any lethal effects to zebrafish fig 5b which indicates the complete degradation of mg without the formation of harmful by products upon pztn photocatalysis under sunlight irradiation 3 9 2 non cardiotoxic nature of photocatalytically degraded mg dye the mode of mg toxicity in zebrafish larvae was predicted using some preliminary studies such as cardiotoxicity observations ros estimation and apoptosis detection in fig 5c the light microscopic observation revealed the cardiotoxicity induced by mg dye in zebrafish larvae 4 dpf it is known that cardiotoxicity affects the heart muscles and cardiac tissues resulting in a disruption of the electrophysiology of the heart previous study reported that mg induces cardiovascular toxicity by inhibiting the vascular endothelial growth factor vegf and arresting the heart rate jang et al 2009 our result also showed the evident abnormalities of the heart morphology such as cardiac looping defects and larger pericardial edema in the mg treated animals whereas normal looped hearts were observed in the photocatalyzed mg treated animals similar to that of the normal control fig 5c indicating the non cardiovascular toxic nature of photodegraded mg dye 3 9 3 non cellular toxic nature of photocatalytically degraded mg dye in general mg dye causes higher cytotoxic effects including lipid peroxidation cell apoptosis and cellular damage by formation of ros radicals hence the cellular toxicity induced by the mg dye in zebrafish larvae was observed by confirming the oxidative stress using 2 7 dichlorofluorescin diacetate dcfda method fig 6 a shows the fl intensity of dcfda inside the animals which represents the level of intracellular ros the ros intensity was increased in the mg exposed fish which corroborates the oxidative stress induced toxicity of the mg dye fig 6b on the other hand the ros intensity was significantly reduced in the pmg exposed fish suggesting that the photodegraded mg dye did not cause any oxidative stress to aquatic creatures subsequently the outcome of ros irregularities in the cellular toxicity and cell apoptosis was detected by ao etbr staining as shown in fig 6c patches of red colored fluorescence emission in zebrafish denote dead cells induced by ros mediated apoptotic cell death resulting in mortality during prolonged exposure to the mg dye on the other hand few patches of apoptotic cells were found in the photocatalyzed mg group like normal group suggesting that this photodegraded mg dye did not show any significant cellular toxicity 3 9 4 non organ toxic nature of photocatalytically degraded mg dye mg dye can induce permanent damages to several organs including the liver kidney and intestine of aquatic animals resulting in weight loss anemia and death ultimately culp et al 1996 to validate this statement the toxic effects of mg as well as photodegraded mg dye in gill intestine kidney liver and brain were evaluated using histopathology analysis with adult zebrafish prior to histopathological analysis the toxicity assay result shows that all the animals were dead in the mg dye treated group within 22 h due to its acute toxicity whereas no animals were affected in the photodegraded mg group fig 7 a suggesting that the photocatalytically destroyed mg dye did not show any toxicity to adult zebrafish in addition the physical observation of the experiment animals showed the severe internal accumulation of mg dye and its toxic effects in adult zebrafish whereas the photodegraded mg did not show any toxic effects indicating the non toxic nature of photocatalytically destroyed dye by pztn photocatalysis fig 7b further the toxic effect of mg dye in zebrafish as well as the non toxic nature of photocatalytically destroyed dye was assessed at organ level using histopathological studies the histopathology of gills shows that the mg dye caused several poisonous effects in gills such as multifocal fusions of primary lamella and secondary lamella brutal damage in branchial blood vessels and hyperplasia of gill epithelium fig 8 a the histology of intestines showed the disgusting abnormalities including necrosis of lamina propria collapsed tunica mucosa hyperplasia of goblet cells severe infiltration of lymphocytes damages in internal as well as external muscular layer in the mg dye treated fish fig 8b the mg treated kidney also has some histopathological changes such as collapsed proximal or distal tubulus expanded and reduced bowman s space and necrosis of hematopoietic tissues fig 8c as expected these histological abnormalities were not found in the gill intestine or kidney of photodegraded mg dye treated animals and were identical to untreated control animals on the other hand the collapsed hepatic sinusoids hyperplasia of center lobular vein and necrosis of melanomacrophage centres were observed in the liver of the mg treated animals fig 8d similarly mg dye directly damages the brain by causing diffuse swelling of the brain tissue as shown in fig 8e the photodegraded mg dye treated animals did not show any pathological changes in liver and brain and were healthy like the untreated control animals overall the histopathological results indicated that the photodegraded mg dye did not show any toxic effects to zebrafish suggesting that the photocatalytically degraded dye by pztn photocatalysis is environmentally safe 3 10 reusability of pztn to determine the recyclability of pztn the photocatalytic experiments were performed multiple times with experimented nanocomposite for bacterial deactivation and dye degradation under sunlight the result found that no major decrease in photocatalytic performance was observed when pztn was recycled for five cycles fig s14 showing the recyclable nature of pztn since the number of recycling times increased the photocatalytic performance of pztn decreased slightly it might be due to the loss of nanocomposites during the recycling process 3 11 pztn pvc plastic for anti biofouling application the phenomenon of biofouling is initiated by the formation of biofilms on man made sub merged materials zardus et al 2008 bacterial cells create an extracellular polymeric substance matrix after adherence which forms a biofilm biofilms could grow on a number of immersed surfaces such as ship hulls and water supply system pipes teodosio et al 2013 bacterial adherence correlates to the early stages of biofilm development microfouling which is a crucial phase in biofouling bacteria along with diatoms as well as other microorganisms promote microfouling by enabling larger organisms including algae mussels and barnacles to adhere to the surface causing macrofouling kerr et al 1998 hence the anti biofouling effect of synthesized pztn was initially evaluated through biofilm assay as expected the obtained result reveals that the pztn effectively inhibited the biofilm formation of vibrio species at 100 µg ml concentration fig s15 further to validate the antibiofilm potential of pztn the light microscopic and fluorescence microscopic analysis were performed in fig s16 the light microscopic images clearly indicate that the reduced intensities of biofilms were observed in pztn treated samples upon 100 µg ml treatment in the fluorescence microscopic analysis the reduced green fluorescence intensity of biofilms were obtained in the pztn treated slide revealing the antibiofilm nature of pztn against vibrio species fig s17 3 11 1 synthesis of pztn coated pvc plastic knowing and combating biofouling necessitates a comprehensive understanding of biofilm formation on man made materials rosenhahn et al 2010 nevertheless employing antibiofilm coating to prevent biofouling in the early phases is more feasible in the present study we have prepared an efficient pztn pvc plastic film fig 9 a and assessed their antibiofilm potential against fouling strains at laboratory conditions at first the prepared pztn pvc plastic film was allowed for sem and atr ftir analysis in fig 9b the sem image clearly illustrated the coating of pztn on the pvc films further the ftir results reveal that the absorbance peaks at 2915 1425 1252 and 620 cm 1 related to the stretchings of ch ch2 ch and ccl which are the main functional groups of the pvc plastics fig s18 in addition the absorbance peaks at 891 and 3270 cm 1 stretchings were confirming the presence of zn o ti and oh on the surface of prepared pztn pvc plastic films then the prepared plastic films were subjected to evaluate their antibiofilm potential against fouling strains using in vitro analysis 3 11 2 anti biofilm activity of pztn pvc films against fouling bacteria the diversity of bacterial species results in a variety of different kinds of adhesion which can also vary depending on environmental factors making critical biofilms on the sub merged materials wang et al 2021 hence we have assessed the antibiofilm activity of prepared pztn pvc plastic films against fouling strains as well as vibrio species using in vitro biofilm assay in fig s19 the obtained results show that the pztn pvc films significantly prevent the biofilm formation of all the strains including vibrio species v harveyi v campbellii v parahaemolyticus v alginolyticus v vulnificus and isolates of biofouling strains v parahaemolyticus b kochii m salsuginis and s xylosus the most efficient biofilm prevention of pztn pvc was reported against v campbellii 91 28 while the least effective was observed against a fouling isolate of v parahaemolyticus 64 88 in fig 9c the crystal violet staining clearly evidenced the biofilm preventing efficacy of pztn pvc films the pvc films had a high density of biofilms but the pztn pvc films seemed to have a lower density of biofilms demonstrating the antibiofilm efficacy of pztn pvc plastic films furthermore the findings of fluorescence microscopic examination show that the pztn pvc sheets achieve a considerable reduction in biofilms in terms of green fluorescence of biofilms as shown in fig 9 d 3 11 3 effect of pztn pvc plastic films on mixed species biofilms in nature majority biofilms are produced by so many bacterial communities and such mixed species biofilms depict microorganisms real lives comprising bacteria fungi viruses and protozoa baker et al 1998 mixed species biofilm development and environmental tolerance are the foremost apprehension to water supply and human healthiness cao et al 2011 due to the physiological interactions conventional techniques such as antibiotic or disinfectant treatments are typically unsuccessful for mixed species biofilm consortium even in the last decade antibiofilm coated surfaces seem to be the target of an unprecedented number of studies ye et al 2017 the present study found that the pztn pvc films competently disallowed the mixed species biofilms on their surface for up to 72 h fig 10 a further crystal violet staining showed that the pvc films exhibited a high density of biofilms while the pztn pvc films appeared to have a reduced biofilms showing the potential against mixed species biofilms fig 10b the results of a fluorescence microscopic examination reveal that the pztn pvc films significantly reduced the mixed species biofilms in terms of fluorescence intensity fig 10c which further validated the antibiofilm activity it is well known that the ability of nanomaterial to generate free radicals is generally used as an antibiofilm antimicrobial agent matai et al 2014 the antibiofilm activity of pztn pvc films is accomplished due to the generation of free radicals it was found that oxidative stress was generated by the formation of ros while pztn pvc films were in contact with bacterial cells and increasing contact time increased the ros intensity resulting in antibiofilm activity similarly the zno cds nanocomposite showed antibiofilm and antibacterial action by generating ros inside the cells gholap et al 2020 reduced graphene oxide metal oxide nanocomposites also showed their antibiofilm activity via ros mechanism elbasuney et al 2021 due to the formation of free radicals our results revealed that the pztn pvc films do not allow bacterial cells to form biofilms on their surface based on the results we strongly suggest that this kind of antibiofilm nanomaterials coated plastics can be applied to avoid biofouling at an early stage in future 4 conclusion over the last decades semiconductor nanomaterials driven photocatalysis have become the target of intensive research for water treatment under direct sunlight yielding several studies aimed at explaining mechanisms and improving efficiencies for the remediation of pollutants in water in the present study a potent sunlight active pztn photocatalyst was synthesized for photocatalytic water treatment the prepared nanocomposite productively deactivated the bacterial pollutants as well as malachite green dye through the generation of photo induced free radicals in water under sunlight irradiation notably the photocatalytically deactivated bacteria as well as mg dye did not show any toxic effects during toxicity studies demonstrating that the phototreated water by pztn is extremely safe to the environment in addition the pztn has a competent antibiofilm nature against biofouling bacterial strains hence the pztn coated pvc plastic film effectively prevented the bacterial biofilms on their surface suggesting that the pztn coated pvc plastic is the best preference to prevent bacterial fouling on submerged man made materials in biofouling control overall this research will aid the development of dual functional photocatalysts for environmental application and also the prevention of fouling related problems moreover further studies are needed to increase its efficiency through the improvement of performance related aspects

16250,with a growing consciousness of the importance of nature stewardship researchers are focusing their efforts on utilizing renewable energy particularly solar energy to address environmental concerns in this context photocatalysis has long been viewed as one of the most promising cleaning methods hence we have prepared a sunlight active phytol assisted zno tio2 nanocomposite pztn for photocatalytic bacterial deactivation and dye degradation process the pztn photocatalysis effectively deactivated the bacterial pathogens as well as malachite green dye within 240 min under direct sunlight moreover this will be the first complete study on safety level assessment of photocatalytically remediated water through toxicity studies the obtained results evidenced that photocatalytically deactivated bacteria and mg dye showed to have no toxic effects signifying that the pztn photocatalyzed water seems to be extremely safe for the environment as a result of this research we suggest that the pztn could be a promising sunlight active photocatalyst for environmental water treatment on the other hand biofouling is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the marine environment bacteria are the first organisms to foul surfaces and produce biofilms on man made submerged materials interestingly pztn coated pvc plastic films effectively disallowed biofilms on their surface this part of this research suggests that pztn coated pvc plastics are the best alternative for biofouling management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sunlight active photocatalyst bacterial deactivation dye degradation toxicity assessment anti biofouling activity 1 introduction presence of pathogenic bacteria and toxic dye pollutants in water bodies are the most serious health issues around the globe for humans as well as aquatic creatures younis et al 2021 in aquaculture industries the bacterial infection has been known to cause devastating impacts on aquatic cultivars which leads to severe economic loss and bothers the growth and sustainability of aquaculture defoirdt et al 2007 the abrupt outbreak of diseases in aquaculture is majorly caused by vibrio species such as vibrio harveyi v parahaemolyticus v vulnificus v alginolyticus v campbellii v anguillarum and other species santhakumari et al 2017 notably v harveyi is a ubiquitous gram negative pathogen that frequently found in seawater and being as a natural inhabitant of the gastrointestinal tract of aquatic animals hence it has related with large scale outbreaks in larval and juvenile penaeids and fish salini et al 2019 till date antibiotics have been applied to indulge the bacterial infections in aquaculture however the wide and frequent use of antibiotics has resulted in causing drug resistance in bacterial strains which leads to not showing effective bacterial control in aquaculture pérez sánchez et al 2018 malachite green mg a toxic cationic triphenylmethane dye has been used as a topical antiseptic to treat protozoan fungal and bacterial infections in aquaculture srivastava et al 2004 however it is always present in the wastewater and will become a highly lethal compound due to their acute and chronic toxicity hashimoto et al 2011 in addition mg has broadly been used as a disinfectant food additive anthelmintic and as a dyeing agent for the textile industry notably mg is able to cause irreversible damages in the liver kidney and intestine in aquatic animals culp et al 1996 the us food and drug administration fda agency has banned the use of mg in aquaculture industries hence this dye has been forbidden in many countries however it has illegitimately been used in some countries because of its high efficiency with low cost zhu et al 2016 in mammalian cells it acts as a respiratory enzyme poison and causes tumors in the lungs breast and ovaries stammati et al 2005 on another hand biofouling seems to be a major ecological dilemma for submerged man made objects in aquaculture significantly improving biofouling and corrosion possibly affecting the flotation of polyethylene plastics bera et al 2018 biofouling a regular and progressive settlement of microorganisms and invertebrates in submerged surfaces kim et al 2021 in aquaculture systems biofouling species decrease water flow and promote biodeposition on plastic pipes jeong et al 2021 there are multiple phases to this process as well as distinct types of fouling organisms in the very first stage bacteria fungus and diatoms build biofilms next smooth foulers such as sponges bryozoans and macroalgae arrive and finally difficult foulers such as barnacles mussels and calcified tubular echinoderms establish in the structure baker et al 1998 during the biofouling development bacterial survival attachment multiplication and recruitment on material surfaces have a strong influence li et al 2020 contemporary anti fouling technologies hinder the biofouling process through releasing large volumes of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere chen et al 2019 as a result biofouling control prioritises biocompatible strategy with excellent inhibitory effectiveness without any negative impacts to the environment chen et al 2021 in recent years metal oxide photocatalysts have become known as a promising material for a wide range of applications in environmental remediation abidi et al 2019 paul et al 2010 mirzaei et al 2018 metal oxide photocatalysts have great attention in the field of photocatalysis which can generate reactive oxygen species ros thereby productively eradicate the environmental pollutants in the water samples under light irradiation kusiak nejman et al 2019 titanium dioxide tio2 is well known and nearly every one known photocatalyst for environmental applications because of their photo stability low cost and non toxicity ye et al 2017 dong et al 2015 however the weak utilization of solar energy and the short diffusion length of photogenerated exciton are limiting the rate of a photocatalytic performance of tio2 under sunlight due to its wide bandgap xiao et al 2021 therefore modulating the bandgap absorption to the visible region is needed for practical application under direct sunlight in this regard the application of bandgap narrowed coupled semiconductors in the photocatalytic process is regarded as an alternative approach to enhance the activity of photocatalysts by inhibiting the recombination of electron hole pairs huang et al 2021 in previous our group has reported a bandgap narrowed carbon dots coated tio2 nanocomposite dctn for photocatalytic bacterial deactivation under direct sunlight alexpandi et al 2020 in this study a bandgap narrowed sunlight active zno tio2 nanocomposite pztn was prepared using phytol as a capping agent through hydrothermal method phytol an acyclic diterpene alcohol mainly present in the part of chlorophyll in plants largely used as a precursor for the manufacture of vitamin e islam et al 2018 superior hydrophobic nature of phytol deliberated its utilization as a biosurfactant prabha et al 2019 in the present study the decreased bandgap of pztn resulted in enhanced photocatalytic activity under direct sunlight hence the photocatalytic bacterial disinfection efficacy and dye degradation potential of pztn were assessed for environmental application in addition the toxicity level of photocatalytically remediated water was evaluated using in vivo toxicity study with histopathological analysis furthermore the pztn was coated with pvc polymer to construct an antibiofim plastic film for biofouling management in water environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of phytol assisted zno tio2 nanocomposite pztn all the chemicals

resolution transmission electron microscope hr tem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds x ray powder diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy uv drs 2 2 photocatalytic bacterial deactivation of pztn under sunlight all the photocatalytic experiments for bacterial deactivation and dye degradation were carried out in the sunlight between 10 am to 2 pm throughout the months of april to june with a light intensity of 968 61 w m2 as measured by a photometer all the photocatalytic experiments were performed at science campus alagappa university india 10 0926 n 78 7866 e the photocatalytic bacterial deactivation efficacy of prepared pztn was assessed using vibrio harveyi mtcc

rpm for 10 min and washed twice with pbs then the cell pellets were resuspended in 100 ml saline water in a glass beaker after that 50 mg of pztn was added to the bacterial suspension and kept in the dark condition for 10 min finally the experimental setup was exposed to direct sunlight as shown in fig s1 every 60 min 100 µl of the experimental water was taken and spread on lb agar plates to count the bacterial density christensen et al 2003 the photocatalytic generation of ros in water under sunlight was confirmed through 2 3 bis 2 methoxy 4 nitro 5 sulfophenyl 5 carboxanilide 2h tetrazolium xtt and terephthalic acid ta method alexpandi et al 2020 for the environmental sample the natural seawater was collected from the coastal area of central marine fisheries research institute mandapam india 9 161740 n 79 132167 e and allowed to the photocatalytic water disinfection under sunlight exposure in this experiment 100 ml of collected seawater was kept in the dark condition for 10 min in the presence of 50 mg pztn and then exposed to direct sunlight every 1 h 100 µl of the experimental water was collected and spread on zobell marine broth zmb agar plates to count the bacterial density

dataset 2 3 assessing the safety level of photocatalytically inactivated bacteria the toxicity of the photocatalytically inactivated bacteria was determined using survival assay and histopathological analysis with tomato clownfish as described in the background dataset 2 4 photocatalytic dye degradation of pztn under sunlight the photocatalytic dye degradation efficacy of pztn was estimated using malachite green as the model dye pollutant in the experiment 50 mg of prepared pztn was dispersed in 100 ml of an mg aqueous solution 100 mg l prior to sunlight irradiation the reaction mixture was placed in the dark for 30 min to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and dye during the photodegradation process under sunlight a 3 ml sample was taken from the reaction mixture at 30 min intervals and centrifuged to remove the photocatalysts then the reduction of mg was determined by observing the change in the density at od655nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer chowdhury et al 2014 2 5 assessing the cytotoxicity of photodecomposed mg dye after the dye degradation by pztn photocatalysis further to confirm the complete inactivation of mg dye as well as the non toxic nature of photocatalytically degraded dye toxicity studies such as acute toxicity assay cardiotoxicity assessment ros detection apoptosis detection and histopathology analysis were performed with zebrafish model as given in the background dataset 2 6 synthesis of pztn coated pvc plastic for anti biofouling application further the pztn was coated on polyvinyl chloride pvc polymer to form an antibiofilm plastic film for anti biofouling application in the preparation 1 g of pvc was dissolved in 10 ml of n methyl 2 pyrrolidone under stirring overnight then 0 1 g of prepared pztn was gently added to the pvc solution under stirring the resultant pvc pztn mixture was spread on a petri plate and dried for 48 h at 50 c after the prepared pztn pvc films were characterized using fe sem and ft ir analysis and allowed to assess their anti biofouling activity using in vitro studies the radius of the prepared film s circle was 4 cm and the circle s area was 50 cm2 2 7 antibiofilm activity of pztn pvc against fouling bacteria for anti biofouling studies the prepared pztn pvc films were cutted into 1 1 cm sized pieces and subjected to biofilm assay with reference strains v harveyi mtcc 7771 v campbellii atcc baa 1116 v parahaemolyticus atcc 17 802 v alginolyticus v vulnificus mtcc 1145 and isolated biofouling strains v parahaemolyticus accession number mk100431 bacillus kochii mk100427 marinobacter salsuginis mk100392 and staphylococcus xylosus mk100439 the biofilms were formed on the pvc and pztn pvc for 48 h at 30 c in 24 well mtp supplemented with 1 ml of sterile lb broth after incubation the planktonic cells were discarded and adhering biofilm cells were gently rinsed with distilled water then the biofilm cells were stained with 0 2 crystal violet and suspended in 1 ml of 20 glacial acetic acid further the intensity was measured at od570nm using uv vis spectroscopy abirami et al 2020 to validate the anti biofilm potential of pztn pvc films microscopic analyses such as light microscopic and fluorescence microscope analysis were performed with 0 2 crystal violet and 0 1 acridine orange staining respectively durgadevi et al 2019 2 8 statistical analysis all the experiments were performed in triplicates the values were expressed as a mean standard deviation the statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics 23 spss ltd hong kong software package a dunnett s anova test and student t test were used to compare treated groups and control 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural characterization of phytol assisted zno tio2 nanocomposite pztn in fig 1 a the fe sem image showed the sphere shaped structure of the prepared pztn the hr tem image also revealed that the shape of the prepared nanostructure was spherical as shown in fig 1b the resulting spherical morphology in hr tem analysis was quite similar to the shape observed through fe sem analysis further the lattice spacing of the 0 264 nm of 002 plane and 0 351 nm of 101 plane revealed the existence of zno and tio2 in the prepared pztn photocatalyst mukhopadhyay et al 2016 the obtained he tem coupled saed analysis evidently demonstrated the doping of zno with tio2 in addition eds analysis was performed to determine the actual loading of zno on the surface of tio2 the obtained edx spectrum showed four peaks which were identified as carbon 7 84 oxygen 43 62 zinc 21 52 and titanium 27 02 confirming the doping of zno with tio2 in the prepared nanocomposite fig s2 in fig 1c fig s3 the xrd spectrum showed the reflections at 27 4 36 1 39 1 41 2 44 1 54 4 56 6 63 1 64 1 and 69 8 2θ were subjected to the 101 112 105 211 and 215 crystallographic planes of rutile tio2 whereas the reflections at 27 4 36 1 39 1 41 2 44 1 54 4 56 6 63 1 64 1 and 69 8 2θ were subjected to the 100 002 101 102 110 103 200 112 and 201 planes of hexagonal zno the obtained xrd result undoubtedly demonstrated the successful doping of zno on the tio2 in the nanocomposite in fig s4 the ft ir spectrum reveals that the characteristic peaks at 3424 cm 1 2919 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 indicate the presence of oh c h and c o groups respectively the absorption bands showing around 509 cm 1 and 430 cm 1 are responsible for the stretching of zn o and ti o respectively the absorption at 1440 cm 1 represents the combination of ti o c and zn o c vibrations notably the absorption around 891 cm 1 represents the formation of zn o ti stretching in the prepared nanocomposite salavati niasari et al 2016 mofokeng et al 2017 in fig 1e the high resolution c1s xps spectrum shows that the binding energies of zn 2p1 2 and zn 2p3 2 are 1025 1 ev and 1047 2 ev revealing the occurrence of zn2 in the pztn in fig 1f the o1s spectrum reveals that the most intense peak at 529 5 ev denotes ti o zn o bonds and other peaks at 531 6 ev and 534 5 ev were allocated to c oh c o c and zn o ti bonds respectively pérez gonzález et al 2021 in fig 6g the ti 2p high resolution spectrum shows that two peaks at 458 0 and 463 1 ev of the binding energies of ti2p 3 2 and ti2p 1 2 indicate the presence of tio2 in the prepared nanocomposite bharti et al 2016 the high resolution c1s spectrum shows two peaks at 284 2 ev and 288 0 ev fig 6h which are responsible for the c c c h and coo bonds respectively alexpandi et al 2020 overall the xps and ft ir data proposed that the strong interaction between zno and tio2 is formed through the development of zn o ti bonds during nanocomposite synthesis by the assistance of phytol 3 2 reduced bandgap for improved photocatalytic activity the main goal of this study is to enhance the photocatalytic performance of tio2 by narrowing the bandgap and enhancing the visible light absorption since the light absorption of the photocatalyst influences the photocatalytic performance wang et al 2014 the uv drs analysis was performed to verify the aptitude of visible light absorption of pztn under sunlight the uv drs spectra demonstrate that the pure tio2 and zno did not show absorption edge in the region between 400 and 800 nm on the other hand the pztn displayed a higher and extending absorbance in the visible light region fig s5 therefore the prepared pztn is expected to exhibit a superior photocatalytic performance under sunlight further it is understood that the photocatalysis process is the direct absorption of photons with the aid of bandgap of the nanomaterials to produce electron hole pairs zheng et al 2015 naimi joubani et al 2015 in general the electron excited from the valence band to the conduction band is initiated by light absorption with energy equal to or greater than the band gap liao et al 2004 in the present study the bandgap of pztn was calculated to be 2 84 ev which indicates that pztn has a narrowed bandgap than pure tio2 3 2 ev and zno 3 16 ev fig s6 the nanomaterials with the bandgap energy 3 1 ev can only be activated by uv light which seems unattainable to be activated by visible light the prepared pztn has a lower bandgap than that of pure tio2 and zno the narrowed bandgap energy could be attributed to the formation of new energy levels in sub bands by defects such as oxygen vacancies within the prohibited band of tio2 and zno fig s7 which would decrease the bandgap of the pztn sun et al 2015 it is known that the size of photocatalysts within nanoscale regime might results in a blue shift in the absorption wavelength and higher band gap energy owing to quantum confinement effect xi et al 2010 as seen in pure tio2 3 2 ev and zno 3 16 ev on the other hand the phenomenon is reverse that the smaller size of pztn results in a red shift in the absorption wavelength which narrows the bandgap and enlarges the absorption range sun et al 2015 resulting in improved photocatalytic activity under sunlight further the higher charge carrier separation prolongs the lifetime of the hole electron pair which promoting the formation of ros resulting in a better photocatalytic performance under sunlight liao et al 2004 zheng et al 2015 upadhyay et al 2019 3 3 improved ros production in water under sunlight the prepared pztn exhibit increased visible light absorption due to its narrowed bandgap resulting in an improved photocatalytic activity under sunlight the improved production of reactive oxygen species ros by pztn photocatalyst was proved by the xtt and terephthalic acid method in the xtt assay the produced o2 radicals convert the yellow xtt dye into an orange coloured compound called formazan the intensity of coloured formazan is represents the amount of o2 radicals in the sample agbe et al 2019 accordingly the assay result revealed that the o2 generation in pztn is superior compared to pure tio2 and zno under sunlight fig s8 on the other hand ta responds with oh radicals to produce a fluorescent product 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid hta which emits fluorescence at 420 nm gonzalez et al 2018 the intensity of hta is denotes the amount of oh radicals the assay result showed a higher fluorescence intensity of hta which denotes the improved production of oh radicals in pztn photocatalysis under sunlight fig s9 3 4 photocatalytic bacterial deactivation under sunlight the photocatalytic bacterial elimination of pztn under sunlight was assessed using v harveyi as a model bacterium the results show that in the condition of pztn photocatalyst time dependent bacterial eradication was obtained during sunlight irradiation fig s10 the findings showed that the total mortality of v harveyi cells was seen after 240 min in the presence of the pztn photocatalyst but no significant bacterial reduction was observed in the presence of tio2 as well as zno under sunlight furthermore under dark circumstances the pztn tio2 and zno treated samples had no antibacterial effect which revealed that the photocatalytic activity is responsible for the bacterial eradication instead of the antibacterial activity interestingly the prepared pztn effectively eradicated the bacterial pollutants in the natural seawater in fig s11 the results indicate that the pztn photocatalysis exhibited a successful bacterial killing of natural seawater within 240 min under sunlight our previous report revealed that carbon dots tio2 nanocomposite effectively killed the bacterial load in the natural seawater within 240 min under sunlight alexpandi et al 2020 3 5 mode of bacterial deactivation of pztn photocatalysis the fundamental processes of tio2 based photocatalytic bacterial inactivation are well understood in a word photoinduced free radicals create oxidative stress which destroys membranes and cellular components eventually leading to bacterial mortality dalrymple et al 2010 as a consequence photocatalytic bacterial deactivation is profoundly associated with the induction of oxidative stress ros in fig 2 b the result reveals that the ros intensity in photocatalyzed cells was significantly augmented than that of normal cells at the start of the process following that the strength of ros steadily found to decrease which implies the bacterial killing of v harveyi with increasing exposure time subsequently the cell viability of v harveyi during pztn photocatalysis was assessed through alamarblue assay the fluorescence intensity of reduced alamarblue a pink coloured fluorescent product with the level of fluorescence related to the amount of live cells selvaraj et al 2019 the reduction of the fluorescence intensity reveals the time dependent loss of bacterial viability fig 2c which confirmed the bacterial death of v harveyi during pztn photocatalysis under sunlight further fe sem analysis was performed to examine the morphological characteristics in order to truly comprehend the damaging consequences of ros induced antibacterial effects in v harveyi in the control samples fe sem analysis exhibited unbroken cells with normal morphology whereas the broken cells with noticeable alterations such as membrane damage caused by developing pits and holes in their cell membrane were obtained in the photocatalyzed cells fig 2d overall the obtained fe sem data concluded that the bactericidal action of pztn photocatalysis was accomplished via ros dependent severe injury of cell membrane and cellular components of v harveyi 3 6 assessment of safety level of photocatalyzed bacteria using tomato clownfish 3 6 1 toxicity assessment with survival assay several studies have discovered that when chemical disinfectants interact with natural organic matter in water toxic disinfection byproducts are produced making the aquatic environment more hazardous wang et al 2021a therefore it is necessary to assess the toxicity of disinfected water to minimize harmful consequences in the present study we have assessed the toxicity of photocatalyzed v harveyi cells through in vivo studies with tomato clownfish amphiprion frenatus a species of marine fish in fig 3 a the survival assay revealed that non photocatalyzed normal v harveyi infected fish were died completely within 48 h but photocatalyzed v harveyi infected fish showed no significant mortality indicating that v harveyi was successfully disinfected with sunlight using pztn photocatalysis moreover the physical observation illustrates that the infected fish exhibit a variety of gross clinical signs such as discolored skin inflammation or hemorrhaging of the skin lethargy weight loss loss of appetite and cloudy eyes but photocatalyzed bacteria infected fish appear to be unaffected by the infection of v harveyi fig 3b 3 6 2 histopathology analysis with infected organs histopathology an essential resource for health diagnosis and screening as it identifies changes in cells and tissues affected by infections it is known that the gill is the first organ by which pathogens come into contact with fish it is more vulnerable to damage than other tissues fonseca et al 2016 as demonstrated in fig 4 a v harveyi has caused considerable pathological alterations such as lamellar fusion congested branchial blood vessels multifocal fusions of secondary lamella and damaged erythrocytes in the gills of infected fish on the other hand the photocatalyzed v harveyi did not cause any injurious effect on the gills and seems to be a normal fish with natural gill anatomy in fig 4b the histology of intestines showed the gross abnormalities such as necrosis of lamina propria collapsed tunica mucosa hyperplasia of goblet cells severe infiltration of lymphocytes damages in internal as well as external muscular layer in the v harveyi infected fish as expected the photocatalyzed cells treated intestines have normal structure similar to untreated control similarly the v harveyii infected kidney also showed the highest levels of histopathological changes such as collapsed proximal or distal tubulus expanded and abnormal bowman s space and necrosis of hematopoietic tissues fig 4c the kidneys treated with photocatalyzed cells exhibit normal structure identical to the untreated control this is the first study to show that photocatalytically disinfected bacteria do not pose a major risk to aquatic organisms upon photocatalytic bacterial deactivation 3 7 photocatalytic mg dye degradation of pztn under sunlight the photocatalytic activity of pztn under sunlight was assessed using the degradation of malachite green mg as a model dye pollutant dye degradation was directly proportional to the time of sunlight exposure in a blank trial without photocatalyst 3 of photolysis self degradation of mg was observed whereas complete dye degradation was noticed in the presence of pztn photocatalyst under sunlight for 240 min fig 5 a in addition the photocatalytic performance of pztn was superior to pure zno and tio2 under sunlight when the photocatalysts are exposed to sunlight excitation of the valence electron produces photoelectrons which can generate free radicals that degrade dye pollutants in water pei et al 2013 in fig s12 the schematic diagram representing the possible mechanism for degradation process of mg dye by pztn photocatalyst under sunlight irradiation once the pztn exposed to sunlight the photocatalytic reaction induced by excitation of the valence electron and produces photoelectrons which can generate free radicals oh and o2 that degrades the mg dye in water 3 8 gc ms analysis of degradation by products some degradation by products may become more toxic than the parental compound eslami et al 2020 pereira et al 2014 hence gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis was used to detect if any by products were produced during the photodegradation of mg under pztn photocatalysis fig s13 the gc ms spectrum revealed that there are no peaks detected in the photodegraded mg sample which suggests that no harmful by products were produced during pztn photocatalysis mediated dye degradation process the outcome of gc ms analysis evidently confirmed that the pztn photocatalysis did not produce any degradation by products 3 9 toxicity evaluation of mg dye and photodegraded mg dye pmg using zebrafish 3 9 1 non acute toxic nature of photodegraded mg dye in order to determine the toxicity of photocatalytically degraded mg dye pmg the survival assay was performed using zebrafish as a model system in common mg dye can cause irreversible damage to several organs including the liver kidney and intestine of aquatic animals in mammalian cells it can act as a respiratory enzyme poison and cause tumors in the lungs breasts and ovaries culp et al 1996 the toxicity results reveal that mg dye caused total death of zebrafish within 6 h whereas the pmg did not show any lethal effects to zebrafish fig 5b which indicates the complete degradation of mg without the formation of harmful by products upon pztn photocatalysis under sunlight irradiation 3 9 2 non cardiotoxic nature of photocatalytically degraded mg dye the mode of mg toxicity in zebrafish larvae was predicted using some preliminary studies such as cardiotoxicity observations ros estimation and apoptosis detection in fig 5c the light microscopic observation revealed the cardiotoxicity induced by mg dye in zebrafish larvae 4 dpf it is known that cardiotoxicity affects the heart muscles and cardiac tissues resulting in a disruption of the electrophysiology of the heart previous study reported that mg induces cardiovascular toxicity by inhibiting the vascular endothelial growth factor vegf and arresting the heart rate jang et al 2009 our result also showed the evident abnormalities of the heart morphology such as cardiac looping defects and larger pericardial edema in the mg treated animals whereas normal looped hearts were observed in the photocatalyzed mg treated animals similar to that of the normal control fig 5c indicating the non cardiovascular toxic nature of photodegraded mg dye 3 9 3 non cellular toxic nature of photocatalytically degraded mg dye in general mg dye causes higher cytotoxic effects including lipid peroxidation cell apoptosis and cellular damage by formation of ros radicals hence the cellular toxicity induced by the mg dye in zebrafish larvae was observed by confirming the oxidative stress using 2 7 dichlorofluorescin diacetate dcfda method fig 6 a shows the fl intensity of dcfda inside the animals which represents the level of intracellular ros the ros intensity was increased in the mg exposed fish which corroborates the oxidative stress induced toxicity of the mg dye fig 6b on the other hand the ros intensity was significantly reduced in the pmg exposed fish suggesting that the photodegraded mg dye did not cause any oxidative stress to aquatic creatures subsequently the outcome of ros irregularities in the cellular toxicity and cell apoptosis was detected by ao etbr staining as shown in fig 6c patches of red colored fluorescence emission in zebrafish denote dead cells induced by ros mediated apoptotic cell death resulting in mortality during prolonged exposure to the mg dye on the other hand few patches of apoptotic cells were found in the photocatalyzed mg group like normal group suggesting that this photodegraded mg dye did not show any significant cellular toxicity 3 9 4 non organ toxic nature of photocatalytically degraded mg dye mg dye can induce permanent damages to several organs including the liver kidney and intestine of aquatic animals resulting in weight loss anemia and death ultimately culp et al 1996 to validate this statement the toxic effects of mg as well as photodegraded mg dye in gill intestine kidney liver and brain were evaluated using histopathology analysis with adult zebrafish prior to histopathological analysis the toxicity assay result shows that all the animals were dead in the mg dye treated group within 22 h due to its acute toxicity whereas no animals were affected in the photodegraded mg group fig 7 a suggesting that the photocatalytically destroyed mg dye did not show any toxicity to adult zebrafish in addition the physical observation of the experiment animals showed the severe internal accumulation of mg dye and its toxic effects in adult zebrafish whereas the photodegraded mg did not show any toxic effects indicating the non toxic nature of photocatalytically destroyed dye by pztn photocatalysis fig 7b further the toxic effect of mg dye in zebrafish as well as the non toxic nature of photocatalytically destroyed dye was assessed at organ level using histopathological studies the histopathology of gills shows that the mg dye caused several poisonous effects in gills such as multifocal fusions of primary lamella and secondary lamella brutal damage in branchial blood vessels and hyperplasia of gill epithelium fig 8 a the histology of intestines showed the disgusting abnormalities including necrosis of lamina propria collapsed tunica mucosa hyperplasia of goblet cells severe infiltration of lymphocytes damages in internal as well as external muscular layer in the mg dye treated fish fig 8b the mg treated kidney also has some histopathological changes such as collapsed proximal or distal tubulus expanded and reduced bowman s space and necrosis of hematopoietic tissues fig 8c as expected these histological abnormalities were not found in the gill intestine or kidney of photodegraded mg dye treated animals and were identical to untreated control animals on the other hand the collapsed hepatic sinusoids hyperplasia of center lobular vein and necrosis of melanomacrophage centres were observed in the liver of the mg treated animals fig 8d similarly mg dye directly damages the brain by causing diffuse swelling of the brain tissue as shown in fig 8e the photodegraded mg dye treated animals did not show any pathological changes in liver and brain and were healthy like the untreated control animals overall the histopathological results indicated that the photodegraded mg dye did not show any toxic effects to zebrafish suggesting that the photocatalytically degraded dye by pztn photocatalysis is environmentally safe 3 10 reusability of pztn to determine the recyclability of pztn the photocatalytic experiments were performed multiple times with experimented nanocomposite for bacterial deactivation and dye degradation under sunlight the result found that no major decrease in photocatalytic performance was observed when pztn was recycled for five cycles fig s14 showing the recyclable nature of pztn since the number of recycling times increased the photocatalytic performance of pztn decreased slightly it might be due to the loss of nanocomposites during the recycling process 3 11 pztn pvc plastic for anti biofouling application the phenomenon of biofouling is initiated by the formation of biofilms on man made sub merged materials zardus et al 2008 bacterial cells create an extracellular polymeric substance matrix after adherence which forms a biofilm biofilms could grow on a number of immersed surfaces such as ship hulls and water supply system pipes teodosio et al 2013 bacterial adherence correlates to the early stages of biofilm development microfouling which is a crucial phase in biofouling bacteria along with diatoms as well as other microorganisms promote microfouling by enabling larger organisms including algae mussels and barnacles to adhere to the surface causing macrofouling kerr et al 1998 hence the anti biofouling effect of synthesized pztn was initially evaluated through biofilm assay as expected the obtained result reveals that the pztn effectively inhibited the biofilm formation of vibrio species at 100 µg ml concentration fig s15 further to validate the antibiofilm potential of pztn the light microscopic and fluorescence microscopic analysis were performed in fig s16 the light microscopic images clearly indicate that the reduced intensities of biofilms were observed in pztn treated samples upon 100 µg ml treatment in the fluorescence microscopic analysis the reduced green fluorescence intensity of biofilms were obtained in the pztn treated slide revealing the antibiofilm nature of pztn against vibrio species fig s17 3 11 1 synthesis of pztn coated pvc plastic knowing and combating biofouling necessitates a comprehensive understanding of biofilm formation on man made materials rosenhahn et al 2010 nevertheless employing antibiofilm coating to prevent biofouling in the early phases is more feasible in the present study we have prepared an efficient pztn pvc plastic film fig 9 a and assessed their antibiofilm potential against fouling strains at laboratory conditions at first the prepared pztn pvc plastic film was allowed for sem and atr ftir analysis in fig 9b the sem image clearly illustrated the coating of pztn on the pvc films further the ftir results reveal that the absorbance peaks at 2915 1425 1252 and 620 cm 1 related to the stretchings of ch ch2 ch and ccl which are the main functional groups of the pvc plastics fig s18 in addition the absorbance peaks at 891 and 3270 cm 1 stretchings were confirming the presence of zn o ti and oh on the surface of prepared pztn pvc plastic films then the prepared plastic films were subjected to evaluate their antibiofilm potential against fouling strains using in vitro analysis 3 11 2 anti biofilm activity of pztn pvc films against fouling bacteria the diversity of bacterial species results in a variety of different kinds of adhesion which can also vary depending on environmental factors making critical biofilms on the sub merged materials wang et al 2021 hence we have assessed the antibiofilm activity of prepared pztn pvc plastic films against fouling strains as well as vibrio species using in vitro biofilm assay in fig s19 the obtained results show that the pztn pvc films significantly prevent the biofilm formation of all the strains including vibrio species v harveyi v campbellii v parahaemolyticus v alginolyticus v vulnificus and isolates of biofouling strains v parahaemolyticus b kochii m salsuginis and s xylosus the most efficient biofilm prevention of pztn pvc was reported against v campbellii 91 28 while the least effective was observed against a fouling isolate of v parahaemolyticus 64 88 in fig 9c the crystal violet staining clearly evidenced the biofilm preventing efficacy of pztn pvc films the pvc films had a high density of biofilms but the pztn pvc films seemed to have a lower density of biofilms demonstrating the antibiofilm efficacy of pztn pvc plastic films furthermore the findings of fluorescence microscopic examination show that the pztn pvc sheets achieve a considerable reduction in biofilms in terms of green fluorescence of biofilms as shown in fig 9 d 3 11 3 effect of pztn pvc plastic films on mixed species biofilms in nature majority biofilms are produced by so many bacterial communities and such mixed species biofilms depict microorganisms real lives comprising bacteria fungi viruses and protozoa baker et al 1998 mixed species biofilm development and environmental tolerance are the foremost apprehension to water supply and human healthiness cao et al 2011 due to the physiological interactions conventional techniques such as antibiotic or disinfectant treatments are typically unsuccessful for mixed species biofilm consortium even in the last decade antibiofilm coated surfaces seem to be the target of an unprecedented number of studies ye et al 2017 the present study found that the pztn pvc films competently disallowed the mixed species biofilms on their surface for up to 72 h fig 10 a further crystal violet staining showed that the pvc films exhibited a high density of biofilms while the pztn pvc films appeared to have a reduced biofilms showing the potential against mixed species biofilms fig 10b the results of a fluorescence microscopic examination reveal that the pztn pvc films significantly reduced the mixed species biofilms in terms of fluorescence intensity fig 10c which further validated the antibiofilm activity it is well known that the ability of nanomaterial to generate free radicals is generally used as an antibiofilm antimicrobial agent matai et al 2014 the antibiofilm activity of pztn pvc films is accomplished due to the generation of free radicals it was found that oxidative stress was generated by the formation of ros while pztn pvc films were in contact with bacterial cells and increasing contact time increased the ros intensity resulting in antibiofilm activity similarly the zno cds nanocomposite showed antibiofilm and antibacterial action by generating ros inside the cells gholap et al 2020 reduced graphene oxide metal oxide nanocomposites also showed their antibiofilm activity via ros mechanism elbasuney et al 2021 due to the formation of free radicals our results revealed that the pztn pvc films do not allow bacterial cells to form biofilms on their surface based on the results we strongly suggest that this kind of antibiofilm nanomaterials coated plastics can be applied to avoid biofouling at an early stage in future 4 conclusion over the last decades semiconductor nanomaterials driven photocatalysis have become the target of intensive research for water treatment under direct sunlight yielding several studies aimed at explaining mechanisms and improving efficiencies for the remediation of pollutants in water in the present study a potent sunlight active pztn photocatalyst was synthesized for photocatalytic water treatment the prepared nanocomposite productively deactivated the bacterial pollutants as well as malachite green dye through the generation of photo induced free radicals in water under sunlight irradiation notably the photocatalytically deactivated bacteria as well as mg dye did not show any toxic effects during toxicity studies demonstrating that the phototreated water by pztn is extremely safe to the environment in addition the pztn has a competent antibiofilm nature against biofouling bacterial strains hence the pztn coated pvc plastic film effectively prevented the bacterial biofilms on their surface suggesting that the pztn coated pvc plastic is the best preference to prevent bacterial fouling on submerged man made materials in biofouling control overall this research will aid the development of dual functional photocatalysts for environmental application and also the prevention of fouling related problems moreover further studies are needed to increase its efficiency through the improvement of performance related aspects

16251,the microcosmic mechanisms underlying filamentous bulking remain unclear the role of extracellular polymeric substances eps governed by quorum sensing qs in deteriorating sludge floc stability and structure during filamentous bulking and the feasibility of using quorum quenching qq to maintain sludge floc stability and structure and sludge settling were investigated in this study the results indicated that the concentration of c6 hsl increased from 22 08 3 22 ng g vss to 81 42 5 98 ng g vss during filamentous bulking the filamentous bacteria gradually evolved the hdts gene related to the synthesis of c6 hsl with increases in the population density triggered qs by filamentous bacteria proliferation induced variation in the composition and structure of eps within the sludge flocs the proteins pn content of the eps increased evidently from 40 06 2 41 mg g vss to 110 32 4 32 mg g vss and the polysaccharides ps content slightly increased during filamentous bulking the upregulated proteins in the eps led to a decrease in the relative hydrophobicity of the sludge and an increase in negative surface charge the α helix β sheet random coil ratio evidently increased from 0 76 to 0 99 during filamentous bulking revealing that the proteins were tightly structured which prevented the exposure of inner hydrophobic groups the total energy of the interaction wt between bacteria increased during sludge bulking which resulted in the weakening of sludge aggregation variation in the physicochemical properties of eps induced by qs in the filamentous bacteria markedly restrained adhesion between the filamentous bacteria and floc forming bacteria the production of pn in the eps and the expression of the hdts gene were inhibited by vanillin which served as a qs inhibitor the wt between bacteria with 50 mg l of vanillin basically did not change filamentous bulking was significantly inhibited by the addition of vanillin therefore qq is a potential strategy for the prevention and control of filamentous bulking this study provides new information regarding the microcosmic mechanisms of filamentous bulking graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords filamentous bulking quorum sensing extracellular polymeric substances surface thermodynamics bacterial aggregation 1 introduction the activated sludge process is widely used in municipal wastewater treatment plants owing to its advantages of low cost simple operation and excellent treatment performance filamentous bulking is a frequent problem in the activated sludge process which is provoked by the excessive proliferation of filamentous bacteria eikelboom 2000 filamentous bulking results in activated sludge flocs with a loose and diffuse structure and slow sludge settling which lead to poor sludge water separation and sludge washout with the effluent and it can even cause the whole wastewater treatment system to collapse jenkins et al 2014 the development of methods to prevent or control filamentous sludge bulking in wastewater treatment has been regarded as an important issue since the invention of the activated sludge process martins et al 2004 wágner et al 2015 regrettably filamentous bulking remains a serious problem in wastewater treatment plants wwtps because the microcosmic mechanisms underlying filamentous bulking are still unclear activated sludge exists as flocs which are aggregates of microorganisms wang et al 2014 microorganisms can form flocculent aggregates during the metabolic process therefore these types of bacteria are called floc forming bacteria palm 1980 several filamentous bacteria serve as the skeleton of activated sludge flocs and floc forming bacteria attach to the skeleton by secreting extracellular polymeric substances eps during the formation of activated sludge flocs wilen et al 2003 wang et al 2020 the physicochemical properties are important for microbial aggregate formation and maintaining its structure and function by contributing to bacterial adhesion jia et al 2017 sludge floc formation is central and often interconnected with the features of bacterial social life as large quantities of dense bacterial consortia are assembled in sludge flocs shi et al 2017 bacterial communities regulate some bacterial behaviors such as eps production and bacterial aggregation by exchanging chemical signals to coordinate the responses of bacteria to environmental challenges and opportunities huang et al 2016 this phenomenon is known as quorum sensing qs and it is an important mechanism by which bacteria control aggregation and the growth of bacterial populations in response to changes in population density williams et al 2007 high cell density can activate specific cellular functions by strengthening information exchange and cooperative action among bacteria lu et al 2012 for example in granular sludge with high bacteria density qs promotes microbial aggregation and adhesion by regulating eps content and the proportions of its components as well as biofilm formation li et al 2014 therefore in this study a hypothesis has suggested that the rapid and excessive proliferation of filamentous bacteria with high bacterial density can enhance effective intercellular communication among filamentous bacteria and trigger qs to influence microbial aggregation during filamentous bulking the qs of filamentous bacteria induces variation in the contents and components of eps in activated sludge which enables microorganisms to suspend and diffuse growth instead of undergoing attached growth variation in eps induced by qs among filamentous bacteria with high bacterial density may be the primary cause of loose floc structure and poor sludge settling during filamentous bulking quorum quenching qq is a term used to describe the interference of qs alison 2001 if eps are regulated by qs among filamentous bacteria it will undoubtedly be inversely regulated by qq therefore qq may be a potential strategy to control filamentous sludge bulking by inversely regulating eps during the activated sludge process regretfully knowledge gaps still remain regarding the roles of qs and qq in filamentous bulking within the activated sludge process therefore the objective of this study was to reveal the role of eps governed by qs in deteriorating sludge floc stability and structure during filamentous bulking and prove the feasibility of using quorum sensing inhibitors qsis to maintain sludge floc stability and structure and sludge settling during filamentous bulking the physicochemical properties of eps the surface energy barrier between bacteria xdlvo theory the morphological structure of flocs the concentration of n acyl homoserine lactose ahl and the microbial community structure were investigated to reveal the effect of filamentous bacteria proliferation on microbial aggregation during filamentous bulking metaproteomics and metagenomics were employed to elucidate the potential role of qs and qq in the eps regulation by filamentous bacteria the results of this study provide new insight into the microcosmic mechanism of filamentous bulking based on qs 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation and wastewater characteristics the experiment was performed in a sequencing batch reactor sbr equipped with a probe to measure dissolved oxygen do ph and temperature the do concentration was controlled using a do controller the sbr cycle was 6 h with a volume exchange ratio of 40 the operation modes per cycle and specific operation parameters of the sbr are provided in table s1 the experiment was carried out over two phases with varied do concentration in phase i 0 60 days normal operation of the reactor was ensured by monitoring the wastewater treatment efficiency and sludge volume index svi under a do concentration of 2 mg l in phase ii after 60 days filamentous bulking was induced in the sbr while maintaining a do concentration of 0 5 mg l the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater comprising cod nh4 n tn and tp at concentrations of 500 mg l 1 50 mg l 1 55 mg l 1 and 7 mg l 1 respectively water quality and svi were measured using apha standard methods apha 2005 details about the ahl eps zeta potential contact angle xdlvo theory fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy methods are provided in the supporting information 2 2 batch tests batch tests were performed to verify the effect of qs among filamentous bacteria on eps secretion four triangular flasks r1 r4 as batch reactors were induced to filamentous bulking by adding ahls to these reactors under a do concentration of 0 5 mg l qs was triggered by adding exogenous ahls c6 hsl r2 c8 hsl r3 and c14 hsl r4 at a final concentration of 1 μm and an equal volume of methanol was added to the r1 reactor as a control group exogenous qsis are commonly used to disrupt qs systems and vanillin as a qsi is widely employed to disrupt the qs of microorganisms in wastewater treatment systems kim et al 2021 pal et al 2020 ponnusamy et al 2009 therefore vanillin was employed to destroy the qs system among the filamentous bacteria four other triangular flasks r5 0 mg l r6 10 mg l r7 50 mg l and r8 100 mg l were induced into filamentous bulking by adding vanillin to the reactor at a do concentration of 0 5 mg l specific operation of the batch tests are provided in the supporting information 2 3 microbial community metaproteomics and metagenomics analyses the v1 v3 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was used for polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification yan et al 2018 the raw reads obtained from this study were deposited in the ncbi genbank accession number srp124435 samples were analyzed by shotgun proteomics classifications of the identified proteins were carried out using gene ontology annotation according to their protein accession numbers for metagenomics analysis dna was extracted with the e z n a soil dna kit omega biotek norcross ga u s following the manufacturer s protocol the paired end illumina reads were trimmed of adaptors and the low quality reads were removed by fastp then the function genes were annotated using blast against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database details regarding the gene pyrosequencing metaproteomics assays and metagenomics assays are provided in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 quorum sensing was triggered during filamentous bulking in the sbr 3 1 1 the evolutionary dynamics of ahl mediated qs in filamentous bacteria the variations in the mlss and do in the sbr during the total operation are shown in fig s1a and b excellent wastewater treatment efficiency and sludge settleability were obtained when the sbr was operated with a do concentration of 2 mg l in phase i fig 1 a d however in phase ii the svi sharply increased from 64 ml g to 350 ml g when do decreased from 2 mg l to 0 5 mg l fig 1d thiothrix is a well known filamentous bacterium that causes the deterioration of activated sludge sedimentation performance wu et al 2019 the abundance of filamentous bacteria af thiothrix sharply increased from 0 39 to 27 30 when the svi increased from 64 ml g to 350 ml g fig s1c these results indicated that the filamentous bacteria bulking was successfully induced in the sbr ahl mediated qs systems for intraspecific communication based on population density have been proven to play an important role in maintaining the stability of microbial aggregates by regulating eps secretion huang et al 2019 raju maddela et al 2019 variation in the concentration of ahl during filamentous bulking is shown in fig 2 a when af increased from 0 39 to 27 30 the concentration of c6 hsl increased from 22 08 3 22 ng g vss to 81 42 5 98 ng g vss the concentration of c6 hsl increased 3 68 fold with increasing af which indicated that the qs ahl system mediated by c6 hsl may play a critical role in filamentous bulking an ahl mediated qs system has the characteristics of mutability adaptability and evolvability in natural communities within limits prescott et al 2020 the evolutionary characteristics of ahl mediated qs in the filamentous bacteria were revealed at the gene level in the sbr through metagenomic analysis of activated sludge samples with afs of 0 39 1 93 10 45 and 27 30 a total of three genes regulating the synthesis of ahls were detected namely lasi rpai and hdts fig 2b among them the hdts gene is responsible for regulating the synthesis of c6 hsl laue et al 2000 which plays a critical role in promoting the secretion of protein pn in the eps ding et al 2016 li et al 2014 lv et al 2018 tang et al 2018 when the af increased from 0 39 to 27 30 the relative abundance of the hdts gene was upregulated fig 2b conversely the relative abundances of acylase and hydrolase which were the qq enzymes interfering with the qs system by degrading ahls dong et al 2000 were both downregulated with increasing af fig 2b which was consistent with the idea that the qq and qs systems are two antagonistic systems huang et al 2016 the relative abundance of the hdts gene was strongly and positively correlated with the concentrations of c6 hsl and af r2 0 80 p 0 05 fig 2c the results indicated that the hdts gene which can regulate the production of c6 hsl was harbored by the filamentous bacteria in the activated sludge aggregates unexpectedly when af was lower than 1 93 the filamentous bacteria did not harbor the hdts gene however the filamentous bacteria gradually evolved the hdts gene with an increase in population density fig 2d similarly under the condition of a low population density the filamentous bacteria did not harbor the fabd fadd or metk genes fig 2d which are extremely important in the process of synthesizing ahl precursor substances sun et al 2019 however the filamentous bacteria gradually evolved these key genes with the increase of population density fig 2d these results indicated that the filamentous bacteria gradually evolved an intraspecies communication network based on ahl mediated qs with an increase in population density this evolvability of filamentous bacteria has established an advantage for its survival helping to provide the capacity to strengthen coordinated interactions in an ever changing environment prescott et al 2020 during sludge bulking the relative abundance of the type iv secretory system t4ss which is closely related to microbial evolution gomis ruth et al 2002 also presented an upregulated expression fig s1d the phenomenon that other microorganisms randomly acquire or lose genes related to the ahl mediated qs system was widespread during sludge bulking fig s2 which was consistent with the results of previous studies feng et al 2019 prescott et al 2020 3 1 2 identification of metabolic pathways associated with quorum sensing metaproteomics analysis was performed on sludge samples with afs of 0 39 10 45 and 27 30 the metabolic profile of the bulking sludge was analyzed using kegg ontologies the number of proteins that matched cell communication signal transduction and membrane transport evidently increased from 4 16 and 7 to 18 32 and 20 respectively during filamentous bulking fig s3 these results indicated that the rapid and excessive proliferation of filamentous bacteria with high filamentous bacterial density strengthened intercellular communication among the filamentous bacteria notably among the metabolic pathways related to cell communication the relative abundance of metabolic pathway matched qs was 1 10 within the non bulking activated sludge sample af 0 39 but it significantly increased to 7 50 when the af reached 27 30 fig 2e meanwhile the relative abundance of signal transducer activity and signaling receptor activity proteins which are directly involved in qs behavior increased from 1 28 and 2 00 to 12 28 and 11 64 respectively as the af increased fig 2e the abovementioned results indicated that qs participated in the coordination and expression of the behavior of microorganisms during filamentous bulking additionally the transferase activity proteins involved in transferring acyl groups other than amino acyl groups as well as acyl groups converted into alkyl groups increased as the af increased fig 2e these results indicated that the signal molecule involved in qs may be a compound containing an acyl group such as ahl the results were consistent with the abovementioned result that the concentration of ahl c6 hsl evidently increased during filamentous bulking in the sbr section 3 1 1 3 2 the regulation of physicochemical properties of eps by quorum sensing in the sbr the physicochemical properties of eps depend on their composition changes in the pn and polysaccharides ps content within the eps in the reactor during the bulking period were investigated to further reveal the effect of the ahl mediated qs system on eps secretion among filamentous bacteria when af increased from 0 39 to 27 30 the pn content of the eps increased from 40 06 2 41 mg g vss to 110 32 4 32 mg g vss and the ps content slightly increased fig 3 a the total eps content within the sludge flocs which was represented by the sum of pn and ps content significantly increased from 51 07 2 15 mg g vss to 127 26 2 73 mg g vss during filamentous bulking the eps content was strongly and positively correlated with the svi r2 0 90 p 0 05 fig s4a which indicated that the increase in eps content had a negative effect on the settling performance of the sludge aggregates thus eem fluorescence spectra were utilized to investigate the variation in the main component of eps at different bulking levels fig s4b e peak a excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 225 300 350 nm exhibited tyrosine like fluorescence whereas peak b ex em of 275 280 310 350 nm exhibited a protein like nature in which the fluorescence was associated with the aromatic amino acid tryptophan chen et al 2003 the intensities of these two peaks significantly increased as af increased which was consistent with the observed variation in the eps content within the sludge flocs c6 hsl used for intraspecific communication has a crucial role in promoting eps productivity especially for the secretion of pn in the eps ding et al 2016 lv et al 2018 tang et al 2018 with increasing c6 hsl concentrations the relative abundance of proteins related to amino acid metabolic processes and amino acid biosynthetic processes was evidently upregulated including aromatic amino acids aspartate family amino acids and serine family amino acids fig 3b the results showed that the ahl mediated qs system in filamentous bacteria promoted the production of pn in the eps during sludge bulking as the pn content in the eps changed the pn ps ratio obviously increased from 3 64 to 5 57 fig 3a this indicated that a high pn ps ratio in the eps appeared to correspond to poor settling ability which was consistent with previous research batstone et al 2001 martinez et al 2004 jing et al 2009 with a significant increase in the pn content in the eps the structure of pn became tighter in which hydrophobic groups distributed in the inner layer and hydrophilic groups distributed in the outer layer jing et al 2009 the secondary structures were closely related to protein hydrophobicity therefore ftir analysis was conducted in the region of 4000 800 cm 1 fig s4f the α helix β sheet random coil ratio is usually used to evaluate the structure of hydrophobic groups hou et al 2015 the higher this ratio is the tighter the structure of the protein is in this study the α helix β sheet random coil ratio evidently increased from 0 76 to 0 99 with increasing pn content in the eps fig 3c this result indicated that the structure of the proteins became tighter as bulking progressed which prevented the exposure of inner hydrophobic groups maintained low bacterial surface hydrophobicity and thus hindered sludge aggregation the hydrophobicity of the cell suspensions was significantly decreased during filamentous bulking the smaller the contact angle the weaker the hydrophobicity fig 3d which resulted in improving the free energy of the bacterial surface and then decreasing the adhesive force between bacteria eps are usually negatively charged therefore the negative charge on the surface of the sludge aggregates increased with the increase in eps content thereby strengthening the electrostatic repulsion jia et al 1996 wilen et al 2003 during sludge bulking the zeta potential of the sludge surface decreased as the af increased fig 3e these results indicated that the bacteria had to overcome a greater electrostatic barrier to adhere to each other which was not conducive to bacterial aggregation the degree of the aggregation between bacteria was qualitatively characterized using xdlvo theory during sludge bulking eq s2 s13 the total energy of interaction wt which is called the surface energy barrier is the sum of the van der waals energies wa the electric double layer interaction wr and the acid base interaction wab the higher the energy barrier the weaker the microbial aggregation performance liu et al 2010 the energy barrier gradually increased as bulking progressed fig 3f which indicated that the aggregation of bacteria gradually weakened the increase in wt was mainly due to the increase in wr and wab during sludge bulking fig s5a c wr and wab are determined by zeta potential and hydrophobicity the abovementioned results indicated that variation in the physicochemical properties of eps induced by qs in filamentous bacteria markedly inhibited microbial aggregates as bulking progressed the filamentous bacteria no longer served as the skeleton of sludge aggregates and inhibition of adhesion between floc forming bacteria and filamentous bacteria was clearly observed fig s6a additionally the abundance of floc forming bacteria such as hydrogenophaga thauera and nitrospira evidently decreased during filamentous bulking fig s6b the results indicated that the change of the physicochemical properties of eps inhibited the enrichment of floc forming bacteria in the flocs during filamentous bulking 3 3 verification of filamentous bulking regulated by quorum sensing 3 3 1 the acceleration of filamentous bulking by adding exogenous ahls the qs ahl system is triggered by extracellular signaling molecules seet et al 2011 herein three types of ahls including c6 hsl c8 hsl and c14 hsl were separately added to sbrs r2 r4 to verify the positive regulation of eps secretion for the ahl mediated qs system among the filamentous bacteria under a low do concentration of 0 5 mg l compared with control experiment r1 the deterioration of activated sludge sedimentation performance in the reactors with exogenous ahls was obviously more severe especially in the r2 reactor with c6 hsl fig s7a additionally up to the 36th cycle compared with control experiment r1 the af in r2 reactor with c6 hsl increased 8 77 fold r1 2 80 r2 24 56 fig s7b meanwhile there were also more filamentous bacteria in reactors r3 and r4 than in reactor r1 fig s8 the above results showed that filamentous bulking could be sharply promoted by adding exogenous ahls c6 hsl c8 hsl and c14 hsl especially c6 hsl as bulking progressed there were variations in pn and ps content in the eps for the four reactors r1 r4 as shown in fig 4 a d during filamentous bulking the pn content in the eps in reactors r1 r2 r3 and r4 increased from 66 67 3 41 mg g vss to 89 01 8 46 mg g vss 144 94 6 91 mg g vss 99 12 4 95 mg g vss and 124 85 14 87 mg g vss respectively simultaneously the pn ps ratio in the eps for reactors r1 r2 r3 and r4 increased from 2 71 to 3 08 4 83 3 03 and 4 66 respectively these results further confirmed that the ahl mediated qs system in the filamentous bacteria had a negative impact on the stability of aggregates by obviously promoting the secretion of pn in the eps 3 3 2 inhibition of filamentous bulking by quorum sensing inhibitors vanillin a qsi can block bacterial cell to cell communication based on the ahl mediated qs system ponnusamy et al 2013 herein four different concentrations of vanillin were separately added to sbrs r5 with 0 mg l r6 with 10 mg l r7 with 50 mg l and r8 with 100 mg l to reverse verify the promotion of ahl mediated qs on eps secretion among the filamentous bacteria under a low do concentration of 0 5 mg l the svis of r5 with 0 mg l vanillin and r6 with 10 mg l vanillin sharply increased however the svis of r7 with 50 mg l vanillin and r8 with 100 mg l vanillin were always lower than 100 ml g fig s9a additionally up to the 58th cycle compared with control experiment r5 the afs of reactors r6 r7 and r8 were significantly lower especially those for reactors r6 and r7 fig s9b the results indicated that filamentous bulking was evidently inhibited by adding appropriate concentration of qsis within 58 operating cycles there were variations in the pn and ps content in the eps as shown in fig 5 a d expectedly as bulking progressed in reactor r5 with 0 mg l vanillin the pn content and the pn ps ratio obviously increased from 53 15 4 56 mg g vss and 3 67 to 161 31 3 01 mg g vss and 6 02 respectively fig 5a however for reactor r6 with 10 mg l vanillin both the pn content and pn ps ratio showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing during sludge bulking fig 5b the results indicated that a low concentration of vanillin 10 mg l retarded the production of pn in the eps during filamentous bulking especially in reactor r7 with 50 mg l vanillin and reactor r8 with 100 mg l vanillin the production of pn in the eps was evidently inhibited fig 5c and d up to the 58th cycle compared with raw sludge non bulking sludge the contact angle and zeta potential on the surface of the aggregates in reactor r7 basically did not change table s2 the surface energy barrier wt between bacteria in the r7 reactor also basically did not change compared with the raw sludge fig 5e the abovementioned results indicated that a proper concentration of vanillin can inhibit the production of eps thereby preventing the increase of the surface energy barrier and then inhibiting the deterioration of the aggregation performance the electron transport chain activity etca representing the electron transport rate in the r5 r6 r7 and r8 reactors in the 58th cycle was investigated to evaluate the effect of the addition of vanillin on the microbial activity fig s10 there were no significant differences among the etca in the r5 0 mg l vanillin r6 10 mg l vanillin and r7 50 mg l vanillin reactors however the etca was significantly inhibited in r8 reactor 100 mg l vanillin the result indicated that the appropriate concentration of vanillin had no negative impact on the activity of microorganisms in addition compared with the raw sludge the relative abundance of the ahl synthesis gene hdts decreased by 82 39 for the sludge sample in reactor r7 reactor after 58 cycles fig 5f in this study c6 hsl regulated by the hdts gene among the filamentous bacteria plays a critical role in promoting pn production in the eps in reactor r7 after 58 cycles the total proportion of ahl synthesis genes and receptor genes evidently decreased while the total proportion of ahl degradation genes significantly increased fig 5f after vanillin addition the qs ahl system was weakened while the qq ahl system was strengthened therefore the qq effect of vanillin resulted in the inhibition of filamentous bulking by reducing eps production especially reducing the secretion of pn 3 4 a possible mechanism of the deterioration in sludge floc stability and structure during filamentous bulking currently mainstream opinions about filamentous bulking explain the loose structure and poor settlement of bulking sludge based on the morphological characteristics and diffuse growth pattern of filamentous bacteria nielsen et al 2009 martins et al 2004 in this study the qs system was triggered due to the rapid and excessive proliferation of filamentous bacteria the triggered qs system induced variation in the composition and structure of eps the filamentous bacteria produced more pn which affected the composition of eps the significant increase in pn content not only significantly increased the negative charge at the cell surface but also reduced the hydrophobicity of the cell surface these results implied that bacteria must overcome enhanced electrostatic and surface energy barriers to adhere to each other during filamentous bulking further investigation indicated that filamentous bulking was promoted by the addition of exogenous ahls to the sbrs while the addition of qsis had the opposite effect therefore qs plays a vital role in sludge formation and structure stability by controlling eps secretion during filamentous bulking a proposed mechanism of the deterioration in sludge floc stability and structure during filamentous bulking was developed based on the results mentioned above fig 6 generally several filamentous bacteria serve as the skeleton of activated sludge flocs and floc forming bacteria attach to the skeleton by secreting eps within the activated flocs filamentous bacteria proliferate when environmental conditions change to suit their growth and then qs is triggered by an increase in population density at this stage the filamentous bacteria communicate with each other through small signaling molecules which enable them to express specific genes to decrease their surface zeta potential and hydrophobicity by regulating the composition and structure of eps the biological behavior induced by qs inhibits adhesion between filamentous bacteria and floc forming bacteria by enhancing surface electrostatics and energy barriers free floc forming bacteria are gradually washed out of the activated sludge system during filamentous bulking because they cannot act as a floc skeleton as shown in fig s6 the survival advantage of filamentous bacteria is established by eliminating other bacterial populations in this process flocs with large proportions of filamentous bacteria grow disorderly and eventually form a loose branched floc dominated by filamentous bacteria bridging between filamentous bacteria prevents the flocs from entering into close proximity with each other thus hindering the sedimentation and compaction of the flocs this phenomenon results in poor sludge water separation and sludge bulking 4 conclusion to gain insight into the microcosmic mechanisms underlying filamentous sludge bulking the role of eps governed by qs in deteriorating sludge floc stability and structure was investigated during filamentous bulking rapid proliferation of filamentous bacteria triggered qs which induced variation in the composition and structure of eps within the sludge flocs therefore bacteria were required to overcome enhanced electrostatics and surface energy barriers to adhere to each other during filamentous bulking variation in the physicochemical properties of eps induced by qs markedly inhibited microbial aggregation which directly resulted in flocs with a loose structure slow sludge settling and poor sludge compression thus qs plays a vital role in sludge formation and structure stability by controlling eps secretion during filamentous bulking in addition qq evidently inhibited filamentous bulking by reducing the secretion of pn therefore qq is a promising strategy for the prevention and control of filamentous bulking credit authorship contribution statement hong xin shi writing original draft

16251,the microcosmic mechanisms underlying filamentous bulking remain unclear the role of extracellular polymeric substances eps governed by quorum sensing qs in deteriorating sludge floc stability and structure during filamentous bulking and the feasibility of using quorum quenching qq to maintain sludge floc stability and structure and sludge settling were investigated in this study the results indicated that the concentration of c6 hsl increased from 22 08 3 22 ng g vss to 81 42 5 98 ng g vss during filamentous bulking the filamentous bacteria gradually evolved the hdts gene related to the synthesis of c6 hsl with increases in the population density triggered qs by filamentous bacteria proliferation induced variation in the composition and structure of eps within the sludge flocs the proteins pn content of the eps increased evidently from 40 06 2 41 mg g vss to 110 32 4 32 mg g vss and the polysaccharides ps content slightly increased during filamentous bulking the upregulated proteins in the eps led to a decrease in the relative hydrophobicity of the sludge and an increase in negative surface charge the α helix β sheet random coil ratio evidently increased from 0 76 to 0 99 during filamentous bulking revealing that the proteins were tightly structured which prevented the exposure of inner hydrophobic groups the total energy of the interaction wt between bacteria increased during sludge bulking which resulted in the weakening of sludge aggregation variation in the physicochemical properties of eps induced by qs in the filamentous bacteria markedly restrained adhesion between the filamentous bacteria and floc forming bacteria the production of pn in the eps and the expression of the hdts gene were inhibited by vanillin which served as a qs inhibitor the wt between bacteria with 50 mg l of vanillin basically did not change filamentous bulking was significantly inhibited by the addition of vanillin therefore qq is a potential strategy for the prevention and control of filamentous bulking this study provides new information regarding the microcosmic mechanisms of filamentous bulking graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords filamentous bulking quorum sensing extracellular polymeric substances surface thermodynamics bacterial aggregation 1 introduction the activated sludge process is widely used in municipal wastewater treatment plants owing to its advantages of low cost simple operation and excellent treatment performance filamentous bulking is a frequent problem in the activated sludge process which is provoked by the excessive proliferation of filamentous bacteria eikelboom 2000 filamentous bulking results in activated sludge flocs with a loose and diffuse structure and slow sludge settling which lead to poor sludge water separation and sludge washout with the effluent and it can even cause the whole wastewater treatment system to collapse jenkins et al 2014 the development of methods to prevent or control filamentous sludge bulking in wastewater treatment has been regarded as an important issue since the invention of the activated sludge process martins et al 2004 wágner et al 2015 regrettably filamentous bulking remains a serious problem in wastewater treatment plants wwtps because the microcosmic mechanisms underlying filamentous bulking are still unclear activated sludge exists as flocs which are aggregates of microorganisms wang et al 2014 microorganisms can form flocculent aggregates during the metabolic process therefore these types of bacteria are called floc forming bacteria palm 1980 several filamentous bacteria serve as the skeleton of activated sludge flocs and floc forming bacteria attach to the skeleton by secreting extracellular polymeric substances eps during the formation of activated sludge flocs wilen et al 2003 wang et al 2020 the physicochemical properties are important for microbial aggregate formation and maintaining its structure and function by contributing to bacterial adhesion jia et al 2017 sludge floc formation is central and often interconnected with the features of bacterial social life as large quantities of dense bacterial consortia are assembled in sludge flocs shi et al 2017 bacterial communities regulate some bacterial behaviors such as eps production and bacterial aggregation by exchanging chemical signals to coordinate the responses of bacteria to environmental challenges and opportunities huang et al 2016 this phenomenon is known as quorum sensing qs and it is an important mechanism by which bacteria control aggregation and the growth of bacterial populations in response to changes in population density williams et al 2007 high cell density can activate specific cellular functions by strengthening information exchange and cooperative action among bacteria lu et al 2012 for example in granular sludge with high bacteria density qs promotes microbial aggregation and adhesion by regulating eps content and the proportions of its components as well as biofilm formation li et al 2014 therefore in this study a hypothesis has suggested that the rapid and excessive proliferation of filamentous bacteria with high bacterial density can enhance effective intercellular communication among filamentous bacteria and trigger qs to influence microbial aggregation during filamentous bulking the qs of filamentous bacteria induces variation in the contents and components of eps in activated sludge which enables microorganisms to suspend and diffuse growth instead of undergoing attached growth variation in eps induced by qs among filamentous bacteria with high bacterial density may be the primary cause of loose floc structure and poor sludge settling during filamentous bulking quorum quenching qq is a term used to describe the interference of qs alison 2001 if eps are regulated by qs among filamentous bacteria it will undoubtedly be inversely regulated by qq therefore qq may be a potential strategy to control filamentous sludge bulking by inversely regulating eps during the activated sludge process regretfully knowledge gaps still remain regarding the roles of qs and qq in filamentous bulking within the activated sludge process therefore the objective of this study was to reveal the role of eps governed by qs in deteriorating sludge floc stability and structure during filamentous bulking and prove the feasibility of using quorum sensing inhibitors qsis to maintain sludge floc stability and structure and sludge settling during filamentous bulking the physicochemical properties of eps the surface energy barrier between bacteria xdlvo theory the morphological structure of flocs the concentration of n acyl homoserine lactose ahl and the microbial community structure were investigated to reveal the effect of filamentous bacteria proliferation on microbial aggregation during filamentous bulking metaproteomics and metagenomics were employed to elucidate the potential role of qs and qq in the eps regulation by filamentous bacteria the results of this study provide new insight into the microcosmic mechanism of filamentous bulking based on qs 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation and wastewater characteristics the experiment was performed in a sequencing batch reactor sbr equipped with a probe to measure dissolved oxygen do ph and temperature the do concentration was controlled using a do controller the sbr cycle was 6 h with a volume exchange ratio of 40 the operation modes per cycle and specific operation parameters of the sbr are provided in table s1 the experiment was carried out over two phases with varied do concentration in phase i 0 60 days normal operation of the reactor was ensured by monitoring the wastewater treatment efficiency and sludge volume index svi under a do concentration of 2 mg l in phase ii after 60 days filamentous bulking was induced in the sbr while maintaining a do concentration of 0 5 mg l the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater comprising cod nh4 n tn and tp at concentrations of 500 mg l 1 50 mg l 1 55 mg l 1 and 7 mg l 1 respectively water quality and svi were measured using apha standard methods apha 2005 details about the ahl eps zeta potential contact angle xdlvo theory fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy methods are provided in the supporting information 2 2 batch tests batch tests were performed to verify the effect of qs among filamentous bacteria on eps secretion four triangular flasks r1 r4 as batch reactors were induced to filamentous bulking by adding ahls to these reactors under a do concentration of 0 5 mg l qs was triggered by adding exogenous ahls c6 hsl r2 c8 hsl r3 and c14 hsl r4 at a final concentration of 1 μm and an equal volume of methanol was added to the r1 reactor as a control group exogenous qsis are commonly used to disrupt qs systems and vanillin as a qsi is widely employed to disrupt the qs of microorganisms in wastewater treatment systems kim et al 2021 pal et al 2020 ponnusamy et al 2009 therefore vanillin was employed to destroy the qs system among the filamentous bacteria four other triangular flasks r5 0 mg l r6 10 mg l r7 50 mg l and r8 100 mg l were induced into filamentous bulking by adding vanillin to the reactor at a do concentration of 0 5 mg l specific operation of the batch tests are provided in the supporting information 2 3 microbial community metaproteomics and metagenomics analyses the v1 v3 region of the

metaproteomics assays and metagenomics assays are provided in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 quorum sensing was triggered during filamentous bulking in the sbr 3 1 1 the evolutionary dynamics of ahl mediated qs in filamentous bacteria the variations in the mlss and do in the sbr during the total operation are shown in fig s1a and b excellent wastewater treatment efficiency and sludge settleability were obtained when the sbr was operated with a do concentration of 2 mg l in phase i fig 1 a d however in phase ii the svi sharply increased from 64 ml g to 350 ml g when do decreased from 2 mg l to 0 5 mg l fig 1d thiothrix is a well known filamentous bacterium that causes the deterioration of activated sludge sedimentation performance wu et al 2019 the abundance of filamentous bacteria af thiothrix sharply increased from 0 39 to 27 30 when the svi increased from 64 ml g to 350 ml g fig s1c these results indicated that the filamentous bacteria bulking was successfully induced in the sbr ahl mediated qs systems for intraspecific communication based on population density have been proven to play an important role in maintaining the stability of microbial aggregates by regulating eps secretion huang et al 2019 raju maddela et al 2019 variation in the concentration of ahl during filamentous bulking is shown in fig 2 a when af increased from 0 39 to 27 30 the concentration of c6 hsl increased from 22 08 3 22 ng g vss to 81 42 5 98 ng g vss the concentration of c6 hsl increased 3 68 fold with increasing af which indicated that the qs ahl system mediated by c6 hsl may play a critical role in filamentous bulking an ahl mediated qs system has the characteristics of mutability adaptability and evolvability in natural communities within limits prescott et al 2020 the evolutionary characteristics of ahl mediated qs in the filamentous bacteria were revealed at the gene level in the sbr through metagenomic analysis of activated sludge samples with afs of 0 39 1 93 10 45 and 27 30 a total of three genes regulating the synthesis of ahls were detected namely lasi rpai and hdts fig 2b among them the hdts gene is responsible for regulating the synthesis of c6 hsl laue et al 2000 which plays a critical role in promoting the secretion of protein pn in the eps ding et al 2016 li et al 2014 lv et al 2018 tang et al 2018 when the af increased from 0 39 to 27 30 the relative abundance of the hdts gene was upregulated fig 2b conversely the relative abundances of acylase and hydrolase which were the qq enzymes interfering with the qs system by degrading ahls dong et al 2000 were both downregulated with increasing af fig 2b which was consistent with the idea that the qq and qs systems are two antagonistic systems huang et al 2016 the relative abundance of the hdts gene was strongly and positively correlated with the concentrations of c6 hsl and af r2 0 80 p 0 05 fig 2c the results indicated that the hdts gene which can regulate the production of c6 hsl was harbored by the filamentous bacteria in the activated sludge aggregates unexpectedly when af was lower than 1 93 the filamentous bacteria did not harbor the hdts gene however the filamentous bacteria gradually evolved the hdts gene with an increase in population density fig 2d similarly under the condition of a low population density the filamentous bacteria did not harbor the fabd fadd or metk genes fig 2d which are extremely important in the process of synthesizing ahl precursor substances sun et al 2019 however the filamentous bacteria gradually evolved these key genes with the increase of population density fig 2d these results indicated that the filamentous bacteria gradually evolved an intraspecies communication network based on ahl mediated qs with an increase in population density this evolvability of filamentous bacteria has established an advantage for its survival helping to provide the capacity to strengthen coordinated interactions in an ever changing environment prescott et al 2020 during sludge bulking the relative abundance of the type iv secretory system t4ss which is closely related to microbial evolution gomis ruth et al 2002 also presented an upregulated expression fig s1d the phenomenon that other microorganisms randomly acquire or lose genes related to the ahl mediated qs system was widespread during sludge bulking fig s2 which was consistent with the results of previous studies feng et al 2019 prescott et al 2020 3 1 2 identification of metabolic pathways associated with quorum sensing metaproteomics analysis was performed on sludge samples with afs of 0 39 10 45 and 27 30 the metabolic profile of the bulking sludge was analyzed using kegg ontologies the number of proteins that matched cell communication signal transduction and membrane transport evidently increased from 4 16 and 7 to 18 32 and 20 respectively during filamentous bulking fig s3 these results indicated that the rapid and excessive proliferation of filamentous bacteria with high filamentous bacterial density strengthened intercellular communication among the filamentous bacteria notably among the metabolic pathways related to cell communication the relative abundance of metabolic pathway matched qs was 1 10 within the non bulking activated sludge sample af 0 39 but it significantly increased to 7 50 when the af reached 27 30 fig 2e meanwhile the relative abundance of signal transducer activity and signaling receptor activity proteins which are directly involved in qs behavior increased from 1 28 and 2 00 to 12 28 and 11 64 respectively as the af increased fig 2e the abovementioned results indicated that qs participated in the coordination and expression of the behavior of microorganisms during filamentous bulking additionally the transferase activity proteins involved in transferring acyl groups other than amino acyl groups as well as acyl groups converted into alkyl groups increased as the af increased fig 2e these results indicated that the signal molecule involved in qs may be a compound containing an acyl group such as ahl the results were consistent with the abovementioned result that the concentration of ahl c6 hsl evidently increased during filamentous bulking in the sbr section 3 1 1 3 2 the regulation of physicochemical properties of eps by quorum sensing in the sbr the physicochemical properties of eps depend on their composition changes in the pn and polysaccharides ps content within the eps in the reactor during the bulking period were investigated to further reveal the effect of the ahl mediated qs system on eps secretion among filamentous bacteria when af increased from 0 39 to 27 30 the pn content of the eps increased from 40 06 2 41 mg g vss to 110 32 4 32 mg g vss and the ps content slightly increased fig 3 a the total eps content within the sludge flocs which was represented by the sum of pn and ps content significantly increased from 51 07 2 15 mg g vss to 127 26 2 73 mg g vss during filamentous bulking the eps content was strongly and positively correlated with the svi r2 0 90 p 0 05 fig s4a which indicated that the increase in eps content had a negative effect on the settling performance of the sludge aggregates thus eem fluorescence spectra were utilized to investigate the variation in the main component of eps at different bulking levels fig s4b e peak a excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 225 300 350 nm exhibited tyrosine like fluorescence whereas peak b ex em of 275 280 310 350 nm exhibited a protein like nature in which the fluorescence was associated with the aromatic amino acid tryptophan chen et al 2003 the intensities of these two peaks significantly increased as af increased which was consistent with the observed variation in the eps content within the sludge flocs c6 hsl used for intraspecific communication has a crucial role in promoting eps productivity especially for the secretion of pn in the eps ding et al 2016 lv et al 2018 tang et al 2018 with increasing c6 hsl concentrations the relative abundance of proteins related to amino acid metabolic processes and amino acid biosynthetic processes was evidently upregulated including aromatic amino acids aspartate family amino acids and serine family amino acids fig 3b the results showed that the ahl mediated qs system in filamentous bacteria promoted the production of pn in the eps during sludge bulking as the pn content in the eps changed the pn ps ratio obviously increased from 3 64 to 5 57 fig 3a this indicated that a high pn ps ratio in the eps appeared to correspond to poor settling ability which was consistent with previous research batstone et al 2001 martinez et al 2004 jing et al 2009 with a significant increase in the pn content in the eps the structure of pn became tighter in which hydrophobic groups distributed in the inner layer and hydrophilic groups distributed in the outer layer jing et al 2009 the secondary structures were closely related to protein hydrophobicity therefore ftir analysis was conducted in the region of 4000 800 cm 1 fig s4f the α helix β sheet random coil ratio is usually used to evaluate the structure of hydrophobic groups hou et al 2015 the higher this ratio is the tighter the structure of the protein is in this study the α helix β sheet random coil ratio evidently increased from 0 76 to 0 99 with increasing pn content in the eps fig 3c this result indicated that the structure of the proteins became tighter as bulking progressed which prevented the exposure of inner hydrophobic groups maintained low bacterial surface hydrophobicity and thus hindered sludge aggregation the hydrophobicity of the cell suspensions was significantly decreased during filamentous bulking the smaller the contact angle the weaker the hydrophobicity fig 3d which resulted in improving the free energy of the bacterial surface and then decreasing the adhesive force between bacteria eps are usually negatively charged therefore the negative charge on the surface of the sludge aggregates increased with the increase in eps content thereby strengthening the electrostatic repulsion jia et al 1996 wilen et al 2003 during sludge bulking the zeta potential of the sludge surface decreased as the af increased fig 3e these results indicated that the bacteria had to overcome a greater electrostatic barrier to adhere to each other which was not conducive to bacterial aggregation the degree of the aggregation between bacteria was qualitatively characterized using xdlvo theory during sludge bulking eq s2 s13 the total energy of interaction wt which is called the surface energy barrier is the sum of the van der waals energies wa the electric double layer interaction wr and the acid base interaction wab the higher the energy barrier the weaker the microbial aggregation performance liu et al 2010 the energy barrier gradually increased as bulking progressed fig 3f which indicated that the aggregation of bacteria gradually weakened the increase in wt was mainly due to the increase in wr and wab during sludge bulking fig s5a c wr and wab are determined by zeta potential and hydrophobicity the abovementioned results indicated that variation in the physicochemical properties of eps induced by qs in filamentous bacteria markedly inhibited microbial aggregates as bulking progressed the filamentous bacteria no longer served as the skeleton of sludge aggregates and inhibition of adhesion between floc forming bacteria and filamentous bacteria was clearly observed fig s6a additionally the abundance of floc forming bacteria such as hydrogenophaga thauera and nitrospira evidently decreased during filamentous bulking fig s6b the results indicated that the change of the physicochemical properties of eps inhibited the enrichment of floc forming bacteria in the flocs during filamentous bulking 3 3 verification of filamentous bulking regulated by quorum sensing 3 3 1 the acceleration of filamentous bulking by adding exogenous ahls the qs ahl system is triggered by extracellular signaling molecules seet et al 2011 herein three types of ahls including c6 hsl c8 hsl and c14 hsl were separately added to sbrs r2 r4 to verify the positive regulation of eps secretion for the ahl mediated qs system among the filamentous bacteria under a low do concentration of 0 5 mg l compared with control experiment r1 the deterioration of activated sludge sedimentation performance in the reactors with exogenous ahls was obviously more severe especially in the r2 reactor with c6 hsl fig s7a additionally up to the 36th cycle compared with control experiment r1 the af in r2 reactor with c6 hsl increased 8 77 fold r1 2 80 r2 24 56 fig s7b meanwhile there were also more filamentous bacteria in reactors r3 and r4 than in reactor r1 fig s8 the above results showed that filamentous bulking could be sharply promoted by adding exogenous ahls c6 hsl c8 hsl and c14 hsl especially c6 hsl as bulking progressed there were variations in pn and ps content in the eps for the four reactors r1 r4 as shown in fig 4 a d during filamentous bulking the pn content in the eps in reactors r1 r2 r3 and r4 increased from 66 67 3 41 mg g vss to 89 01 8 46 mg g vss 144 94 6 91 mg g vss 99 12 4 95 mg g vss and 124 85 14 87 mg g vss respectively simultaneously the pn ps ratio in the eps for reactors r1 r2 r3 and r4 increased from 2 71 to 3 08 4 83 3 03 and 4 66 respectively these results further confirmed that the ahl mediated qs system in the filamentous bacteria had a negative impact on the stability of aggregates by obviously promoting the secretion of pn in the eps 3 3 2 inhibition of filamentous bulking by quorum sensing inhibitors vanillin a qsi can block bacterial cell to cell communication based on the ahl mediated qs system ponnusamy et al 2013 herein four different concentrations of vanillin were separately added to sbrs r5 with 0 mg l r6 with 10 mg l r7 with 50 mg l and r8 with 100 mg l to reverse verify the promotion of ahl mediated qs on eps secretion among the filamentous bacteria under a low do concentration of 0 5 mg l the svis of r5 with 0 mg l vanillin and r6 with 10 mg l vanillin sharply increased however the svis of r7 with 50 mg l vanillin and r8 with 100 mg l vanillin were always lower than 100 ml g fig s9a additionally up to the 58th cycle compared with control experiment r5 the afs of reactors r6 r7 and r8 were significantly lower especially those for reactors r6 and r7 fig s9b the results indicated that filamentous bulking was evidently inhibited by adding appropriate concentration of qsis within 58 operating cycles there were variations in the pn and ps content in the eps as shown in fig 5 a d expectedly as bulking progressed in reactor r5 with 0 mg l vanillin the pn content and the pn ps ratio obviously increased from 53 15 4 56 mg g vss and 3 67 to 161 31 3 01 mg g vss and 6 02 respectively fig 5a however for reactor r6 with 10 mg l vanillin both the pn content and pn ps ratio showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing during sludge bulking fig 5b the results indicated that a low concentration of vanillin 10 mg l retarded the production of pn in the eps during filamentous bulking especially in reactor r7 with 50 mg l vanillin and reactor r8 with 100 mg l vanillin the production of pn in the eps was evidently inhibited fig 5c and d up to the 58th cycle compared with raw sludge non bulking sludge the contact angle and zeta potential on the surface of the aggregates in reactor r7 basically did not change table s2 the surface energy barrier wt between bacteria in the r7 reactor also basically did not change compared with the raw sludge fig 5e the abovementioned results indicated that a proper concentration of vanillin can inhibit the production of eps thereby preventing the increase of the surface energy barrier and then inhibiting the deterioration of the aggregation performance the electron transport chain activity etca representing the electron transport rate in the r5 r6 r7 and r8 reactors in the 58th cycle was investigated to evaluate the effect of the addition of vanillin on the microbial activity fig s10 there were no significant differences among the etca in the r5 0 mg l vanillin r6 10 mg l vanillin and r7 50 mg l vanillin reactors however the etca was significantly inhibited in r8 reactor 100 mg l vanillin the result indicated that the appropriate concentration of vanillin had no negative impact on the activity of microorganisms in addition compared with the raw sludge the relative abundance of the ahl synthesis gene hdts decreased by 82 39 for the sludge sample in reactor r7 reactor after 58 cycles fig 5f in this study c6 hsl regulated by the hdts gene among the filamentous bacteria plays a critical role in promoting pn production in the eps in reactor r7 after 58 cycles the total proportion of ahl synthesis genes and receptor genes evidently decreased while the total proportion of ahl degradation genes significantly increased fig 5f after vanillin addition the qs ahl system was weakened while the qq ahl system was strengthened therefore the qq effect of vanillin resulted in the inhibition of filamentous bulking by reducing eps production especially reducing the secretion of pn 3 4 a possible mechanism of the deterioration in sludge floc stability and structure during filamentous bulking currently mainstream opinions about filamentous bulking explain the loose structure and poor settlement of bulking sludge based on the morphological characteristics and diffuse growth pattern of filamentous bacteria nielsen et al 2009 martins et al 2004 in this study the qs system was triggered due to the rapid and excessive proliferation of filamentous bacteria the triggered qs system induced variation in the composition and structure of eps the filamentous bacteria produced more pn which affected the composition of eps the significant increase in pn content not only significantly increased the negative charge at the cell surface but also reduced the hydrophobicity of the cell surface these results implied that bacteria must overcome enhanced electrostatic and surface energy barriers to adhere to each other during filamentous bulking further investigation indicated that filamentous bulking was promoted by the addition of exogenous ahls to the sbrs while the addition of qsis had the opposite effect therefore qs plays a vital role in sludge formation and structure stability by controlling eps secretion during filamentous bulking a proposed mechanism of the deterioration in sludge floc stability and structure during filamentous bulking was developed based on the results mentioned above fig 6 generally several filamentous bacteria serve as the skeleton of activated sludge flocs and floc forming bacteria attach to the skeleton by secreting eps within the activated flocs filamentous bacteria proliferate when environmental conditions change to suit their growth and then qs is triggered by an increase in population density at this stage the filamentous bacteria communicate with each other through small signaling molecules which enable them to express specific genes to decrease their surface zeta potential and hydrophobicity by regulating the composition and structure of eps the biological behavior induced by qs inhibits adhesion between filamentous bacteria and floc forming bacteria by enhancing surface electrostatics and energy barriers free floc forming bacteria are gradually washed out of the activated sludge system during filamentous bulking because they cannot act as a floc skeleton as shown in fig s6 the survival advantage of filamentous bacteria is established by eliminating other bacterial populations in this process flocs with large proportions of filamentous bacteria grow disorderly and eventually form a loose branched floc dominated by filamentous bacteria bridging between filamentous bacteria prevents the flocs from entering into close proximity with each other thus hindering the sedimentation and compaction of the flocs this phenomenon results in poor sludge water separation and sludge bulking 4 conclusion to gain insight into the microcosmic mechanisms underlying filamentous sludge bulking the role of eps governed by qs in deteriorating sludge floc stability and structure was investigated during filamentous bulking rapid proliferation of filamentous bacteria triggered qs which induced variation in the composition and structure of eps within the sludge flocs therefore bacteria were required to overcome enhanced electrostatics and surface energy barriers to adhere to each other during filamentous bulking variation in the physicochemical properties of eps induced by qs markedly inhibited microbial aggregation which directly resulted in flocs with a loose structure slow sludge settling and poor sludge compression thus qs plays a vital role in sludge formation and structure stability by controlling eps secretion during filamentous bulking in addition qq evidently inhibited filamentous bulking by reducing the secretion of pn therefore qq is a promising strategy for the prevention and control of filamentous bulking credit authorship contribution statement hong xin shi writing original draft

16252,coupling dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra pathway with anammox process has a prominent advantage in enhancement of nitrogen removal however the anammox bacteria driven dnra is difficult to proceed at normal autotrophic circumstance herein for the first time biochar prepared by bamboo was used as a mediator to stimulate the dnra pathway of anammox bacteria under varying chemical oxygen demand cod to nitrogen cod n ratios 0 1 0 7 and the underlying stimulation mechanism was elucidated by metagenomics sequencing analysis results showed that biochar addition 10 g l stimulated dnra pathway of anammox bacteria at low cod n ratios 0 1 0 5 thus enhancing the nitrogen removal efficiency nre of the anammox system by 7 2 16 4 and 0 9 3 0 respectively compared to that of tests without sodium acetate and biochar p 0 05 this enhancement was attributed to the improved extracellular electron accepting capacity of anammox biomass by biochar the easily obtained electrons from sodium acetate further increased the relative abundances of anammox related hzs and complete dnra related napab and nrfah genes p 0 05 which catalyze electron consuming reactions the stimulated anammox pathway and dnra pathway further increased the specific anammox activity and the relative abundance of anammox bacteria especially ca jettenia by 15 5 23 0 and 11 3 82 6 compared with that without biochar respectively metagenomics sequencing also revealed that anammox bacteria ca jettenia caeni was the main bacteria for dnra metabolism in this system our findings reveal that biochar could selectively stimulate dnra pathway of anammox bacteria affiliated by a low amount of carbon which provides a novel strategy to improve the nitrogen removal of anammox based processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox biochar dnra metagenomics sequencing nitrogen removal 1 introduction dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra is a biological process that reduces nitrate to ammonium using nitrite as the intermediate güven et al 2005 it involves a two step reaction which occurs in anoxic environment the first step is nitrate reduction to nitrite like denitrification which is called nitrate respiration the second step is nitrite reduction to ammonium which can either be respiratory or fermentative kern and simon 2009 pandey et al 2020 simon and klotz 2013 wang et al 2019b dnra process was firstly discovered in autotrophic soil organisms as early as 1938 woods 1938 and now has been considered as a vital part of global biogeochemical nitrogen cycling in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems accounting for approximately 93 of nitrate reduction chen et al 2015 nie et al 2021 wang et al 2021b some anammox bacteria species such as ca anammoxoglobus propionicus ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis and ca brocadia fuldiga have already been found to be capable of performing dnra metabolism using small molecule acids e g formate acetate and propionate as electron donors güven et al 2005 kartal et al 2007b shu et al 2015 the limitation of chemical oxygen demand cod and the presence of ammonium can favor anammox bacteria to perform dnra and outcompete heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria castro barros et al 2017 considering the presence of organics in the real wastewater wang et al 2020c the dnra metabolism of anammox bacteria is meaningful firstly the dnra metabolites nitrite and ammonium can be further utilized by anammox pathway thus improving the total nitrogen removal efficiency nre of anammox systems castro barros et al 2017 secondly compared with other methods to improve the nre of anammox systems such as coupling with denitrification and partial denitrification coupling dnra with anammox can rely solely on the functional autotrophic anammox bacteria which can dramatically reduce the additional carbon sources operating cost and energy consumption li et al 2020b moreover dnra metabolism consumes organics e g formate acetate and propionate which will reduce the effluent cod and avoid the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria due to numerous advantages of coupling dnra with anammox process there have already been attempts to enable dnra occur synergistically with anammox pathway in the same reactor table 1 castro barros et al 2017 han et al 2020 li et al 2020b wang et al 2021a yin et al 2021 it has been confirmed that low influent cod no3 n ratio about 1 14 favored anammox bacteria to perform partial dnra together with anammox reaction castro barros et al 2017 using acetate iron or intracellular carbon source e g glycogen as electron donors the coupled dnra and anammox processes have been successfully established both performed by anammox bacteria li et al 2020b wang et al 2021a yin et al 2021 in another study coupling anammox with ignavibacterium or geobacter performed dnra pathway was also successfully achieved however this coupling process requires the cooperation of multiple functional bacteria posing challenges for the operational control strategies to achieve the process stability ahmad et al 2021 additionally the coupled anammox and dnra processes were found to be beneficial to promote the degradation of benzene and accelerate the growth of anammox bacteria han et al 2020 yin et al 2021 however the dnra metabolism activity of anammox bacteria is usually low 0 3 0 02 fmol cell d kartal et al 2007a wang et al 2020a therefore an appropriate method to selectively promote the dnra pathway of anammox bacteria while effectively inhibit heterotrophic microorganisms is urgently required biochar is a cost effective and eco friendly material with abundant redox active functional groups hence biochar has redox properties capable of accepting and donating electrons which has been used to facilitate extracellular electron transfer efficiency and stimulate denitrification kamali et al 2021 su et al 2019 wu et al 2019 the extracellular electron transfer capability etc of anammox bacteria has also been proved recently shaw et al 2020 thus an assumption is that whether biochar can be used as an electron shuttle to enhance the extracellular electron transfer efficiency and selectively mediate the dnra pathway of anammox bacteria in the presence of organics ultimately enhancing the nre of anammox system the main objective of this study was using biochar to selectively mediate dnra pathway of anammox bacteria and make it co occurrence with anammox metabolism under varying cod n ratios a possible mechanism of biochar enhancing dnra pathway of anammox bacteria was also proposed from the perspective of etc microbial community composition and metagenomics sequencing this study for the first time provided deep insights into the feasibility of using redox active biochar to selectively mediate dnra pathway of anammox bacteria these insights are expected to provide an economical and efficient approach to improve nre of anammox based processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation condition two parallel reactors rck and rbc were used in this experiment rck was the control reactor with no biochar added while rbc was the experimental reactor with 10 g l biochar added at the initial of this experiment other operating conditions except the addition of biochar of the two reactors were consistent biochar with a uniform particle size of 20 40 μm was produced by pyrolyzing bamboo lianyungang jiangsu province china at 400 c in a tube furnace fig s1 bamboo was selected as the feedstock for the preparation of biochar due to the potential high etc of bamboo based biochar li et al 2020a two sequencing batch reactors sbrs made of plexiglass with a working volume of 1 l were adopted to culture anammox granules a typical sbr cycle lasted for 8 h including 5 min of feeding 390 min of mixing 60 min of settling 10 min of drainage and 15 min of idling time the influent and effluent were controlled by peristaltic pumps the hydraulic retention time was set as 13 h and the reactor temperature was controlled by a thermostatic water bath at 35 1 c before testing the two sbrs were pre cultured using synthetic wastewater for 107 days the nitrogen removal performances of the two sbrs were consistent and the nitrogen loading rate nlr and nre were stable at 1 24 kg n m3 d and 80 5 1 5 respectively fig s2 on d 108 10 g biochar was added to rbc resulting in a final concentration of 10 g l the dosage of 10 g biochar l was selected in this study according to our previous study wang et al 2022 the two sbrs were then operated for 106 days d 108 213 which could be divided into five phases according to the influent cod concentration table 2 cod was controlled as required by adding different concentrations of sodium acetate 2 2 seed sludge and feeding medium anammox granules enriched in a 20 l parent sbr in our laboratory were used as inoculation sludge the anammox granules were cultured using synthetic

cod n ratio gradually increased from 0 to 0 7 by increasing the influent cod concentration the operation could be divided into five phases based on the cod n ratio i e 0 phase i 0 1 phase ii 0 3 phase iii 0 5 phase iv and 0 7 phase v table 2 as shown in fig 1 when the influent cod n ratio gradually increased from 0 to 0 7 the effluent no3 n concentrations of rck and rbc gradually decreased leading to gradual improvement of nre also the nre of rbc was higher than that of rck in the corresponding phase in phase i cod n 0 d 108 127 both rck and rbc showed good nitrogen removal performance with the influent nh4 n and no2 n almost completely being consumed fig 1a and b the cumulative no3 n concentrations of rck and rbc were 124 7 3 3 mg l and 117 6 4 4 mg l respectively resulting in a similar nre of 81 6 0 6 and 80 5 1 5 in individual reactor fig 1c when increasing the influent cod n ratio from 0 1 to 0 5 phase ii iv the effluent no3 n concentration of rck and rbc gradually decreased to 43 6 5 0 mg l and 38 8 6 1 mg l respectively but nre increased to 92 9 1 1 and 93 7 1 2 respectively fig 1a and b besides the nrr of rck and rbc showed an increasing trend from 1 22 0 04 and 1 24 0 04 kg n m3 d in phase ii respectively to 1 33 0 03 and 1 34 0 03 kg n m3 d in phase iv fig 1c it should be noted that the nre nrr and cod removal efficiency in rbc were all higher than those in the corresponding phase of rck fig 1c and d for example when the influent cod n ratio was 0 3 phase iii the difference of nitrogen removal performance between rck and rbc was significant fig 1a and b i e the nre of rbc was 90 4 1 4 3 0 higher than that of rck of 87 8 1 4 p 0 001 on the other hand when the influent cod n ratio continued to increase to 0 7 in phase v d 192 213 the effluent nh4 n concentrations of rck and rbc reached 25 2 4 4 mg l and 22 1 1 3 mg l although the nre of rck and rbc were further increased to 96 7 0 7 and 97 1 0 3 respectively fig 1a b and c this result indicated that anammox bacteria were inhibited when the influent cod n ratio was high at 0 7 and the detailed explanation will be discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 4 3 2 variations on anammox biomass concentration and saa the sludge concentration in the reactor and the corresponding saa were measured at the end of each phase d 127 148 170 191 and d 213 and the results are shown in fig 2 it was found that the biomass concentration in the two anammox reactors remained constant during the long term operation while the saa was enhanced under influent cod n ratio between 0 1 and 0 5 and the saa of rbc was much higher than that of rck in the corresponding phase fig 2 as can be seen from fig 2 the mlss in rck and rbc basically remained stable which were 3584 196 and 3701 184 mg l respectively the mlvss also maintained a relatively stable state which were 3203 184 and 3316 109 mg l respectively in rck and rbc in addition the mlvss mlss ratios in rck and rbc were maintained at 0 89 0 01 and 0 90 0 01 respectively indicating that the organic contents in the sludge were relatively high clearly there were no significant difference in the sludge concentration and the mlvss mlss ratio between the two reactors indicating that the addition of biochar did not change the sludge concentration and the proportion of organic content in the anammox enriched sludge different from the relatively stable biomass concentration the saa of the two reactors varied greatly fig 2 on d 127 phase i the saa values of rck and rbc were similar with the vales of 0 46 0 02 and 0 50 0 03 g n g vss d respectively the saa values of rck at d 148 phase ii 170 phase iii and 191 phase iv were 0 58 0 03 0 61 0 03 and 0 55 0 03 g n g vss d respectively compared to that at d 127 the saa values of rck increased to a certain extent that the highest saa was achieved when the influent cod n ratio was 0 3 d 170 phase iii fig 2 however when the influent cod n ratio further increased to 0 7 d 213 phase v the saa of rck decreased to 0 42 0 02 g n g n g vss d which was even lower than that without a cod addition d 127 phase i therefore the activity of anammox bacteria could be improved only when the influent cod n ratio was low 0 1 0 5 compared with rck the saa values of rbc at d 148 170 and 191 were 0 67 0 04 0 75 0 04 and 0 66 0 04 g n g vss d respectively which were about 1 2 times of those of rck at the same phase p 0 05 fig 2 therefore biochar addition could effectively improve the anammox activity on d 213 phase v the saa value of rbc was 0 49 0 04 g n g vss d which was similar to that of rck combined with the nitrogen removal performance of the two reactors in section 3 1 it could be postulated that the anammox activities of the two reactors were inhibited at phase v 3 3 variations on etc of eps and anammox biomass at the end of each phase of operation i e d 127 148 170 191 and d 213 the etc of anammox biomass and eps were also measured as shown in fig 3 biochar could effectively improve the electron donating capacities edc and electron accepting capacities eac of both anammox biomass and its eps so as to improve their etc to be specific during the entire operation the edc of anammox biomass in rck and rbc reactors increased slightly from 0 23 and 0 22 on d 127 phase i to 0 35 and 0 48 mmol e od600 on d 191 phase iv respectively and then remained stable until d 213 phase v 0 37 and 0 50 mmol e od600 respectively fig 3a the eac of anammox biomass in rck and rbc reactors gradually increased from 3 41 and 3 42 d 127 phase i to 3 69 and 5 02 mmol e od600 d 191 phase iv respectively and then remained stable d 213 phase v 3 71 and 5 05 mmol e od600 respectively fig 3a it should be noted that in the stable state phases iv v both edc and eac of anammox biomass in rbc reactor were approximately 35 higher than those of anammox biomass in rck reactor therefore biochar could effectively improve the etc of anammox biomass similar to anammox biomass the addition of biochar also significantly increased the etc of anammox granular eps fig 3b besides it should be mentioned that the eac of anammox biomass was much higher than its edc which might allow the anammox biomass much easier to gain extracellular electrons 3 4 dynamic changes in microbial community composition the inoculated sludge and the sludge at the end of phases ii iii iv and v were sampled the inoculated sludge was recorded as seeding while the other sludge samples were numbered as rck 01 rbc 01 rck 03 rbc 03 rck 05 rbc 05 rck 07 and rbc 07 respectively according to the reactor and influent cod n high throughput sequencing results showed that biochar could selectively promote the abundance of anammox bacteria ca jettenia in the presence of low concentration of organics fig 4 as shown in table s1 ace and chao indexes of sludge samples in rbc were significantly higher than those in the corresponding rck except rck 05 and rbc 05 which were close to each other the results indicated that biochar could significantly improve the microbial community richness of anammox sludge wang et al 2018 2019a the shannon index of rbc 03 was higher than that of rck 03 while the simpson index of rbc 03 was lower than that of rck 03 suggesting that biochar improved the microbial community diversity when the influent cod n ratio was 0 3 wang et al 2018 2019a however under other influent cod n ratios the stimulation effect of biochar on microbial community diversity was not obvious besides the otu number of sludge samples in rbc were also higher than those in the corresponding rck indicating that biochar could increase the species number of anammox sludge wang et al 2018 fig 4 shows the distribution of microorganisms at the genus level the main bacteria genera included ca kuenenia ca jettenia norank f a4b denitratisoma norank f norank o sbr1031 norank f norank o ardenticatenales unclassified f comamonadaceae and alicycliphilus etc among them ca kuenenia ca jettenia and denitratisoma were directly related to nitrogen removal ca kuenenia and ca brocadia are two commonly found anammox bacteria in the laboratory when the influent cod n ratio increased from 0 1 to 0 5 the relative abundance of ca kuenenia in rck gradually increased from 10 0 to 17 1 while that of rbc gradually decreased from 18 1 to 11 8 fig 4 however the relative abundances of ca jettenia both in rck and rbc were increased from 6 6 and 12 2 to 8 1 and 16 2 respectively besides the relative abundance of ca jettenia in rbc was higher than that in the corresponding rck the results indicated that biochar could selectively promote the activity of ca jettenia in the presence of small amounts of organics which was the main bacteria performing dnra pathway details in section 3 5 however when the influent cod n ratio continually increased to 0 7 the relative abundance of ca kuenenia decreased sharply from 17 1 rck 05 and 11 8 rbc 05 to 7 6 rck 07 and 7 6 rbc 07 respectively and the relative abundance of ca jettenia also decreased sharply in rck and rbc from 8 1 rck 05 and 16 2 rbc 05 to 2 3 rck 07 and 2 9 rbc 07 respectively fig 4 obviously the anammox system with biochar addition had lost its advantages when the influent cod n ratio was high at 0 7 in addition the relative abundance of ca kuenenia exceeded ca jettenia again which might be caused by the good tolerance of ca kuenenia to a high concentration of organic carbon russ et al 2012 denitratisoma is a kind of denitrification bacteria which can use eps as carbon source wang et al 2020c increase the influent cod n ratio from 0 1 to 0 5 decreased the relative abundance of denitratisoma gradually from 10 7 rck 01 and 6 4 rbc 01 to 5 1 rck 05 and 3 9 rbc 05 respectively indicating that anammox bacteria still occupied a dominant position in the competition with denitrifying bacteria however when the influent cod n ratio increased further to 0 7 denitratisoma significantly proliferated and the dominant bacteria transformed from anammox bacteria to denitrifying bacteria therefore the effluent nh4 n concentration increased and the saa decreased figs 1a 1b and 2 although some other kinds of bacteria such as comamonas might also have the ability to do denitrification wu et al 2015 the relative abundance of comamonas was only high in rbc 03 and rbc 07 7 1 and 3 8 respectively 3 5 functional composition analysis based on metagenomics sequencing 3 5 1 nitrogen metabolic in this study the metagenomes of anammox sludge with cod n of 0 3 were compared and analyzed each sludge sample contained three biological replicates the abundances of genes encoding enzymes related to ammonia oxidation denitrification anammox and dnra pathway in nitrogen metabolism are shown in fig 5 a the main nitrogen conversion reactions and the variation trend of nitrogen conversion related genes under the effect of biochar are shown in fig 5b the encoding genes of enzymes catalyzing the anammox reaction are nirsk hzs and hdh the relative abundance of hzs in rbc 03 was 8 3 significantly higher than that in rck 03 6 4 p 0 01 however there was no significant difference in the abundance of hdh and nirsk genes fig 5a combined with the enhanced saa it was speculated that biochar enhanced the reaction of no and nh4 to generate n2h4 under the action of hzs fig 5b notably the abundances of dnra related genes napab and nrfah in rbc 03 were significantly higher than those in rck 03 fig 5a indicating that biochar could significantly enhance the dnra pathway in anammox system and the enhancement effect function at each step of the dnra pathway fig 5b interestingly the abundances of denitrification related genes nar and nor in rbc 03 were much lower than those in rck 03 fig 5a the relative abundance of dnra metabolic function gene nrf in different species was further analyzed fig 5c the three species with the highest abundance were unclassified d unclassified ca jettenia caeni and ca brocadia sinica among them ca jettenia caeni and ca brocadia sinica are anammox bacteria fig 5c the relative abundance of nrf gene in ca jettenia caeni in rbc 03 was 30 35 0 01 significantly higher than that in rck 03 14 53 0 01 p 0 01 the relative abundance of nrf gene in ca brocadia sinica in rck 03 and rbc 03 had no significant difference 6 92 0 03 and 5 39 0 02 respectively p 0 05 fig 5c besides the relative abundance of nrf gene in ca jettenia caeni was much higher than that in ca brocadia sinica these results suggested that anammox bacteria especially ca jettenia caeni was the main microorganism for dnra metabolism in anammox system and biochar could significantly enhance the dnra metabolism of anammox bacteria 3 5 2 carbon metabolic in this study the carbon fixation and central carbohydrate metabolism modules in the kegg database were taken as the analysis objects the relative abundances of the genes annotated to these modules are shown in fig 6 prokaryotic microorganisms have six major carbon fixation pathways including reductive pentose phosphate cycle reductive citrate cycle reductive acetyl coa pathway 3 hydroxypropionate bi cycle hydroxypropionate hydroxybutylate cycle and dicarboxylate hydroxybutyrate cycle the relative abundances of genes related to the reductive citrate cycle and reductive acetyl coa pathway in rbc 03 were significantly higher than those of rck 03 fig 6 therefore biochar could strengthen the carbon fixation pathways by enhancing the reductive citrate cycle and reductive acetyl coa pathway central carbohydrate metabolism pathways mainly include glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle and pentose phosphate pathway in this study the relative abundances of genes related to glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle in rbc 03 were significantly higher than those in rck 03 fig 6 indicating that biochar significantly promoted the glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways 4 discussion 4 1 evidence for the occurrence of dnra at low cod n ratios with the increase in the influent cod n ratio from 0 to 0 5 the effluent no3 n concentrations of rbc and rck gradually decreased while the nre gradually improved fig 1a c the nre of rbc and rck respectively increased by 7 2 16 4 and 4 2 13 6 with the increasing of influent cod n ratio from 0 to 0 5 fig 1c further increasing the influent cod n ratio from 0 5 to 0 7 inhibited the anammox reaction and the effluent nh4 n concentrations in the two reactors had a certain surplus phase v fig 1a and b clearly a high concentration of sodium acetate stimulated the proliferation of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria which was confirmed by the 16s rdna sequencing results fig 4 thus reducing the activity of anammox bacteria huang et al 2014 sem also showed that a lot of filamentous bacteria occurred on the anammox granular surface in phase v which were speculated to be the proliferating denitrifying bacteria fig s3 two pathways are possibly responsible for the enhanced nre when the influent cod n ratio was low at 0 1 0 5 i e denitrification and dnra guo et al 2022 wang et al 2020a microbial community analysis revealed that when the influent cod n ratio was 0 0 5 anammox bacteria was in a dominant position in the competition with denitrifying bacteria also the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria mainly denitratisoma gradually decreased with the increased influent cod n ratio fig 4 therefore the denitrification rate of the anammox systems might be low at low influent cod n ratios more importantly metagenomics sequencing results showed that the relative abundance of dnra related gene nrfah in rbc 03 was higher than that of the denitrification related genes norbc and nosz besides the relative abundance of nrfah in rck 03 was also higher than that of nosz fig 5a these results suggest that when the influent cod n ratio was low 0 1 0 5 the nre was significantly increased mainly due to the enhanced dnra pathway in the anammox system instead of denitrification and anammox bacteria ca jettenia caeni were the main microorganism for dnra metabolism in anammox system fig 5c in contrast when the influent cod n ratio was increased to 0 7 denitratisoma became the dominant genus and the relative abundances of ca kuenenia and ca jettenia decreased significantly fig 4 it was reported that the limitation of organics was the driving force for dnra and denitrifying castro barros et al 2017 i e dnra process could be the main nitrogen transformation pathway when limited organics were provided therefore when the influent cod n ratio was low 0 1 0 5 dnra process was more likely to occur in the system combined with the 16s rdna and metagenomics high throughput sequencing results it was speculated that acetate in the influent acted as an electron donor for dnra metabolism of anammox bacteria and reacted with a part of no3 n produced by anammox reaction thus reducing the effluent no3 n concentration 4 2 effect of biochar on dnra pathway of anammox system at low cod n ratios it should be noted that the nre of rbc was 0 9 3 0 higher than that of the corresponding phase of rck when the influent cod n ratio was low 0 1 0 5 and the sludge concentration of the two reactors did not change significantly with the operation time figs 1c and 2 therefore the enhanced nitrogen removal performance was primarily due to the promoted dnra pathway rather than the enriched anammox biomass besides the addition of biochar must have strengthened the dnra pathway of anammox bacteria so that rbc could consume more no3 n and cod than rck in the same time fig 1c and d when the influent cod n ratio was 0 1 0 5 the saa and etc of rbc were 15 5 23 0 and 19 5 32 6 higher than those of the corresponding phase of rck respectively figs 2 and 3a the improved saa indicated that biochar stimulated the activity of anammox bacteria and the enhanced etc of anammox biomass by biochar might be the direct reason for the improved saa and nre on one hand biochar can promote the expression of key genes of anammox bacteria to stimulate anammox and dnra reactions xu et al 2021 on the other hand biochar can enhance extracellular microbial electron transfer of anammox biomass and donate electrons to support bioenergetics of anammox and dnra metabolism xu et al 2020 besides the relative abundances of total anammox bacteria and ca jettenia in rbc were higher than those in the corresponding rck suggesting the stimulation effect of biochar on anammox bacteria fig 4 it should be noted that ca jettenia caeni was the main microorganism for dnra metabolism in anammox system fig 5c more importantly metagenomics sequencing results reveal that rbc 03 had significantly higher abundances of dnra related genes napab and nrfah and much lower abundances of denitrification related genes narghi and norbc than rck 03 fig 5a therefore biochar had stimulated the dnra pathway of anammox bacteria fig 5b it was speculated that biochar could improve the ability of anammox bacteria to gain extracellular electrons by improving the eac of anammox sludge and then enhance the saa dnra pathway and the abundance of anammox bacteria sathishkumar et al 2020 wu et al 2019 biochar has been added to anammox systems to increase the nre by stimulating denitrification and a 9 21 increase in nre and a highest nre of 97 9 were gained adams et al 2021 mojiri et al 2020 xu et al 2020 2021 however in this study with the addition of biochar and organics cod n 0 1 0 5 the nre only increased by 7 16 with the highest nre of 93 7 1 2 through stimulating dnra which was lower than those obtained by stimulating denitrification xu et al 2020 2021 the reason could be attributed to the lower extracellular etc of anammox bacteria than denitrification bacteria anammox bacteria have a dense anammoxosome membrane consisting of ladderane lipids which could block electrons from entering and leaking out of the membrane sinninghe damsté et al 2002 van niftrik et al 2008 compared with other electroactive bacteria such as denitrification bacteria geobacter and shewanella to transfer electrons anammox bacteria has to overcome the additional barrier i e anammoxosome membrane shaw et al 2020 in heterotrophic environments biochar was found to increase nre by 3 1 6 4 compared with that without biochar under different cod concentrations 50 150 mg l which was similar to the 0 9 3 0 increase in this study guo et al 2022 however the increase in nre in their study was also due to the enhanced denitrification rather than the stimulated dnra like in this study which might be caused by the difference in the added cod sources glucose was used as the carbon source in previous study which could not be utilized by anammox bacteria guo et al 2022 however the acetate used in this study was proved to be utilized by anammox bacteria to perform dnra pathway castro barros et al 2017 sumino et al 2006 4 3 possible mechanism of biochar mediated dnra pathway of anammox bacteria in this study biochar was firstly used to selectively mediate dnra pathway of anammox bacteria under varying cod n ratios it was found that 10 g l biochar stimulated the dnra pathway of anammox bacteria at low cod n ratios 0 1 0 5 especially at the cod n ratio of 0 3 fig 1 within which biochar significantly increased saa by 15 5 23 0 and increased the relative abundances of total anammox bacteria and ca jettenia the main bacteria for dnra metabolism by 11 3 82 6 and 68 1 99 3 respectively figs 2 and 4 the etc mainly eac of anammox biomass was also increased by approximately 19 5 32 6 compared to the control fig 3 a possible mechanism for biochar to promote dnra pathway of anammox bacteria was proposed based on the obtained results fig 7 the added biochar could act as an electron shuttle facilitating the extracellular electron transfer especially for anammox bacteria accepting extracellular electrons from other bacteria species or electron donors fig 3 the easily obtained electrons could significantly increase the abundances of genes related to dnra pathway napab and nrfah and anammox reaction hzs which catalyze reactions that consuming electrons fig 5b the created environment favored the enrichment of anammox bacteria especially ca jettenia carrying on dnra metabolism fig 4 the enriched anammox bacteria further stimulated the saa nre etc and carbon metabolic figs 1 3 and 6 the results open a new door for the engineering application of anammox by using biochar to achieve advanced nitrogen removal however to distinguish the contribution of different pathways i e anammox dnra and heterotrophic denitrification to nitrogen removal isotopic technique should be taken in further researches broman et al 2021 the effects of redox active biochar derived from other kinds of feedstock such as sewage sludge and the methods for improving biochar redox properties also need to be further explored 5 conclusions this study for the first time investigated the stimulation effect of biochar on dnra pathway of anammox process under varying cod n ratios the variations on saa etc microbial community composition and genes related to nitrogen and carbon metabolic were examined the results suggested that the dnra pathway of anammox bacteria could be stimulated by the addition of 10 g l biochar at low influent cod n ratios 0 1 0 5 especially when the cod n ratio was 0 3 the highest saa was also achieved in rbc at the influent cod n ratio of 0 3 with the value of 0 75 0 04 g n g vss d being 23 higher than that of rck 0 61 0 03 g n g vss d the promotion effect of biochar on nre of anammox system was attributed to the enhanced etc especially eac of anammox biomass and enriched anammox bacteria which facilitated dnra pathway metagenomics sequencing further revealed that the addition of biochar increased the relative abundances of genes related to anammox reaction hzs dnra pathway napab and nrfah reductive citrate cycle reductive acetyl coa pathway glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle which might be the most essential mechanism for the improved the nre of anammox process by biochar declaration of competing interest the

16252,coupling dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra pathway with anammox process has a prominent advantage in enhancement of nitrogen removal however the anammox bacteria driven dnra is difficult to proceed at normal autotrophic circumstance herein for the first time biochar prepared by bamboo was used as a mediator to stimulate the dnra pathway of anammox bacteria under varying chemical oxygen demand cod to nitrogen cod n ratios 0 1 0 7 and the underlying stimulation mechanism was elucidated by metagenomics sequencing analysis results showed that biochar addition 10 g l stimulated dnra pathway of anammox bacteria at low cod n ratios 0 1 0 5 thus enhancing the nitrogen removal efficiency nre of the anammox system by 7 2 16 4 and 0 9 3 0 respectively compared to that of tests without sodium acetate and biochar p 0 05 this enhancement was attributed to the improved extracellular electron accepting capacity of anammox biomass by biochar the easily obtained electrons from sodium acetate further increased the relative abundances of anammox related hzs and complete dnra related napab and nrfah genes p 0 05 which catalyze electron consuming reactions the stimulated anammox pathway and dnra pathway further increased the specific anammox activity and the relative abundance of anammox bacteria especially ca jettenia by 15 5 23 0 and 11 3 82 6 compared with that without biochar respectively metagenomics sequencing also revealed that anammox bacteria ca jettenia caeni was the main bacteria for dnra metabolism in this system our findings reveal that biochar could selectively stimulate dnra pathway of anammox bacteria affiliated by a low amount of carbon which provides a novel strategy to improve the nitrogen removal of anammox based processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox biochar dnra metagenomics sequencing nitrogen removal 1 introduction dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra is a biological process that reduces nitrate to ammonium using nitrite as the intermediate güven et al 2005 it involves a two step reaction which occurs in anoxic environment the first step is nitrate reduction to nitrite like denitrification which is called nitrate respiration the second step is nitrite reduction to ammonium which can either be respiratory or fermentative kern and simon 2009 pandey et al 2020 simon and klotz 2013 wang et al 2019b dnra process was firstly discovered in autotrophic soil organisms as early as 1938 woods 1938 and now has been considered as a vital part of global biogeochemical nitrogen cycling in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems accounting for approximately 93 of nitrate reduction chen et al 2015 nie et al 2021 wang et al 2021b some anammox bacteria species such as ca anammoxoglobus propionicus ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis and ca brocadia fuldiga have already been found to be capable of performing dnra metabolism using small molecule acids e g formate acetate and propionate as electron donors güven et al 2005 kartal et al 2007b shu et al 2015 the limitation of chemical oxygen demand cod and the presence of ammonium can favor anammox bacteria to perform dnra and outcompete heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria castro barros et al 2017 considering the presence of organics in the real wastewater wang et al 2020c the dnra metabolism of anammox bacteria is meaningful firstly the dnra metabolites nitrite and ammonium can be further utilized by anammox pathway thus improving the total nitrogen removal efficiency nre of anammox systems castro barros et al 2017 secondly compared with other methods to improve the nre of anammox systems such as coupling with denitrification and partial denitrification coupling dnra with anammox can rely solely on the functional autotrophic anammox bacteria which can dramatically reduce the additional carbon sources operating cost and energy consumption li et al 2020b moreover dnra metabolism consumes organics e g formate acetate and propionate which will reduce the effluent cod and avoid the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria due to numerous advantages of coupling dnra with anammox process there have already been attempts to enable dnra occur synergistically with anammox pathway in the same reactor table 1 castro barros et al 2017 han et al 2020 li et al 2020b wang et al 2021a yin et al 2021 it has been confirmed that low influent cod no3 n ratio about 1 14 favored anammox bacteria to perform partial dnra together with anammox reaction castro barros et al 2017 using acetate iron or intracellular carbon source e g glycogen as electron donors the coupled dnra and anammox processes have been successfully established both performed by anammox bacteria li et al 2020b wang et al 2021a yin et al 2021 in another study coupling anammox with ignavibacterium or geobacter performed dnra pathway was also successfully achieved however this coupling process requires the cooperation of multiple functional bacteria posing challenges for the operational control strategies to achieve the process stability ahmad et al 2021 additionally the coupled anammox and dnra processes were found to be beneficial to promote the degradation of benzene and accelerate the growth of anammox bacteria han et al 2020 yin et al 2021 however the dnra metabolism activity of anammox bacteria is usually low 0 3 0 02 fmol cell d kartal et al 2007a wang et al 2020a therefore an appropriate method to selectively promote the dnra pathway of anammox bacteria while effectively inhibit heterotrophic microorganisms is urgently required biochar is a cost effective and eco friendly material with abundant redox active functional groups hence biochar has redox properties capable of accepting and donating electrons which has been used to facilitate extracellular electron transfer efficiency and stimulate denitrification kamali et al 2021 su et al 2019 wu et al 2019 the extracellular electron transfer capability etc of anammox bacteria has also been proved recently shaw et al 2020 thus an assumption is that whether biochar can be used as an electron shuttle to enhance the extracellular electron transfer efficiency and selectively mediate the dnra pathway of anammox bacteria in the presence of organics ultimately enhancing the nre of anammox system the main objective of this study was using biochar to selectively mediate dnra pathway of anammox bacteria and make it co occurrence with anammox metabolism under varying cod n ratios a possible mechanism of biochar enhancing dnra pathway of anammox bacteria was also proposed from the perspective of etc microbial community composition and metagenomics sequencing this study for the first time provided deep insights into the feasibility of using redox active biochar to selectively mediate dnra pathway of anammox bacteria these insights are expected to provide an economical and efficient approach to improve nre of anammox based processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation condition two parallel reactors rck and rbc were used in this experiment rck was the control reactor with no biochar added while rbc was the experimental reactor with 10 g l biochar added at the initial of this experiment other operating conditions except the addition of biochar of the two reactors were consistent biochar with a uniform particle size of 20 40 μm was produced by pyrolyzing bamboo lianyungang jiangsu province china at 400 c in a tube furnace fig s1 bamboo was selected as the feedstock for the preparation of biochar due to the potential high etc of bamboo based biochar li et al 2020a two sequencing batch reactors sbrs made of plexiglass with a working volume of 1 l were adopted to culture anammox granules a typical sbr cycle lasted for 8 h including 5 min of feeding 390 min of mixing 60 min of settling 10 min of drainage and 15 min of idling time the influent and effluent were controlled by peristaltic pumps the hydraulic retention time was set as 13 h and the reactor temperature was controlled by a thermostatic water bath at 35 1 c before testing the two sbrs were pre cultured using synthetic wastewater for 107 days the nitrogen removal performances of the two sbrs were consistent and the nitrogen loading rate nlr and nre were stable at 1 24 kg n m3 d and 80 5 1 5 respectively fig s2 on d 108 10 g biochar was added to rbc resulting in a final concentration of 10 g l the dosage of 10 g biochar l was selected in this study according to our previous study wang et al 2022 the two sbrs were then operated for 106 days d 108 213 which could be divided into five phases according to the influent cod concentration table 2 cod was controlled as required by adding different concentrations of sodium acetate 2 2 seed sludge and feeding medium anammox granules enriched in a 20 l parent sbr in our laboratory were used as inoculation sludge the anammox granules were cultured using synthetic

cod n ratio gradually increased from 0 to 0 7 by increasing the influent cod concentration the operation could be divided into five phases based on the cod n ratio i e 0 phase i 0 1 phase ii 0 3 phase iii 0 5 phase iv and 0 7 phase v table 2 as shown in fig 1 when the influent cod n ratio gradually increased from 0 to 0 7 the effluent no3 n concentrations of rck and rbc gradually decreased leading to gradual improvement of nre also the nre of rbc was higher than that of rck in the corresponding phase in phase i cod n 0 d 108 127 both rck and rbc showed good nitrogen removal performance with the influent nh4 n and no2 n almost completely being consumed fig 1a and b the cumulative no3 n concentrations of rck and rbc were 124 7 3 3 mg l and 117 6 4 4 mg l respectively resulting in a similar nre of 81 6 0 6 and 80 5 1 5 in individual reactor fig 1c when increasing the influent cod n ratio from 0 1 to 0 5 phase ii iv the effluent no3 n concentration of rck and rbc gradually decreased to 43 6 5 0 mg l and 38 8 6 1 mg l respectively but nre increased to 92 9 1 1 and 93 7 1 2 respectively fig 1a and b besides the nrr of rck and rbc showed an increasing trend from 1 22 0 04 and 1 24 0 04 kg n m3 d in phase ii respectively to 1 33 0 03 and 1 34 0 03 kg n m3 d in phase iv fig 1c it should be noted that the nre nrr and cod removal efficiency in rbc were all higher than those in the corresponding phase of rck fig 1c and d for example when the influent cod n ratio was 0 3 phase iii the difference of nitrogen removal performance between rck and rbc was significant fig 1a and b i e the nre of rbc was 90 4 1 4 3 0 higher than that of rck of 87 8 1 4 p 0 001 on the other hand when the influent cod n ratio continued to increase to 0 7 in phase v d 192 213 the effluent nh4 n concentrations of rck and rbc reached 25 2 4 4 mg l and 22 1 1 3 mg l although the nre of rck and rbc were further increased to 96 7 0 7 and 97 1 0 3 respectively fig 1a b and c this result indicated that anammox bacteria were inhibited when the influent cod n ratio was high at 0 7 and the detailed explanation will be discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 4 3 2 variations on anammox biomass concentration and saa the sludge concentration in the reactor and the corresponding saa were measured at the end of each phase d 127 148 170 191 and d 213 and the results are shown in fig 2 it was found that the biomass concentration in the two anammox reactors remained constant during the long term operation while the saa was enhanced under influent cod n ratio between 0 1 and 0 5 and the saa of rbc was much higher than that of rck in the corresponding phase fig 2 as can be seen from fig 2 the mlss in rck and rbc basically remained stable which were 3584 196 and 3701 184 mg l respectively the mlvss also maintained a relatively stable state which were 3203 184 and 3316 109 mg l respectively in rck and rbc in addition the mlvss mlss ratios in rck and rbc were maintained at 0 89 0 01 and 0 90 0 01 respectively indicating that the organic contents in the sludge were relatively high clearly there were no significant difference in the sludge concentration and the mlvss mlss ratio between the two reactors indicating that the addition of biochar did not change the sludge concentration and the proportion of organic content in the anammox enriched sludge different from the relatively stable biomass concentration the saa of the two reactors varied greatly fig 2 on d 127 phase i the saa values of rck and rbc were similar with the vales of 0 46 0 02 and 0 50 0 03 g n g vss d respectively the saa values of rck at d 148 phase ii 170 phase iii and 191 phase iv were 0 58 0 03 0 61 0 03 and 0 55 0 03 g n g vss d respectively compared to that at d 127 the saa values of rck increased to a certain extent that the highest saa was achieved when the influent cod n ratio was 0 3 d 170 phase iii fig 2 however when the influent cod n ratio further increased to 0 7 d 213 phase v the saa of rck decreased to 0 42 0 02 g n g n g vss d which was even lower than that without a cod addition d 127 phase i therefore the activity of anammox bacteria could be improved only when the influent cod n ratio was low 0 1 0 5 compared with rck the saa values of rbc at d 148 170 and 191 were 0 67 0 04 0 75 0 04 and 0 66 0 04 g n g vss d respectively which were about 1 2 times of those of rck at the same phase p 0 05 fig 2 therefore biochar addition could effectively improve the anammox activity on d 213 phase v the saa value of rbc was 0 49 0 04 g n g vss d which was similar to that of rck combined with the nitrogen removal performance of the two reactors in section 3 1 it could be postulated that the anammox activities of the two reactors were inhibited at phase v 3 3 variations on etc of eps and anammox biomass at the end of each phase of operation i e d 127 148 170 191 and d 213 the etc of anammox biomass and eps were also measured as shown in fig 3 biochar could effectively improve the electron donating capacities edc and electron accepting capacities eac of both anammox biomass and its eps so as to improve their etc to be specific during the entire operation the edc of anammox biomass in rck and rbc reactors increased slightly from 0 23 and 0 22 on d 127 phase i to 0 35 and 0 48 mmol e od600 on d 191 phase iv respectively and then remained stable until d 213 phase v 0 37 and 0 50 mmol e od600 respectively fig 3a the eac of anammox biomass in rck and rbc reactors gradually increased from 3 41 and 3 42 d 127 phase i to 3 69 and 5 02 mmol e od600 d 191 phase iv respectively and then remained stable d 213 phase v 3 71 and 5 05 mmol e od600 respectively fig 3a it should be noted that in the stable state phases iv v both edc and eac of anammox biomass in rbc reactor were approximately 35 higher than those of anammox biomass in rck reactor therefore biochar could effectively improve the etc of anammox biomass similar to anammox biomass the addition of biochar also significantly increased the etc of anammox granular eps fig 3b besides it should be mentioned that the eac of anammox biomass was much higher than its edc which might allow the anammox biomass much easier to gain extracellular electrons 3 4 dynamic changes in microbial community composition the inoculated sludge and the sludge at the end of phases ii iii iv and v were sampled the inoculated sludge was recorded as seeding while the other sludge samples were numbered as rck 01 rbc 01 rck 03 rbc 03 rck 05 rbc 05 rck 07 and rbc 07 respectively according to the reactor and influent cod n high throughput sequencing results showed that biochar could selectively promote the abundance of anammox bacteria ca jettenia in the presence of low concentration of organics fig 4 as shown in table s1 ace and chao indexes of sludge samples in rbc were significantly higher than those in the corresponding rck except rck 05 and rbc 05 which were close to each other the results indicated that biochar could significantly improve the microbial community richness of anammox sludge wang et al 2018 2019a the shannon index of rbc 03 was higher than that of rck 03 while the simpson index of rbc 03 was lower than that of rck 03 suggesting that biochar improved the microbial community diversity when the influent cod n ratio was 0 3 wang et al 2018 2019a however under other influent cod n ratios the stimulation effect of biochar on microbial community diversity was not obvious besides the otu number of sludge samples in rbc were also higher than those in the corresponding rck indicating that biochar could increase the species number of anammox sludge wang et al 2018 fig 4 shows the distribution of microorganisms at the genus level the main bacteria genera included ca kuenenia ca jettenia norank f a4b denitratisoma norank f norank o sbr1031 norank f norank o ardenticatenales unclassified f comamonadaceae and alicycliphilus etc among them ca kuenenia ca jettenia and denitratisoma were directly related to nitrogen removal ca kuenenia and ca brocadia are two commonly found anammox bacteria in the laboratory when the influent cod n ratio increased from 0 1 to 0 5 the relative abundance of ca kuenenia in rck gradually increased from 10 0 to 17 1 while that of rbc gradually decreased from 18 1 to 11 8 fig 4 however the relative abundances of ca jettenia both in rck and rbc were increased from 6 6 and 12 2 to 8 1 and 16 2 respectively besides the relative abundance of ca jettenia in rbc was higher than that in the corresponding rck the results indicated that biochar could selectively promote the activity of ca jettenia in the presence of small amounts of organics which was the main bacteria performing dnra pathway details in section 3 5 however when the influent cod n ratio continually increased to 0 7 the relative abundance of ca kuenenia decreased sharply from 17 1 rck 05 and 11 8 rbc 05 to 7 6 rck 07 and 7 6 rbc 07 respectively and the relative abundance of ca jettenia also decreased sharply in rck and rbc from 8 1 rck 05 and 16 2 rbc 05 to 2 3 rck 07 and 2 9 rbc 07 respectively fig 4 obviously the anammox system with biochar addition had lost its advantages when the influent cod n ratio was high at 0 7 in addition the relative abundance of ca kuenenia exceeded ca jettenia again which might be caused by the good tolerance of ca kuenenia to a high concentration of organic carbon russ et al 2012 denitratisoma is a kind of denitrification bacteria which can use eps as carbon source wang et al 2020c increase the influent cod n ratio from 0 1 to 0 5 decreased the relative abundance of denitratisoma gradually from 10 7 rck 01 and 6 4 rbc 01 to 5 1 rck 05 and 3 9 rbc 05 respectively indicating that anammox bacteria still occupied a dominant position in the competition with denitrifying bacteria however when the influent cod n ratio increased further to 0 7 denitratisoma significantly proliferated and the dominant bacteria transformed from anammox bacteria to denitrifying bacteria therefore the effluent nh4 n concentration increased and the saa decreased figs 1a 1b and 2 although some other kinds of bacteria such as comamonas might also have the ability to do denitrification wu et al 2015 the relative abundance of comamonas was only high in rbc 03 and rbc 07 7 1 and 3 8 respectively 3 5 functional composition analysis based on metagenomics sequencing 3 5 1 nitrogen metabolic in this study the metagenomes of anammox sludge with cod n of 0 3 were compared and analyzed each sludge sample contained three biological replicates the abundances of genes encoding enzymes related to ammonia oxidation denitrification anammox and dnra pathway in nitrogen metabolism are shown in fig 5 a the main nitrogen conversion reactions and the variation trend of nitrogen conversion related genes under the effect of biochar are shown in fig 5b the encoding genes of enzymes catalyzing the anammox reaction are nirsk hzs and hdh the relative abundance of hzs in rbc 03 was 8 3 significantly higher than that in rck 03 6 4 p 0 01 however there was no significant difference in the abundance of hdh and nirsk genes fig 5a combined with the enhanced saa it was speculated that biochar enhanced the reaction of no and nh4 to generate n2h4 under the action of hzs fig 5b notably the abundances of dnra related genes napab and nrfah in rbc 03 were significantly higher than those in rck 03 fig 5a indicating that biochar could significantly enhance the dnra pathway in anammox system and the enhancement effect function at each step of the dnra pathway fig 5b interestingly the abundances of denitrification related genes nar and nor in rbc 03 were much lower than those in rck 03 fig 5a the relative abundance of dnra metabolic function gene nrf in different species was further analyzed fig 5c the three species with the highest abundance were unclassified d unclassified ca jettenia caeni and ca brocadia sinica among them ca jettenia caeni and ca brocadia sinica are anammox bacteria fig 5c the relative abundance of nrf gene in ca jettenia caeni in rbc 03 was 30 35 0 01 significantly higher than that in rck 03 14 53 0 01 p 0 01 the relative abundance of nrf gene in ca brocadia sinica in rck 03 and rbc 03 had no significant difference 6 92 0 03 and 5 39 0 02 respectively p 0 05 fig 5c besides the relative abundance of nrf gene in ca jettenia caeni was much higher than that in ca brocadia sinica these results suggested that anammox bacteria especially ca jettenia caeni was the main microorganism for dnra metabolism in anammox system and biochar could significantly enhance the dnra metabolism of anammox bacteria 3 5 2 carbon metabolic in this study the carbon fixation and central carbohydrate metabolism modules in the kegg database were taken as the analysis objects the relative abundances of the genes annotated to these modules are shown in fig 6 prokaryotic microorganisms have six major carbon fixation pathways including reductive pentose phosphate cycle reductive citrate cycle reductive acetyl coa pathway 3 hydroxypropionate bi cycle hydroxypropionate hydroxybutylate cycle and dicarboxylate hydroxybutyrate cycle the relative abundances of genes related to the reductive citrate cycle and reductive acetyl coa pathway in rbc 03 were significantly higher than those of rck 03 fig 6 therefore biochar could strengthen the carbon fixation pathways by enhancing the reductive citrate cycle and reductive acetyl coa pathway central carbohydrate metabolism pathways mainly include glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle and pentose phosphate pathway in this study the relative abundances of genes related to glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle in rbc 03 were significantly higher than those in rck 03 fig 6 indicating that biochar significantly promoted the glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways 4 discussion 4 1 evidence for the occurrence of dnra at low cod n ratios with the increase in the influent cod n ratio from 0 to 0 5 the effluent no3 n concentrations of rbc and rck gradually decreased while the nre gradually improved fig 1a c the nre of rbc and rck respectively increased by 7 2 16 4 and 4 2 13 6 with the increasing of influent cod n ratio from 0 to 0 5 fig 1c further increasing the influent cod n ratio from 0 5 to 0 7 inhibited the anammox reaction and the effluent nh4 n concentrations in the two reactors had a certain surplus phase v fig 1a and b clearly a high concentration of sodium acetate stimulated the proliferation of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria which was confirmed by the 16s rdna sequencing results fig 4 thus reducing the activity of anammox bacteria huang et al 2014 sem also showed that a lot of filamentous bacteria occurred on the anammox granular surface in phase v which were speculated to be the proliferating denitrifying bacteria fig s3 two pathways are possibly responsible for the enhanced nre when the influent cod n ratio was low at 0 1 0 5 i e denitrification and dnra guo et al 2022 wang et al 2020a microbial community analysis revealed that when the influent cod n ratio was 0 0 5 anammox bacteria was in a dominant position in the competition with denitrifying bacteria also the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria mainly denitratisoma gradually decreased with the increased influent cod n ratio fig 4 therefore the denitrification rate of the anammox systems might be low at low influent cod n ratios more importantly metagenomics sequencing results showed that the relative abundance of dnra related gene nrfah in rbc 03 was higher than that of the denitrification related genes norbc and nosz besides the relative abundance of nrfah in rck 03 was also higher than that of nosz fig 5a these results suggest that when the influent cod n ratio was low 0 1 0 5 the nre was significantly increased mainly due to the enhanced dnra pathway in the anammox system instead of denitrification and anammox bacteria ca jettenia caeni were the main microorganism for dnra metabolism in anammox system fig 5c in contrast when the influent cod n ratio was increased to 0 7 denitratisoma became the dominant genus and the relative abundances of ca kuenenia and ca jettenia decreased significantly fig 4 it was reported that the limitation of organics was the driving force for dnra and denitrifying castro barros et al 2017 i e dnra process could be the main nitrogen transformation pathway when limited organics were provided therefore when the influent cod n ratio was low 0 1 0 5 dnra process was more likely to occur in the system combined with the 16s rdna and metagenomics high throughput sequencing results it was speculated that acetate in the influent acted as an electron donor for dnra metabolism of anammox bacteria and reacted with a part of no3 n produced by anammox reaction thus reducing the effluent no3 n concentration 4 2 effect of biochar on dnra pathway of anammox system at low cod n ratios it should be noted that the nre of rbc was 0 9 3 0 higher than that of the corresponding phase of rck when the influent cod n ratio was low 0 1 0 5 and the sludge concentration of the two reactors did not change significantly with the operation time figs 1c and 2 therefore the enhanced nitrogen removal performance was primarily due to the promoted dnra pathway rather than the enriched anammox biomass besides the addition of biochar must have strengthened the dnra pathway of anammox bacteria so that rbc could consume more no3 n and cod than rck in the same time fig 1c and d when the influent cod n ratio was 0 1 0 5 the saa and etc of rbc were 15 5 23 0 and 19 5 32 6 higher than those of the corresponding phase of rck respectively figs 2 and 3a the improved saa indicated that biochar stimulated the activity of anammox bacteria and the enhanced etc of anammox biomass by biochar might be the direct reason for the improved saa and nre on one hand biochar can promote the expression of key genes of anammox bacteria to stimulate anammox and dnra reactions xu et al 2021 on the other hand biochar can enhance extracellular microbial electron transfer of anammox biomass and donate electrons to support bioenergetics of anammox and dnra metabolism xu et al 2020 besides the relative abundances of total anammox bacteria and ca jettenia in rbc were higher than those in the corresponding rck suggesting the stimulation effect of biochar on anammox bacteria fig 4 it should be noted that ca jettenia caeni was the main microorganism for dnra metabolism in anammox system fig 5c more importantly metagenomics sequencing results reveal that rbc 03 had significantly higher abundances of dnra related genes napab and nrfah and much lower abundances of denitrification related genes narghi and norbc than rck 03 fig 5a therefore biochar had stimulated the dnra pathway of anammox bacteria fig 5b it was speculated that biochar could improve the ability of anammox bacteria to gain extracellular electrons by improving the eac of anammox sludge and then enhance the saa dnra pathway and the abundance of anammox bacteria sathishkumar et al 2020 wu et al 2019 biochar has been added to anammox systems to increase the nre by stimulating denitrification and a 9 21 increase in nre and a highest nre of 97 9 were gained adams et al 2021 mojiri et al 2020 xu et al 2020 2021 however in this study with the addition of biochar and organics cod n 0 1 0 5 the nre only increased by 7 16 with the highest nre of 93 7 1 2 through stimulating dnra which was lower than those obtained by stimulating denitrification xu et al 2020 2021 the reason could be attributed to the lower extracellular etc of anammox bacteria than denitrification bacteria anammox bacteria have a dense anammoxosome membrane consisting of ladderane lipids which could block electrons from entering and leaking out of the membrane sinninghe damsté et al 2002 van niftrik et al 2008 compared with other electroactive bacteria such as denitrification bacteria geobacter and shewanella to transfer electrons anammox bacteria has to overcome the additional barrier i e anammoxosome membrane shaw et al 2020 in heterotrophic environments biochar was found to increase nre by 3 1 6 4 compared with that without biochar under different cod concentrations 50 150 mg l which was similar to the 0 9 3 0 increase in this study guo et al 2022 however the increase in nre in their study was also due to the enhanced denitrification rather than the stimulated dnra like in this study which might be caused by the difference in the added cod sources glucose was used as the carbon source in previous study which could not be utilized by anammox bacteria guo et al 2022 however the acetate used in this study was proved to be utilized by anammox bacteria to perform dnra pathway castro barros et al 2017 sumino et al 2006 4 3 possible mechanism of biochar mediated dnra pathway of anammox bacteria in this study biochar was firstly used to selectively mediate dnra pathway of anammox bacteria under varying cod n ratios it was found that 10 g l biochar stimulated the dnra pathway of anammox bacteria at low cod n ratios 0 1 0 5 especially at the cod n ratio of 0 3 fig 1 within which biochar significantly increased saa by 15 5 23 0 and increased the relative abundances of total anammox bacteria and ca jettenia the main bacteria for dnra metabolism by 11 3 82 6 and 68 1 99 3 respectively figs 2 and 4 the etc mainly eac of anammox biomass was also increased by approximately 19 5 32 6 compared to the control fig 3 a possible mechanism for biochar to promote dnra pathway of anammox bacteria was proposed based on the obtained results fig 7 the added biochar could act as an electron shuttle facilitating the extracellular electron transfer especially for anammox bacteria accepting extracellular electrons from other bacteria species or electron donors fig 3 the easily obtained electrons could significantly increase the abundances of genes related to dnra pathway napab and nrfah and anammox reaction hzs which catalyze reactions that consuming electrons fig 5b the created environment favored the enrichment of anammox bacteria especially ca jettenia carrying on dnra metabolism fig 4 the enriched anammox bacteria further stimulated the saa nre etc and carbon metabolic figs 1 3 and 6 the results open a new door for the engineering application of anammox by using biochar to achieve advanced nitrogen removal however to distinguish the contribution of different pathways i e anammox dnra and heterotrophic denitrification to nitrogen removal isotopic technique should be taken in further researches broman et al 2021 the effects of redox active biochar derived from other kinds of feedstock such as sewage sludge and the methods for improving biochar redox properties also need to be further explored 5 conclusions this study for the first time investigated the stimulation effect of biochar on dnra pathway of anammox process under varying cod n ratios the variations on saa etc microbial community composition and genes related to nitrogen and carbon metabolic were examined the results suggested that the dnra pathway of anammox bacteria could be stimulated by the addition of 10 g l biochar at low influent cod n ratios 0 1 0 5 especially when the cod n ratio was 0 3 the highest saa was also achieved in rbc at the influent cod n ratio of 0 3 with the value of 0 75 0 04 g n g vss d being 23 higher than that of rck 0 61 0 03 g n g vss d the promotion effect of biochar on nre of anammox system was attributed to the enhanced etc especially eac of anammox biomass and enriched anammox bacteria which facilitated dnra pathway metagenomics sequencing further revealed that the addition of biochar increased the relative abundances of genes related to anammox reaction hzs dnra pathway napab and nrfah reductive citrate cycle reductive acetyl coa pathway glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle which might be the most essential mechanism for the improved the nre of anammox process by biochar declaration of competing interest the

16253,investigating waterborne viruses is of great importance to minimizing risks to public health viruses tend to adsorb to sludge particles from wastewater processes by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between virus aquatic matrix and particle surface sludge is often re used in agriculture therefore its evaluation is also of great interest to public health in the present study a pilot scale system treating real domestic wastewater from a large city in brazil was used to evaluate the removal the overall reduction and liquid solid partitioning of human adenovirus hadv the novel coronavirus sars cov 2 and fecal indicators f specific coliphages and e coli the system consists of a high rate algal pond hrap post treating the effluent of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor samples were collected from the influent and effluent of each unit as well as from the sludge of the uasb and from the microalgae biomass in the hrap pathogens and indicators were quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr for hadv qpcr with reverse transcription rtqpcr for sars cov 2 the double agar plaque assay for coliphages and the most probable number mpn method for e coli the removal and overall reduction of hadv and sars cov 2 was greater than 1 log10 almost 60 of remaining sars cov 2 rna and more than 70 of remaining hadv dna left the system in the sludge demonstrating that both viruses may have affinity for solids coliphages showed a much lower affinity to solids with only 3 7 leaving the system in the sludge the system performed well in terms of the removal of organic matter and ammoniacal nitrogen however tertiary treatment would be necessary to provide further pathogen reduction if the effluent is to be reused in agriculture to our knowledge this is the first study that evaluated the reduction and partitioning of sars cov 2 and hadv through the complete cycle of a wastewater treatment system consisting of a uasb reactor followed by hraps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sars cov 2 adenovirus sludge virus removal sewage uasb high rate algal ponds 1 introduction the study of waterborne viruses is of great importance to minimizing risks to public health especially in developing countries where sanitation infrastructure is scarce and wastewater is commonly discharged without any previous treatment pandey et al 2021 for instance brazil treats 49 of the generated wastewater snis 2019 india only 37 and the situation in south east asian countries is even worse as only 10 of wastewater is treated pandey et al 2021 human adenoviruses hadv a non enveloped and double stranded dna virus have been suggested as preferred candidates as indicators for viral pathogens because compared to other viruses hadv are frequently present in contaminated waters and their concentration in wastewater is high allard 2017 also they do not fluctuate seasonally verbyla et al 2016 and may survive long periods in aquatic environments not to mention that they are highly resistant to different processes such as uv radiation allard 2017 new viral pathogens are constantly emerging or being discovered in the environment one example is the novel coronavirus sars cov 2 that caused the covid 19 pandemic it is an enveloped and single stranded rna virus which viral particles have been detected in stool and urine samples of infected people that are subsequently discharged into the wastewater saawarn and hait 2021 the detection of sars cov 2 has been reported in wastewater samples ahmed et al 2020a medema et al 2020 mota et al 2021 and in sludge samples peccia et al 2020 serra compte et al 2021 from wastewater treatment plants the detection of hadv in wastewater and sludge has also been widely studied allard 2017 fong et al 2010 yin et al 2018 nevertheless there is still a lack of knowledge and literature data about the removal of viruses including sars cov 2 and hadv in wastewater treatment processes especially in developing countries verbyla et al 2017 this may be attributed to the high costs and expertise required to perform the necessary quantitative molecular analyses upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors are one of the most widely used wastewater treatment technologies in latin america and the caribbean mainly due to their low operating costs noyola et al 2012 high rate algal ponds hrap have been recently used as post treatment for uasb reactors organic matter solids nutrients pathogen indicators and other pollutants have been reported for this combined system espinosa et al 2021 vassalle et al 2020b 2020a but there are still very limited data available on the removal of pathogens an important factor which is often widely ignored in the literature is the viruses affinity toward solids in the wastewater and their removal in the solid phase viruses tend to adsorb to solids due to electrostatic interactions influenced by the surface charge of the virus and hydrophobic interactions influenced by the hydrophobic proteins of the viral capsid verbyla and mihelcic 2015 if a virus is highly resistant to a treatment process but has a high affinity toward solids and is discharged in the sludge there may be an illusion of high reduction based on the observed differences in the concentration of the virus at the influent and liquid effluent points but there could still be a need to ensure sufficient reduction of viruses in the sludge before it can be safely reused or discharged in our recently study espinosa et al 2021 we proposed a mass balance model which helps estimating a mass balance of the microorganisms entering and leaving the system the model is based on the microbial influent and effluent concentrations in the liquid phase and the microbial fraction in the solid phase this model can be used by other wwtp since the concentrations of microorganisms in the liquid phase are commonly reported as the fraction of pathogens in the sludge is not usually reported it can be predicted using the total solid yields with respect to the ts produced or cod treated in the system a complete explanation of the model is reported in espinosa et al 2021 the aim of this study was to fill important knowledge gaps regarding the removal and liquid solid partitioning of hadv sars cov 2 f specific coliphages and e coli in a pilot scale uasb reactor followed by parallel hraps treating real domestic wastewater in belo horizonte brazil 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design experimental data were gathered in a demonstration scale system located at the research and training center for sanitation cepts in belo horizonte brazil the system consists of a uasb reactor followed by twin high rate algal ponds vassalle et al 2020a fed with real wastewater from a full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp in the city of belo horizonte as shown in fig 1 the system was operating normally during the pandemic the uasb reactor worked with a volume of 343 l height 4 0 m diameter 0 3 m and was operated at a flow rate of 50 l h 1 and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 7 h the hraps worked in parallel with a volume of 205 l each height 0 5 m length 1 7 m width 0 24 m and were operated at a flow rate of 25 5 l day 1 each and an hrt of 8 days the biomass settler worked with a volume of 30 l and was operated at an hrt of 14 hours for the anaerobic co digestion 12 l of harvested microalgae biomass were pumped to a plexiglass column located 4 m above the uasb reactor and recirculated to the reactor at flow rate of 0 5 l h 1 the system has been operating since july 2018 on a continuous basis a total of 13 samples were collected from each sample collection point during a total period of 6 weeks i e approximately two samples collected each week between july and august 2020 during the first wave of the covid 19 outbreak in the city of belo horizonte this sampling period of six weeks was chosen because of the high concentrations of sars cov 2 in the wastewater due to the outbreak which permitted its detection in both untreated and treated wastewater allowing for the calculation of removal rates the samples were composite samples with subsamples collected every 20 minutes for 1 h at the influent point 1 fig 1 and at the effluent of the uasb reactor point 2 fig 1 from the uasb sludge point 5 fig 1 from the hrap liquid effluent point 3 fig 1 and from the algal biomass at the bottom of the settler point 4 fig 1 these sample collection points were chosen to perform a mass balance of microorganisms entering and leaving each reactor in the liquid and sludge biomass phases all samples were stored at 4 c and the microbial analyses were conducted within 24 h of sample collection at the laboratory of microbiology of the sanitary and environmental engineering department at federal university of minas gerais 2 2 physical chemical analysis liquid phase samples from the raw wastewater and the

quantitative calculations the lod was defined as the number of copies corresponding with 95 probability of amplification bustin et al 2009 the calculation for the lod was carried out following the exponential model established by verbyla et al 2016 values obtained for the lod in this study are presented in the supplementary material for both viruses sars cov 2 and hadv in order to calculate removal reduction and partitioning values the concentrations of all nd samples were substituted with the lod for the respective assay 2 6 analysis of removal reduction and partitioning of the microrganisms the removal and reduction of the four microbial constituents analyzed in this study were calculated as previously explained in espinosa et al 2021 using the log10 removal or the log10 reduction of the geometric mean concentrations or loadings see eq s1 and eq s2 in the supplementary material here removal is defined as the removal of the microorganism from the liquid fraction of influent and effluent streams whereas reduction is defined as the overall difference in the loadings coming into the reactor vs leaving the reactor including both liquid and sludge biomass streams solids partitioning was calculated using the fraction of geometric mean loadings discharged in sludge or biomass where the loadings were calculated from the concentrations multiplied by the respective volumetric flow rates for liquid samples or dry mass loading rates for sludge biomass samples see eq s3 in the supplementary material 2 7 statistical analysis the anova and post hoc tukey test were performed in minitab 19 to determine whether log removals and log reductions were significantly different from each other p 0 05 for the different microorganisms throughout the treatment stages furthermore the presence or absence of significant differences p 0 05 between the influent loadings of the four microorganisms were analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 effluent quality and system monitoring the results of the physical chemical analyses of raw wastewater uasb effluent and hrap effluent are presented in table 1 physical chemical parameters of the sludge and biomass are shown in the supplementary material an overall average efficiency of 71 was observed in cod removal this result agrees with the average values referenced in the literature which ranging from 64 to 75 for uasb followed by hrap espinosa et al 2021 vassalle et al 2020a villar torres et al 2018 regarding the removal of tss and vss in the system the average concentrations in the uasb effluent were 34 4 mg l 1 and 29 3 mg l 1 respectively these values are below those reported in the literature 50 160 mg tss l 1 and 30 mgvss l 1 chernicharo 2007 after the post treatment of the effluent by hrap there is an increase in tss and vss concentrations to 74 5 mg l 1 and 56 6 mg l 1 respectively the increase in both tss and vss is due to microalgae biomass production in the hraps during effluent treatment which has been reported previously vassalle et al 2020a villar navarro et al 2018 the ammonium n concentration increased slightly in the anaerobic reactor from 30 to 38 mg n nh4 l 1 a likely result of the hydrolysis of proteins and urea tchobanoglous et al 2003 in the hrap the average n nh4 removal was 57 previous studies have shown similar results 64 in hraps operated at an hrt of 6 days treating anaerobic effluent gonçalves et al 2020 total nitrogen tn removal in the hrap was on average 44 the same removal efficiency was observed in another uasb hrap system treating domestic wastewater with hrt of 6 days in the hrap gonçalves et al 2020 it is important to highlight that the overall concentration of pollutants in the treated effluent met the brazilian regulatory requirements which are 180 mg cod l 1 150 mg tss l 1 and 20 mg n nh4 l 1 conama 2011 microalgae production was calculated from the average tss concentration into the hrap 155 mg l 1 which resulted in an average value of 9 2 g tss m 2 day 1 over the year this value is similar to that reported for this system over 1 year of operation vassalle et al 2020a in terms of biomass characterization the average composition was as follow 1 75 g ts l 1 1 19 g vs l 1 3 15 g cod l 1 206 mg tkn l 1 and 1226 mg l 1 of proteins the main microalgae species found in harvested biomass was scenedesmus sp which has been reported to be the most common species in microalgae based wastewater treatment systems mohsenpour et al 2021 physical chemical parameters of uasb sludge and microalgae biomass are in the supplementary material 3 2 concentrations and removals of the microrganisms measured concentrations of microbial constituents and the resulting log10 removal values using eq s1 are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively the geometric mean concentrations of sars cov 2 rna in the influent raw wastewater and liquid effluent of the uasb reactor were 2 09 and 1 92 log copies ml respectively which results in a calculated removal of 0 18 log10 units the geometric mean concentrations of hadv dna were slightly higher than sars cov 2 rna with 2 81 and 2 74 log copies ml in the influent and effluent respectively and a log10 removal of less than 0 1 log10 units geometric mean influent and liquid effluent concentration of f specific coliphages were 3 51 and 2 79 log pfu ml respectively with a removal of 0 73 log10 units anova tukey test showed significant difference p 0 000 between influent concentration of coliphages and the two human viruses no significant difference p 0 193 was observed between the influent concentrations of hadv and sars cov 2 influent concentrations in the raw wastewater for all three viruses are consistent with values reported in the literature for instance sars cov 2 concentrations reported previously have ranged from 1 to 5 1 log copies ml ahmed et al 2020a medema et al 2020 prado et al 2021 hadv concentrations generally range from 1 7 to 5 8 log copies ml garcía aljaro et al 2018 kaliakatsos et al 2019 prado et al 2011 sheludchenko et al 2016 and coliphage concentrations range from 2 8 to 4 0 log pfu ml dias et al 2018 jebri et al 2016 the efficiency of virus removal from wastewater depends on the types of treatment technologies used the wastewater characteristics e g temperature ph organic matter content etc and design operational factors such as hydraulic retention times ali et al 2021 for instance el senousy and abou elela 2017 obtained a removal of hadv in a uasb reactor between 0 to 1 log10 units with a mean of 0 5 log10 units and fong et al 2010 obtained a mean removal of hadv after primary sedimentation of only 0 01 log10 units symonds et al 2014 reported negligible removal for some enteric viruses in a uasb reactor in bolivia in a recent review the viral removal in a uasb reactor treating wastewater was reported between 0 to 0 7 log10 units oakley et al 2017 in the uasb reactor analyzed in this study the viral removal was 1 log10 units which is expected in these reactors recently kumar et al 2021 reported a removal of 1 3 log10 units for sars cov 2 in a uasb reactor which is higher than the removal obtained in this study on the other hand e coli had a removal above 1 log10 units which is similar to values reported in the literature for uasb reactors dias et al 2014 oakley et al 2017 the geometric mean influent and effluent concentrations for e coli were 5 85 and 4 79 log mpn ml respectively statistical results showed that sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna removals were significantly lower than e coli p 0 05 coliphages removals were significantly greater than hadv p 0 05 but they did not show a significant difference with sars cov 2 rna and e coli removals p 0 05 it is expected for this to happen because bacteria are more sensitive to treatment processes compared with viruses and other pathogens rodriguez manzano et al 2012 who 2001 another important factor affecting the results is that the measurement of hadv dna and sars cov 2 rna using rt qpcr does not assess viability whereas the double agar layer plaque assay used to quantify f specific coliphages only measures coliphages that are viable it is possible for rt qpcr to detect intact segments of genome associated with virus particles that have lost viability however once viral rna is released from a damaged capsid its persistence in wastewater is likely very limited one study reported that free viral rna released into wastewater was no longer detectable after only a few minutes limsawat and ohgaki 1997 extracellular dna free dna and adsorbed dna on the contrary have more persistence in the environment since it can be adsorbed onto solid particles and organic matter which gives protection against degradation by nuclease gutiérrez cacciabue et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 this may lead to an overestimation of the hadv dna in our study it is important to note that even though culture based methods were not used to quantify the human viruses in this study the results presented here advance knowledge as they show the dynamics of the removal of these viruses and indicators in a treatment system for the hraps only 2 of the 13 hrap effluent samples amplified for sars cov 2 rna and for hadv dna therefore the limit of detection lod of 28 and 45 copies reaction respectively was used for the non detect samples to calculate a conservative estimate for removal and reduction i e the estimated values are likely less than the actual values this assumption also likely led to partitioning values that overestimated the fraction present in liquid effluent and underestimated the fraction present in biomass the geometric means of the effluent concentrations were 1 18 log copies ml 1 82 log copies ml 1 09 log pfu ml and 2 91 log mpn ml for sars cov 2 rna hadv dna f specific coliphages and e coli respectively sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna removals were both 1 log10 unit f specific coliphages and e coli had removals of 1 70 and 1 87 log units respectively statistical results showed that sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna removals were significantly lower than e coli and coliphages removal p 0 05 the removal of microorganisms was higher in the hrap stage than in the uasb reactor which is expected due to sunlight exposure and longer hydraulic retention time in the ponds symonds et al 2014 verbyla and mihelcic 2015 the observed removal of 1 70 log10 units for f specific coliphages in hraps with an hrt of 8 days was within the range reported 1 3 log10 units for hraps operating under acidic conditions by delanka pedige et al 2020b the observed removals of hadv dna 0 92 log10 unit and sars cov 2 rna 0 74 log10 unit in the current study were more consistent with the removal rates 1 log10 unit of enteric viruses and bacteriophages reported by verbyla and mihelcic 2015 for conventional stabilization ponds not high rate with hrts of 15 to 20 days however our observed removals of hadv dna and sars cov 2 rna were slightly lower than those reported by delanka pedige et al 2020a for enterovirus rna 1 05 log10 units and norovirus gi rna 1 49 log10 units in an acidic hrap with an hrt of 4 5 days e coli removal in hraps has been reported in the literature between 1 76 to 2 19 log units buchanan et al 2018 fallowfield et al 2018 young et al 2016 and virus removal between zero and 1 7 log units verbyla et al 2017 hence removals observed in the current study are within the range of values previously reported in the literature when considering the overall system uasb hrap influent point 1 effluent point 3 fig 1 the removal of sars cov 2 rna was 0 9 log10 units and for hadv dna it was 1 log10 units it is important to note that uasb hrap systems are generally not designed to optimize the removal of pathogens the main design objective is usually to reduce organic matter and nutrients to comply with discharge regulations which was the case for this system the viral and bacterial indicators coliphages and e coli had an overall removal of 2 43 and 2 94 log10 units respectively there is still a lack of studies in the literature about sars cov 2 removal in different wastewater treatment processes saawarn and hait 2021 only a few studies of the removal of sars cov 2 in wastewater treatment systems have mostly focused on conventional activated sludge system in some cases followed by tertiary treatment processes randazzo et al 2020 serra compte et al 2021 sherchan et al 2020 or for systems using a moving bed biofilm reactor and sequencing batch reactor technologies arora et al 2020 balboa et al 2021 with a maximum removal value of 1 97 log due to the limited amount of data from the literature on this type of uasb hrap system we compared our results with similar anaerobic reactors followed by similar algal based treatment technologies for example in an anaerobic digester followed by a hrap coliphages had a 1 log10 overall removal davies colley et al 2005 in a septic tank followed by hrap the removal was found to be 1 8 log10 young et al 2016 symonds et al 2014 reported a 0 8 log10 removal of culturable enteric viruses in a uasb reactor followed by polishing maturation ponds our findings regarding virus removal are generally within the range of previously published literature except for coliphages where our observed removal was higher than what has been reported in similar systems with anaerobic reactors followed by ponds or lagoons one possible hypothesis is that the combination of a high rate anaerobic reactor with granular sludge followed by a high rate algal system may somehow enhance the decay rate of viable coliphages however more studies with direct comparison of anaerobic reactor algal pond systems e g septic tank followed by conventional stabilization pond and high rate anaerobic reactor high rate algal pond systems e g uasb hrap to be able to test this hypothesis on the other hand for e coli removal santiago et al 2013 reported a removal of 2 log10 units in a uasb reactor followed by hrap and young et al 2016 reported the same 2 log10 removal in septic tank followed by hrap our finding resulted a little higher than these removals in an algal based system with acidic conditions the removal of total coliforms was 7 log10 and for pathogenic e coli was 4 log10 delanka pedige et al 2019 these high removals are attributed to the system s low ph 4 e coli and also other fecal indicator bacteria have been demonstrated to be less resistant to treatment than viruses momba et al 2019 this state was confirmed with our finding where e coli removal was significantly higher than sars cov 2 rna hadv dna and coliphages removal p 0 05 fig 2 shows boxplots of the concentrations of the microorganisms in the liquid phase of the overall system 3 3 overall reductions and liquid solid partitioning of the microorganisms results of influent and effluent loadings and overall reduction including flow rate and the total loading inactivation of each microorganism throughout the uasb reactor hraps and complete system are presented in tables 4 6 respectively a diagram with the liquid solid partitioning in the system is presented in fig 3 no significant correlation p 0 05 was found between water parameters od cod and sst and influent effluent and sludge loadings results not shown when analyzing the uasb reactor alone considering influent as the raw wastewater and the microalgae biomass recirculated from the hraps point 1 point 4 fig 1 viruses and e coli loadings into the reactor came mostly from the raw wastewater with the loadings from the microalgae biomass contributing only negligible amounts the majority of coliphage and e coli effluent loadings also left the uasb reactor in the liquid phase whereas approximately one third of sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna left the uasb reactor in the sludge using eq s2 the overall reduction in the uasb reactor was less than 1 log10 unit for all the viruses the reduction of e coli in the uasb reactor was significantly greater than the reduction of viruses f specific coliphages reduction was significantly greater than the reduction of hadv dna demonstrating that coliphages may not be the best indicators for enteric virus nucleic acids a mass balance for the hraps showed that more than 99 of all microorganisms left the hraps in the liquid phase fig 3b the overall reductions eq s2 in this stage were higher than they were in the uasb reactor sars cov 2 rna hadv dna f specific coliphages and e coli had log10 reductions of 0 86 1 04 1 81 and 1 99 respectively reduction of the viral and bacterial indicators was significantly higher than the reduction of sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna in the hrap a mass balance for the complete system uasb hrap showed that the influent loadings of the different viruses were not significantly different from each other but the influent e coli loading was higher than influent loadings for viruses p 0 05 the percentage of sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna leaving the reactor in the uasb sludge was 58 3 and 71 5 respectively indicating that these viruses may have had affinity to solids in the reactor fig 3c in contrast f specific coliphages showed a lower affinity to solids with only 3 7 of them leaving the system in the sludge regarding e coli 37 3 were removed in the sludge and 62 7 were removed in the liquid phase however the larger percentage of e coli leaving in the sludge compared to coliphages may have been due to the higher removal of e coli observed in the liquid fraction compared to f specific coliphages as mentioned before viruses can adsorb to particles by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions these interactions not only depend on the particle surface and the water composition arraj et al 2005 verbyla and mihelcic 2015 but also on the characteristics of the virus arraj et al 2005 even if viruses are of the same family they can present different behaviors yin et al 2018 for instance the percentage of six types of echoviruses in the solid phase varied from 67 to 99 5 gerba et al 1980 hadv in primary and secondary sludge was 75 8 and 67 8 respectively yin et al 2018 and coliphages ranged from 1 to 99 arraj et al 2005 our results agree with these observations however more studies are needed on the liquid solid partitioning of different viruses to better understand the viral distribution and removal mechanisms in wastewater treatment plants ali et al 2021 obtained 1 log removal of sars cov 2 rna in a primary sedimentation tank indicating that most of sars cov 2 rna were attached to settled solids balboa et al 2021 also suggested that sars cov 2 rna is mainly adsorbed to the settled solids by the lipid bilayer surrounding the sars cov 2 protein capsid other studies have also detected the sars cov 2 in primary secondary and anaerobically digested sludge samples bhattarai et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 indicating that this enveloped virus may have a higher affinity to solids compared to other waterborne viruses our findings support these suggestions indicating that almost 60 of sars cov 2 rna leaving the reactor were found in the sludge despite the fact that the sludge removed accounted for 1 of the volumetric flow leaving the reactor the removal of sars cov 2 and liquid solid partitioning in the sludge of uasb reactors has not been reported previously these results were not strongly affected by our assumptions about non detect values when using the half the lod instead of the lod for non detect samples the percentage of sars cov 2 leaving in the sludge varied only slightly from 58 3 to 66 for hadv the difference was only 1 ye et al 2016 hypothesized that some enveloped viruses may have a higher affinity for solids compared to non enveloped viruses and microbial indicators our findings do not support this statement since dna from hadv a non enveloped virus also showed evidence of having a high affinity to solids with more than 70 of them leaving the uasb reactor in the sludge which only accounted for 1 of the volumetric flow leaving the reactor this finding was also reported by verbyla 2015 who showed that adenovirus was volumetrically concentrated in the sludge from two uasb reactors in brazil one pilot scale and one full scale the pilot scale uasb was not the same uasb reactor from the present study on the other hand the effluent loadings of the microbial indicators coliphages and e coli support the results presented by ye et al 2016 as summarized by yin et al 2018 the sorption of viruses to wastewater solids can be highly variable for that reason it is important not only to analyze the removal in the liquid phase but also analyze in the solid phase for each microorganism in wastewater treatment systems this is especially important when biosolids produced from sludge or biomass extracted from wastewater treatment unit processes is reused for beneficial purposes such as soil amendment kumar et al 2017 the fraction of viruses and e coli leaving in the microalgae biomass in our study was negligible 0 5 this contrasts with previous findings from the literature such as young et al 2016 who reported that microalgae from hraps could influence pathogen removal by increasing adsorption to microalgae biomass there are tools that can be used to assess virus solid affinity adsorption from a mechanistic or genetic perspective in a controlled laboratory setting this was not the aim of our study but previous studies have already reported the affinity of viruses to solids using these approaches moore et al 1975 ye et al 2016 yin et al 2018 a low reduction 0 5 log units of sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna was observed for the overall system at the same time viral and bacterial indicators had significantly higher reductions with values of 2 20 and 2 74 log units respectively this echoes previous reports that the concentrations of coliphages quantified by plaque assays may not correlate with the concentrations of enteric viruses detected via rt qpcr sheludchenko et al 2016 sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna had very similar behavior throughout the system but no significant correlation was found between both viruses in order to find suitable indicators of microbial risk for wastewater reuse and resource recovery activities further studies are needed to better understand the factors that influence reduction and liquid solid partitioning of different viruses for different wastewater treatment technologies 4 conclusions a pilot scale uasb reactor followed by twin hraps treating real domestic wastewater showed high removal of organic matter and nutrients 71 cod and 57 n nh4 but low removal and reduction of viruses demonstrating the potential need for additional tertiary treatment or disinfection processes if resources are to be safely recovered from systems like these furthermore the results of this study showed that e coli and f specific coliphages are both inadequate indicators for the liquid solid partitioning of enteric viruses almost 60 of remaining sars cov 2 rna and more than 70 of hadv dna left the system in the sludge compared to 5 of coliphages demonstrating that the human viruses may have a higher affinity for solids than the coliphages this study demonstrates the importance of analyzing concentrations of pathogens and indicators not only in the liquid phase of wastewater treatment processes but also in the solid phase a mass balance approach can be used to compare overall reduction and liquid solids partitioning for different pathogens and indicators more studies are needed about liquid solid partitioning in different treatment systems to better understand differences in the affinity of different viruses and viral surrogates to wastewater solids there is a limitation of these results since sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna were quantify using molecular methods rt qpcr while for coliphages and e coli was used culture methods thus these differences with the detection methods must be considered when analyzing the obtained results even with this limitation the results presented here advance knowledge when it shows the dynamics of removing these viruses and indicators in this treatment system

16253,investigating waterborne viruses is of great importance to minimizing risks to public health viruses tend to adsorb to sludge particles from wastewater processes by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between virus aquatic matrix and particle surface sludge is often re used in agriculture therefore its evaluation is also of great interest to public health in the present study a pilot scale system treating real domestic wastewater from a large city in brazil was used to evaluate the removal the overall reduction and liquid solid partitioning of human adenovirus hadv the novel coronavirus sars cov 2 and fecal indicators f specific coliphages and e coli the system consists of a high rate algal pond hrap post treating the effluent of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor samples were collected from the influent and effluent of each unit as well as from the sludge of the uasb and from the microalgae biomass in the hrap pathogens and indicators were quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr for hadv qpcr with reverse transcription rtqpcr for sars cov 2 the double agar plaque assay for coliphages and the most probable number mpn method for e coli the removal and overall reduction of hadv and sars cov 2 was greater than 1 log10 almost 60 of remaining sars cov 2 rna and more than 70 of remaining hadv dna left the system in the sludge demonstrating that both viruses may have affinity for solids coliphages showed a much lower affinity to solids with only 3 7 leaving the system in the sludge the system performed well in terms of the removal of organic matter and ammoniacal nitrogen however tertiary treatment would be necessary to provide further pathogen reduction if the effluent is to be reused in agriculture to our knowledge this is the first study that evaluated the reduction and partitioning of sars cov 2 and hadv through the complete cycle of a wastewater treatment system consisting of a uasb reactor followed by hraps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sars cov 2 adenovirus sludge virus removal sewage uasb high rate algal ponds 1 introduction the study of waterborne viruses is of great importance to minimizing risks to public health especially in developing countries where sanitation infrastructure is scarce and wastewater is commonly discharged without any previous treatment pandey et al 2021 for instance brazil treats 49 of the generated wastewater snis 2019 india only 37 and the situation in south east asian countries is even worse as only 10 of wastewater is treated pandey et al 2021 human adenoviruses hadv a non enveloped and double stranded dna virus have been suggested as preferred candidates as indicators for viral pathogens because compared to other viruses hadv are frequently present in contaminated waters and their concentration in wastewater is high allard 2017 also they do not fluctuate seasonally verbyla et al 2016 and may survive long periods in aquatic environments not to mention that they are highly resistant to different processes such as uv radiation allard 2017 new viral pathogens are constantly emerging or being discovered in the environment one example is the novel coronavirus sars cov 2 that caused the covid 19 pandemic it is an enveloped and single stranded rna virus which viral particles have been detected in stool and urine samples of infected people that are subsequently discharged into the wastewater saawarn and hait 2021 the detection of sars cov 2 has been reported in wastewater samples ahmed et al 2020a medema et al 2020 mota et al 2021 and in sludge samples peccia et al 2020 serra compte et al 2021 from wastewater treatment plants the detection of hadv in wastewater and sludge has also been widely studied allard 2017 fong et al 2010 yin et al 2018 nevertheless there is still a lack of knowledge and literature data about the removal of viruses including sars cov 2 and hadv in wastewater treatment processes especially in developing countries verbyla et al 2017 this may be attributed to the high costs and expertise required to perform the necessary quantitative molecular analyses upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors are one of the most widely used wastewater treatment technologies in latin america and the caribbean mainly due to their low operating costs noyola et al 2012 high rate algal ponds hrap have been recently used as post treatment for uasb reactors organic matter solids nutrients pathogen indicators and other pollutants have been reported for this combined system espinosa et al 2021 vassalle et al 2020b 2020a but there are still very limited data available on the removal of pathogens an important factor which is often widely ignored in the literature is the viruses affinity toward solids in the wastewater and their removal in the solid phase viruses tend to adsorb to solids due to electrostatic interactions influenced by the surface charge of the virus and hydrophobic interactions influenced by the hydrophobic proteins of the viral capsid verbyla and mihelcic 2015 if a virus is highly resistant to a treatment process but has a high affinity toward solids and is discharged in the sludge there may be an illusion of high reduction based on the observed differences in the concentration of the virus at the influent and liquid effluent points but there could still be a need to ensure sufficient reduction of viruses in the sludge before it can be safely reused or discharged in our recently study espinosa et al 2021 we proposed a mass balance model which helps estimating a mass balance of the microorganisms entering and leaving the system the model is based on the microbial influent and effluent concentrations in the liquid phase and the microbial fraction in the solid phase this model can be used by other wwtp since the concentrations of microorganisms in the liquid phase are commonly reported as the fraction of pathogens in the sludge is not usually reported it can be predicted using the total solid yields with respect to the ts produced or cod treated in the system a complete explanation of the model is reported in espinosa et al 2021 the aim of this study was to fill important knowledge gaps regarding the removal and liquid solid partitioning of hadv sars cov 2 f specific coliphages and e coli in a pilot scale uasb reactor followed by parallel hraps treating real domestic wastewater in belo horizonte brazil 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design experimental data were gathered in a demonstration scale system located at the research and training center for sanitation cepts in belo horizonte brazil the system consists of a uasb reactor followed by twin high rate algal ponds vassalle et al 2020a fed with real wastewater from a full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp in the city of belo horizonte as shown in fig 1 the system was operating normally during the pandemic the uasb reactor worked with a volume of 343 l height 4 0 m diameter 0 3 m and was operated at a flow rate of 50 l h 1 and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 7 h the hraps worked in parallel with a volume of 205 l each height 0 5 m length 1 7 m width 0 24 m and were operated at a flow rate of 25 5 l day 1 each and an hrt of 8 days the biomass settler worked with a volume of 30 l and was operated at an hrt of 14 hours for the anaerobic co digestion 12 l of harvested microalgae biomass were pumped to a plexiglass column located 4 m above the uasb reactor and recirculated to the reactor at flow rate of 0 5 l h 1 the system has been operating since july 2018 on a continuous basis a total of 13 samples were collected from each sample collection point during a total period of 6 weeks i e approximately two samples collected each week between july and august 2020 during the first wave of the covid 19 outbreak in the city of belo horizonte this sampling period of six weeks was chosen because of the high concentrations of sars cov 2 in the wastewater due to the outbreak which permitted its detection in both untreated and treated wastewater allowing for the calculation of removal rates the samples were composite samples with subsamples collected every 20 minutes for 1 h at the influent point 1 fig 1 and at the effluent of the uasb reactor point 2 fig 1 from the uasb sludge point 5 fig 1 from the hrap liquid effluent point 3 fig 1 and from the algal biomass at the bottom of the settler point 4 fig 1 these sample collection points were chosen to perform a mass balance of microorganisms entering and leaving each reactor in the liquid and sludge biomass phases all samples were stored at 4 c and the microbial analyses were conducted within 24 h of sample collection at the laboratory of microbiology of the sanitary and environmental engineering department at federal university of minas gerais 2 2 physical chemical analysis liquid phase samples from the raw wastewater and the effluents of the uasb reactor and the hraps were collected every sample day at 10 00 am 2 h physical chemical parameters analyzed were ph temperature dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod

quantitative calculations the lod was defined as the number of copies corresponding with 95 probability of amplification bustin et al 2009 the calculation for the lod was carried out following the exponential model established by verbyla et al 2016 values obtained for the lod in this study are presented in the supplementary material for both viruses sars cov 2 and hadv in order to calculate removal reduction and partitioning values the concentrations of all nd samples were substituted with the lod for the respective assay 2 6 analysis of removal reduction and partitioning of the microrganisms the removal and reduction of the four microbial constituents analyzed in this study were calculated as previously explained in espinosa et al 2021 using the log10 removal or the log10 reduction of the geometric mean concentrations or loadings see eq s1 and eq s2 in the supplementary material here removal is defined as the removal of the microorganism from the liquid fraction of influent and effluent streams whereas reduction is defined as the overall difference in the loadings coming into the reactor vs leaving the reactor including both liquid and sludge biomass streams solids partitioning was calculated using the fraction of geometric mean loadings discharged in sludge or biomass where the loadings were calculated from the concentrations multiplied by the respective volumetric flow rates for liquid samples or dry mass loading rates for sludge biomass samples see eq s3 in the supplementary material 2 7 statistical analysis the anova and post hoc tukey test were performed in minitab 19 to determine whether log removals and log reductions were significantly different from each other p 0 05 for the different microorganisms throughout the treatment stages furthermore the presence or absence of significant differences p 0 05 between the influent loadings of the four microorganisms were analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 effluent quality and system monitoring the results of the physical chemical analyses of raw wastewater uasb effluent and hrap effluent are presented in table 1 physical chemical parameters of the sludge and biomass are shown in the supplementary material an overall average efficiency of 71 was observed in cod removal this result agrees with the average values referenced in the literature which ranging from 64 to 75 for uasb followed by hrap espinosa et al 2021 vassalle et al 2020a villar torres et al 2018 regarding the removal of tss and vss in the system the average concentrations in the uasb effluent were 34 4 mg l 1 and 29 3 mg l 1 respectively these values are below those reported in the literature 50 160 mg tss l 1 and 30 mgvss l 1 chernicharo 2007 after the post treatment of the effluent by hrap there is an increase in tss and vss concentrations to 74 5 mg l 1 and 56 6 mg l 1 respectively the increase in both tss and vss is due to microalgae biomass production in the hraps during effluent treatment which has been reported previously vassalle et al 2020a villar navarro et al 2018 the ammonium n concentration increased slightly in the anaerobic reactor from 30 to 38 mg n nh4 l 1 a likely result of the hydrolysis of proteins and urea tchobanoglous et al 2003 in the hrap the average n nh4 removal was 57 previous studies have shown similar results 64 in hraps operated at an hrt of 6 days treating anaerobic effluent gonçalves et al 2020 total nitrogen tn removal in the hrap was on average 44 the same removal efficiency was observed in another uasb hrap system treating domestic wastewater with hrt of 6 days in the hrap gonçalves et al 2020 it is important to highlight that the overall concentration of pollutants in the treated effluent met the brazilian regulatory requirements which are 180 mg cod l 1 150 mg tss l 1 and 20 mg n nh4 l 1 conama 2011 microalgae production was calculated from the average tss concentration into the hrap 155 mg l 1 which resulted in an average value of 9 2 g tss m 2 day 1 over the year this value is similar to that reported for this system over 1 year of operation vassalle et al 2020a in terms of biomass characterization the average composition was as follow 1 75 g ts l 1 1 19 g vs l 1 3 15 g cod l 1 206 mg tkn l 1 and 1226 mg l 1 of proteins the main microalgae species found in harvested biomass was scenedesmus sp which has been reported to be the most common species in microalgae based wastewater treatment systems mohsenpour et al 2021 physical chemical parameters of uasb sludge and microalgae biomass are in the supplementary material 3 2 concentrations and removals of the microrganisms measured concentrations of microbial constituents and the resulting log10 removal values using eq s1 are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively the geometric mean concentrations of sars cov 2 rna in the influent raw wastewater and liquid effluent of the uasb reactor were 2 09 and 1 92 log copies ml respectively which results in a calculated removal of 0 18 log10 units the geometric mean concentrations of hadv dna were slightly higher than sars cov 2 rna with 2 81 and 2 74 log copies ml in the influent and effluent respectively and a log10 removal of less than 0 1 log10 units geometric mean influent and liquid effluent concentration of f specific coliphages were 3 51 and 2 79 log pfu ml respectively with a removal of 0 73 log10 units anova tukey test showed significant difference p 0 000 between influent concentration of coliphages and the two human viruses no significant difference p 0 193 was observed between the influent concentrations of hadv and sars cov 2 influent concentrations in the raw wastewater for all three viruses are consistent with values reported in the literature for instance sars cov 2 concentrations reported previously have ranged from 1 to 5 1 log copies ml ahmed et al 2020a medema et al 2020 prado et al 2021 hadv concentrations generally range from 1 7 to 5 8 log copies ml garcía aljaro et al 2018 kaliakatsos et al 2019 prado et al 2011 sheludchenko et al 2016 and coliphage concentrations range from 2 8 to 4 0 log pfu ml dias et al 2018 jebri et al 2016 the efficiency of virus removal from wastewater depends on the types of treatment technologies used the wastewater characteristics e g temperature ph organic matter content etc and design operational factors such as hydraulic retention times ali et al 2021 for instance el senousy and abou elela 2017 obtained a removal of hadv in a uasb reactor between 0 to 1 log10 units with a mean of 0 5 log10 units and fong et al 2010 obtained a mean removal of hadv after primary sedimentation of only 0 01 log10 units symonds et al 2014 reported negligible removal for some enteric viruses in a uasb reactor in bolivia in a recent review the viral removal in a uasb reactor treating wastewater was reported between 0 to 0 7 log10 units oakley et al 2017 in the uasb reactor analyzed in this study the viral removal was 1 log10 units which is expected in these reactors recently kumar et al 2021 reported a removal of 1 3 log10 units for sars cov 2 in a uasb reactor which is higher than the removal obtained in this study on the other hand e coli had a removal above 1 log10 units which is similar to values reported in the literature for uasb reactors dias et al 2014 oakley et al 2017 the geometric mean influent and effluent concentrations for e coli were 5 85 and 4 79 log mpn ml respectively statistical results showed that sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna removals were significantly lower than e coli p 0 05 coliphages removals were significantly greater than hadv p 0 05 but they did not show a significant difference with sars cov 2 rna and e coli removals p 0 05 it is expected for this to happen because bacteria are more sensitive to treatment processes compared with viruses and other pathogens rodriguez manzano et al 2012 who 2001 another important factor affecting the results is that the measurement of hadv dna and sars cov 2 rna using rt qpcr does not assess viability whereas the double agar layer plaque assay used to quantify f specific coliphages only measures coliphages that are viable it is possible for rt qpcr to detect intact segments of genome associated with virus particles that have lost viability however once viral rna is released from a damaged capsid its persistence in wastewater is likely very limited one study reported that free viral rna released into wastewater was no longer detectable after only a few minutes limsawat and ohgaki 1997 extracellular dna free dna and adsorbed dna on the contrary have more persistence in the environment since it can be adsorbed onto solid particles and organic matter which gives protection against degradation by nuclease gutiérrez cacciabue et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 this may lead to an overestimation of the hadv dna in our study it is important to note that even though culture based methods were not used to quantify the human viruses in this study the results presented here advance knowledge as they show the dynamics of the removal of these viruses and indicators in a treatment system for the hraps only 2 of the 13 hrap effluent samples amplified for sars cov 2 rna and for hadv dna therefore the limit of detection lod of 28 and 45 copies reaction respectively was used for the non detect samples to calculate a conservative estimate for removal and reduction i e the estimated values are likely less than the actual values this assumption also likely led to partitioning values that overestimated the fraction present in liquid effluent and underestimated the fraction present in biomass the geometric means of the effluent concentrations were 1 18 log copies ml 1 82 log copies ml 1 09 log pfu ml and 2 91 log mpn ml for sars cov 2 rna hadv dna f specific coliphages and e coli respectively sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna removals were both 1 log10 unit f specific coliphages and e coli had removals of 1 70 and 1 87 log units respectively statistical results showed that sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna removals were significantly lower than e coli and coliphages removal p 0 05 the removal of microorganisms was higher in the hrap stage than in the uasb reactor which is expected due to sunlight exposure and longer hydraulic retention time in the ponds symonds et al 2014 verbyla and mihelcic 2015 the observed removal of 1 70 log10 units for f specific coliphages in hraps with an hrt of 8 days was within the range reported 1 3 log10 units for hraps operating under acidic conditions by delanka pedige et al 2020b the observed removals of hadv dna 0 92 log10 unit and sars cov 2 rna 0 74 log10 unit in the current study were more consistent with the removal rates 1 log10 unit of enteric viruses and bacteriophages reported by verbyla and mihelcic 2015 for conventional stabilization ponds not high rate with hrts of 15 to 20 days however our observed removals of hadv dna and sars cov 2 rna were slightly lower than those reported by delanka pedige et al 2020a for enterovirus rna 1 05 log10 units and norovirus gi rna 1 49 log10 units in an acidic hrap with an hrt of 4 5 days e coli removal in hraps has been reported in the literature between 1 76 to 2 19 log units buchanan et al 2018 fallowfield et al 2018 young et al 2016 and virus removal between zero and 1 7 log units verbyla et al 2017 hence removals observed in the current study are within the range of values previously reported in the literature when considering the overall system uasb hrap influent point 1 effluent point 3 fig 1 the removal of sars cov 2 rna was 0 9 log10 units and for hadv dna it was 1 log10 units it is important to note that uasb hrap systems are generally not designed to optimize the removal of pathogens the main design objective is usually to reduce organic matter and nutrients to comply with discharge regulations which was the case for this system the viral and bacterial indicators coliphages and e coli had an overall removal of 2 43 and 2 94 log10 units respectively there is still a lack of studies in the literature about sars cov 2 removal in different wastewater treatment processes saawarn and hait 2021 only a few studies of the removal of sars cov 2 in wastewater treatment systems have mostly focused on conventional activated sludge system in some cases followed by tertiary treatment processes randazzo et al 2020 serra compte et al 2021 sherchan et al 2020 or for systems using a moving bed biofilm reactor and sequencing batch reactor technologies arora et al 2020 balboa et al 2021 with a maximum removal value of 1 97 log due to the limited amount of data from the literature on this type of uasb hrap system we compared our results with similar anaerobic reactors followed by similar algal based treatment technologies for example in an anaerobic digester followed by a hrap coliphages had a 1 log10 overall removal davies colley et al 2005 in a septic tank followed by hrap the removal was found to be 1 8 log10 young et al 2016 symonds et al 2014 reported a 0 8 log10 removal of culturable enteric viruses in a uasb reactor followed by polishing maturation ponds our findings regarding virus removal are generally within the range of previously published literature except for coliphages where our observed removal was higher than what has been reported in similar systems with anaerobic reactors followed by ponds or lagoons one possible hypothesis is that the combination of a high rate anaerobic reactor with granular sludge followed by a high rate algal system may somehow enhance the decay rate of viable coliphages however more studies with direct comparison of anaerobic reactor algal pond systems e g septic tank followed by conventional stabilization pond and high rate anaerobic reactor high rate algal pond systems e g uasb hrap to be able to test this hypothesis on the other hand for e coli removal santiago et al 2013 reported a removal of 2 log10 units in a uasb reactor followed by hrap and young et al 2016 reported the same 2 log10 removal in septic tank followed by hrap our finding resulted a little higher than these removals in an algal based system with acidic conditions the removal of total coliforms was 7 log10 and for pathogenic e coli was 4 log10 delanka pedige et al 2019 these high removals are attributed to the system s low ph 4 e coli and also other fecal indicator bacteria have been demonstrated to be less resistant to treatment than viruses momba et al 2019 this state was confirmed with our finding where e coli removal was significantly higher than sars cov 2 rna hadv dna and coliphages removal p 0 05 fig 2 shows boxplots of the concentrations of the microorganisms in the liquid phase of the overall system 3 3 overall reductions and liquid solid partitioning of the microorganisms results of influent and effluent loadings and overall reduction including flow rate and the total loading inactivation of each microorganism throughout the uasb reactor hraps and complete system are presented in tables 4 6 respectively a diagram with the liquid solid partitioning in the system is presented in fig 3 no significant correlation p 0 05 was found between water parameters od cod and sst and influent effluent and sludge loadings results not shown when analyzing the uasb reactor alone considering influent as the raw wastewater and the microalgae biomass recirculated from the hraps point 1 point 4 fig 1 viruses and e coli loadings into the reactor came mostly from the raw wastewater with the loadings from the microalgae biomass contributing only negligible amounts the majority of coliphage and e coli effluent loadings also left the uasb reactor in the liquid phase whereas approximately one third of sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna left the uasb reactor in the sludge using eq s2 the overall reduction in the uasb reactor was less than 1 log10 unit for all the viruses the reduction of e coli in the uasb reactor was significantly greater than the reduction of viruses f specific coliphages reduction was significantly greater than the reduction of hadv dna demonstrating that coliphages may not be the best indicators for enteric virus nucleic acids a mass balance for the hraps showed that more than 99 of all microorganisms left the hraps in the liquid phase fig 3b the overall reductions eq s2 in this stage were higher than they were in the uasb reactor sars cov 2 rna hadv dna f specific coliphages and e coli had log10 reductions of 0 86 1 04 1 81 and 1 99 respectively reduction of the viral and bacterial indicators was significantly higher than the reduction of sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna in the hrap a mass balance for the complete system uasb hrap showed that the influent loadings of the different viruses were not significantly different from each other but the influent e coli loading was higher than influent loadings for viruses p 0 05 the percentage of sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna leaving the reactor in the uasb sludge was 58 3 and 71 5 respectively indicating that these viruses may have had affinity to solids in the reactor fig 3c in contrast f specific coliphages showed a lower affinity to solids with only 3 7 of them leaving the system in the sludge regarding e coli 37 3 were removed in the sludge and 62 7 were removed in the liquid phase however the larger percentage of e coli leaving in the sludge compared to coliphages may have been due to the higher removal of e coli observed in the liquid fraction compared to f specific coliphages as mentioned before viruses can adsorb to particles by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions these interactions not only depend on the particle surface and the water composition arraj et al 2005 verbyla and mihelcic 2015 but also on the characteristics of the virus arraj et al 2005 even if viruses are of the same family they can present different behaviors yin et al 2018 for instance the percentage of six types of echoviruses in the solid phase varied from 67 to 99 5 gerba et al 1980 hadv in primary and secondary sludge was 75 8 and 67 8 respectively yin et al 2018 and coliphages ranged from 1 to 99 arraj et al 2005 our results agree with these observations however more studies are needed on the liquid solid partitioning of different viruses to better understand the viral distribution and removal mechanisms in wastewater treatment plants ali et al 2021 obtained 1 log removal of sars cov 2 rna in a primary sedimentation tank indicating that most of sars cov 2 rna were attached to settled solids balboa et al 2021 also suggested that sars cov 2 rna is mainly adsorbed to the settled solids by the lipid bilayer surrounding the sars cov 2 protein capsid other studies have also detected the sars cov 2 in primary secondary and anaerobically digested sludge samples bhattarai et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 indicating that this enveloped virus may have a higher affinity to solids compared to other waterborne viruses our findings support these suggestions indicating that almost 60 of sars cov 2 rna leaving the reactor were found in the sludge despite the fact that the sludge removed accounted for 1 of the volumetric flow leaving the reactor the removal of sars cov 2 and liquid solid partitioning in the sludge of uasb reactors has not been reported previously these results were not strongly affected by our assumptions about non detect values when using the half the lod instead of the lod for non detect samples the percentage of sars cov 2 leaving in the sludge varied only slightly from 58 3 to 66 for hadv the difference was only 1 ye et al 2016 hypothesized that some enveloped viruses may have a higher affinity for solids compared to non enveloped viruses and microbial indicators our findings do not support this statement since dna from hadv a non enveloped virus also showed evidence of having a high affinity to solids with more than 70 of them leaving the uasb reactor in the sludge which only accounted for 1 of the volumetric flow leaving the reactor this finding was also reported by verbyla 2015 who showed that adenovirus was volumetrically concentrated in the sludge from two uasb reactors in brazil one pilot scale and one full scale the pilot scale uasb was not the same uasb reactor from the present study on the other hand the effluent loadings of the microbial indicators coliphages and e coli support the results presented by ye et al 2016 as summarized by yin et al 2018 the sorption of viruses to wastewater solids can be highly variable for that reason it is important not only to analyze the removal in the liquid phase but also analyze in the solid phase for each microorganism in wastewater treatment systems this is especially important when biosolids produced from sludge or biomass extracted from wastewater treatment unit processes is reused for beneficial purposes such as soil amendment kumar et al 2017 the fraction of viruses and e coli leaving in the microalgae biomass in our study was negligible 0 5 this contrasts with previous findings from the literature such as young et al 2016 who reported that microalgae from hraps could influence pathogen removal by increasing adsorption to microalgae biomass there are tools that can be used to assess virus solid affinity adsorption from a mechanistic or genetic perspective in a controlled laboratory setting this was not the aim of our study but previous studies have already reported the affinity of viruses to solids using these approaches moore et al 1975 ye et al 2016 yin et al 2018 a low reduction 0 5 log units of sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna was observed for the overall system at the same time viral and bacterial indicators had significantly higher reductions with values of 2 20 and 2 74 log units respectively this echoes previous reports that the concentrations of coliphages quantified by plaque assays may not correlate with the concentrations of enteric viruses detected via rt qpcr sheludchenko et al 2016 sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna had very similar behavior throughout the system but no significant correlation was found between both viruses in order to find suitable indicators of microbial risk for wastewater reuse and resource recovery activities further studies are needed to better understand the factors that influence reduction and liquid solid partitioning of different viruses for different wastewater treatment technologies 4 conclusions a pilot scale uasb reactor followed by twin hraps treating real domestic wastewater showed high removal of organic matter and nutrients 71 cod and 57 n nh4 but low removal and reduction of viruses demonstrating the potential need for additional tertiary treatment or disinfection processes if resources are to be safely recovered from systems like these furthermore the results of this study showed that e coli and f specific coliphages are both inadequate indicators for the liquid solid partitioning of enteric viruses almost 60 of remaining sars cov 2 rna and more than 70 of hadv dna left the system in the sludge compared to 5 of coliphages demonstrating that the human viruses may have a higher affinity for solids than the coliphages this study demonstrates the importance of analyzing concentrations of pathogens and indicators not only in the liquid phase of wastewater treatment processes but also in the solid phase a mass balance approach can be used to compare overall reduction and liquid solids partitioning for different pathogens and indicators more studies are needed about liquid solid partitioning in different treatment systems to better understand differences in the affinity of different viruses and viral surrogates to wastewater solids there is a limitation of these results since sars cov 2 rna and hadv dna were quantify using molecular methods rt qpcr while for coliphages and e coli was used culture methods thus these differences with the detection methods must be considered when analyzing the obtained results even with this limitation the results presented here advance knowledge when it shows the dynamics of removing these viruses and indicators in this treatment system

16254,a concentration gradient battery cgb is an energy storage system comprised of a series of concentrated and dilute salt solution compartments separated by ion exchange membranes iems the battery is charged by electrodialysis ed which increases the concentration gradient between these solutions and discharged by reverse electrodialysis red which allows these solutions to mix in both ed and red water moves by osmosis from dilute to concentrated compartments reducing the cgb faradaic and energy efficiency a promising approach to mitigate osmosis is to use an osmotic ballast in the dilute solution to balance the osmotic pressure and reduce faradaic energy losses the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of ballast properties i e size structure end group on the faradaic and round trip efficiency of the cgb to accomplish this objective we tested seven sugar and five glycol compounds as osmotic ballasts in a closed loop cell results show that ballasts with high molecular weight generally resulted in higher faradaic efficiency and lower water transport compared with low molecular weight ballasts data also indicates that ballast with a cyclic structure instead of linear non planar structure instead of planar and lower number of methyl end groups led to lower water transport of all ballasts tested sucrose performed best in terms of reducing non ideal water transport by 109 and enhancing both faradaic and round trip efficiencies from 47 4 to 77 7 and 25 5 to 38 1 respectively compared with the non ballasted cgb our results contribute to fundamental understanding of the impact of solute properties on water and small organic molecule transport in ion exchange membranes and indicate that ballasted cgbs can be further improved through development of optimized ballasts and selection of optimum membrane ballast pairs the improved understanding of ballast impact on cgb performance could be used for evaluation of potential ballast benefits in other membrane based systems that may be impacted by osmosis such as the acid base flow battery waste heat recovery using red ed purification processes osmotically assisted processes and redox flow batteries graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords concentration gradient battery osmotic ballast reverse electrodialysis ion exchange membrane 1 introduction grid scale electric energy storage systems are essential for facilitating the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources e g wind and solar energy into the electricity grid improving grid reliability and stability and improving the efficiency of power generation barnhart et al 2013 carbajales dale et al 2014 dunn et al 2011 it was estimated that by 2030 the global demand for large scale energy storage devices will reach 11 89 15 72 twh irena 2017 the current solution to store a large amount of electric energy is to pump water into an elevated reservoir and utilize hydroelectricity to recover it when needed this pumped hydro energy storage approach accounted for 96 of globally installed energy storage capacity in 2016 gür 2018 however this approach is site constrained where large reservoirs at an appreciable height are required although electrochemical storage technologies e g li ion battery or hydrogen fuel cell can offer some desirable features such as high conversion efficiency long life cycle low maintenance and compact size for use in distributed locations they still face challenges on the choice of materials sustainability and safety larcher and tarascon 2014 pellow et al 2015 winter et al 2018 it is therefore essential to explore new electrochemical storage systems that address these challenges a concentration gradient battery cgb was proposed as a promising alternative technology for storing surplus energy in waters of different salinity kingsbury et al 2015 van egmond et al 2016 this energy can later be recovered by mixing the solutions the cgb is a membrane based system that operates through a combination of an electrodialysis ed stage where energy generated from renewable resources is used to produce both a highly concentrated brine and a dilute solution and a reverse electrodialysis red stage where the brine and dilute solutions are mixed to generate power the advantage of this device is that the electrolyte is a non hazardous environmentally friendly and abundantly available aqueous salt solution e g sodium chloride it is also scalable and safe to operate non flammable and non explosive no precious or toxic materials are required theoretically the energy extracted from mixing river water and seawater is equivalent to a hydro power plant with a height of at least 200 m and mixing freshwater with high concentration industrial brines can deliver several times more energy yip et al 2016 hence the cgb holds great potential to contribute to addressing global energy storage needs there have been several studies on system optimization and efficiency enhancement of cgbs porada et al 2018 van egmond et al 2016 van egmond et al 2017 stougie et al 2019 analyzed several decentralized energy storage systems using life cycle assessment and pointed out that the cgb is the most preferable system from an economic standpoint however the energy efficiency of cgb is still much lower than other energy storage systems specifically the non ideal transport of water through the membranes by osmosis has a substantial negative impact on the power density and faradaic efficiency of the battery kingsbury and coronell 2017 these detrimental effects of osmosis increase dramatically if higher concentration gradients are used thereby preventing the battery from harnessing the higher energy content of e g brines in a previous study kingsbury and coronell 2017 we reported a novel approach to mitigate osmosis where uncharged osmotic ballasts i e ethylene glycol were added in the dilute solution to balance the osmotic pressure significantly reducing faradaic energy losses and enhancing the faradaic efficiency from 18 to 50 these ballasts can not only improve the performance of salinity ph gradient batteries but also benefit other closed loop aqueous membrane processes such as acid base flow batteries culcasi et al 2020 van egmond et al 2018 muñoz cruzado alba et al 2021 pärnamäe et al 2020 sáez et al 2016 xia et al 2020 waste heat recovery using red kwon et al 2015 luo et al 2012 ed purification process zhang et al 2011 osmotically assisted process bartholomew et al 2017 and redox flow batteries zhang et al 2018 the previous ballast study only tested two glycol ballasts same chemistry type but different sizes and resulted in different efficiencies and water transport for a potential implementation of ballasts in full scale systems there is a need to understand the relationship between basic ballast properties chemistry shape and size and battery performance and identify corresponding inexpensive ballasts therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of ballast size i e molecular weight structure i e linear vs cyclic and functional end groups i e methyl ether on water transport faradaic efficiency and round trip efficiency of a gcb we show that the properties of osmotic ballasts had a significant correlation with gcb performance and provide a guideline for the future development of osmotic ballast toward mitigating osmotic water transport in closed loop membrane processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the cgb consisted of a pccell electrodialysis stack with 10 membrane pairs separated by a mesh spacer with a thickness of 450 µm pccell gmbh germany fig 1 selemion asa anion exchange membranes agc engineering japan and fke 30 cation exchange membranes fumatech germany were used due to their relatively low water permeability kingsbury et al 2018 the active area of membranes and electrodes i e cathode and anode was 64 cm2 the electrodes consisted of a titanium mesh coated with mixed metal oxide electrode rinse solutions of 0 5 m nacl were recirculated through the electrode compartments the o2 h2 and possibly cl2 gases produced were removed by the ventilation system which included exhaust snorkels for operation of a similar battery at larger scale the production of gases can be avoided by using a different redox couple as electrode rinse solution reference electrodes of ag agcl re 5b basi usa were used to measure the electrical potential over the membrane stack the reference electrodes were positioned on each side of the membrane stack via a customized frame the total volume of each electrode chamber was 97 ml concentrated and dilute nacl solutions 250 ml each were recirculated through the stack in a closed loop from two volumetric cylinders each of which was placed on an electronic balance adventurer ax422 ohaus usa 2 2 operation conditions we followed the operational procedure described in detail in our previous study with some modifications kingsbury and coronell 2017 the starting concentrations for all tests were 0 5 and 0 25 m nacl for concentrated and dilute solution respectively a control experiment without ballasts using the same initial concentrated and dilute solution concentrations was performed to determine the baseline performance the osmotic ballasts were added to the dilute solution the flow rates of the concentrated dilute solutions and the electrode rinse solution were 80 ml min and 160 ml min respectively the higher flow rate of the electrode rinse solution prevented the end membrane to bulge into the reference electrode compartment and break the reference electrode the cgb was operated in a single galvanostatic charge discharge cycle at a constant charge current of 45 ma 7 a m2 normalized to the cell cross sectional area using a potentiostat vmp 3 bio logic france the applied current density of 7 a m2 corresponded to the current density at which the highest round trip efficiency was obtained without ballasts fig a1 this current density is similar to those used in other studies on the concentration gradient battery fu et al 2019 kingsbury and coronell 2017 porada et al 2018 adding ballast to the dilute solution reduces the initial open circuit voltage ocv of the cgb compared to the case without ballast as previously explained kingsbury and coronell 2017 given that different ballast concentrations in the dilute solution resulted in different levels of ocv reduction we used a pre charge step to increase the initial ocv in all tests to 302 mv e g 16 min for sucrose and 43 min for tetra egde depending on the initial ocv which is the same starting ocv as in the control experiment without ballast addition after pre charging the battery cycle started with an ed charge step for 1 5 h followed by a red discharge step that continued until the ocv decreased to its initial value of 302 mv the current and cell voltage were recorded every second the voltage profile demonstrating the charge discharge cycle can be seen in fig a2 we used a fixed charge time to have the same charge input for all ballast tests the battery was disassembled and cleaned before every test after the cell was dis assembled the spacers were cleaned by brushing with soapy water the membranes were flushed with deionized water and soaked in 3 m nacl for 2 h and then soaked in 0 5 m nacl overnight when the cell was re assembled we applied a series of electric current conditions 50 ma 50 ma and 50 ma for 5 min each with the entire stack filled with 0 5 m nacl solution to remove any remaining ions molecules in the membrane this periodical change of current direction has been used in ed to reduce organic fouling vermaas et al 2013 finally we verified that the cell resistance was close to our benchmark resistance 2 2 ω in addition we performed a hydraulic test before the charge discharge test in order to evaluate water transport through membranes due to differences in hydraulic pressure between the concentrated and dilute compartments in this test 0 5 m nacl solution was recirculated through all spacer channels at 80 ml min water transport due to hydraulic pressure differences was measured for the same time duration as the charge discharge cycle and was later subtracted from the total observed water transport during the charge discharge cycle the membrane stack resistance was determined by linear sweep voltammetry 2 3 preparation of ballasted dilute solution the dilute solution was prepared by adding osmotic ballast to 0 25 m nacl solutions because multiple factors affect water transport including ballast addition ballast transport salt transport salinity gradient and discharge duration water transport cannot be prevented during the entire charge discharge cycle instead we targeted achieving zero net water transport over one charge discharge cycle toward achieving a sustainable operation of the battery over multiple cycles accordingly we prepared the dilute solution with a ballast concentration 25 greater than that theoretically needed to achieve the same water mole fraction as in the 0 5 m nacl solution concentrated salt solution we chose 125 of the concentration theoretically needed to achieve osmotic balance for the initial dilute and concentrated solutions because this was the concentration that achieved zero net water transport using tetra ethylene glycol as the ballast in our previous study kingsbury and coronell 2017 the calculations for determining the dilute solution composition are provided in the supplementary materials 2 4 selection of ballasts the osmotic ballasts used in this study were inexpensive non hazardous highly soluble and non dissociable uncharged organic compounds additional ballast properties taken into account for ballast selection were i chemistry to include at least two chemically distinct groups of ballasts i e sugars and glycols satisfying the characteristics above ii size to include ballasts in the molecular weight range of 100 400 da selected based on the initial results in our previous study kingsbury and coronell 2017 and iii molecular orientation to include linear and cyclic molecules the selected ballasts and their properties are summarized in table 1 and include sugars and glycols sugar ballasts included monosaccharides glycerol xylose dextrose and fructose disaccharides sucrose and polyols mannitol and sorbitol glycol ballasts included triethylene glycol and tetraethylene glycol and their monomethyl ether and dimethyl ether analogs 2 5 metrics of interest for each experiment we evaluated the transport of water ballast and salt between dilute and concentrated solutions during one charge discharge cycle the total water ballast and salt transported was measured as the mass change of the concentrated and dilute solutions in their reservoirs the mass of ballast transported from the dilute solution to the concentrated solution was calculated as the product of the volume of the concentrated solution and the change in its total organic carbon toc content measured using a toc analyzer shimadzu japan the moles of salt transport j s a l t mol was calculated from the charge balance as 1 j s a l t i c t c i d t d f where i c a and i d a are the current during charge and discharge steps respectively which were identical by design t c s and t d s are the charge and discharge times and f 96 485 c mol is the faraday constant the mass of water transport was calculated by subtracting the ballast and salt transport from the total mass transport ballast salt nacl and water transport were converted from mass to mole units using corresponding molecular weights see table 1 we evaluated the battery performance in terms of faradaic and round trip efficiency the faradaic or current efficiency η i unitless was calculated as the ratio of the total charge extracted from the cgb during discharge and the total charge used to charge the battery as kingsbury et al 2015 2 η i 0 t d i d dt 0 t c i c dt round trip or energy efficiency η unitless was calculated as the ratio between the energy recovered from the battery during discharge and the energy spent to charge it as kingsbury et al 2015 3 η 0 t d i d e d dt 0 t c i c e c dt where e c v and e d v are the cell voltage measured during charge and discharge respectively 2 6 osmotic and electro osmotic water transport osmotic water transport j o s g is the water transport driven by the osmotic pressure where water generally moves from the dilute to the concentrated compartment electro osmotic water transport j e o g is the water transported along with the salt ions e g in their hydration shells which moves to the concentrated compartment during the charge step and to the dilute compartment during the discharge step water transport was expressed as 4 j j t where j is water flux g s and t is operation time s the amount moles of water transported from the dilute into the concentrated solution during the charge step is the sum of the osmotic and electro osmotic processes and was calculated as 5 j c j os c j eo c j os c j eo c t c where subscript c represents the charge step and subscripts os and eo indicate osmosis and electro osmosis respectively similarly the amount of water transported from the dilute into the concentrated solution during the discharge step was calculated as 6 j d j os d j eo d j os d j eo d t d where subscript d represents the discharge step as evidenced by the approximately linear voltage profiles during the charge and discharge steps fig a2 the concentration gradient and osmotic pressure profiles were also approximately linear which enables the use of average osmotic fluxes in eqs 5 6 instead of integrals we assumed that the electro osmotic water flux remained constant since the same current density was applied during the charge and discharge steps this assumption is only valid if the presence of ballast did not impact the hydration number of nacl a previous study showed that the hydration of salt ions migrating through membranes was not affected by several organic solutes including acetic acid phenol and glucose at 0 1 mol l han et al 2016 hence 7 j eo c j eo d j eo by design the increase in stack potential during the charge step of a given experiment e g from initial of 302 mv to final of 685 mv in the case of sucrose was the same as the stack potential decrease in the discharge step from 685 to 302 mv therefore consistent with the nernst and van t hoff equations atkins and paula 2006 the average concentration gradient and osmotic pressure over the course of the experiment were also the same leading to 8 j o s c j o s d j o s by combining eqs 4 8 we obtained the following equations for calculating electro osmotic water flux and average osmotic water flux 9 j o s j c t c j d t d 1 2 10 j e o j c t c j d t d 1 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 water and ballast transport the net water and ballast transport after one charge discharge cycle were investigated across all 13 ballasts and the results are summarized in fig 2 water transported from the dilute solution to the concentrated solution is shown in positive numbers and the reverse water transport i e from the concentrated to dilute solution due to reverse osmotic pressure is shown in negative numbers fig 2a adding sugar or glycol ballasts to the dilute solution reduced the net water transport by at least 80 compared to the no ballast control 1609 4 90 4 mmol different osmotic ballast molecules behaved differently in controlling the net water transport at the same ballast loading i e 125 of the concentration needed to achieve osmotic balance likely due to different ballast structural properties the highest net water transport of 306 6 11 5 mmol was observed using glycerol and the lowest of 157 4 31 0 mmol using sucrose notably while 125 tetra eg loading resulted in zero net water transport in our previous study kingsbury and coronell 2017 this was not the case in this study we attribute this difference to the use of different membranes in the two studies altogether sugar ballasts achieved a similar net water transport range as glycol ballasts as sugars are cheaper and more environmentally friendly than glycols sugars are more attractive materials to be used as ballasts achieving zero net water transport and keeping a balanced water volume between the concentrated and dilute compartments is essential for the long term stability of the battery performance at 125 ballast loading most ballast tests still showed a positive net water transport the extra ballast dosage in these tests did not reverse or balance the net osmotic transport between compartments this was likely because these ballasts diffused across the membranes and transported into the concentrated compartment resulting in an unbalanced osmotic pressure in favor of water transport from the dilute to the concentrated compartment total reverse water transport negative occurred only with sucrose and tetra eg as the ballast indicating the extra ballast loading reversed the net osmotic transport although this reverse water transport can increase the faradaic efficiency as the salinity gradient is enhanced the unbalanced water volume between the concentrated and dilute compartments hinders the long term battery operation by adjusting the ballast loading percentage zero net water transport can be achieved fig 3 water transport decreased from 352 8 9 0 mmol at 100 sucrose loading to 92 57 5 9 mmol at 118 3 0 69 7 mmol at 121 and 156 1 32 0 mmol at 125 loading net water transport can be broken down into transport during the charge and discharge steps fig 2a water transport during the charge step occurred in all cases from the dilute to the concentrated compartment as the result of additive osmosis and electro osmosis during the discharge step although osmotic water transport remained in the same direction electro osmosis changed direction as the current was reversed therefore to reach zero net water transport a balance between water transport during the charge and discharge steps is critical some ballasts like glycerol and xylitol had a large amount of water transport during charge and minimal transport during discharge resulting in a large amount of net water transport in contrast tetra eg showed a relatively balanced behavior in water transport as the water transport during the charge and discharge steps is closely related to osmosis and electro osmosis we further investigated the effect of these two driving forces fig 2b ballasts exhibited a large difference in osmotic water transport where glycerol and tri egde showed the greatest osmotic transport 260 mmol and fructose and tetra egde had the lowest transport 3 5 4 5 mmol sucrose and tetra eg exhibited reverse osmotic water transport due to an over ballasted dilute solution compared to the osmotic water transport the electro osmotic water transport was limited to a relatively small range 28 48 mmol across all ballasts the overall electro osmotic water transport after one charge discharge cycle was positive across all ballasts because the charge time was always longer than the discharge time leading to a smaller amount of water transferring back to the dilute solution during discharge the average electro osmotic water flux in ballasted tests was 1 96 0 22 mmol min a value similar to that for the control experiment 1 81 0 09 mmol min indicating that the electro osmotic water transport mainly depended on the current density and was not affected by the ballast loading or its effect on the osmotic pressure the nacl hydration number calculated from the ratio between net electro osmotic water transport fig 2b and net salt transport eq 1 was 7 which was within the range of reported hydration numbers for nacl in bulk solution lu et al 2011 marcus 1991 ohtaki and radnai 1993 ballast transport from the dilute solution to the concentrated solution through ion exchange membranes was identified to be one of the most significant obstacles to the stable operation of the cgb over many cycles in the previous study kingsbury and coronell 2017 a stable ballast concentration in the dilute solution is essential to balancing the osmotic pressure during long term operation and hence minimal transport through the membranes is an important criterion for an optimized ballast compound in our study osmotic ballast transport from the dilute to the concentrated salt solution was observed for all the ballasts fig 2c the amount of ballast transport ranged from 0 02 0 05 mmol to 20 7 1 2 mmol for most ballasts 0 5 1 5 of the total ballast was transported to the concentrated compartment after one charge discharge cycle the ballast with the lowest transport 0 01 was sucrose and the ballast with the most transport 3 7 was glycerol ballast transport across the membrane can be attributed to both diffusion transport related to the ballast concentration gradient across the membrane and electro osmotic water drag water flux related to the migration of the salts borges et al 2008 han et al 2016 3 2 faradaic efficiency the cgb faradaic efficiency was between 64 6 and 79 7 with all ballasts the best performing glycol and sugar ballasts were tetra egde 79 7 and sucrose 77 7 respectively by comparison the faradaic efficiency in the no ballast case was only 47 4 therefore ballast addition increased the faradaic efficiency up to by 68 the cgb round trip efficiency ranged from 32 8 to 39 8 across all ballasts and was 25 5 in the no ballast case therefore ballast addition increased the round trip efficiency by 56 compared with the previous study using 125 ballast loading of tetra eg kingsbury and coronell 2017 the faradaic and round trip efficiency with tetra eg in this study improved 48 and 146 respectively the improvement can be attributed to the use of a more suitable membrane for the cgb i e lower water transport and electrical resistance therefore future research should focus on studying the effect of membrane properties on cgb performance and optimizing the membrane ballast combination in our tests lower net water transport was correlated with higher faradaic efficiency r2 0 4475 p 0 05 as shown in fig 4 a this correlation is much stronger when including the no ballasted control r2 0 8892 p 0 01 fig 4b indicating that faradaic efficiency can be increased substantially by using ballasted solutions the relationship between lower faradaic efficiency and higher net water transport in the absence of a ballast can be partly explained by the fact that osmotic water transport decreases the salinity gradient between concentrated and dilute solutions and consumes the mixing energy i e discharges the battery without generating electricity the correlation between faradaic efficiency and net water transport is also partly explained by the electro osmotic water transport at 100 faradaic efficiency the net electro osmotic water transport after one charge discharge cycle should be zero however self discharge of the battery by e g osmosis or salt diffusion results in less electro osmotic water transport during the discharge step compared with the discharge step causing a greater net water transport a strong correlation r2 0 8585 p 0 01 between ballast transport and faradaic efficiency was also observed fig 4c lower ballast transport generally corresponded to higher faradaic efficiency tetra egde among glycols showed the highest faradaic efficiency 79 7 with the lowest ballast transport 1 58 mmol similarly sucrose among sugars showed the highest faradaic efficiency 77 7 with the lowest ballast transport 0 02 mmol these results indicate that maintaining a stable ballast concentration in the dilute solution has a positive impact on enhancing battery performance 3 3 stack resistance and voltage efficiency our previous study concluded that the presence of ballast has a negative impact on voltage efficiency as the internal resistance is increased kingsbury and coronell 2017 the voltage efficiency η v unitless is defined as the ratio between the average battery voltage during the discharge step and the average battery voltage during the charge step consistent with the observations in our previous study the greatest voltage efficiency observed with a 125 ballast loading was 52 1 for fructose which was slightly lower than the 53 8 observed in the no ballast case in comparison among tested ballasts we did not notice a significant internal resistance and voltage efficiency variation the internal resistance was in the range of 2 67 3 27 ω and voltage efficiency was in the range of 40 50 indicating that a significant fraction of the input energy was being lost to the resistance of the solutions and membranes these losses became the limiting factor upon ballast addition which increased the faradaic efficiency by 70 3 4 effect of ballast properties maintaining a stable ballast concentration in the dilute solution i e eliminating ballast transport is critical for achieving low water transport between the concentrated and dilute compartments and therefore high faradaic efficiency to better understand the effect of molecular properties on ballast and water transport we analyzed the correlation between transport and various ballast properties including molecular weight molar volume balaban j index determined from the distance matrix of the molecule structure cluster count number of atoms in a specific arrangement topological index calculated based on the molecular graph of a chemical compound polar surface area the surface summation of all polar atoms shape attribute wiener index sum of the lengths of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices and the largest dimension the degree of correlation r2 between ballast properties and water transport ballast transport and faradaic round trip efficiency are shown in table a1 3 4 1 ballast size we found that molecular weight had the strongest linear correlation with water transport r2 0 6506 p 0 01 fig 5 a where the larger ballast molecules result in lower water transport from the linear fit fig 5a a molecular weight of approximately 250 g mol corresponds to the ballast size that would result in zero net water transport when used at 125 loading while the correlation between water transport and ballast molecular weight was linear the correlation between ballast transport and molecular weight was exponential r2 0 9341 p 0 01 fig 5b the ballasts with higher molecular weight can be rejected by the membrane more effectively and therefore the larger ballasts result in more stable ballast concentrations and lower water transport the molecular weight cut off of the membrane for osmotic ballasts is approximately 300 g mol fig 5b tetra egde had the closest molecular weight to this cut off value and resulted in the best faradaic efficiency 79 7 among all ballasts fig 4c above this threshold there is no ballast transport sucrose which resulted in a reverse water transport because ballasts were dosed at 125 of the concentration theoretically needed to achieve osmotic balance 3 4 2 ballast molecular structure we compared the cgb performance using linear mannitol and sorbitol and cyclic dextrose and fructose sugar molecules with a similar molecular weight of 180 182 g mol fig 6 the difference in ballast transport between linear and cyclic molecules was only 0 5 mmol on average linear molecules had 14 2 greater ballast transport than cyclic ballasts the greater transport of linear ballasts could be because linear molecules might fit through smaller membrane pores than cyclic molecules the difference in water transport between linear and cyclic ballasts was 50 1 mmol on average the water transport with the cyclic molecules 60 8 mmol was only 55 of that with the linear molecules 111 0 mmol the greater water transport with linear molecules could be attributed to the difference in number and strength of the hydrogen bonds between sugar and water in which linear molecules could have more affinity to water than cyclic molecules and hence drag more water to the concentrated compartment compared with the variation in net water transport across all ballasts standard deviation sd 131 3 mmol the difference between linear and cyclic ballasts sd 29 9 mmol is relatively small therefore this difference in net water transport did not result in appreciable differences in faradaic and round trip efficiency over one battery cycle fig a6a where faradaic efficiency averaged 75 0 9 and round trip efficiency 37 2 2 4 for both types of ballasts mannitol and sorbitol also serve to compare the difference in water and ballast transport between ballasts with nearly identical structures fig 6 mannitol and sorbitol are isomers whose structures are different only with respect to the orientations of the hydroxyl group on the second carbon which leads to a planar conformation for mannitol and non planar for sorbitol despite the lower ballast transport observed for mannitol compared with sorbitol net water transport with mannitol was 36 higher than with sorbitol the greater net water transport observed with mannitol may be partially explained by the demonstrated stronger interaction that water molecules have with mannitol compared with sorbitol jasra and ahluwalia 1982 the planar zigzag conformation of mannitol is more compatible with the tetrahedral structure of water than the sickle bent structure of sorbitol jasra and ahluwalia 1982 dextrose and fructose serve to compare the difference in water and ballast transport between cyclic ballasts with the same molecular weight 180 16 g mol but different structure fig 6 dextrose in an aqueous solution exhibits a six membered pyranose conformation while fructose can form both five membered furanose and six membered pyranose rings in equilibrium 60 pyranose and 40 furanose seuvre and mathlouthi 2010 as a result dextrose has most of its hydroxyl groups in the equatorial position where water molecules can be easily attached rather than the axial position and dextrose has a higher hydration number 3 26 than fructose 2 93 seuvre and mathlouthi 2010 similarly as discussed above for mannitol and sorbitol despite lower ballast transport for dextrose compared with sucrose net water transport with dextrose as a ballast was 70 higher than with fructose therefore the greater net water transport with dextrose may be partially explained by its greater extent of hydration based on the above results for the mannitol sorbitol and dextrose fructose pairs it appears that a stronger interaction between ballast and water enables a higher water transport via ballast hydration shells therefore our results suggest that for future design and synthesis of optimized ballast molecules reducing hydrophilic groups such as oh in cyclic molecules which showed less water and ballast transport than linear molecules may be beneficial 3 4 3 ballast end group chemistry we investigated the effect of glycol end group hydroxyl oh versus methyl ether ome on water and ballast transport fig 7 using monomethyl ether tri egme and dimethyl ether tri egde and tetra egde variations of non methylated ballasts tri eg and tetra eg overall we observed that the presence of methyl ether groups increased water transport water transport increased from 127 4 to 149 7 mmol when using tri egme compared with tri eg and it was further increased to 304 6 mmol with tri egde therefore methylation increased water transport with di methylation resulting in greater water transport than mono methylation this increase in water transport was also observed with tetra eg where the ballast with dimethyl ether end group tetra egde had higher water transport compared with the one without the methyl end group tetra eg the observed higher water transport of methylated ballasts is inconsistent with the results obtained for the mannitol sorbitol and dextrose fructose cases where ballasts with greater hydration numbers resulted in greater water transport the oh end group in glycols can act as hydrogen bond donor and acceptor whereas ome end group in ethers can only function as hydrogen bond acceptor though the ether oxygen pereira et al 2015 the oh group forms hydrogen bonds with an average of 1 3 water molecules and ether oxygen only with 0 5 water molecules at 300 k tamai et al 1996 the observed higher water transport of methylated ballasts is also inconsistent with their observed lower ballast transport fig 7 we speculate that the greater water transport in the methylated ballast cases could be explained in part by increased osmosis greater water activity in the dilute solution could result from the reduced ballast water interaction compared with the oh end group cases it is unclear why for the mannitol sorbitol and dextrose fructose cases increased water transport by hydration dominated over reduced transport due to reduced water activity while in the hydroxyl methyl case the opposite was true the fact that in the mannitol sorbitol and dextrose fructose cases there was no difference in chemical functionalities while in the hydroxyl methyl case the differences were in chemical functionalities may have played a role elucidation of the exact mechanisms driving the differences in behavior between hydroxylated and methylated ballasts is out of the scope of this study 3 4 4 ballast properties and efficiencies properties in terms of molecular weight ballast structure and end group are important determinants of water transport however these differences in the ballast properties did not result in appreciable differences in faradaic and especially round trip efficiency over one battery cycle which can be seen in fig a5 molecular weight and fig a6 cyclic vs linear and end group for a long term operation the water and ballast transport would add up over battery cycles eventually causing operational challenges therefore minimizing the water and ballast transport between the concentrated and dilute salt solution makes a significant contribution to system optimization while water and ballast transport are small over one charge discharge cycle they are finite and therefore their effects on performance will likely be exacerbated over multiple cycles leading to changes in battery performance over time therefore the investigation of multi cycle battery performance with ballast addition is needed in future studies 4 conclusions we investigated the effect of the molecular size structure and end group chemistry of osmotic ballasts on the performance of a concentration gradient battery cgb the following conclusions can be drawn from our study addition of ballast either glycols or sugars to the dilute solution increased faradaic by 68 and round trip by 56 efficiency by reducing water transport comparing across ballasted experiments ballast properties had a substantial impact on water transport ballast transport and faradaic efficiency but only a minor impact on round trip efficiency ballasts with larger molecular weight were more effectively rejected by the membranes and led to lower water transport and better battery performance however the smallest molecule that can still be effectively rejected is preferred due to benefits in cost solubility viscosity conductivity and pumping energy among other factors ballast with a cyclic structure instead of linear non planar structure instead of planar and lower number of methyl end groups led to lower water transport sucrose performed best in terms of reducing the water transport by 109 compared with the no ballast control and enhancing both faradaic efficiency from 47 4 to 77 7 and round trip efficiency from 25 5 to 38 1 our findings suggest that the ballasted cgb can be improved through ballast material selection further improvements could be achieved by optimizing the ballast membrane combination and should be the subject of future studies future studies should also focus on other implications of organic ballast use such as potential occurrence of biofouling and means to mitigate it in addition to crossover to the concentrated solution a potential alternate fate of organic osmotic ballasts is sorption onto the membranes or other surfaces it would be important to investigate such sorption phenomena which also contribute to membrane fouling in future studies when multi cycle experiments are performed the findings from this study could have applications in other closed loop energy processes where water transport through membranes is detrimental for process performance such as acid base

16254,a concentration gradient battery cgb is an energy storage system comprised of a series of concentrated and dilute salt solution compartments separated by ion exchange membranes iems the battery is charged by electrodialysis ed which increases the concentration gradient between these solutions and discharged by reverse electrodialysis red which allows these solutions to mix in both ed and red water moves by osmosis from dilute to concentrated compartments reducing the cgb faradaic and energy efficiency a promising approach to mitigate osmosis is to use an osmotic ballast in the dilute solution to balance the osmotic pressure and reduce faradaic energy losses the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of ballast properties i e size structure end group on the faradaic and round trip efficiency of the cgb to accomplish this objective we tested seven sugar and five glycol compounds as osmotic ballasts in a closed loop cell results show that ballasts with high molecular weight generally resulted in higher faradaic efficiency and lower water transport compared with low molecular weight ballasts data also indicates that ballast with a cyclic structure instead of linear non planar structure instead of planar and lower number of methyl end groups led to lower water transport of all ballasts tested sucrose performed best in terms of reducing non ideal water transport by 109 and enhancing both faradaic and round trip efficiencies from 47 4 to 77 7 and 25 5 to 38 1 respectively compared with the non ballasted cgb our results contribute to fundamental understanding of the impact of solute properties on water and small organic molecule transport in ion exchange membranes and indicate that ballasted cgbs can be further improved through development of optimized ballasts and selection of optimum membrane ballast pairs the improved understanding of ballast impact on cgb performance could be used for evaluation of potential ballast benefits in other membrane based systems that may be impacted by osmosis such as the acid base flow battery waste heat recovery using red ed purification processes osmotically assisted processes and redox flow

improving the efficiency of power generation barnhart et al 2013 carbajales dale et al 2014 dunn et al 2011 it was estimated that by 2030 the global demand for large scale energy storage devices will reach 11 89 15 72 twh irena 2017 the current solution to store a large amount of electric energy is to pump water into an elevated reservoir and utilize hydroelectricity to recover it when needed this pumped hydro energy storage approach accounted for 96 of globally installed energy storage capacity in 2016 gür 2018 however this approach is site constrained where large reservoirs at an appreciable

maintenance and compact size for use in distributed locations they still face challenges on the choice of materials sustainability and safety larcher and tarascon 2014 pellow et al 2015 winter et al 2018 it is therefore essential to explore new electrochemical storage systems that address these challenges a concentration gradient battery cgb was proposed as a promising alternative technology for storing surplus energy in waters of different salinity kingsbury et al 2015 van egmond et al 2016 this energy can later be recovered by mixing the solutions the cgb is a membrane based system that operates through a combination of an electrodialysis ed stage where energy generated from renewable resources is used to produce both a highly concentrated brine and a dilute solution and a reverse electrodialysis red stage where the brine and dilute solutions are mixed to generate power the advantage of this device is that the electrolyte is a non hazardous environmentally friendly and abundantly available aqueous salt solution e g sodium chloride it is also scalable and safe to operate non flammable and non explosive no precious or toxic materials are required theoretically the energy extracted from mixing river water and seawater is equivalent to a hydro power plant with a height of at least 200 m and mixing freshwater with high concentration industrial brines can deliver several times more energy yip et al 2016 hence the cgb holds great potential to contribute to addressing global energy storage needs there have been several studies on system optimization and efficiency enhancement of cgbs porada et al 2018 van egmond et al 2016 van egmond et al 2017 stougie et al 2019 analyzed several decentralized energy storage systems using life cycle assessment and pointed out that the cgb is the most preferable system from an economic standpoint however the energy efficiency of cgb is still much lower than other energy storage systems specifically the non ideal transport of water through the membranes by osmosis has a substantial negative impact on the power density and faradaic efficiency of the battery kingsbury and coronell 2017 these detrimental effects of osmosis increase dramatically if higher concentration gradients are used thereby preventing the battery from harnessing the higher energy content of e g brines in a previous study kingsbury and coronell 2017 we reported a novel approach to mitigate osmosis where uncharged osmotic ballasts i e ethylene glycol were added in the dilute solution to balance the osmotic pressure significantly reducing faradaic energy losses and enhancing the faradaic efficiency from 18 to 50 these ballasts can not only improve the performance of salinity ph gradient batteries but also benefit other closed loop aqueous membrane processes such as acid base flow batteries culcasi et al 2020 van egmond et al 2018 muñoz cruzado alba et al 2021 pärnamäe et al 2020 sáez et al 2016 xia et al 2020 waste heat recovery using red kwon et al 2015 luo et al 2012 ed purification process zhang et al 2011 osmotically assisted process bartholomew et al 2017 and redox flow batteries zhang et al 2018 the previous ballast study only tested two glycol ballasts same chemistry type but different sizes and resulted in different efficiencies and water transport for a potential implementation of ballasts in full scale systems there is a need to understand the relationship between basic ballast properties chemistry shape and size and battery performance and identify corresponding inexpensive ballasts therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of ballast size i e molecular weight structure i e linear vs cyclic and functional end groups i e methyl ether on water transport faradaic efficiency and round trip efficiency of a gcb we show that the properties of osmotic ballasts had a significant correlation with gcb performance and provide a guideline for the future development of osmotic ballast toward mitigating osmotic water transport in closed loop membrane processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the cgb consisted of a pccell electrodialysis stack with 10 membrane pairs separated by a mesh spacer with a thickness of 450 µm pccell gmbh germany fig 1 selemion asa anion exchange membranes agc engineering japan and fke 30 cation exchange membranes fumatech germany were used due to their relatively low water permeability kingsbury et al 2018 the active area of membranes and electrodes i e cathode and anode was 64 cm2 the electrodes consisted of a titanium mesh coated with mixed metal oxide electrode rinse solutions of 0 5 m nacl were recirculated through the electrode compartments the o2 h2 and possibly cl2 gases produced were removed by the ventilation system which included exhaust snorkels for operation of a similar battery at larger scale the production of gases can be avoided by using a different redox couple as electrode rinse solution reference electrodes of ag agcl re 5b basi usa were used to measure the electrical potential over the membrane stack the reference electrodes were positioned on each side of the membrane stack via a customized frame the total volume of each electrode chamber was 97 ml concentrated and dilute nacl solutions 250 ml each were recirculated through the stack in a closed loop from two volumetric cylinders each of which was placed on an electronic balance adventurer ax422 ohaus usa 2 2 operation conditions we followed the operational procedure described in detail in our previous study with some modifications kingsbury and coronell 2017 the starting concentrations for all tests were 0 5 and 0 25 m nacl for concentrated and dilute solution respectively a control experiment without ballasts using the same initial concentrated and dilute solution concentrations was performed to determine the baseline performance the osmotic ballasts were added to the dilute solution the flow rates of the concentrated dilute solutions and the electrode rinse solution were 80 ml min and 160 ml min respectively the higher flow rate of the electrode rinse solution prevented the end membrane to bulge into the reference electrode compartment and break the reference electrode the cgb was operated in a single galvanostatic charge discharge cycle at a constant charge current of 45 ma 7 a m2 normalized to the cell cross sectional area using a potentiostat vmp 3 bio logic france the applied current density of 7 a m2 corresponded to the current density at which the highest round trip efficiency was obtained without ballasts fig a1 this current density is similar to those used in other studies on the concentration gradient battery fu et al 2019 kingsbury and coronell 2017 porada et al 2018 adding ballast to the dilute solution reduces the initial open circuit voltage ocv of the cgb compared to the case without ballast as previously explained kingsbury and coronell 2017 given that different ballast concentrations in the dilute solution resulted in different levels of ocv reduction we used a pre charge step to increase the initial ocv in all tests to 302 mv e g 16 min for sucrose and 43 min for tetra egde depending on the initial ocv which is the same starting ocv as in the control experiment without ballast addition after pre charging the battery cycle started with an ed charge step for 1 5 h followed by a red discharge step that continued until the ocv decreased to its initial value of 302 mv the current and cell voltage were recorded every second the voltage profile demonstrating the charge discharge cycle can be seen in fig a2 we used a fixed charge time to have the same charge input for all ballast tests the battery was disassembled and cleaned before every test after the cell was dis assembled the spacers were cleaned by brushing with soapy water the membranes were flushed with deionized water and soaked in 3 m nacl for 2 h and then soaked in 0 5 m nacl overnight when the cell was re assembled we applied a series of electric current conditions 50 ma 50 ma and 50 ma for 5 min each with the entire stack filled with 0 5 m nacl solution to remove any remaining ions molecules in the membrane this periodical change of current direction has been used in ed to reduce organic fouling vermaas et al 2013 finally we verified that the cell resistance was close to our benchmark resistance 2 2 ω in addition we performed a hydraulic test before the charge discharge test in order to evaluate water transport through membranes due to differences in hydraulic pressure between the concentrated and dilute compartments in this test 0 5 m nacl solution was recirculated through all spacer channels at 80 ml min water transport due to hydraulic pressure differences was measured for the same time duration as the charge discharge cycle and was later subtracted from the total observed water transport during the charge discharge cycle the membrane stack resistance was determined by linear sweep voltammetry 2 3 preparation of ballasted dilute solution the dilute solution was prepared by adding osmotic ballast to 0 25 m nacl solutions because multiple factors affect water transport including ballast addition ballast transport salt transport salinity gradient and discharge duration water transport cannot be prevented during the entire charge discharge cycle instead we targeted achieving zero net water transport over one charge discharge cycle toward achieving a sustainable operation of the battery over multiple cycles accordingly we prepared the dilute solution with a ballast concentration 25 greater than that theoretically needed to achieve the same water mole fraction as in the 0 5 m nacl solution concentrated salt solution we chose 125 of the concentration theoretically needed to achieve osmotic balance for the initial dilute and concentrated solutions because this was the concentration that achieved zero net water transport using tetra ethylene glycol as the ballast in our previous study kingsbury and coronell 2017 the calculations for determining the dilute solution composition are provided in the supplementary materials 2 4 selection of ballasts the osmotic ballasts used in this study were inexpensive non hazardous highly soluble and non dissociable uncharged organic compounds additional ballast properties taken into account for ballast selection were i chemistry to include at least two chemically distinct groups of ballasts i e sugars and glycols satisfying the characteristics above ii size to include ballasts in the molecular weight range of 100 400 da selected based on the initial results in our previous study kingsbury and coronell 2017 and iii molecular orientation to include linear and cyclic molecules the selected ballasts and their properties are summarized in table 1 and include sugars and glycols sugar ballasts included monosaccharides glycerol xylose dextrose and fructose disaccharides sucrose and polyols mannitol and sorbitol glycol ballasts included triethylene glycol and tetraethylene glycol and their monomethyl ether and dimethyl ether analogs 2 5 metrics of interest for each experiment we evaluated the transport of water ballast and salt between dilute and concentrated solutions during one charge discharge cycle the total water ballast and salt transported was measured as the mass change of the concentrated and dilute solutions in their reservoirs the mass of ballast transported from the dilute solution to the concentrated solution was calculated as the product of the volume of the concentrated solution and the change in its total organic carbon toc content measured using a toc analyzer shimadzu japan the moles of salt transport j s a l t mol was calculated from the charge balance as 1 j s a l t i c t c i d t d f where i c a and i d a are the current during charge and discharge steps respectively which were identical by design t c s and t d s are the charge and discharge times and f 96 485 c mol is the faraday constant the mass of water transport was calculated by subtracting the ballast and salt transport from the total mass transport ballast salt nacl and water transport were converted from mass to mole units using corresponding molecular weights see table 1 we evaluated the battery performance in terms of faradaic and round trip efficiency the faradaic or current efficiency η i unitless was calculated as the ratio of the total charge extracted from the cgb during discharge and the total charge used to charge the battery as kingsbury et al 2015 2 η i 0 t d i d dt 0 t c i c dt round trip or energy efficiency η unitless was calculated as the ratio between the energy recovered from the battery during discharge and the energy spent to charge it as kingsbury et al 2015 3 η 0 t d i d e d dt 0 t c i c e c dt where e c v and e d v are the cell voltage measured during charge and discharge respectively 2 6 osmotic and electro osmotic water transport osmotic water transport j o s g is the water transport driven by the osmotic pressure where water generally moves from the dilute to the concentrated compartment electro osmotic water transport j e o g is the water transported along with the salt ions e g in their hydration shells which moves to the concentrated compartment during the charge step and to the dilute compartment during the discharge step water transport was expressed as 4 j j t where j is water flux g s and t is operation time s the amount moles of water transported from the dilute into the concentrated solution during the charge step is the sum of the osmotic and electro osmotic processes and was calculated as 5 j c j os c j eo c j os c j eo c t c where subscript c represents the charge step and subscripts os and eo indicate osmosis and electro osmosis respectively similarly the amount of water transported from the dilute into the concentrated solution during the discharge step was calculated as 6 j d j os d j eo d j os d j eo d t d where subscript d represents the discharge step as evidenced by the approximately linear voltage profiles during the charge and discharge steps fig a2 the concentration gradient and osmotic pressure profiles were also approximately linear which enables the use of average osmotic fluxes in eqs 5 6 instead of integrals we assumed that the electro osmotic water flux remained constant since the same current density was applied during the charge and discharge steps this assumption is only valid if the presence of ballast did not impact the hydration number of nacl a previous study showed that the hydration of salt ions migrating through membranes was not affected by several organic solutes including acetic acid phenol and glucose at 0 1 mol l han et al 2016 hence 7 j eo c j eo d j eo by design the increase in stack potential during the charge step of a given experiment e g from initial of 302 mv to final of 685 mv in the case of sucrose was the same as the stack potential decrease in the discharge step from 685 to 302 mv therefore consistent with the nernst and van t hoff equations atkins and paula 2006 the average concentration gradient and osmotic pressure over the course of the experiment were also the same leading to 8 j o s c j o s d j o s by combining eqs 4 8 we obtained the following equations for calculating electro osmotic water flux and average osmotic water flux 9 j o s j c t c j d t d 1 2 10 j e o j c t c j d t d 1 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 water and ballast transport the net water and ballast transport after one charge discharge cycle were investigated across all 13 ballasts and the results are summarized in fig 2 water transported from the dilute solution to the concentrated solution is shown in positive numbers and the reverse water transport i e from the concentrated to dilute solution due to reverse osmotic pressure is shown in negative numbers fig 2a adding sugar or glycol ballasts to the dilute solution reduced the net water transport by at least 80 compared to the no ballast control 1609 4 90 4 mmol different osmotic ballast molecules behaved differently in controlling the net water transport at the same ballast loading i e 125 of the concentration needed to achieve osmotic balance likely due to different ballast structural properties the highest net water transport of 306 6 11 5 mmol was observed using glycerol and the lowest of 157 4 31 0 mmol using sucrose notably while 125 tetra eg loading resulted in zero net water transport in our previous study kingsbury and coronell 2017 this was not the case in this study we attribute this difference to the use of different membranes in the two studies altogether sugar ballasts achieved a similar net water transport range as glycol ballasts as sugars are cheaper and more environmentally friendly than glycols sugars are more attractive materials to be used as ballasts achieving zero net water transport and keeping a balanced water volume between the concentrated and dilute compartments is essential for the long term stability of the battery performance at 125 ballast loading most ballast tests still showed a positive net water transport the extra ballast dosage in these tests did not reverse or balance the net osmotic transport between compartments this was likely because these ballasts diffused across the membranes and transported into the concentrated compartment resulting in an unbalanced osmotic pressure in favor of water transport from the dilute to the concentrated compartment total reverse water transport negative occurred only with sucrose and tetra eg as the ballast indicating the extra ballast loading reversed the net osmotic transport although this reverse water transport can increase the faradaic efficiency as the salinity gradient is enhanced the unbalanced water volume between the concentrated and dilute compartments hinders the long term battery operation by adjusting the ballast loading percentage zero net water transport can be achieved fig 3 water transport decreased from 352 8 9 0 mmol at 100 sucrose loading to 92 57 5 9 mmol at 118 3 0 69 7 mmol at 121 and 156 1 32 0 mmol at 125 loading net water transport can be broken down into transport during the charge and discharge steps fig 2a water transport during the charge step occurred in all cases from the dilute to the concentrated compartment as the result of additive osmosis and electro osmosis during the discharge step although osmotic water transport remained in the same direction electro osmosis changed direction as the current was reversed therefore to reach zero net water transport a balance between water transport during the charge and discharge steps is critical some ballasts like glycerol and xylitol had a large amount of water transport during charge and minimal transport during discharge resulting in a large amount of net water transport in contrast tetra eg showed a relatively balanced behavior in water transport as the water transport during the charge and discharge steps is closely related to osmosis and electro osmosis we further investigated the effect of these two driving forces fig 2b ballasts exhibited a large difference in osmotic water transport where glycerol and tri egde showed the greatest osmotic transport 260 mmol and fructose and tetra egde had the lowest transport 3 5 4 5 mmol sucrose and tetra eg exhibited reverse osmotic water transport due to an over ballasted dilute solution compared to the osmotic water transport the electro osmotic water transport was limited to a relatively small range 28 48 mmol across all ballasts the overall electro osmotic water transport after one charge discharge cycle was positive across all ballasts because the charge time was always longer than the discharge time leading to a smaller amount of water transferring back to the dilute solution during discharge the average electro osmotic water flux in ballasted tests was 1 96 0 22 mmol min a value similar to that for the control experiment 1 81 0 09 mmol min indicating that the electro osmotic water transport mainly depended on the current density and was not affected by the ballast loading or its effect on the osmotic pressure the nacl hydration number calculated from the ratio between net electro osmotic water transport fig 2b and net salt transport eq 1 was 7 which was within the range of reported hydration numbers for nacl in bulk solution lu et al 2011 marcus 1991 ohtaki and radnai 1993 ballast transport from the dilute solution to the concentrated solution through ion exchange membranes was identified to be one of the most significant obstacles to the stable operation of the cgb over many cycles in the previous study kingsbury and coronell 2017 a stable ballast concentration in the dilute solution is essential to balancing the osmotic pressure during long term operation and hence minimal transport through the membranes is an important criterion for an optimized ballast compound in our study osmotic ballast transport from the dilute to the concentrated salt solution was observed for all the ballasts fig 2c the amount of ballast transport ranged from 0 02 0 05 mmol to 20 7 1 2 mmol for most ballasts 0 5 1 5 of the total ballast was transported to the concentrated compartment after one charge discharge cycle the ballast with the lowest transport 0 01 was sucrose and the ballast with the most transport 3 7 was glycerol ballast transport across the membrane can be attributed to both diffusion transport related to the ballast concentration gradient across the membrane and electro osmotic water drag water flux related to the migration of the salts borges et al 2008 han et al 2016 3 2 faradaic efficiency the cgb faradaic efficiency was between 64 6 and 79 7 with all ballasts the best performing glycol and sugar ballasts were tetra egde 79 7 and sucrose 77 7 respectively by comparison the faradaic efficiency in the no ballast case was only 47 4 therefore ballast addition increased the faradaic efficiency up to by 68 the cgb round trip efficiency ranged from 32 8 to 39 8 across all ballasts and was 25 5 in the no ballast case therefore ballast addition increased the round trip efficiency by 56 compared with the previous study using 125 ballast loading of tetra eg kingsbury and coronell 2017 the faradaic and round trip efficiency with tetra eg in this study improved 48 and 146 respectively the improvement can be attributed to the use of a more suitable membrane for the cgb i e lower water transport and electrical resistance therefore future research should focus on studying the effect of membrane properties on cgb performance and optimizing the membrane ballast combination in our tests lower net water transport was correlated with higher faradaic efficiency r2 0 4475 p 0 05 as shown in fig 4 a this correlation is much stronger when including the no ballasted control r2 0 8892 p 0 01 fig 4b indicating that faradaic efficiency can be increased substantially by using ballasted solutions the relationship between lower faradaic efficiency and higher net water transport in the absence of a ballast can be partly explained by the fact that osmotic water transport decreases the salinity gradient between concentrated and dilute solutions and consumes the mixing energy i e discharges the battery without generating electricity the correlation between faradaic efficiency and net water transport is also partly explained by the electro osmotic water transport at 100 faradaic efficiency the net electro osmotic water transport after one charge discharge cycle should be zero however self discharge of the battery by e g osmosis or salt diffusion results in less electro osmotic water transport during the discharge step compared with the discharge step causing a greater net water transport a strong correlation r2 0 8585 p 0 01 between ballast transport and faradaic efficiency was also observed fig 4c lower ballast transport generally corresponded to higher faradaic efficiency tetra egde among glycols showed the highest faradaic efficiency 79 7 with the lowest ballast transport 1 58 mmol similarly sucrose among sugars showed the highest faradaic efficiency 77 7 with the lowest ballast transport 0 02 mmol these results indicate that maintaining a stable ballast concentration in the dilute solution has a positive impact on enhancing battery performance 3 3 stack resistance and voltage efficiency our previous study concluded that the presence of ballast has a negative impact on voltage efficiency as the internal resistance is increased kingsbury and coronell 2017 the voltage efficiency η v unitless is defined as the ratio between the average battery voltage during the discharge step and the average battery voltage during the charge step consistent with the observations in our previous study the greatest voltage efficiency observed with a 125 ballast loading was 52 1 for fructose which was slightly lower than the 53 8 observed in the no ballast case in comparison among tested ballasts we did not notice a significant internal resistance and voltage efficiency variation the internal resistance was in the range of 2 67 3 27 ω and voltage efficiency was in the range of 40 50 indicating that a significant fraction of the input energy was being lost to the resistance of the solutions and membranes these losses became the limiting factor upon ballast addition which increased the faradaic efficiency by 70 3 4 effect of ballast properties maintaining a stable ballast concentration in the dilute solution i e eliminating ballast transport is critical for achieving low water transport between the concentrated and dilute compartments and therefore high faradaic efficiency to better understand the effect of molecular properties on ballast and water transport we analyzed the correlation between transport and various ballast properties including molecular weight molar volume balaban j index determined from the distance matrix of the molecule structure cluster count number of atoms in a specific arrangement topological index calculated based on the molecular graph of a chemical compound polar surface area the surface summation of all polar atoms shape attribute wiener index sum of the lengths of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices and the largest dimension the degree of correlation r2 between ballast properties and water transport ballast transport and faradaic round trip efficiency are shown in table a1 3 4 1 ballast size we found that molecular weight had the strongest linear correlation with water transport r2 0 6506 p 0 01 fig 5 a where the larger ballast molecules result in lower water transport from the linear fit fig 5a a molecular weight of approximately 250 g mol corresponds to the ballast size that would result in zero net water transport when used at 125 loading while the correlation between water transport and ballast molecular weight was linear the correlation between ballast transport and molecular weight was exponential r2 0 9341 p 0 01 fig 5b the ballasts with higher molecular weight can be rejected by the membrane more effectively and therefore the larger ballasts result in more stable ballast concentrations and lower water transport the molecular weight cut off of the membrane for osmotic ballasts is approximately 300 g mol fig 5b tetra egde had the closest molecular weight to this cut off value and resulted in the best faradaic efficiency 79 7 among all ballasts fig 4c above this threshold there is no ballast transport sucrose which resulted in a reverse water transport because ballasts were dosed at 125 of the concentration theoretically needed to achieve osmotic balance 3 4 2 ballast molecular structure we compared the cgb performance using linear mannitol and sorbitol and cyclic dextrose and fructose sugar molecules with a similar molecular weight of 180 182 g mol fig 6 the difference in ballast transport between linear and cyclic molecules was only 0 5 mmol on average linear molecules had 14 2 greater ballast transport than cyclic ballasts the greater transport of linear ballasts could be because linear molecules might fit through smaller membrane pores than cyclic molecules the difference in water transport between linear and cyclic ballasts was 50 1 mmol on average the water transport with the cyclic molecules 60 8 mmol was only 55 of that with the linear molecules 111 0 mmol the greater water transport with linear molecules could be attributed to the difference in number and strength of the hydrogen bonds between sugar and water in which linear molecules could have more affinity to water than cyclic molecules and hence drag more water to the concentrated compartment compared with the variation in net water transport across all ballasts standard deviation sd 131 3 mmol the difference between linear and cyclic ballasts sd 29 9 mmol is relatively small therefore this difference in net water transport did not result in appreciable differences in faradaic and round trip efficiency over one battery cycle fig a6a where faradaic efficiency averaged 75 0 9 and round trip efficiency 37 2 2 4 for both types of ballasts mannitol and sorbitol also serve to compare the difference in water and ballast transport between ballasts with nearly identical structures fig 6 mannitol and sorbitol are isomers whose structures are different only with respect to the orientations of the hydroxyl group on the second carbon which leads to a planar conformation for mannitol and non planar for sorbitol despite the lower ballast transport observed for mannitol compared with sorbitol net water transport with mannitol was 36 higher than with sorbitol the greater net water transport observed with mannitol may be partially explained by the demonstrated stronger interaction that water molecules have with mannitol compared with sorbitol jasra and ahluwalia 1982 the planar zigzag conformation of mannitol is more compatible with the tetrahedral structure of water than the sickle bent structure of sorbitol jasra and ahluwalia 1982 dextrose and fructose serve to compare the difference in water and ballast transport between cyclic ballasts with the same molecular weight 180 16 g mol but different structure fig 6 dextrose in an aqueous solution exhibits a six membered pyranose conformation while fructose can form both five membered furanose and six membered pyranose rings in equilibrium 60 pyranose and 40 furanose seuvre and mathlouthi 2010 as a result dextrose has most of its hydroxyl groups in the equatorial position where water molecules can be easily attached rather than the axial position and dextrose has a higher hydration number 3 26 than fructose 2 93 seuvre and mathlouthi 2010 similarly as discussed above for mannitol and sorbitol despite lower ballast transport for dextrose compared with sucrose net water transport with dextrose as a ballast was 70 higher than with fructose therefore the greater net water transport with dextrose may be partially explained by its greater extent of hydration based on the above results for the mannitol sorbitol and dextrose fructose pairs it appears that a stronger interaction between ballast and water enables a higher water transport via ballast hydration shells therefore our results suggest that for future design and synthesis of optimized ballast molecules reducing hydrophilic groups such as oh in cyclic molecules which showed less water and ballast transport than linear molecules may be beneficial 3 4 3 ballast end group chemistry we investigated the effect of glycol end group hydroxyl oh versus methyl ether ome on water and ballast transport fig 7 using monomethyl ether tri egme and dimethyl ether tri egde and tetra egde variations of non methylated ballasts tri eg and tetra eg overall we observed that the presence of methyl ether groups increased water transport water transport increased from 127 4 to 149 7 mmol when using tri egme compared with tri eg and it was further increased to 304 6 mmol with tri egde therefore methylation increased water transport with di methylation resulting in greater water transport than mono methylation this increase in water transport was also observed with tetra eg where the ballast with dimethyl ether end group tetra egde had higher water transport compared with the one without the methyl end group tetra eg the observed higher water transport of methylated ballasts is inconsistent with the results obtained for the mannitol sorbitol and dextrose fructose cases where ballasts with greater hydration numbers resulted in greater water transport the oh end group in glycols can act as hydrogen bond donor and acceptor whereas ome end group in ethers can only function as hydrogen bond acceptor though the ether oxygen pereira et al 2015 the oh group forms hydrogen bonds with an average of 1 3 water molecules and ether oxygen only with 0 5 water molecules at 300 k tamai et al 1996 the observed higher water transport of methylated ballasts is also inconsistent with their observed lower ballast transport fig 7 we speculate that the greater water transport in the methylated ballast cases could be explained in part by increased osmosis greater water activity in the dilute solution could result from the reduced ballast water interaction compared with the oh end group cases it is unclear why for the mannitol sorbitol and dextrose fructose cases increased water transport by hydration dominated over reduced transport due to reduced water activity while in the hydroxyl methyl case the opposite was true the fact that in the mannitol sorbitol and dextrose fructose cases there was no difference in chemical functionalities while in the hydroxyl methyl case the differences were in chemical functionalities may have played a role elucidation of the exact mechanisms driving the differences in behavior between hydroxylated and methylated ballasts is out of the scope of this study 3 4 4 ballast properties and efficiencies properties in terms of molecular weight ballast structure and end group are important determinants of water transport however these differences in the ballast properties did not result in appreciable differences in faradaic and especially round trip efficiency over one battery cycle which can be seen in fig a5 molecular weight and fig a6 cyclic vs linear and end group for a long term operation the water and ballast transport would add up over battery cycles eventually causing operational challenges therefore minimizing the water and ballast transport between the concentrated and dilute salt solution makes a significant contribution to system optimization while water and ballast transport are small over one charge discharge cycle they are finite and therefore their effects on performance will likely be exacerbated over multiple cycles leading to changes in battery performance over time therefore the investigation of multi cycle battery performance with ballast addition is needed in future studies 4 conclusions we investigated the effect of the molecular size structure and end group chemistry of osmotic ballasts on the performance of a concentration gradient battery cgb the following conclusions can be drawn from our study addition of ballast either glycols or sugars to the dilute solution increased faradaic by 68 and round trip by 56 efficiency by reducing water transport comparing across ballasted experiments ballast properties had a substantial impact on water transport ballast transport and faradaic efficiency but only a minor impact on round trip efficiency ballasts with larger molecular weight were more effectively rejected by the membranes and led to lower water transport and better battery performance however the smallest molecule that can still be effectively rejected is preferred due to benefits in cost solubility viscosity conductivity and pumping energy among other factors ballast with a cyclic structure instead of linear non planar structure instead of planar and lower number of methyl end groups led to lower water transport sucrose performed best in terms of reducing the water transport by 109 compared with the no ballast control and enhancing both faradaic efficiency from 47 4 to 77 7 and round trip efficiency from 25 5 to 38 1 our findings suggest that the ballasted cgb can be improved through ballast material selection further improvements could be achieved by optimizing the ballast membrane combination and should be the subject of future studies future studies should also focus on other implications of organic ballast use such as potential occurrence of biofouling and means to mitigate it in addition to crossover to the concentrated solution a potential alternate fate of organic osmotic ballasts is sorption onto the membranes or other surfaces it would be important to investigate such sorption phenomena which also contribute to membrane fouling in future studies when multi cycle experiments are performed the findings from this study could have applications in other closed loop energy processes where water transport through membranes is detrimental for process performance such as acid base
